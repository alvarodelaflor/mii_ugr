# CoronaAlert UGR

## [Introduccion](#introduccion)

CoronaAlert UGR is an application that monitors tracking in the different classrooms of the [ETSIIT](https://etsiit.ugr.es/) of the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es/).

The problem to be solved by this application is to detect cases of contact with positive cases of the [Coronavirus](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1) from the subject's schedule and the classrooms he has visited. The application will notify the students who have had contact with such a positive case.

### **Comparison with current applications**

At present, an application called [RadarCovid](https://github.com/RadarCOVID) has been developed, but there are many criticisms of it.

Some of the main features to be improved are:

```
Quick alert to possible contacts
```
```
Isolate contact location
```
```
Monitoring of positive cases
```

## [Initial functionality](#initial-functionality)

The key objective of this application is a quick alert between possible contacts with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 and could have infected someone.

To this end, in the event that this positive is detected, the system will track all the classrooms it has been in, alerting the people who have had contact with this positive case by means of a notification.
