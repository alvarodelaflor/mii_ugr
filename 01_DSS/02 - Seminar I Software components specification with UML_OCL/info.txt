Programmers using technologies such as Enterprise Java Beans need to be able to unambiguously describe the specifications of their software components. This specification can be realized, without problem, using UML whether the components you want to develop are finally implemented using object technology or not. In addition, it is necessary to have a simple design process that allows to ensure that the specifications correspond correctly with the implementations of the mentioned components.
