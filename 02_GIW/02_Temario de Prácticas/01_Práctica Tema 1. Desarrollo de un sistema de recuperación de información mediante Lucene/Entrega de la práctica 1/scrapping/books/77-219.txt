The flood had made, the wind was nearly\r\ncalm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come\r\nto and wait for the turn of the tide.\r\n\r\nThe sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of\r\nan interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded\r\ntogether without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of\r\nthe barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red\r\nclusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A\r\nhaze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing\r\nflatness. The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still\r\nseemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the\r\nbiggest, and the greatest, town on earth.\r\n\r\nThe Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four\r\naffectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to\r\nseaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so\r\nnautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness\r\npersonified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in\r\nthe luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.\r\n\r\nBetween us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the\r\nsea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of\r\nseparation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyarns\xe2\x80\x94and even convictions. The Lawyer\xe2\x80\x94the best of old fellows\xe2\x80\x94had,\r\nbecause of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck,\r\nand was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a\r\nbox of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow\r\nsat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had\r\nsunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect,\r\nand, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an\r\nidol. The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way\r\naft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily.\r\nAfterwards there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or\r\nother we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and\r\nfit for nothing but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of\r\nstill and exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky,\r\nwithout a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very\r\nmist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from\r\nthe wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous\r\nfolds. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches,\r\nbecame more sombre every minute, as if angered by the approach of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nAnd at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low,\r\nand from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without\r\nheat, as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of\r\nthat gloom brooding over a crowd of men.\r\n\r\nForthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less\r\nbrilliant but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested\r\nunruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the\r\nrace that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a\r\nwaterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the\r\nvenerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and\r\ndeparts for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories. And\r\nindeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfollowed the sea\xe2\x80\x9d with reverence and affection, than to evoke the\r\ngreat spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The\r\ntidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with\r\nmemories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the\r\nbattles of the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the\r\nnation is proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights\r\nall, titled and untitled\xe2\x80\x94the great knights-errant of the sea. It had\r\nborne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night\r\nof time, from the _Golden Hind_ returning with her rotund flanks full\r\nof treasure, to be visited by the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Highness and thus pass out of\r\nthe gigantic tale, to the _Erebus_ and _Terror_, bound on other\r\nconquests\xe2\x80\x94and that never returned. It had known the ships and the men.\r\nThey had sailed from Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nadventurers and the settlers; kings\xe2\x80\x99 ships and the ships of men on\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Change; captains, admirals, the dark \xe2\x80\x9cinterlopers\xe2\x80\x9d of the Eastern\r\ntrade, and the commissioned \xe2\x80\x9cgenerals\xe2\x80\x9d of East India fleets. Hunters\r\nfor gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone out on that stream,\r\nbearing the sword, and often the torch, messengers of the might within\r\nthe land, bearers of a spark from the sacred fire. What greatness had\r\nnot floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown\r\nearth!... The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of\r\nempires.\r\n\r\nThe sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear\r\nalong the shore. The Chapman light-house, a three-legged thing erect on\r\na mud-flat, shone strongly. Lights of ships moved in the fairway\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngreat stir of lights going up and going down. And farther west on the\r\nupper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked\r\nominously on the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under\r\nthe stars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marlow suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9chas been one of the dark places\r\nof the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was the only man of us who still \xe2\x80\x9cfollowed the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d The worst that\r\ncould be said of him was that he did not represent his class. He was a\r\nseaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may\r\nso express it, a sedentary life. Their minds are of the stay-at-home\r\norder, and their home is always with them\xe2\x80\x94the ship; and so is their\r\ncountry\xe2\x80\x94the sea. One ship is very much like another, and the sea is\r\nalways the same. In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign\r\nshores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past,\r\nveiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful\r\nignorance; for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the\r\nsea itself, which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable\r\nas Destiny. For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a\r\ncasual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole\r\ncontinent, and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing. The\r\nyarns of seamen have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which\r\nlies within the shell of a cracked nut. But Marlow was not typical (if\r\nhis propensity to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an\r\nepisode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale\r\nwhich brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness\r\nof one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the\r\nspectral illumination of moonshine.\r\n\r\nHis remark did not seem at all surprising. It was just like Marlow. It\r\nwas accepted in silence. No one took the trouble to grunt even; and\r\npresently he said, very slow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of very old times, when\r\nthe Romans first came here, nineteen hundred years ago\xe2\x80\x94the other day\r\n.... Light came out of this river since\xe2\x80\x94you say Knights? Yes; but it is\r\nlike a running blaze on a plain, like a flash of lightning in the\r\nclouds. We live in the flicker\xe2\x80\x94may it last as long as the old earth\r\nkeeps rolling! But darkness was here yesterday. Imagine the feelings of\r\na commander of a fine\xe2\x80\x94what d\xe2\x80\x99ye call \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x94trireme in the Mediterranean,\r\nordered suddenly to the north; run overland across the Gauls in a\r\nhurry; put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries\xe2\x80\x94a wonderful\r\nlot of handy men they must have been, too\xe2\x80\x94used to build, apparently by\r\nthe hundred, in a month or two, if we may believe what we read. Imagine\r\nhim here\xe2\x80\x94the very end of the world, a sea the colour of lead, a sky the\r\ncolour of smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina\xe2\x80\x94and\r\ngoing up this river with stores, or orders, or what you like.\r\nSand-banks, marshes, forests, savages,\xe2\x80\x94precious little to eat fit for a\r\ncivilized man, nothing but Thames water to drink. No Falernian wine\r\nhere, no going ashore. Here and there a military camp lost in a\r\nwilderness, like a needle in a bundle of hay\xe2\x80\x94cold, fog, tempests,\r\ndisease, exile, and death\xe2\x80\x94death skulking in the air, in the water, in\r\nthe bush. They must have been dying like flies here. Oh, yes\xe2\x80\x94he did it.\r\nDid it very well, too, no doubt, and without thinking much about it\r\neither, except afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his\r\ntime, perhaps. They were men enough to face the darkness. And perhaps\r\nhe was cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet\r\nat Ravenna by and by, if he had good friends in Rome and survived the\r\nawful climate. Or think of a decent young citizen in a toga\xe2\x80\x94perhaps too\r\nmuch dice, you know\xe2\x80\x94coming out here in the train of some prefect, or\r\ntax-gatherer, or trader even, to mend his fortunes. Land in a swamp,\r\nmarch through the woods, and in some inland post feel the savagery, the\r\nutter savagery, had closed round him\xe2\x80\x94all that mysterious life of the\r\nwilderness that stirs in the forest, in the jungles, in the hearts of\r\nwild men. There\xe2\x80\x99s no initiation either into such mysteries. He has to\r\nlive in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable.\r\nAnd it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him. The\r\nfascination of the abomination\xe2\x80\x94you know, imagine the growing regrets,\r\nthe longing to escape, the powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind,\xe2\x80\x9d he began again, lifting one arm from the elbow, the palm of the\r\nhand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the\r\npose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a\r\nlotus-flower\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMind, none of us would feel exactly like this. What saves\r\nus is efficiency\xe2\x80\x94the devotion to efficiency. But these chaps were not\r\nmuch account, really. They were no colonists; their administration was\r\nmerely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect. They were conquerors,\r\nand for that you want only brute force\xe2\x80\x94nothing to boast of, when you\r\nhave it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the\r\nweakness of others. They grabbed what they could get for the sake of\r\nwhat was to be got. It was just robbery with violence, aggravated\r\nmurder on a great scale, and men going at it blind\xe2\x80\x94as is very proper\r\nfor those who tackle a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which\r\nmostly means the taking it away from those who have a different\r\ncomplexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty\r\nthing when you look into it too much. What redeems it is the idea only.\r\nAn idea at the back of it; not a sentimental pretence but an idea; and\r\nan unselfish belief in the idea\xe2\x80\x94something you can set up, and bow down\r\nbefore, and offer a sacrifice to....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke off. Flames glided in the river, small green flames, red\r\nflames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking, joining, crossing each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94then separating slowly or hastily. The traffic of the great city\r\nwent on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river. We looked on,\r\nwaiting patiently\xe2\x80\x94there was nothing else to do till the end of the\r\nflood; but it was only after a long silence, when he said, in a\r\nhesitating voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you fellows remember I did once turn\r\nfresh-water sailor for a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d that we knew we were fated, before the\r\nebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlow\xe2\x80\x99s inconclusive\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to bother you much with what happened to me personally,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe began, showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales\r\nwho seem so often unaware of what their audience would like best to\r\nhear; \xe2\x80\x9cyet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how I\r\ngot out there, what I saw, how I went up that river to the place where\r\nI first met the poor chap. It was the farthest point of navigation and\r\nthe culminating point of my experience. It seemed somehow to throw a\r\nkind of light on everything about me\xe2\x80\x94and into my thoughts. It was\r\nsombre enough, too\xe2\x80\x94and pitiful\xe2\x80\x94not extraordinary in any way\xe2\x80\x94not very\r\nclear either. No, not very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had then, as you remember, just returned to London after a lot of\r\nIndian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas\xe2\x80\x94a regular dose of the East\xe2\x80\x94six years\r\nor so, and I was loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and\r\ninvading your homes, just as though I had got a heavenly mission to\r\ncivilize you. It was very fine for a time, but after a bit I did get\r\ntired of resting. Then I began to look for a ship\xe2\x80\x94I should think the\r\nhardest work on earth. But the ships wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even look at me. And I\r\ngot tired of that game, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look\r\nfor hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in\r\nall the glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank\r\nspaces on the earth, and when I saw one that looked particularly\r\ninviting on a map (but they all look that) I would put my finger on it\r\nand say, \xe2\x80\x99When I grow up I will go there.\xe2\x80\x99 The North Pole was one of\r\nthese places, I remember. Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been there yet, and shall not\r\ntry now. The glamour\xe2\x80\x99s off. Other places were scattered about the\r\nhemispheres. I have been in some of them, and... well, we won\xe2\x80\x99t talk\r\nabout that. But there was one yet\xe2\x80\x94the biggest, the most blank, so to\r\nspeak\xe2\x80\x94that I had a hankering after.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, by this time it was not a blank space any more. It had got\r\nfilled since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names. It had ceased\r\nto be a blank space of delightful mystery\xe2\x80\x94a white patch for a boy to\r\ndream gloriously over. It had become a place of darkness. But there was\r\nin it one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on\r\nthe map, resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the\r\nsea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail\r\nlost in the depths of the land. And as I looked at the map of it in a\r\nshop-window, it fascinated me as a snake would a bird\xe2\x80\x94a silly little\r\nbird. Then I remembered there was a big concern, a Company for trade on\r\nthat river. Dash it all! I thought to myself, they can\xe2\x80\x99t trade without\r\nusing some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water\xe2\x80\x94steamboats! Why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I try to get charge of one? I went on along Fleet Street, but\r\ncould not shake off the idea. The snake had charmed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand it was a Continental concern, that Trading society; but\r\nI have a lot of relations living on the Continent, because it\xe2\x80\x99s cheap\r\nand not so nasty as it looks, they say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to own I began to worry them. This was already a fresh\r\ndeparture for me. I was not used to get things that way, you know. I\r\nalways went my own road and on my own legs where I had a mind to go. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed it of myself; but, then\xe2\x80\x94you see\xe2\x80\x94I felt somehow I\r\nmust get there by hook or by crook. So I worried them. The men said \xe2\x80\x98My\r\ndear fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 and did nothing. Then\xe2\x80\x94would you believe it?\xe2\x80\x94I tried the\r\nwomen. I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work\xe2\x80\x94to get a job. Heavens!\r\nWell, you see, the notion drove me. I had an aunt, a dear enthusiastic\r\nsoul. She wrote: \xe2\x80\x98It will be delightful. I am ready to do anything,\r\nanything for you. It is a glorious idea. I know the wife of a very high\r\npersonage in the Administration, and also a man who has lots of\r\ninfluence with,\xe2\x80\x99 etc. She was determined to make no end of fuss to get\r\nme appointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my fancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got my appointment\xe2\x80\x94of course; and I got it very quick. It appears\r\nthe Company had received news that one of their captains had been\r\nkilled in a scuffle with the natives. This was my chance, and it made\r\nme the more anxious to go. It was only months and months afterwards,\r\nwhen I made the attempt to recover what was left of the body, that I\r\nheard the original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some\r\nhens. Yes, two black hens. Fresleven\xe2\x80\x94that was the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s name, a\r\nDane\xe2\x80\x94thought himself wronged somehow in the bargain, so he went ashore\r\nand started to hammer the chief of the village with a stick. Oh, it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me in the least to hear this, and at the same time to\r\nbe told that Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that ever\r\nwalked on two legs. No doubt he was; but he had been a couple of years\r\nalready out there engaged in the noble cause, you know, and he probably\r\nfelt the need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way.\r\nTherefore he whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while a big crowd of\r\nhis people watched him, thunderstruck, till some man\xe2\x80\x94I was told the\r\nchief\xe2\x80\x99s son\xe2\x80\x94in desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a\r\ntentative jab with a spear at the white man\xe2\x80\x94and of course it went quite\r\neasy between the shoulder-blades. Then the whole population cleared\r\ninto the forest, expecting all kinds of calamities to happen, while, on\r\nthe other hand, the steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad\r\npanic, in charge of the engineer, I believe. Afterwards nobody seemed\r\nto trouble much about Fresleven\xe2\x80\x99s remains, till I got out and stepped\r\ninto his shoes. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let it rest, though; but when an opportunity\r\noffered at last to meet my predecessor, the grass growing through his\r\nribs was tall enough to hide his bones. They were all there. The\r\nsupernatural being had not been touched after he fell. And the village\r\nwas deserted, the huts gaped black, rotting, all askew within the\r\nfallen enclosures. A calamity had come to it, sure enough. The people\r\nhad vanished. Mad terror had scattered them, men, women, and children,\r\nthrough the bush, and they had never returned. What became of the hens\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know either. I should think the cause of progress got them,\r\nanyhow. However, through this glorious affair I got my appointment,\r\nbefore I had fairly begun to hope for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI flew around like mad to get ready, and before forty-eight hours I\r\nwas crossing the Channel to show myself to my employers, and sign the\r\ncontract. In a very few hours I arrived in a city that always makes me\r\nthink of a whited sepulchre. Prejudice no doubt. I had no difficulty in\r\nfinding the Company\xe2\x80\x99s offices. It was the biggest thing in the town,\r\nand everybody I met was full of it. They were going to run an over-sea\r\nempire, and make no end of coin by trade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA narrow and deserted street in deep shadow, high houses, innumerable\r\nwindows with venetian blinds, a dead silence, grass sprouting between\r\nthe stones, imposing carriage archways right and left, immense double\r\ndoors standing ponderously ajar. I slipped through one of these cracks,\r\nwent up a swept and ungarnished staircase, as arid as a desert, and\r\nopened the first door I came to. Two women, one fat and the other slim,\r\nsat on straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool. The slim one got up\r\nand walked straight at me\xe2\x80\x94still knitting with downcast eyes\xe2\x80\x94and only\r\njust as I began to think of getting out of her way, as you would for a\r\nsomnambulist, stood still, and looked up. Her dress was as plain as an\r\numbrella-cover, and she turned round without a word and preceded me\r\ninto a waiting-room. I gave my name, and looked about. Deal table in\r\nthe middle, plain chairs all round the walls, on one end a large\r\nshining map, marked with all the colours of a rainbow. There was a vast\r\namount of red\xe2\x80\x94good to see at any time, because one knows that some real\r\nwork is done in there, a deuce of a lot of blue, a little green, smears\r\nof orange, and, on the East Coast, a purple patch, to show where the\r\njolly pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager-beer. However, I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t going into any of these. I was going into the yellow. Dead in\r\nthe centre. And the river was there\xe2\x80\x94fascinating\xe2\x80\x94deadly\xe2\x80\x94like a snake.\r\nOugh! A door opened, a white-haired secretarial head, but wearing a\r\ncompassionate expression, appeared, and a skinny forefinger beckoned me\r\ninto the sanctuary. Its light was dim, and a heavy writing-desk\r\nsquatted in the middle. From behind that structure came out an\r\nimpression of pale plumpness in a frock-coat. The great man himself. He\r\nwas five feet six, I should judge, and had his grip on the handle-end\r\nof ever so many millions. He shook hands, I fancy, murmured vaguely,\r\nwas satisfied with my French. _Bon Voyage_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn about forty-five seconds I found myself again in the waiting-room\r\nwith the compassionate secretary, who, full of desolation and sympathy,\r\nmade me sign some document. I believe I undertook amongst other things\r\nnot to disclose any trade secrets. Well, I am not going to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI began to feel slightly uneasy. You know I am not used to such\r\nceremonies, and there was something ominous in the atmosphere. It was\r\njust as though I had been let into some conspiracy\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94something not quite right; and I was glad to get out. In the outer\r\nroom the two women knitted black wool feverishly. People were arriving,\r\nand the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them. The\r\nold one sat on her chair. Her flat cloth slippers were propped up on a\r\nfoot-warmer, and a cat reposed on her lap. She wore a starched white\r\naffair on her head, had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed\r\nspectacles hung on the tip of her nose. She glanced at me above the\r\nglasses. The swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me.\r\nTwo youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted\r\nover, and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned\r\nwisdom. She seemed to know all about them and about me, too. An eerie\r\nfeeling came over me. She seemed uncanny and fateful. Often far away\r\nthere I thought of these two, guarding the door of Darkness, knitting\r\nblack wool as for a warm pall, one introducing, introducing\r\ncontinuously to the unknown, the other scrutinizing the cheery and\r\nfoolish faces with unconcerned old eyes. _Ave!_ Old knitter of black\r\nwool. _Morituri te salutant_. Not many of those she looked at ever saw\r\nher again\xe2\x80\x94not half, by a long way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was yet a visit to the doctor. \xe2\x80\x98A simple formality,\xe2\x80\x99 assured me\r\nthe secretary, with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows.\r\nAccordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow, some\r\nclerk I suppose\xe2\x80\x94there must have been clerks in the business, though the\r\nhouse was as still as a house in a city of the dead\xe2\x80\x94came from somewhere\r\nup-stairs, and led me forth. He was shabby and careless, with inkstains\r\non the sleeves of his jacket, and his cravat was large and billowy,\r\nunder a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot. It was a little too\r\nearly for the doctor, so I proposed a drink, and thereupon he developed\r\na vein of joviality. As we sat over our vermouths he glorified the\r\nCompany\xe2\x80\x99s business, and by and by I expressed casually my surprise at\r\nhim not going out there. He became very cool and collected all at once.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not such a fool as I look, quoth Plato to his disciples,\xe2\x80\x99 he said\r\nsententiously, emptied his glass with great resolution, and we rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old doctor felt my pulse, evidently thinking of something else the\r\nwhile. \xe2\x80\x98Good, good for there,\xe2\x80\x99 he mumbled, and then with a certain\r\neagerness asked me whether I would let him measure my head. Rather\r\nsurprised, I said Yes, when he produced a thing like calipers and got\r\nthe dimensions back and front and every way, taking notes carefully. He\r\nwas an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine, with\r\nhis feet in slippers, and I thought him a harmless fool. \xe2\x80\x98I always ask\r\nleave, in the interests of science, to measure the crania of those\r\ngoing out there,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98And when they come back, too?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I never see them,\xe2\x80\x99 he remarked; \xe2\x80\x98and, moreover, the changes take\r\nplace inside, you know.\xe2\x80\x99 He smiled, as if at some quiet joke. \xe2\x80\x98So you\r\nare going out there. Famous. Interesting, too.\xe2\x80\x99 He gave me a searching\r\nglance, and made another note. \xe2\x80\x98Ever any madness in your family?\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nasked, in a matter-of-fact tone. I felt very annoyed. \xe2\x80\x98Is that question\r\nin the interests of science, too?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98It would be,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, without\r\ntaking notice of my irritation, \xe2\x80\x98interesting for science to watch the\r\nmental changes of individuals, on the spot, but...\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Are you an\r\nalienist?\xe2\x80\x99 I interrupted. \xe2\x80\x98Every doctor should be\xe2\x80\x94a little,\xe2\x80\x99 answered\r\nthat original, imperturbably. \xe2\x80\x98I have a little theory which you\r\nmessieurs who go out there must help me to prove. This is my share in\r\nthe advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a\r\nmagnificent dependency. The mere wealth I leave to others. Pardon my\r\nquestions, but you are the first Englishman coming under my\r\nobservation...\xe2\x80\x99 I hastened to assure him I was not in the least\r\ntypical. \xe2\x80\x98If I were,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be talking like this with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What you say is rather profound, and probably erroneous,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid, with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x98Avoid irritation more than exposure to the sun.\r\n_Adieu_. How do you English say, eh? Good-bye. Ah! Good-bye. _Adieu_.\r\nIn the tropics one must before everything keep calm.\xe2\x80\x99... He lifted a\r\nwarning forefinger.... \xe2\x80\x98_Du calme, du calme_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing more remained to do\xe2\x80\x94say good-bye to my excellent aunt. I\r\nfound her triumphant. I had a cup of tea\xe2\x80\x94the last decent cup of tea for\r\nmany days\xe2\x80\x94and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would\r\nexpect a lady\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room to look, we had a long quiet chat by the\r\nfireside. In the course of these confidences it became quite plain to\r\nme I had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary, and\r\ngoodness knows to how many more people besides, as an exceptional and\r\ngifted creature\xe2\x80\x94a piece of good fortune for the Company\xe2\x80\x94a man you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget hold of every day. Good heavens! and I was going to take charge of\r\na two-penny-half-penny river-steamboat with a penny whistle attached!\r\nIt appeared, however, I was also one of the Workers, with a capital\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nknow. Something like an emissary of light, something like a lower sort\r\nof apostle. There had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and\r\ntalk just about that time, and the excellent woman, living right in the\r\nrush of all that humbug, got carried off her feet. She talked about\r\n\xe2\x80\x98weaning those ignorant millions from their horrid ways,\xe2\x80\x99 till, upon my\r\nword, she made me quite uncomfortable. I ventured to hint that the\r\nCompany was run for profit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You forget, dear Charlie, that the labourer is worthy of his hire,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe said, brightly. It\xe2\x80\x99s queer how out of touch with truth women are.\r\nThey live in a world of their own, and there has never been anything\r\nlike it, and never can be. It is too beautiful altogether, and if they\r\nwere to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset. Some\r\nconfounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the\r\nday of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter this I got embraced, told to wear flannel, be sure to write\r\noften, and so on\xe2\x80\x94and I left. In the street\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why\xe2\x80\x94a queer\r\nfeeling came to me that I was an imposter. Odd thing that I, who used\r\nto clear out for any part of the world at twenty-four hours\xe2\x80\x99 notice,\r\nwith less thought than most men give to the crossing of a street, had a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t say of hesitation, but of startled pause, before this\r\ncommonplace affair. The best way I can explain it to you is by saying\r\nthat, for a second or two, I felt as though, instead of going to the\r\ncentre of a continent, I were about to set off for the centre of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left in a French steamer, and she called in every blamed port they\r\nhave out there, for, as far as I could see, the sole purpose of landing\r\nsoldiers and custom-house officers. I watched the coast. Watching a\r\ncoast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma. There\r\nit is before you\xe2\x80\x94smiling, frowning, inviting, grand, mean, insipid, or\r\nsavage, and always mute with an air of whispering, \xe2\x80\x98Come and find out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThis one was almost featureless, as if still in the making, with an\r\naspect of monotonous grimness. The edge of a colossal jungle, so\r\ndark-green as to be almost black, fringed with white surf, ran\r\nstraight, like a ruled line, far, far away along a blue sea whose\r\nglitter was blurred by a creeping mist. The sun was fierce, the land\r\nseemed to glisten and drip with steam. Here and there greyish-whitish\r\nspecks showed up clustered inside the white surf, with a flag flying\r\nabove them perhaps. Settlements some centuries old, and still no bigger\r\nthan pinheads on the untouched expanse of their background. We pounded\r\nalong, stopped, landed soldiers; went on, landed custom-house clerks to\r\nlevy toll in what looked like a God-forsaken wilderness, with a tin\r\nshed and a flag-pole lost in it; landed more soldiers\xe2\x80\x94to take care of\r\nthe custom-house clerks, presumably. Some, I heard, got drowned in the\r\nsurf; but whether they did or not, nobody seemed particularly to care.\r\nThey were just flung out there, and on we went. Every day the coast\r\nlooked the same, as though we had not moved; but we passed various\r\nplaces\xe2\x80\x94trading places\xe2\x80\x94with names like Gran\xe2\x80\x99 Bassam, Little Popo; names\r\nthat seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister\r\nback-cloth. The idleness of a passenger, my isolation amongst all these\r\nmen with whom I had no point of contact, the oily and languid sea, the\r\nuniform sombreness of the coast, seemed to keep me away from the truth\r\nof things, within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion. The\r\nvoice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure, like the\r\nspeech of a brother. It was something natural, that had its reason,\r\nthat had a meaning. Now and then a boat from the shore gave one a\r\nmomentary contact with reality. It was paddled by black fellows. You\r\ncould see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening. They\r\nshouted, sang; their bodies streamed with perspiration; they had faces\r\nlike grotesque masks\xe2\x80\x94these chaps; but they had bone, muscle, a wild\r\nvitality, an intense energy of movement, that was as natural and true\r\nas the surf along their coast. They wanted no excuse for being there.\r\nThey were a great comfort to look at. For a time I would feel I\r\nbelonged still to a world of straightforward facts; but the feeling\r\nwould not last long. Something would turn up to scare it away. Once, I\r\nremember, we came upon a man-of-war anchored off the coast. There\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t even a shed there, and she was shelling the bush. It appears the\r\nFrench had one of their wars going on thereabouts. Her ensign dropped\r\nlimp like a rag; the muzzles of the long six-inch guns stuck out all\r\nover the low hull; the greasy, slimy swell swung her up lazily and let\r\nher down, swaying her thin masts. In the empty immensity of earth, sky,\r\nand water, there she was, incomprehensible, firing into a continent.\r\nPop, would go one of the six-inch guns; a small flame would dart and\r\nvanish, a little white smoke would disappear, a tiny projectile would\r\ngive a feeble screech\xe2\x80\x94and nothing happened. Nothing could happen. There\r\nwas a touch of insanity in the proceeding, a sense of lugubrious\r\ndrollery in the sight; and it was not dissipated by somebody on board\r\nassuring me earnestly there was a camp of natives\xe2\x80\x94he called them\r\nenemies!\xe2\x80\x94hidden out of sight somewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe gave her her letters (I heard the men in that lonely ship were\r\ndying of fever at the rate of three a day) and went on. We called at\r\nsome more places with farcical names, where the merry dance of death\r\nand trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated\r\ncatacomb; all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf, as\r\nif Nature herself had tried to ward off intruders; in and out of\r\nrivers, streams of death in life, whose banks were rotting into mud,\r\nwhose waters, thickened into slime, invaded the contorted mangroves,\r\nthat seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair.\r\nNowhere did we stop long enough to get a particularized impression, but\r\nthe general sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me. It was\r\nlike a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was upward of thirty days before I saw the mouth of the big river.\r\nWe anchored off the seat of the government. But my work would not begin\r\ntill some two hundred miles farther on. So as soon as I could I made a\r\nstart for a place thirty miles higher up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had my passage on a little sea-going steamer. Her captain was a\r\nSwede, and knowing me for a seaman, invited me on the bridge. He was a\r\nyoung man, lean, fair, and morose, with lanky hair and a shuffling\r\ngait. As we left the miserable little wharf, he tossed his head\r\ncontemptuously at the shore. \xe2\x80\x98Been living there?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked. I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Fine lot these government chaps\xe2\x80\x94are they not?\xe2\x80\x99 he went on,\r\nspeaking English with great precision and considerable bitterness. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nis funny what some people will do for a few francs a month. I wonder\r\nwhat becomes of that kind when it goes upcountry?\xe2\x80\x99 I said to him I\r\nexpected to see that soon. \xe2\x80\x98So-o-o!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed. He shuffled athwart,\r\nkeeping one eye ahead vigilantly. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be too sure,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The other day I took up a man who hanged himself on the road. He was a\r\nSwede, too.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Hanged himself! Why, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x99 I cried. He kept on\r\nlooking out watchfully. \xe2\x80\x98Who knows? The sun too much for him, or the\r\ncountry perhaps.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last we opened a reach. A rocky cliff appeared, mounds of turned-up\r\nearth by the shore, houses on a hill, others with iron roofs, amongst a\r\nwaste of excavations, or hanging to the declivity. A continuous noise\r\nof the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation. A\r\nlot of people, mostly black and naked, moved about like ants. A jetty\r\nprojected into the river. A blinding sunlight drowned all this at times\r\nin a sudden recrudescence of glare. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s your Company\xe2\x80\x99s station,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the Swede, pointing to three wooden barrack-like structures on the\r\nrocky slope. \xe2\x80\x98I will send your things up. Four boxes did you say? So.\r\nFarewell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass, then found a path leading\r\nup the hill. It turned aside for the boulders, and also for an\r\nundersized railway-truck lying there on its back with its wheels in the\r\nair. One was off. The thing looked as dead as the carcass of some\r\nanimal. I came upon more pieces of decaying machinery, a stack of rusty\r\nrails. To the left a clump of trees made a shady spot, where dark\r\nthings seemed to stir feebly. I blinked, the path was steep. A horn\r\ntooted to the right, and I saw the black people run. A heavy and dull\r\ndetonation shook the ground, a puff of smoke came out of the cliff, and\r\nthat was all. No change appeared on the face of the rock. They were\r\nbuilding a railway. The cliff was not in the way or anything; but this\r\nobjectless blasting was all the work going on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA slight clinking behind me made me turn my head. Six black men\r\nadvanced in a file, toiling up the path. They walked erect and slow,\r\nbalancing small baskets full of earth on their heads, and the clink\r\nkept time with their footsteps. Black rags were wound round their\r\nloins, and the short ends behind waggled to and fro like tails. I could\r\nsee every rib, the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope;\r\neach had an iron collar on his neck, and all were connected together\r\nwith a chain whose bights swung between them, rhythmically clinking.\r\nAnother report from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of\r\nwar I had seen firing into a continent. It was the same kind of ominous\r\nvoice; but these men could by no stretch of imagination be called\r\nenemies. They were called criminals, and the outraged law, like the\r\nbursting shells, had come to them, an insoluble mystery from the sea.\r\nAll their meagre breasts panted together, the violently dilated\r\nnostrils quivered, the eyes stared stonily uphill. They passed me\r\nwithin six inches, without a glance, with that complete, deathlike\r\nindifference of unhappy savages. Behind this raw matter one of the\r\nreclaimed, the product of the new forces at work, strolled\r\ndespondently, carrying a rifle by its middle. He had a uniform jacket\r\nwith one button off, and seeing a white man on the path, hoisted his\r\nweapon to his shoulder with alacrity. This was simple prudence, white\r\nmen being so much alike at a distance that he could not tell who I\r\nmight be. He was speedily reassured, and with a large, white, rascally\r\ngrin, and a glance at his charge, seemed to take me into partnership in\r\nhis exalted trust. After all, I also was a part of the great cause of\r\nthese high and just proceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of going up, I turned and descended to the left. My idea was\r\nto let that chain-gang get out of sight before I climbed the hill. You\r\nknow I am not particularly tender; I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to strike and to fend off.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve had to resist and to attack sometimes\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s only one way of\r\nresisting\xe2\x80\x94without counting the exact cost, according to the demands of\r\nsuch sort of life as I had blundered into. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the devil of\r\nviolence, and the devil of greed, and the devil of hot desire; but, by\r\nall the stars! these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that swayed\r\nand drove men\xe2\x80\x94men, I tell you. But as I stood on this hillside, I\r\nforesaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land I would become\r\nacquainted with a flabby, pretending, weak-eyed devil of a rapacious\r\nand pitiless folly. How insidious he could be, too, I was only to find\r\nout several months later and a thousand miles farther. For a moment I\r\nstood appalled, as though by a warning. Finally I descended the hill,\r\nobliquely, towards the trees I had seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the\r\nslope, the purpose of which I found it impossible to divine. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na quarry or a sandpit, anyhow. It was just a hole. It might have been\r\nconnected with the philanthropic desire of giving the criminals\r\nsomething to do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Then I nearly fell into a very narrow\r\nravine, almost no more than a scar in the hillside. I discovered that a\r\nlot of imported drainage-pipes for the settlement had been tumbled in\r\nthere. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one that was not broken. It was a wanton smash-up.\r\nAt last I got under the trees. My purpose was to stroll into the shade\r\nfor a moment; but no sooner within than it seemed to me I had stepped\r\ninto the gloomy circle of some Inferno. The rapids were near, and an\r\nuninterrupted, uniform, headlong, rushing noise filled the mournful\r\nstillness of the grove, where not a breath stirred, not a leaf moved,\r\nwith a mysterious sound\xe2\x80\x94as though the tearing pace of the launched\r\nearth had suddenly become audible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlack shapes crouched, lay, sat between the trees leaning against the\r\ntrunks, clinging to the earth, half coming out, half effaced within the\r\ndim light, in all the attitudes of pain, abandonment, and despair.\r\nAnother mine on the cliff went off, followed by a slight shudder of the\r\nsoil under my feet. The work was going on. The work! And this was the\r\nplace where some of the helpers had withdrawn to die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were dying slowly\xe2\x80\x94it was very clear. They were not enemies, they\r\nwere not criminals, they were nothing earthly now\xe2\x80\x94nothing but black\r\nshadows of disease and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish\r\ngloom. Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality\r\nof time contracts, lost in uncongenial surroundings, fed on unfamiliar\r\nfood, they sickened, became inefficient, and were then allowed to crawl\r\naway and rest. These moribund shapes were free as air\xe2\x80\x94and nearly as\r\nthin. I began to distinguish the gleam of the eyes under the trees.\r\nThen, glancing down, I saw a face near my hand. The black bones\r\nreclined at full length with one shoulder against the tree, and slowly\r\nthe eyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me, enormous and\r\nvacant, a kind of blind, white flicker in the depths of the orbs, which\r\ndied out slowly. The man seemed young\xe2\x80\x94almost a boy\xe2\x80\x94but you know with\r\nthem it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell. I found nothing else to do but to offer him one\r\nof my good Swede\xe2\x80\x99s ship\xe2\x80\x99s biscuits I had in my pocket. The fingers\r\nclosed slowly on it and held\xe2\x80\x94there was no other movement and no other\r\nglance. He had tied a bit of white worsted round his neck\xe2\x80\x94Why? Where\r\ndid he get it? Was it a badge\xe2\x80\x94an ornament\xe2\x80\x94a charm\xe2\x80\x94a propitiatory act?\r\nWas there any idea at all connected with it? It looked startling round\r\nhis black neck, this bit of white thread from beyond the seas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear the same tree two more bundles of acute angles sat with their\r\nlegs drawn up. One, with his chin propped on his knees, stared at\r\nnothing, in an intolerable and appalling manner: his brother phantom\r\nrested its forehead, as if overcome with a great weariness; and all\r\nabout others were scattered in every pose of contorted collapse, as in\r\nsome picture of a massacre or a pestilence. While I stood\r\nhorror-struck, one of these creatures rose to his hands and knees, and\r\nwent off on all-fours towards the river to drink. He lapped out of his\r\nhand, then sat up in the sunlight, crossing his shins in front of him,\r\nand after a time let his woolly head fall on his breastbone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any more loitering in the shade, and I made haste\r\ntowards the station. When near the buildings I met a white man, in such\r\nan unexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment I took him\r\nfor a sort of vision. I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a\r\nlight alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clean necktie, and varnished\r\nboots. No hat. Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol\r\nheld in a big white hand. He was amazing, and had a penholder behind\r\nhis ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shook hands with this miracle, and I learned he was the Company\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchief accountant, and that all the book-keeping was done at this\r\nstation. He had come out for a moment, he said, \xe2\x80\x98to get a breath of\r\nfresh air. The expression sounded wonderfully odd, with its suggestion\r\nof sedentary desk-life. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have mentioned the fellow to you at\r\nall, only it was from his lips that I first heard the name of the man\r\nwho is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time.\r\nMoreover, I respected the fellow. Yes; I respected his collars, his\r\nvast cuffs, his brushed hair. His appearance was certainly that of a\r\nhairdresser\xe2\x80\x99s dummy; but in the great demoralization of the land he\r\nkept up his appearance. That\xe2\x80\x99s backbone. His starched collars and\r\ngot-up shirt-fronts were achievements of character. He had been out\r\nnearly three years; and, later, I could not help asking him how he\r\nmanaged to sport such linen. He had just the faintest blush, and said\r\nmodestly, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been teaching one of the native women about the\r\nstation. It was difficult. She had a distaste for the work.\xe2\x80\x99 Thus this\r\nman had verily accomplished something. And he was devoted to his books,\r\nwhich were in apple-pie order.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything else in the station was in a muddle\xe2\x80\x94heads, things,\r\nbuildings. Strings of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and\r\ndeparted; a stream of manufactured goods, rubbishy cottons, beads, and\r\nbrass-wire sent into the depths of darkness, and in return came a\r\nprecious trickle of ivory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to wait in the station for ten days\xe2\x80\x94an eternity. I lived in a\r\nhut in the yard, but to be out of the chaos I would sometimes get into\r\nthe accountant\xe2\x80\x99s office. It was built of horizontal planks, and so\r\nbadly put together that, as he bent over his high desk, he was barred\r\nfrom neck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight. There was no need to\r\nopen the big shutter to see. It was hot there, too; big flies buzzed\r\nfiendishly, and did not sting, but stabbed. I sat generally on the\r\nfloor, while, of faultless appearance (and even slightly scented),\r\nperching on a high stool, he wrote, he wrote. Sometimes he stood up for\r\nexercise. When a truckle-bed with a sick man (some invalid agent from\r\nupcountry) was put in there, he exhibited a gentle annoyance. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\ngroans of this sick person,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98distract my attention. And\r\nwithout that it is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors\r\nin this climate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day he remarked, without lifting his head, \xe2\x80\x98In the interior you\r\nwill no doubt meet Mr. Kurtz.\xe2\x80\x99 On my asking who Mr. Kurtz was, he said\r\nhe was a first-class agent; and seeing my disappointment at this\r\ninformation, he added slowly, laying down his pen, \xe2\x80\x98He is a very\r\nremarkable person.\xe2\x80\x99 Further questions elicited from him that Mr. Kurtz\r\nwas at present in charge of a trading-post, a very important one, in\r\nthe true ivory-country, at \xe2\x80\x98the very bottom of there. Sends in as much\r\nivory as all the others put together...\xe2\x80\x99 He began to write again. The\r\nsick man was too ill to groan. The flies buzzed in a great peace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of\r\nfeet. A caravan had come in. A violent babble of uncouth sounds burst\r\nout on the other side of the planks. All the carriers were speaking\r\ntogether, and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable voice of the\r\nchief agent was heard \xe2\x80\x98giving it up\xe2\x80\x99 tearfully for the twentieth time\r\nthat day.... He rose slowly. \xe2\x80\x98What a frightful row,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. He\r\ncrossed the room gently to look at the sick man, and returning, said to\r\nme, \xe2\x80\x98He does not hear.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What! Dead?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked, startled. \xe2\x80\x98No, not yet,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe answered, with great composure. Then, alluding with a toss of the\r\nhead to the tumult in the station-yard, \xe2\x80\x98When one has got to make\r\ncorrect entries, one comes to hate those savages\xe2\x80\x94hate them to the\r\ndeath.\xe2\x80\x99 He remained thoughtful for a moment. \xe2\x80\x98When you see Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe went on, \xe2\x80\x98tell him from me that everything here\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94he glanced at the\r\ndeck\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 is very satisfactory. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to write to him\xe2\x80\x94with those\r\nmessengers of ours you never know who may get hold of your letter\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nthat Central Station.\xe2\x80\x99 He stared at me for a moment with his mild,\r\nbulging eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, he will go far, very far,\xe2\x80\x99 he began again. \xe2\x80\x98He will\r\nbe a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nCouncil in Europe, you know\xe2\x80\x94mean him to be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe turned to his work. The noise outside had ceased, and presently in\r\ngoing out I stopped at the door. In the steady buzz of flies the\r\nhomeward-bound agent was lying finished and insensible; the other, bent\r\nover his books, was making correct entries of perfectly correct\r\ntransactions; and fifty feet below the doorstep I could see the still\r\ntree-tops of the grove of death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext day I left that station at last, with a caravan of sixty men, for\r\na two-hundred-mile tramp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo use telling you much about that. Paths, paths, everywhere; a\r\nstamped-in network of paths spreading over the empty land, through the\r\nlong grass, through burnt grass, through thickets, down and up chilly\r\nravines, up and down stony hills ablaze with heat; and a solitude, a\r\nsolitude, nobody, not a hut. The population had cleared out a long time\r\nago. Well, if a lot of mysterious niggers armed with all kinds of\r\nfearful weapons suddenly took to travelling on the road between Deal\r\nand Gravesend, catching the yokels right and left to carry heavy loads\r\nfor them, I fancy every farm and cottage thereabouts would get empty\r\nvery soon. Only here the dwellings were gone, too. Still I passed\r\nthrough several abandoned villages. There\xe2\x80\x99s something pathetically\r\nchildish in the ruins of grass walls. Day after day, with the stamp and\r\nshuffle of sixty pair of bare feet behind me, each pair under a 60-lb.\r\nload. Camp, cook, sleep, strike camp, march. Now and then a carrier\r\ndead in harness, at rest in the long grass near the path, with an empty\r\nwater-gourd and his long staff lying by his side. A great silence\r\naround and above. Perhaps on some quiet night the tremor of far-off\r\ndrums, sinking, swelling, a tremor vast, faint; a sound weird,\r\nappealing, suggestive, and wild\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps with as profound a meaning\r\nas the sound of bells in a Christian country. Once a white man in an\r\nunbuttoned uniform, camping on the path with an armed escort of lank\r\nZanzibaris, very hospitable and festive\xe2\x80\x94not to say drunk. Was looking\r\nafter the upkeep of the road, he declared. Can\xe2\x80\x99t say I saw any road or\r\nany upkeep, unless the body of a middle-aged negro, with a bullet-hole\r\nin the forehead, upon which I absolutely stumbled three miles farther\r\non, may be considered as a permanent improvement. I had a white\r\ncompanion, too, not a bad chap, but rather too fleshy and with the\r\nexasperating habit of fainting on the hot hillsides, miles away from\r\nthe least bit of shade and water. Annoying, you know, to hold your own\r\ncoat like a parasol over a man\xe2\x80\x99s head while he is coming to. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp asking him once what he meant by coming there at all. \xe2\x80\x98To make\r\nmoney, of course. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, scornfully. Then he got\r\nfever, and had to be carried in a hammock slung under a pole. As he\r\nweighed sixteen stone I had no end of rows with the carriers. They\r\njibbed, ran away, sneaked off with their loads in the night\xe2\x80\x94quite a\r\nmutiny. So, one evening, I made a speech in English with gestures, not\r\none of which was lost to the sixty pairs of eyes before me, and the\r\nnext morning I started the hammock off in front all right. An hour\r\nafterwards I came upon the whole concern wrecked in a bush\xe2\x80\x94man,\r\nhammock, groans, blankets, horrors. The heavy pole had skinned his poor\r\nnose. He was very anxious for me to kill somebody, but there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nshadow of a carrier near. I remembered the old doctor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98It would be\r\ninteresting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals, on\r\nthe spot.\xe2\x80\x99 I felt I was becoming scientifically interesting. However,\r\nall that is to no purpose. On the fifteenth day I came in sight of the\r\nbig river again, and hobbled into the Central Station. It was on a back\r\nwater surrounded by scrub and forest, with a pretty border of smelly\r\nmud on one side, and on the three others enclosed by a crazy fence of\r\nrushes. A neglected gap was all the gate it had, and the first glance\r\nat the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running\r\nthat show. White men with long staves in their hands appeared languidly\r\nfrom amongst the buildings, strolling up to take a look at me, and then\r\nretired out of sight somewhere. One of them, a stout, excitable chap\r\nwith black moustaches, informed me with great volubility and many\r\ndigressions, as soon as I told him who I was, that my steamer was at\r\nthe bottom of the river. I was thunderstruck. What, how, why? Oh, it\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x98all right.\xe2\x80\x99 The \xe2\x80\x98manager himself\xe2\x80\x99 was there. All quite correct.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everybody had behaved splendidly! splendidly!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98you must,\xe2\x80\x99 he said in\r\nagitation, \xe2\x80\x98go and see the general manager at once. He is waiting!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not see the real significance of that wreck at once. I fancy I\r\nsee it now, but I am not sure\xe2\x80\x94not at all. Certainly the affair was too\r\nstupid\xe2\x80\x94when I think of it\xe2\x80\x94to be altogether natural. Still... But at the\r\nmoment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance. The steamer\r\nwas sunk. They had started two days before in a sudden hurry up the\r\nriver with the manager on board, in charge of some volunteer skipper,\r\nand before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom out of\r\nher on stones, and she sank near the south bank. I asked myself what I\r\nwas to do there, now my boat was lost. As a matter of fact, I had\r\nplenty to do in fishing my command out of the river. I had to set about\r\nit the very next day. That, and the repairs when I brought the pieces\r\nto the station, took some months.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first interview with the manager was curious. He did not ask me to\r\nsit down after my twenty-mile walk that morning. He was commonplace in\r\ncomplexion, in features, in manners, and in voice. He was of middle\r\nsize and of ordinary build. His eyes, of the usual blue, were perhaps\r\nremarkably cold, and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as\r\ntrenchant and heavy as an axe. But even at these times the rest of his\r\nperson seemed to disclaim the intention. Otherwise there was only an\r\nindefinable, faint expression of his lips, something stealthy\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsmile\xe2\x80\x94not a smile\xe2\x80\x94I remember it, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain. It was\r\nunconscious, this smile was, though just after he had said something it\r\ngot intensified for an instant. It came at the end of his speeches like\r\na seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase\r\nappear absolutely inscrutable. He was a common trader, from his youth\r\nup employed in these parts\xe2\x80\x94nothing more. He was obeyed, yet he inspired\r\nneither love nor fear, nor even respect. He inspired uneasiness. That\r\nwas it! Uneasiness. Not a definite mistrust\xe2\x80\x94just uneasiness\xe2\x80\x94nothing\r\nmore. You have no idea how effective such a... a... faculty can be. He\r\nhad no genius for organizing, for initiative, or for order even. That\r\nwas evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station. He\r\nhad no learning, and no intelligence. His position had come to him\xe2\x80\x94why?\r\nPerhaps because he was never ill... He had served three terms of three\r\nyears out there... Because triumphant health in the general rout of\r\nconstitutions is a kind of power in itself. When he went home on leave\r\nhe rioted on a large scale\xe2\x80\x94pompously. Jack ashore\xe2\x80\x94with a difference\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nexternals only. This one could gather from his casual talk. He\r\noriginated nothing, he could keep the routine going\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all. But he\r\nwas great. He was great by this little thing that it was impossible to\r\ntell what could control such a man. He never gave that secret away.\r\nPerhaps there was nothing within him. Such a suspicion made one\r\npause\xe2\x80\x94for out there there were no external checks. Once when various\r\ntropical diseases had laid low almost every \xe2\x80\x98agent\xe2\x80\x99 in the station, he\r\nwas heard to say, \xe2\x80\x98Men who come out here should have no entrails.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nsealed the utterance with that smile of his, as though it had been a\r\ndoor opening into a darkness he had in his keeping. You fancied you had\r\nseen things\xe2\x80\x94but the seal was on. When annoyed at meal-times by the\r\nconstant quarrels of the white men about precedence, he ordered an\r\nimmense round table to be made, for which a special house had to be\r\nbuilt. This was the station\xe2\x80\x99s mess-room. Where he sat was the first\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94the rest were nowhere. One felt this to be his unalterable\r\nconviction. He was neither civil nor uncivil. He was quiet. He allowed\r\nhis \xe2\x80\x98boy\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94an overfed young negro from the coast\xe2\x80\x94to treat the white men,\r\nunder his very eyes, with provoking insolence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe began to speak as soon as he saw me. I had been very long on the\r\nroad. He could not wait. Had to start without me. The up-river stations\r\nhad to be relieved. There had been so many delays already that he did\r\nnot know who was dead and who was alive, and how they got on\xe2\x80\x94and so on,\r\nand so on. He paid no attention to my explanations, and, playing with a\r\nstick of sealing-wax, repeated several times that the situation was\r\n\xe2\x80\x98very grave, very grave.\xe2\x80\x99 There were rumours that a very important\r\nstation was in jeopardy, and its chief, Mr. Kurtz, was ill. Hoped it\r\nwas not true. Mr. Kurtz was... I felt weary and irritable. Hang Kurtz,\r\nI thought. I interrupted him by saying I had heard of Mr. Kurtz on the\r\ncoast. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! So they talk of him down there,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured to himself.\r\nThen he began again, assuring me Mr. Kurtz was the best agent he had,\r\nan exceptional man, of the greatest importance to the Company;\r\ntherefore I could understand his anxiety. He was, he said, \xe2\x80\x98very, very\r\nuneasy.\xe2\x80\x99 Certainly he fidgeted on his chair a good deal, exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Mr. Kurtz!\xe2\x80\x99 broke the stick of sealing-wax and seemed dumfounded\r\nby the accident. Next thing he wanted to know \xe2\x80\x98how long it would take\r\nto\xe2\x80\x99... I interrupted him again. Being hungry, you know, and kept on my\r\nfeet too. I was getting savage. \xe2\x80\x98How can I tell?\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven seen the wreck yet\xe2\x80\x94some months, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x99 All this talk seemed to\r\nme so futile. \xe2\x80\x98Some months,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Well, let us say three months\r\nbefore we can make a start. Yes. That ought to do the affair.\xe2\x80\x99 I flung\r\nout of his hut (he lived all alone in a clay hut with a sort of\r\nverandah) muttering to myself my opinion of him. He was a chattering\r\nidiot. Afterwards I took it back when it was borne in upon me\r\nstartlingly with what extreme nicety he had estimated the time\r\nrequisite for the \xe2\x80\x98affair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to work the next day, turning, so to speak, my back on that\r\nstation. In that way only it seemed to me I could keep my hold on the\r\nredeeming facts of life. Still, one must look about sometimes; and then\r\nI saw this station, these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine\r\nof the yard. I asked myself sometimes what it all meant. They wandered\r\nhere and there with their absurd long staves in their hands, like a lot\r\nof faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence. The word \xe2\x80\x98ivory\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrang in the air, was whispered, was sighed. You would think they were\r\npraying to it. A taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all, like a\r\nwhiff from some corpse. By Jove! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anything so unreal in\r\nmy life. And outside, the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared\r\nspeck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible, like\r\nevil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, these months! Well, never mind. Various things happened. One\r\nevening a grass shed full of calico, cotton prints, beads, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what else, burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have\r\nthought the earth had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that\r\ntrash. I was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer, and saw\r\nthem all cutting capers in the light, with their arms lifted high, when\r\nthe stout man with moustaches came tearing down to the river, a tin\r\npail in his hand, assured me that everybody was \xe2\x80\x98behaving splendidly,\r\nsplendidly,\xe2\x80\x99 dipped about a quart of water and tore back again. I\r\nnoticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI strolled up. There was no hurry. You see the thing had gone off like\r\na box of matches. It had been hopeless from the very first. The flame\r\nhad leaped high, driven everybody back, lighted up everything\xe2\x80\x94and\r\ncollapsed. The shed was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely. A\r\nnigger was being beaten near by. They said he had caused the fire in\r\nsome way; be that as it may, he was screeching most horribly. I saw\r\nhim, later, for several days, sitting in a bit of shade looking very\r\nsick and trying to recover himself; afterwards he arose and went\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94and the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again.\r\nAs I approached the glow from the dark I found myself at the back of\r\ntwo men, talking. I heard the name of Kurtz pronounced, then the words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98take advantage of this unfortunate accident.\xe2\x80\x99 One of the men was the\r\nmanager. I wished him a good evening. \xe2\x80\x98Did you ever see anything like\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94eh? it is incredible,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, and walked off. The other man\r\nremained. He was a first-class agent, young, gentlemanly, a bit\r\nreserved, with a forked little beard and a hooked nose. He was\r\nstand-offish with the other agents, and they on their side said he was\r\nthe manager\xe2\x80\x99s spy upon them. As to me, I had hardly ever spoken to him\r\nbefore. We got into talk, and by and by we strolled away from the\r\nhissing ruins. Then he asked me to his room, which was in the main\r\nbuilding of the station. He struck a match, and I perceived that this\r\nyoung aristocrat had not only a silver-mounted dressing-case but also a\r\nwhole candle all to himself. Just at that time the manager was the only\r\nman supposed to have any right to candles. Native mats covered the clay\r\nwalls; a collection of spears, assegais, shields, knives was hung up in\r\ntrophies. The business intrusted to this fellow was the making of\r\nbricks\xe2\x80\x94so I had been informed; but there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fragment of a brick\r\nanywhere in the station, and he had been there more than a\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x94waiting. It seems he could not make bricks without something, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x94straw maybe. Anyway, it could not be found there and as\r\nit was not likely to be sent from Europe, it did not appear clear to me\r\nwhat he was waiting for. An act of special creation perhaps. However,\r\nthey were all waiting\xe2\x80\x94all the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of them\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nsomething; and upon my word it did not seem an uncongenial occupation,\r\nfrom the way they took it, though the only thing that ever came to them\r\nwas disease\xe2\x80\x94as far as I could see. They beguiled the time by\r\nback-biting and intriguing against each other in a foolish kind of way.\r\nThere was an air of plotting about that station, but nothing came of\r\nit, of course. It was as unreal as everything else\xe2\x80\x94as the philanthropic\r\npretence of the whole concern, as their talk, as their government, as\r\ntheir show of work. The only real feeling was a desire to get appointed\r\nto a trading-post where ivory was to be had, so that they could earn\r\npercentages. They intrigued and slandered and hated each other only on\r\nthat account\xe2\x80\x94but as to effectually lifting a little finger\xe2\x80\x94oh, no. By\r\nheavens! there is something after all in the world allowing one man to\r\nsteal a horse while another must not look at a halter. Steal a horse\r\nstraight out. Very well. He has done it. Perhaps he can ride. But there\r\nis a way of looking at a halter that would provoke the most charitable\r\nof saints into a kick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea why he wanted to be sociable, but as we chatted in there\r\nit suddenly occurred to me the fellow was trying to get at something\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nfact, pumping me. He alluded constantly to Europe, to the people I was\r\nsupposed to know there\xe2\x80\x94putting leading questions as to my acquaintances\r\nin the sepulchral city, and so on. His little eyes glittered like mica\r\ndiscs\xe2\x80\x94with curiosity\xe2\x80\x94though he tried to keep up a bit of\r\nsuperciliousness. At first I was astonished, but very soon I became\r\nawfully curious to see what he would find out from me. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npossibly imagine what I had in me to make it worth his while. It was\r\nvery pretty to see how he baffled himself, for in truth my body was\r\nfull only of chills, and my head had nothing in it but that wretched\r\nsteamboat business. It was evident he took me for a perfectly shameless\r\nprevaricator. At last he got angry, and, to conceal a movement of\r\nfurious annoyance, he yawned. I rose. Then I noticed a small sketch in\r\noils, on a panel, representing a woman, draped and blindfolded,\r\ncarrying a lighted torch. The background was sombre\xe2\x80\x94almost black. The\r\nmovement of the woman was stately, and the effect of the torchlight on\r\nthe face was sinister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt arrested me, and he stood by civilly, holding an empty half-pint\r\nchampagne bottle (medical comforts) with the candle stuck in it. To my\r\nquestion he said Mr. Kurtz had painted this\xe2\x80\x94in this very station more\r\nthan a year ago\xe2\x80\x94while waiting for means to go to his trading post.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me, pray,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98who is this Mr. Kurtz?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The chief of the Inner Station,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered in a short tone, looking\r\naway. \xe2\x80\x98Much obliged,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, laughing. \xe2\x80\x98And you are the brickmaker of\r\nthe Central Station. Every one knows that.\xe2\x80\x99 He was silent for a while.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a prodigy,\xe2\x80\x99 he said at last. \xe2\x80\x98He is an emissary of pity and\r\nscience and progress, and devil knows what else. We want,\xe2\x80\x99 he began to\r\ndeclaim suddenly, \xe2\x80\x98for the guidance of the cause intrusted to us by\r\nEurope, so to speak, higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness\r\nof purpose.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Who says that?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98Lots of them,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some even write that; and so _he_ comes here, a special being, as you\r\nought to know.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why ought I to know?\xe2\x80\x99 I interrupted, really surprised.\r\nHe paid no attention. \xe2\x80\x98Yes. Today he is chief of the best station, next\r\nyear he will be assistant-manager, two years more and... but I dare-say\r\nyou know what he will be in two years\xe2\x80\x99 time. You are of the new\r\ngang\xe2\x80\x94the gang of virtue. The same people who sent him specially also\r\nrecommended you. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say no. I\xe2\x80\x99ve my own eyes to trust.\xe2\x80\x99 Light\r\ndawned upon me. My dear aunt\xe2\x80\x99s influential acquaintances were producing\r\nan unexpected effect upon that young man. I nearly burst into a laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you read the Company\xe2\x80\x99s confidential correspondence?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. He\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t a word to say. It was great fun. \xe2\x80\x98When Mr. Kurtz,\xe2\x80\x99 I continued,\r\nseverely, \xe2\x80\x98is General Manager, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have the opportunity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe blew the candle out suddenly, and we went outside. The moon had\r\nrisen. Black figures strolled about listlessly, pouring water on the\r\nglow, whence proceeded a sound of hissing; steam ascended in the\r\nmoonlight, the beaten nigger groaned somewhere. \xe2\x80\x98What a row the brute\r\nmakes!\xe2\x80\x99 said the indefatigable man with the moustaches, appearing near\r\nus. \xe2\x80\x98Serve him right. Transgression\xe2\x80\x94punishment\xe2\x80\x94bang! Pitiless,\r\npitiless. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way. This will prevent all conflagrations for\r\nthe future. I was just telling the manager...\xe2\x80\x99 He noticed my companion,\r\nand became crestfallen all at once. \xe2\x80\x98Not in bed yet,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, with a\r\nkind of servile heartiness; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s so natural. Ha! Danger\xe2\x80\x94agitation.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nvanished. I went on to the riverside, and the other followed me. I\r\nheard a scathing murmur at my ear, \xe2\x80\x98Heap of muffs\xe2\x80\x94go to.\xe2\x80\x99 The pilgrims\r\ncould be seen in knots gesticulating, discussing. Several had still\r\ntheir staves in their hands. I verily believe they took these sticks to\r\nbed with them. Beyond the fence the forest stood up spectrally in the\r\nmoonlight, and through that dim stir, through the faint sounds of that\r\nlamentable courtyard, the silence of the land went home to one\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x94its mystery, its greatness, the amazing reality of its concealed\r\nlife. The hurt nigger moaned feebly somewhere near by, and then fetched\r\na deep sigh that made me mend my pace away from there. I felt a hand\r\nintroducing itself under my arm. \xe2\x80\x98My dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fellow, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to be misunderstood, and especially by you, who will see Mr.\r\nKurtz long before I can have that pleasure. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like him to get\r\na false idea of my disposition....\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI let him run on, this _papier-mache_ Mephistopheles, and it seemed to\r\nme that if I tried I could poke my forefinger through him, and would\r\nfind nothing inside but a little loose dirt, maybe. He, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see,\r\nhad been planning to be assistant-manager by and by under the present\r\nman, and I could see that the coming of that Kurtz had upset them both\r\nnot a little. He talked precipitately, and I did not try to stop him. I\r\nhad my shoulders against the wreck of my steamer, hauled up on the\r\nslope like a carcass of some big river animal. The smell of mud, of\r\nprimeval mud, by Jove! was in my nostrils, the high stillness of\r\nprimeval forest was before my eyes; there were shiny patches on the\r\nblack creek. The moon had spread over everything a thin layer of\r\nsilver\xe2\x80\x94over the rank grass, over the mud, upon the wall of matted\r\nvegetation standing higher than the wall of a temple, over the great\r\nriver I could see through a sombre gap glittering, glittering, as it\r\nflowed broadly by without a murmur. All this was great, expectant,\r\nmute, while the man jabbered about himself. I wondered whether the\r\nstillness on the face of the immensity looking at us two were meant as\r\nan appeal or as a menace. What were we who had strayed in here? Could\r\nwe handle that dumb thing, or would it handle us? I felt how big, how\r\nconfoundedly big, was that thing that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk, and perhaps was\r\ndeaf as well. What was in there? I could see a little ivory coming out\r\nfrom there, and I had heard Mr. Kurtz was in there. I had heard enough\r\nabout it, too\xe2\x80\x94God knows! Yet somehow it didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring any image with\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94no more than if I had been told an angel or a fiend was in there. I\r\nbelieved it in the same way one of you might believe there are\r\ninhabitants in the planet Mars. I knew once a Scotch sailmaker who was\r\ncertain, dead sure, there were people in Mars. If you asked him for\r\nsome idea how they looked and behaved, he would get shy and mutter\r\nsomething about \xe2\x80\x98walking on all-fours.\xe2\x80\x99 If you as much as smiled, he\r\nwould\xe2\x80\x94though a man of sixty\xe2\x80\x94offer to fight you. I would not have gone\r\nso far as to fight for Kurtz, but I went for him near enough to a lie.\r\nYou know I hate, detest, and can\xe2\x80\x99t bear a lie, not because I am\r\nstraighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me. There\r\nis a taint of death, a flavour of mortality in lies\xe2\x80\x94which is exactly\r\nwhat I hate and detest in the world\xe2\x80\x94what I want to forget. It makes me\r\nmiserable and sick, like biting something rotten would do. Temperament,\r\nI suppose. Well, I went near enough to it by letting the young fool\r\nthere believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence in\r\nEurope. I became in an instant as much of a pretence as the rest of the\r\nbewitched pilgrims. This simply because I had a notion it somehow would\r\nbe of help to that Kurtz whom at the time I did not see\xe2\x80\x94you understand.\r\nHe was just a word for me. I did not see the man in the name any more\r\nthan you do. Do you see him? Do you see the story? Do you see anything?\r\nIt seems to me I am trying to tell you a dream\xe2\x80\x94making a vain attempt,\r\nbecause no relation of a dream can convey the dream-sensation, that\r\ncommingling of absurdity, surprise, and bewilderment in a tremor of\r\nstruggling revolt, that notion of being captured by the incredible\r\nwhich is of the very essence of dreams....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... No, it is impossible; it is impossible to convey the\r\nlife-sensation of any given epoch of one\xe2\x80\x99s existence\xe2\x80\x94that which makes\r\nits truth, its meaning\xe2\x80\x94its subtle and penetrating essence. It is\r\nimpossible. We live, as we dream\xe2\x80\x94alone....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused again as if reflecting, then added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course in this you fellows see more than I could then. You see me,\r\nwhom you know....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had become so pitch dark that we listeners could hardly see one\r\nanother. For a long time already he, sitting apart, had been no more to\r\nus than a voice. There was not a word from anybody. The others might\r\nhave been asleep, but I was awake. I listened, I listened on the watch\r\nfor the sentence, for the word, that would give me the clue to the\r\nfaint uneasiness inspired by this narrative that seemed to shape itself\r\nwithout human lips in the heavy night-air of the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... Yes\xe2\x80\x94I let him run on,\xe2\x80\x9d Marlow began again, \xe2\x80\x9cand think what he\r\npleased about the powers that were behind me. I did! And there was\r\nnothing behind me! There was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled\r\nsteamboat I was leaning against, while he talked fluently about \xe2\x80\x98the\r\nnecessity for every man to get on.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And when one comes out here, you\r\nconceive, it is not to gaze at the moon.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Kurtz was a \xe2\x80\x98universal\r\ngenius,\xe2\x80\x99 but even a genius would find it easier to work with \xe2\x80\x98adequate\r\ntools\xe2\x80\x94intelligent men.\xe2\x80\x99 He did not make bricks\xe2\x80\x94why, there was a\r\nphysical impossibility in the way\xe2\x80\x94as I was well aware; and if he did\r\nsecretarial work for the manager, it was because \xe2\x80\x98no sensible man\r\nrejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors.\xe2\x80\x99 Did I see it? I saw\r\nit. What more did I want? What I really wanted was rivets, by heaven!\r\nRivets. To get on with the work\xe2\x80\x94to stop the hole. Rivets I wanted.\r\nThere were cases of them down at the coast\xe2\x80\x94cases\xe2\x80\x94piled up\xe2\x80\x94burst\xe2\x80\x94split!\r\nYou kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that station-yard on\r\nthe hillside. Rivets had rolled into the grove of death. You could fill\r\nyour pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping down\xe2\x80\x94and there\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t one rivet to be found where it was wanted. We had plates that\r\nwould do, but nothing to fasten them with. And every week the\r\nmessenger, a long negro, letter-bag on shoulder and staff in hand, left\r\nour station for the coast. And several times a week a coast caravan\r\ncame in with trade goods\xe2\x80\x94ghastly glazed calico that made you shudder\r\nonly to look at it, glass beads value about a penny a quart, confounded\r\nspotted cotton handkerchiefs. And no rivets. Three carriers could have\r\nbrought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was becoming confidential now, but I fancy my unresponsive attitude\r\nmust have exasperated him at last, for he judged it necessary to inform\r\nme he feared neither God nor devil, let alone any mere man. I said I\r\ncould see that very well, but what I wanted was a certain quantity of\r\nrivets\xe2\x80\x94and rivets were what really Mr. Kurtz wanted, if he had only\r\nknown it. Now letters went to the coast every week.... \xe2\x80\x98My dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe cried, \xe2\x80\x98I write from dictation.\xe2\x80\x99 I demanded rivets. There was a\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94for an intelligent man. He changed his manner; became very cold,\r\nand suddenly began to talk about a hippopotamus; wondered whether\r\nsleeping on board the steamer (I stuck to my salvage night and day) I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t disturbed. There was an old hippo that had the bad habit of\r\ngetting out on the bank and roaming at night over the station grounds.\r\nThe pilgrims used to turn out in a body and empty every rifle they\r\ncould lay hands on at him. Some even had sat up o\xe2\x80\x99 nights for him. All\r\nthis energy was wasted, though. \xe2\x80\x98That animal has a charmed life,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x98but you can say this only of brutes in this country. No man\xe2\x80\x94you\r\napprehend me?\xe2\x80\x94no man here bears a charmed life.\xe2\x80\x99 He stood there for a\r\nmoment in the moonlight with his delicate hooked nose set a little\r\naskew, and his mica eyes glittering without a wink, then, with a curt\r\nGood-night, he strode off. I could see he was disturbed and\r\nconsiderably puzzled, which made me feel more hopeful than I had been\r\nfor days. It was a great comfort to turn from that chap to my\r\ninfluential friend, the battered, twisted, ruined, tin-pot steamboat. I\r\nclambered on board. She rang under my feet like an empty Huntley &\r\nPalmer biscuit-tin kicked along a gutter; she was nothing so solid in\r\nmake, and rather less pretty in shape, but I had expended enough hard\r\nwork on her to make me love her. No influential friend would have\r\nserved me better. She had given me a chance to come out a bit\xe2\x80\x94to find\r\nout what I could do. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like work. I had rather laze about and\r\nthink of all the fine things that can be done. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like work\xe2\x80\x94no man\r\ndoes\xe2\x80\x94but I like what is in the work\xe2\x80\x94the chance to find yourself. Your\r\nown reality\xe2\x80\x94for yourself, not for others\xe2\x80\x94what no other man can ever\r\nknow. They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it\r\nreally means.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft, on the deck, with his\r\nlegs dangling over the mud. You see I rather chummed with the few\r\nmechanics there were in that station, whom the other pilgrims naturally\r\ndespised\xe2\x80\x94on account of their imperfect manners, I suppose. This was the\r\nforeman\xe2\x80\x94a boiler-maker by trade\xe2\x80\x94a good worker. He was a lank, bony,\r\nyellow-faced man, with big intense eyes. His aspect was worried, and\r\nhis head was as bald as the palm of my hand; but his hair in falling\r\nseemed to have stuck to his chin, and had prospered in the new\r\nlocality, for his beard hung down to his waist. He was a widower with\r\nsix young children (he had left them in charge of a sister of his to\r\ncome out there), and the passion of his life was pigeon-flying. He was\r\nan enthusiast and a connoisseur. He would rave about pigeons. After\r\nwork hours he used sometimes to come over from his hut for a talk about\r\nhis children and his pigeons; at work, when he had to crawl in the mud\r\nunder the bottom of the steamboat, he would tie up that beard of his in\r\na kind of white serviette he brought for the purpose. It had loops to\r\ngo over his ears. In the evening he could be seen squatted on the bank\r\nrinsing that wrapper in the creek with great care, then spreading it\r\nsolemnly on a bush to dry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI slapped him on the back and shouted, \xe2\x80\x98We shall have rivets!\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nscrambled to his feet exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98No! Rivets!\xe2\x80\x99 as though he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve his ears. Then in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x98You... eh?\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why we\r\nbehaved like lunatics. I put my finger to the side of my nose and\r\nnodded mysteriously. \xe2\x80\x98Good for you!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, snapped his fingers\r\nabove his head, lifting one foot. I tried a jig. We capered on the iron\r\ndeck. A frightful clatter came out of that hulk, and the virgin forest\r\non the other bank of the creek sent it back in a thundering roll upon\r\nthe sleeping station. It must have made some of the pilgrims sit up in\r\ntheir hovels. A dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the\r\nmanager\xe2\x80\x99s hut, vanished, then, a second or so after, the doorway itself\r\nvanished, too. We stopped, and the silence driven away by the stamping\r\nof our feet flowed back again from the recesses of the land. The great\r\nwall of vegetation, an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks,\r\nbranches, leaves, boughs, festoons, motionless in the moonlight, was\r\nlike a rioting invasion of soundless life, a rolling wave of plants,\r\npiled up, crested, ready to topple over the creek, to sweep every\r\nlittle man of us out of his little existence. And it moved not. A\r\ndeadened burst of mighty splashes and snorts reached us from afar, as\r\nthough an icthyosaurus had been taking a bath of glitter in the great\r\nriver. \xe2\x80\x98After all,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boiler-maker in a reasonable tone, \xe2\x80\x98why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we get the rivets?\xe2\x80\x99 Why not, indeed! I did not know of any\r\nreason why we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99ll come in three weeks,\xe2\x80\x99 I said\r\nconfidently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Instead of rivets there came an invasion, an\r\ninfliction, a visitation. It came in sections during the next three\r\nweeks, each section headed by a donkey carrying a white man in new\r\nclothes and tan shoes, bowing from that elevation right and left to the\r\nimpressed pilgrims. A quarrelsome band of footsore sulky niggers trod\r\non the heels of the donkey; a lot of tents, camp-stools, tin boxes,\r\nwhite cases, brown bales would be shot down in the courtyard, and the\r\nair of mystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the station.\r\nFive such instalments came, with their absurd air of disorderly flight\r\nwith the loot of innumerable outfit shops and provision stores, that,\r\none would think, they were lugging, after a raid, into the wilderness\r\nfor equitable division. It was an inextricable mess of things decent in\r\nthemselves but that human folly made look like the spoils of thieving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis devoted band called itself the Eldorado Exploring Expedition, and\r\nI believe they were sworn to secrecy. Their talk, however, was the talk\r\nof sordid buccaneers: it was reckless without hardihood, greedy without\r\naudacity, and cruel without courage; there was not an atom of foresight\r\nor of serious intention in the whole batch of them, and they did not\r\nseem aware these things are wanted for the work of the world. To tear\r\ntreasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire, with no more\r\nmoral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into\r\na safe. Who paid the expenses of the noble enterprise I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but\r\nthe uncle of our manager was leader of that lot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neighbourhood, and his\r\neyes had a look of sleepy cunning. He carried his fat paunch with\r\nostentation on his short legs, and during the time his gang infested\r\nthe station spoke to no one but his nephew. You could see these two\r\nroaming about all day long with their heads close together in an\r\neverlasting confab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had given up worrying myself about the rivets. One\xe2\x80\x99s capacity for\r\nthat kind of folly is more limited than you would suppose. I said\r\nHang!\xe2\x80\x94and let things slide. I had plenty of time for meditation, and\r\nnow and then I would give some thought to Kurtz. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very\r\ninterested in him. No. Still, I was curious to see whether this man,\r\nwho had come out equipped with moral ideas of some sort, would climb to\r\nthe top after all and how he would set about his work when there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne evening as I was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat, I heard\r\nvoices approaching\xe2\x80\x94and there were the nephew and the uncle strolling\r\nalong the bank. I laid my head on my arm again, and had nearly lost\r\nmyself in a doze, when somebody said in my ear, as it were: \xe2\x80\x98I am as\r\nharmless as a little child, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be dictated to. Am I\r\nthe manager\xe2\x80\x94or am I not? I was ordered to send him there. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nincredible.\xe2\x80\x99 ... I became aware that the two were standing on the shore\r\nalongside the forepart of the steamboat, just below my head. I did not\r\nmove; it did not occur to me to move: I was sleepy. \xe2\x80\x98It _is_\r\nunpleasant,\xe2\x80\x99 grunted the uncle. \xe2\x80\x98He has asked the Administration to be\r\nsent there,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other, \xe2\x80\x98with the idea of showing what he could\r\ndo; and I was instructed accordingly. Look at the influence that man\r\nmust have. Is it not frightful?\xe2\x80\x99 They both agreed it was frightful,\r\nthen made several bizarre remarks: \xe2\x80\x98Make rain and fine weather\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94the Council\xe2\x80\x94by the nose\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94bits of absurd sentences that got the\r\nbetter of my drowsiness, so that I had pretty near the whole of my wits\r\nabout me when the uncle said, \xe2\x80\x98The climate may do away with this\r\ndifficulty for you. Is he alone there?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the manager;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98he sent his assistant down the river with a note to me in these terms:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear this poor devil out of the country, and don\xe2\x80\x99t bother sending\r\nmore of that sort. I had rather be alone than have the kind of men you\r\ncan dispose of with me.\xe2\x80\x9d It was more than a year ago. Can you imagine\r\nsuch impudence!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Anything since then?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the other hoarsely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ivory,\xe2\x80\x99 jerked the nephew; \xe2\x80\x98lots of it\xe2\x80\x94prime sort\xe2\x80\x94lots\xe2\x80\x94most annoying,\r\nfrom him.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And with that?\xe2\x80\x99 questioned the heavy rumble. \xe2\x80\x98Invoice,\xe2\x80\x99 was\r\nthe reply fired out, so to speak. Then silence. They had been talking\r\nabout Kurtz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was broad awake by this time, but, lying perfectly at ease, remained\r\nstill, having no inducement to change my position. \xe2\x80\x98How did that ivory\r\ncome all this way?\xe2\x80\x99 growled the elder man, who seemed very vexed. The\r\nother explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an\r\nEnglish half-caste clerk Kurtz had with him; that Kurtz had apparently\r\nintended to return himself, the station being by that time bare of\r\ngoods and stores, but after coming three hundred miles, had suddenly\r\ndecided to go back, which he started to do alone in a small dugout with\r\nfour paddlers, leaving the half-caste to continue down the river with\r\nthe ivory. The two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting\r\nsuch a thing. They were at a loss for an adequate motive. As to me, I\r\nseemed to see Kurtz for the first time. It was a distinct glimpse: the\r\ndugout, four paddling savages, and the lone white man turning his back\r\nsuddenly on the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of home\xe2\x80\x94perhaps;\r\nsetting his face towards the depths of the wilderness, towards his\r\nempty and desolate station. I did not know the motive. Perhaps he was\r\njust simply a fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake. His\r\nname, you understand, had not been pronounced once. He was \xe2\x80\x98that man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe half-caste, who, as far as I could see, had conducted a difficult\r\ntrip with great prudence and pluck, was invariably alluded to as \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nscoundrel.\xe2\x80\x99 The \xe2\x80\x98scoundrel\xe2\x80\x99 had reported that the \xe2\x80\x98man\xe2\x80\x99 had been very\r\nill\xe2\x80\x94had recovered imperfectly.... The two below me moved away then a\r\nfew paces, and strolled back and forth at some little distance. I\r\nheard: \xe2\x80\x98Military post\xe2\x80\x94doctor\xe2\x80\x94two hundred miles\xe2\x80\x94quite alone\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94unavoidable delays\xe2\x80\x94nine months\xe2\x80\x94no news\xe2\x80\x94strange rumours.\xe2\x80\x99 They\r\napproached again, just as the manager was saying, \xe2\x80\x98No one, as far as I\r\nknow, unless a species of wandering trader\xe2\x80\x94a pestilential fellow,\r\nsnapping ivory from the natives.\xe2\x80\x99 Who was it they were talking about\r\nnow? I gathered in snatches that this was some man supposed to be in\r\nKurtz\xe2\x80\x99s district, and of whom the manager did not approve. \xe2\x80\x98We will not\r\nbe free from unfair competition till one of these fellows is hanged for\r\nan example,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 grunted the other; \xe2\x80\x98get him hanged!\r\nWhy not? Anything\xe2\x80\x94anything can be done in this country. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\r\nsay; nobody here, you understand, _here_, can endanger your position.\r\nAnd why? You stand the climate\xe2\x80\x94you outlast them all. The danger is in\r\nEurope; but there before I left I took care to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 They moved off and\r\nwhispered, then their voices rose again. \xe2\x80\x98The extraordinary series of\r\ndelays is not my fault. I did my best.\xe2\x80\x99 The fat man sighed. \xe2\x80\x98Very sad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the pestiferous absurdity of his talk,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the other; \xe2\x80\x98he\r\nbothered me enough when he was here. \xe2\x80\x9cEach station should be like a\r\nbeacon on the road towards better things, a centre for trade of course,\r\nbut also for humanizing, improving, instructing.\xe2\x80\x9d Conceive you\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nass! And he wants to be manager! No, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 Here he got choked by\r\nexcessive indignation, and I lifted my head the least bit. I was\r\nsurprised to see how near they were\xe2\x80\x94right under me. I could have spat\r\nupon their hats. They were looking on the ground, absorbed in thought.\r\nThe manager was switching his leg with a slender twig: his sagacious\r\nrelative lifted his head. \xe2\x80\x98You have been well since you came out this\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked. The other gave a start. \xe2\x80\x98Who? I? Oh! Like a charm\xe2\x80\x94like\r\na charm. But the rest\xe2\x80\x94oh, my goodness! All sick. They die so quick,\r\ntoo, that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the time to send them out of the country\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nincredible!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Hm\xe2\x80\x99m. Just so,\xe2\x80\x99 grunted the uncle. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! my boy, trust to\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94I say, trust to this.\xe2\x80\x99 I saw him extend his short flipper of an\r\narm for a gesture that took in the forest, the creek, the mud, the\r\nriver\xe2\x80\x94seemed to beckon with a dishonouring flourish before the sunlit\r\nface of the land a treacherous appeal to the lurking death, to the\r\nhidden evil, to the profound darkness of its heart. It was so startling\r\nthat I leaped to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest, as\r\nthough I had expected an answer of some sort to that black display of\r\nconfidence. You know the foolish notions that come to one sometimes.\r\nThe high stillness confronted these two figures with its ominous\r\npatience, waiting for the passing away of a fantastic invasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey swore aloud together\xe2\x80\x94out of sheer fright, I believe\xe2\x80\x94then\r\npretending not to know anything of my existence, turned back to the\r\nstation. The sun was low; and leaning forward side by side, they seemed\r\nto be tugging painfully uphill their two ridiculous shadows of unequal\r\nlength, that trailed behind them slowly over the tall grass without\r\nbending a single blade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a few days the Eldorado Expedition went into the patient\r\nwilderness, that closed upon it as the sea closes over a diver. Long\r\nafterwards the news came that all the donkeys were dead. I know nothing\r\nas to the fate of the less valuable animals. They, no doubt, like the\r\nrest of us, found what they deserved. I did not inquire. I was then\r\nrather excited at the prospect of meeting Kurtz very soon. When I say\r\nvery soon I mean it comparatively. It was just two months from the day\r\nwe left the creek when we came to the bank below Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s station.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings\r\nof the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees\r\nwere kings. An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest.\r\nThe air was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish. There was no joy in the\r\nbrilliance of sunshine. The long stretches of the waterway ran on,\r\ndeserted, into the gloom of overshadowed distances. On silvery\r\nsand-banks hippos and alligators sunned themselves side by side. The\r\nbroadening waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands; you lost your\r\nway on that river as you would in a desert, and butted all day long\r\nagainst shoals, trying to find the channel, till you thought yourself\r\nbewitched and cut off for ever from everything you had known\r\nonce\xe2\x80\x94somewhere\xe2\x80\x94far away\xe2\x80\x94in another existence perhaps. There were\r\nmoments when one\xe2\x80\x99s past came back to one, as it will sometimes when you\r\nhave not a moment to spare for yourself; but it came in the shape of an\r\nunrestful and noisy dream, remembered with wonder amongst the\r\noverwhelming realities of this strange world of plants, and water, and\r\nsilence. And this stillness of life did not in the least resemble a\r\npeace. It was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an\r\ninscrutable intention. It looked at you with a vengeful aspect. I got\r\nused to it afterwards; I did not see it any more; I had no time. I had\r\nto keep guessing at the channel; I had to discern, mostly by\r\ninspiration, the signs of hidden banks; I watched for sunken stones; I\r\nwas learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out, when I\r\nshaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the\r\nlife out of the tin-pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims; I had\r\nto keep a lookout for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the\r\nnight for next day\xe2\x80\x99s steaming. When you have to attend to things of\r\nthat sort, to the mere incidents of the surface, the reality\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nreality, I tell you\xe2\x80\x94fades. The inner truth is hidden\xe2\x80\x94luckily, luckily.\r\nBut I felt it all the same; I felt often its mysterious stillness\r\nwatching me at my monkey tricks, just as it watches you fellows\r\nperforming on your respective tight-ropes for\xe2\x80\x94what is it? half-a-crown\r\na tumble\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry to be civil, Marlow,\xe2\x80\x9d growled a voice, and I knew there was at\r\nleast one listener awake besides myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon. I forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of\r\nthe price. And indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well\r\ndone? You do your tricks very well. And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do badly either, since\r\nI managed not to sink that steamboat on my first trip. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder to\r\nme yet. Imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road. I\r\nsweated and shivered over that business considerably, I can tell you.\r\nAfter all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsupposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin.\r\nNo one may know of it, but you never forget the thump\xe2\x80\x94eh? A blow on the\r\nvery heart. You remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night and\r\nthink of it\xe2\x80\x94years after\xe2\x80\x94and go hot and cold all over. I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend\r\nto say that steamboat floated all the time. More than once she had to\r\nwade for a bit, with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing. We\r\nhad enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew. Fine\r\nfellows\xe2\x80\x94cannibals\xe2\x80\x94in their place. They were men one could work with,\r\nand I am grateful to them. And, after all, they did not eat each other\r\nbefore my face: they had brought along a provision of hippo-meat which\r\nwent rotten, and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my\r\nnostrils. Phoo! I can sniff it now. I had the manager on board and\r\nthree or four pilgrims with their staves\xe2\x80\x94all complete. Sometimes we\r\ncame upon a station close by the bank, clinging to the skirts of the\r\nunknown, and the white men rushing out of a tumble-down hovel, with\r\ngreat gestures of joy and surprise and welcome, seemed very strange\xe2\x80\x94had\r\nthe appearance of being held there captive by a spell. The word ivory\r\nwould ring in the air for a while\xe2\x80\x94and on we went again into the\r\nsilence, along empty reaches, round the still bends, between the high\r\nwalls of our winding way, reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous\r\nbeat of the stern-wheel. Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive,\r\nimmense, running up high; and at their foot, hugging the bank against\r\nthe stream, crept the little begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle\r\ncrawling on the floor of a lofty portico. It made you feel very small,\r\nvery lost, and yet it was not altogether depressing, that feeling.\r\nAfter all, if you were small, the grimy beetle crawled on\xe2\x80\x94which was\r\njust what you wanted it to do. Where the pilgrims imagined it crawled\r\nto I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. To some place where they expected to get something. I\r\nbet! For me it crawled towards Kurtz\xe2\x80\x94exclusively; but when the\r\nsteam-pipes started leaking we crawled very slow. The reaches opened\r\nbefore us and closed behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely\r\nacross the water to bar the way for our return. We penetrated deeper\r\nand deeper into the heart of darkness. It was very quiet there. At\r\nnight sometimes the roll of drums behind the curtain of trees would run\r\nup the river and remain sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air\r\nhigh over our heads, till the first break of day. Whether it meant war,\r\npeace, or prayer we could not tell. The dawns were heralded by the\r\ndescent of a chill stillness; the wood-cutters slept, their fires\r\nburned low; the snapping of a twig would make you start. We were\r\nwanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an earth that wore the aspect of\r\nan unknown planet. We could have fancied ourselves the first of men\r\ntaking possession of an accursed inheritance, to be subdued at the cost\r\nof profound anguish and of excessive toil. But suddenly, as we\r\nstruggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls, of\r\npeaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of\r\nhands clapping of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes rolling,\r\nunder the droop of heavy and motionless foliage. The steamer toiled\r\nalong slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy. The\r\nprehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us\xe2\x80\x94who could\r\ntell? We were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings; we\r\nglided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men\r\nwould be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse. We could not\r\nunderstand because we were too far and could not remember because we\r\nwere travelling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are\r\ngone, leaving hardly a sign\xe2\x80\x94and no memories.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to look upon the\r\nshackled form of a conquered monster, but there\xe2\x80\x94there you could look at\r\na thing monstrous and free. It was unearthly, and the men were\xe2\x80\x94No, they\r\nwere not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nsuspicion of their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They\r\nhowled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled\r\nyou was just the thought of their humanity\xe2\x80\x94like yours\xe2\x80\x94the thought of\r\nyour remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it\r\nwas ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself\r\nthat there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the\r\nterrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a\r\nmeaning in it which you\xe2\x80\x94you so remote from the night of first\r\nages\xe2\x80\x94could comprehend. And why not? The mind of man is capable of\r\nanything\xe2\x80\x94because everything is in it, all the past as well as all the\r\nfuture. What was there after all? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valour,\r\nrage\xe2\x80\x94who can tell?\xe2\x80\x94but truth\xe2\x80\x94truth stripped of its cloak of time. Let\r\nthe fool gape and shudder\xe2\x80\x94the man knows, and can look on without a\r\nwink. But he must at least be as much of a man as these on the shore.\r\nHe must meet that truth with his own true stuff\xe2\x80\x94with his own inborn\r\nstrength. Principles won\xe2\x80\x99t do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags\xe2\x80\x94rags\r\nthat would fly off at the first good shake. No; you want a deliberate\r\nbelief. An appeal to me in this fiendish row\xe2\x80\x94is there? Very well; I\r\nhear; I admit, but I have a voice, too, and for good or evil mine is\r\nthe speech that cannot be silenced. Of course, a fool, what with sheer\r\nfright and fine sentiments, is always safe. Who\xe2\x80\x99s that grunting? You\r\nwonder I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go ashore for a howl and a dance? Well, no\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nFine sentiments, you say? Fine sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I\r\nhad to mess about with white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping\r\nto put bandages on those leaky steam-pipes\xe2\x80\x94I tell you. I had to watch\r\nthe steering, and circumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by\r\nhook or by crook. There was surface-truth enough in these things to\r\nsave a wiser man. And between whiles I had to look after the savage who\r\nwas fireman. He was an improved specimen; he could fire up a vertical\r\nboiler. He was there below me, and, upon my word, to look at him was as\r\nedifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat,\r\nwalking on his hind-legs. A few months of training had done for that\r\nreally fine chap. He squinted at the steam-gauge and at the water-gauge\r\nwith an evident effort of intrepidity\xe2\x80\x94and he had filed teeth, too, the\r\npoor devil, and the wool of his pate shaved into queer patterns, and\r\nthree ornamental scars on each of his cheeks. He ought to have been\r\nclapping his hands and stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which\r\nhe was hard at work, a thrall to strange witchcraft, full of improving\r\nknowledge. He was useful because he had been instructed; and what he\r\nknew was this\xe2\x80\x94that should the water in that transparent thing\r\ndisappear, the evil spirit inside the boiler would get angry through\r\nthe greatness of his thirst, and take a terrible vengeance. So he\r\nsweated and fired up and watched the glass fearfully (with an impromptu\r\ncharm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and a piece of polished bone, as\r\nbig as a watch, stuck flatways through his lower lip), while the wooded\r\nbanks slipped past us slowly, the short noise was left behind, the\r\ninterminable miles of silence\xe2\x80\x94and we crept on, towards Kurtz. But the\r\nsnags were thick, the water was treacherous and shallow, the boiler\r\nseemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it, and thus neither that\r\nfireman nor I had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome fifty miles below the Inner Station we came upon a hut of reeds,\r\nan inclined and melancholy pole, with the unrecognizable tatters of\r\nwhat had been a flag of some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked\r\nwood-pile. This was unexpected. We came to the bank, and on the stack\r\nof firewood found a flat piece of board with some faded pencil-writing\r\non it. When deciphered it said: \xe2\x80\x98Wood for you. Hurry up. Approach\r\ncautiously.\xe2\x80\x99 There was a signature, but it was illegible\xe2\x80\x94not Kurtz\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmuch longer word. \xe2\x80\x98Hurry up.\xe2\x80\x99 Where? Up the river? \xe2\x80\x98Approach\r\ncautiously.\xe2\x80\x99 We had not done so. But the warning could not have been\r\nmeant for the place where it could be only found after approach.\r\nSomething was wrong above. But what\xe2\x80\x94and how much? That was the\r\nquestion. We commented adversely upon the imbecility of that\r\ntelegraphic style. The bush around said nothing, and would not let us\r\nlook very far, either. A torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway\r\nof the hut, and flapped sadly in our faces. The dwelling was\r\ndismantled; but we could see a white man had lived there not very long\r\nago. There remained a rude table\xe2\x80\x94a plank on two posts; a heap of\r\nrubbish reposed in a dark corner, and by the door I picked up a book.\r\nIt had lost its covers, and the pages had been thumbed into a state of\r\nextremely dirty softness; but the back had been lovingly stitched\r\nafresh with white cotton thread, which looked clean yet. It was an\r\nextraordinary find. Its title was, _An Inquiry into some Points of\r\nSeamanship_, by a man Towser, Towson\xe2\x80\x94some such name\xe2\x80\x94Master in his\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s Navy. The matter looked dreary reading enough, with\r\nillustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of figures, and the copy was\r\nsixty years old. I handled this amazing antiquity with the greatest\r\npossible tenderness, lest it should dissolve in my hands. Within,\r\nTowson or Towser was inquiring earnestly into the breaking strain of\r\nships\xe2\x80\x99 chains and tackle, and other such matters. Not a very\r\nenthralling book; but at the first glance you could see there a\r\nsingleness of intention, an honest concern for the right way of going\r\nto work, which made these humble pages, thought out so many years ago,\r\nluminous with another than a professional light. The simple old sailor,\r\nwith his talk of chains and purchases, made me forget the jungle and\r\nthe pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come upon something\r\nunmistakably real. Such a book being there was wonderful enough; but\r\nstill more astounding were the notes pencilled in the margin, and\r\nplainly referring to the text. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe my eyes! They were in\r\ncipher! Yes, it looked like cipher. Fancy a man lugging with him a book\r\nof that description into this nowhere and studying it\xe2\x80\x94and making\r\nnotes\xe2\x80\x94in cipher at that! It was an extravagant mystery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying noise, and when I\r\nlifted my eyes I saw the wood-pile was gone, and the manager, aided by\r\nall the pilgrims, was shouting at me from the riverside. I slipped the\r\nbook into my pocket. I assure you to leave off reading was like tearing\r\nmyself away from the shelter of an old and solid friendship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI started the lame engine ahead. \xe2\x80\x98It must be this miserable\r\ntrader\xe2\x80\x94this intruder,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the manager, looking back malevolently\r\nat the place we had left. \xe2\x80\x98He must be English,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98It will not\r\nsave him from getting into trouble if he is not careful,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered the\r\nmanager darkly. I observed with assumed innocence that no man was safe\r\nfrom trouble in this world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe current was more rapid now, the steamer seemed at her last gasp,\r\nthe stern-wheel flopped languidly, and I caught myself listening on\r\ntiptoe for the next beat of the boat, for in sober truth I expected the\r\nwretched thing to give up every moment. It was like watching the last\r\nflickers of a life. But still we crawled. Sometimes I would pick out a\r\ntree a little way ahead to measure our progress towards Kurtz by, but I\r\nlost it invariably before we got abreast. To keep the eyes so long on\r\none thing was too much for human patience. The manager displayed a\r\nbeautiful resignation. I fretted and fumed and took to arguing with\r\nmyself whether or no I would talk openly with Kurtz; but before I could\r\ncome to any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence,\r\nindeed any action of mine, would be a mere futility. What did it matter\r\nwhat any one knew or ignored? What did it matter who was manager? One\r\ngets sometimes such a flash of insight. The essentials of this affair\r\nlay deep under the surface, beyond my reach, and beyond my power of\r\nmeddling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTowards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight\r\nmiles from Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s station. I wanted to push on; but the manager looked\r\ngrave, and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it\r\nwould be advisable, the sun being very low already, to wait where we\r\nwere till next morning. Moreover, he pointed out that if the warning to\r\napproach cautiously were to be followed, we must approach in\r\ndaylight\xe2\x80\x94not at dusk or in the dark. This was sensible enough. Eight\r\nmiles meant nearly three hours\xe2\x80\x99 steaming for us, and I could also see\r\nsuspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach. Nevertheless, I was\r\nannoyed beyond expression at the delay, and most unreasonably, too,\r\nsince one night more could not matter much after so many months. As we\r\nhad plenty of wood, and caution was the word, I brought up in the\r\nmiddle of the stream. The reach was narrow, straight, with high sides\r\nlike a railway cutting. The dusk came gliding into it long before the\r\nsun had set. The current ran smooth and swift, but a dumb immobility\r\nsat on the banks. The living trees, lashed together by the creepers and\r\nevery living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into\r\nstone, even to the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf. It was not\r\nsleep\xe2\x80\x94it seemed unnatural, like a state of trance. Not the faintest\r\nsound of any kind could be heard. You looked on amazed, and began to\r\nsuspect yourself of being deaf\xe2\x80\x94then the night came suddenly, and struck\r\nyou blind as well. About three in the morning some large fish leaped,\r\nand the loud splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired. When\r\nthe sun rose there was a white fog, very warm and clammy, and more\r\nblinding than the night. It did not shift or drive; it was just there,\r\nstanding all round you like something solid. At eight or nine, perhaps,\r\nit lifted as a shutter lifts. We had a glimpse of the towering\r\nmultitude of trees, of the immense matted jungle, with the blazing\r\nlittle ball of the sun hanging over it\xe2\x80\x94all perfectly still\xe2\x80\x94and then the\r\nwhite shutter came down again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased\r\ngrooves. I ordered the chain, which we had begun to heave in, to be\r\npaid out again. Before it stopped running with a muffled rattle, a cry,\r\na very loud cry, as of infinite desolation, soared slowly in the opaque\r\nair. It ceased. A complaining clamour, modulated in savage discords,\r\nfilled our ears. The sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under\r\nmy cap. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it struck the others: to me it seemed as\r\nthough the mist itself had screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from\r\nall sides at once, did this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise. It\r\nculminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive\r\nshrieking, which stopped short, leaving us stiffened in a variety of\r\nsilly attitudes, and obstinately listening to the nearly as appalling\r\nand excessive silence. \xe2\x80\x98Good God! What is the meaning\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 stammered at my\r\nelbow one of the pilgrims\xe2\x80\x94a little fat man, with sandy hair and red\r\nwhiskers, who wore sidespring boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his\r\nsocks. Two others remained open-mouthed a while minute, then dashed\r\ninto the little cabin, to rush out incontinently and stand darting\r\nscared glances, with Winchesters at \xe2\x80\x98ready\xe2\x80\x99 in their hands. What we\r\ncould see was just the steamer we were on, her outlines blurred as\r\nthough she had been on the point of dissolving, and a misty strip of\r\nwater, perhaps two feet broad, around her\xe2\x80\x94and that was all. The rest of\r\nthe world was nowhere, as far as our eyes and ears were concerned. Just\r\nnowhere. Gone, disappeared; swept off without leaving a whisper or a\r\nshadow behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went forward, and ordered the chain to be hauled in short, so as to\r\nbe ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if\r\nnecessary. \xe2\x80\x98Will they attack?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered an awed voice. \xe2\x80\x98We will be all\r\nbutchered in this fog,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured another. The faces twitched with the\r\nstrain, the hands trembled slightly, the eyes forgot to wink. It was\r\nvery curious to see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of\r\nthe black fellows of our crew, who were as much strangers to that part\r\nof the river as we, though their homes were only eight hundred miles\r\naway. The whites, of course greatly discomposed, had besides a curious\r\nlook of being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row. The others\r\nhad an alert, naturally interested expression; but their faces were\r\nessentially quiet, even those of the one or two who grinned as they\r\nhauled at the chain. Several exchanged short, grunting phrases, which\r\nseemed to settle the matter to their satisfaction. Their headman, a\r\nyoung, broad-chested black, severely draped in dark-blue fringed\r\ncloths, with fierce nostrils and his hair all done up artfully in oily\r\nringlets, stood near me. \xe2\x80\x98Aha!\xe2\x80\x99 I said, just for good fellowship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake. \xe2\x80\x98Catch \xe2\x80\x99im,\xe2\x80\x99 he snapped, with a bloodshot widening of his eyes\r\nand a flash of sharp teeth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98catch \xe2\x80\x99im. Give \xe2\x80\x99im to us.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98To you, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nasked; \xe2\x80\x98what would you do with them?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Eat \xe2\x80\x99im!\xe2\x80\x99 he said curtly, and,\r\nleaning his elbow on the rail, looked out into the fog in a dignified\r\nand profoundly pensive attitude. I would no doubt have been properly\r\nhorrified, had it not occurred to me that he and his chaps must be very\r\nhungry: that they must have been growing increasingly hungry for at\r\nleast this month past. They had been engaged for six months (I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink a single one of them had any clear idea of time, as we at the end\r\nof countless ages have. They still belonged to the beginnings of\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94had no inherited experience to teach them as it were), and of\r\ncourse, as long as there was a piece of paper written over in\r\naccordance with some farcical law or other made down the river, it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t enter anybody\xe2\x80\x99s head to trouble how they would live. Certainly\r\nthey had brought with them some rotten hippo-meat, which couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nlasted very long, anyway, even if the pilgrims hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, in the midst of\r\na shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable quantity of it overboard.\r\nIt looked like a high-handed proceeding; but it was really a case of\r\nlegitimate self-defence. You can\xe2\x80\x99t breathe dead hippo waking, sleeping,\r\nand eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip on\r\nexistence. Besides that, they had given them every week three pieces of\r\nbrass wire, each about nine inches long; and the theory was they were\r\nto buy their provisions with that currency in riverside villages. You\r\ncan see how _that_ worked. There were either no villages, or the people\r\nwere hostile, or the director, who like the rest of us fed out of tins,\r\nwith an occasional old he-goat thrown in, didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to stop the\r\nsteamer for some more or less recondite reason. So, unless they\r\nswallowed the wire itself, or made loops of it to snare the fishes\r\nwith, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what good their extravagant salary could be to them.\r\nI must say it was paid with a regularity worthy of a large and\r\nhonourable trading company. For the rest, the only thing to eat\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nit didn\xe2\x80\x99t look eatable in the least\xe2\x80\x94I saw in their possession was a few\r\nlumps of some stuff like half-cooked dough, of a dirty lavender colour,\r\nthey kept wrapped in leaves, and now and then swallowed a piece of, but\r\nso small that it seemed done more for the looks of the thing than for\r\nany serious purpose of sustenance. Why in the name of all the gnawing\r\ndevils of hunger they didn\xe2\x80\x99t go for us\xe2\x80\x94they were thirty to five\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhave a good tuck-in for once, amazes me now when I think of it. They\r\nwere big powerful men, with not much capacity to weigh the\r\nconsequences, with courage, with strength, even yet, though their skins\r\nwere no longer glossy and their muscles no longer hard. And I saw that\r\nsomething restraining, one of those human secrets that baffle\r\nprobability, had come into play there. I looked at them with a swift\r\nquickening of interest\xe2\x80\x94not because it occurred to me I might be eaten\r\nby them before very long, though I own to you that just then I\r\nperceived\xe2\x80\x94in a new light, as it were\xe2\x80\x94how unwholesome the pilgrims\r\nlooked, and I hoped, yes, I positively hoped, that my aspect was not\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94what shall I say?\xe2\x80\x94so\xe2\x80\x94unappetizing: a touch of fantastic vanity which\r\nfitted well with the dream-sensation that pervaded all my days at that\r\ntime. Perhaps I had a little fever, too. One can\xe2\x80\x99t live with one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinger everlastingly on one\xe2\x80\x99s pulse. I had often \xe2\x80\x98a little fever,\xe2\x80\x99 or a\r\nlittle touch of other things\xe2\x80\x94the playful paw-strokes of the wilderness,\r\nthe preliminary trifling before the more serious onslaught which came\r\nin due course. Yes; I looked at them as you would on any human being,\r\nwith a curiosity of their impulses, motives, capacities, weaknesses,\r\nwhen brought to the test of an inexorable physical necessity.\r\nRestraint! What possible restraint? Was it superstition, disgust,\r\npatience, fear\xe2\x80\x94or some kind of primitive honour? No fear can stand up\r\nto hunger, no patience can wear it out, disgust simply does not exist\r\nwhere hunger is; and as to superstition, beliefs, and what you may call\r\nprinciples, they are less than chaff in a breeze. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know the\r\ndevilry of lingering starvation, its exasperating torment, its black\r\nthoughts, its sombre and brooding ferocity? Well, I do. It takes a man\r\nall his inborn strength to fight hunger properly. It\xe2\x80\x99s really easier to\r\nface bereavement, dishonour, and the perdition of one\xe2\x80\x99s soul\xe2\x80\x94than this\r\nkind of prolonged hunger. Sad, but true. And these chaps, too, had no\r\nearthly reason for any kind of scruple. Restraint! I would just as soon\r\nhave expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst the corpses of a\r\nbattlefield. But there was the fact facing me\xe2\x80\x94the fact dazzling, to be\r\nseen, like the foam on the depths of the sea, like a ripple on an\r\nunfathomable enigma, a mystery greater\xe2\x80\x94when I thought of it\xe2\x80\x94than the\r\ncurious, inexplicable note of desperate grief in this savage clamour\r\nthat had swept by us on the river-bank, behind the blind whiteness of\r\nthe fog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo pilgrims were quarrelling in hurried whispers as to which bank.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Left.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98no, no; how can you? Right, right, of course.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98It is very\r\nserious,\xe2\x80\x99 said the manager\xe2\x80\x99s voice behind me; \xe2\x80\x98I would be desolated if\r\nanything should happen to Mr. Kurtz before we came up.\xe2\x80\x99 I looked at\r\nhim, and had not the slightest doubt he was sincere. He was just the\r\nkind of man who would wish to preserve appearances. That was his\r\nrestraint. But when he muttered something about going on at once, I did\r\nnot even take the trouble to answer him. I knew, and he knew, that it\r\nwas impossible. Were we to let go our hold of the bottom, we would be\r\nabsolutely in the air\xe2\x80\x94in space. We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to tell where we\r\nwere going to\xe2\x80\x94whether up or down stream, or across\xe2\x80\x94till we fetched\r\nagainst one bank or the other\xe2\x80\x94and then we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know at first which\r\nit was. Of course I made no move. I had no mind for a smash-up. You\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck. Whether we\r\ndrowned at once or not, we were sure to perish speedily in one way or\r\nanother. \xe2\x80\x98I authorize you to take all the risks,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, after a\r\nshort silence. \xe2\x80\x98I refuse to take any,\xe2\x80\x99 I said shortly; which was just\r\nthe answer he expected, though its tone might have surprised him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I must defer to your judgment. You are captain,\xe2\x80\x99 he said with\r\nmarked civility. I turned my shoulder to him in sign of my\r\nappreciation, and looked into the fog. How long would it last? It was\r\nthe most hopeless lookout. The approach to this Kurtz grubbing for\r\nivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many dangers as though he\r\nhad been an enchanted princess sleeping in a fabulous castle. \xe2\x80\x98Will\r\nthey attack, do you think?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the manager, in a confidential tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not think they would attack, for several obvious reasons. The\r\nthick fog was one. If they left the bank in their canoes they would get\r\nlost in it, as we would be if we attempted to move. Still, I had also\r\njudged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrable\xe2\x80\x94and yet eyes were in\r\nit, eyes that had seen us. The riverside bushes were certainly very\r\nthick; but the undergrowth behind was evidently penetrable. However,\r\nduring the short lift I had seen no canoes anywhere in the\r\nreach\xe2\x80\x94certainly not abreast of the steamer. But what made the idea of\r\nattack inconceivable to me was the nature of the noise\xe2\x80\x94of the cries we\r\nhad heard. They had not the fierce character boding immediate hostile\r\nintention. Unexpected, wild, and violent as they had been, they had\r\ngiven me an irresistible impression of sorrow. The glimpse of the\r\nsteamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained\r\ngrief. The danger, if any, I expounded, was from our proximity to a\r\ngreat human passion let loose. Even extreme grief may ultimately vent\r\nitself in violence\xe2\x80\x94but more generally takes the form of apathy....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have seen the pilgrims stare! They had no heart to grin, or\r\neven to revile me: but I believe they thought me gone mad\xe2\x80\x94with fright,\r\nmaybe. I delivered a regular lecture. My dear boys, it was no good\r\nbothering. Keep a lookout? Well, you may guess I watched the fog for\r\nthe signs of lifting as a cat watches a mouse; but for anything else\r\nour eyes were of no more use to us than if we had been buried miles\r\ndeep in a heap of cotton-wool. It felt like it, too\xe2\x80\x94choking, warm,\r\nstifling. Besides, all I said, though it sounded extravagant, was\r\nabsolutely true to fact. What we afterwards alluded to as an attack was\r\nreally an attempt at repulse. The action was very far from being\r\naggressive\xe2\x80\x94it was not even defensive, in the usual sense: it was\r\nundertaken under the stress of desperation, and in its essence was\r\npurely protective.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt developed itself, I should say, two hours after the fog lifted, and\r\nits commencement was at a spot, roughly speaking, about a mile and a\r\nhalf below Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s station. We had just floundered and flopped round a\r\nbend, when I saw an islet, a mere grassy hummock of bright green, in\r\nthe middle of the stream. It was the only thing of the kind; but as we\r\nopened the reach more, I perceived it was the head of a long sand-bank,\r\nor rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of\r\nthe river. They were discoloured, just awash, and the whole lot was\r\nseen just under the water, exactly as a man\xe2\x80\x99s backbone is seen running\r\ndown the middle of his back under the skin. Now, as far as I did see, I\r\ncould go to the right or to the left of this. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know either\r\nchannel, of course. The banks looked pretty well alike, the depth\r\nappeared the same; but as I had been informed the station was on the\r\nwest side, I naturally headed for the western passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo sooner had we fairly entered it than I became aware it was much\r\nnarrower than I had supposed. To the left of us there was the long\r\nuninterrupted shoal, and to the right a high, steep bank heavily\r\novergrown with bushes. Above the bush the trees stood in serried ranks.\r\nThe twigs overhung the current thickly, and from distance to distance a\r\nlarge limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream. It was then\r\nwell on in the afternoon, the face of the forest was gloomy, and a\r\nbroad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water. In this shadow\r\nwe steamed up\xe2\x80\x94very slowly, as you may imagine. I sheered her well\r\ninshore\xe2\x80\x94the water being deepest near the bank, as the sounding-pole\r\ninformed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding in the bows just\r\nbelow me. This steamboat was exactly like a decked scow. On the deck,\r\nthere were two little teakwood houses, with doors and windows. The\r\nboiler was in the fore-end, and the machinery right astern. Over the\r\nwhole there was a light roof, supported on stanchions. The funnel\r\nprojected through that roof, and in front of the funnel a small cabin\r\nbuilt of light planks served for a pilot-house. It contained a couch,\r\ntwo camp-stools, a loaded Martini-Henry leaning in one corner, a tiny\r\ntable, and the steering-wheel. It had a wide door in front and a broad\r\nshutter at each side. All these were always thrown open, of course. I\r\nspent my days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that roof,\r\nbefore the door. At night I slept, or tried to, on the couch. An\r\nathletic black belonging to some coast tribe and educated by my poor\r\npredecessor, was the helmsman. He sported a pair of brass earrings,\r\nwore a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and thought all\r\nthe world of himself. He was the most unstable kind of fool I had ever\r\nseen. He steered with no end of a swagger while you were by; but if he\r\nlost sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject funk, and\r\nwould let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was looking down at the sounding-pole, and feeling much annoyed to\r\nsee at each try a little more of it stick out of that river, when I saw\r\nmy poleman give up on the business suddenly, and stretch himself flat\r\non the deck, without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in. He\r\nkept hold on it though, and it trailed in the water. At the same time\r\nthe fireman, whom I could also see below me, sat down abruptly before\r\nhis furnace and ducked his head. I was amazed. Then I had to look at\r\nthe river mighty quick, because there was a snag in the fairway.\r\nSticks, little sticks, were flying about\xe2\x80\x94thick: they were whizzing\r\nbefore my nose, dropping below me, striking behind me against my\r\npilot-house. All this time the river, the shore, the woods, were very\r\nquiet\xe2\x80\x94perfectly quiet. I could only hear the heavy splashing thump of\r\nthe stern-wheel and the patter of these things. We cleared the snag\r\nclumsily. Arrows, by Jove! We were being shot at! I stepped in quickly\r\nto close the shutter on the landside. That fool-helmsman, his hands on\r\nthe spokes, was lifting his knees high, stamping his feet, champing his\r\nmouth, like a reined-in horse. Confound him! And we were staggering\r\nwithin ten feet of the bank. I had to lean right out to swing the heavy\r\nshutter, and I saw a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own,\r\nlooking at me very fierce and steady; and then suddenly, as though a\r\nveil had been removed from my eyes, I made out, deep in the tangled\r\ngloom, naked breasts, arms, legs, glaring eyes\xe2\x80\x94the bush was swarming\r\nwith human limbs in movement, glistening of bronze colour. The twigs\r\nshook, swayed, and rustled, the arrows flew out of them, and then the\r\nshutter came to. \xe2\x80\x98Steer her straight,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to the helmsman. He held\r\nhis head rigid, face forward; but his eyes rolled, he kept on lifting\r\nand setting down his feet gently, his mouth foamed a little. \xe2\x80\x98Keep\r\nquiet!\xe2\x80\x99 I said in a fury. I might just as well have ordered a tree not\r\nto sway in the wind. I darted out. Below me there was a great scuffle\r\nof feet on the iron deck; confused exclamations; a voice screamed, \xe2\x80\x98Can\r\nyou turn back?\xe2\x80\x99 I caught sight of a V-shaped ripple on the water ahead.\r\nWhat? Another snag! A fusillade burst out under my feet. The pilgrims\r\nhad opened with their Winchesters, and were simply squirting lead into\r\nthat bush. A deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward.\r\nI swore at it. Now I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the ripple or the snag either. I\r\nstood in the doorway, peering, and the arrows came in swarms. They\r\nmight have been poisoned, but they looked as though they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill\r\na cat. The bush began to howl. Our wood-cutters raised a warlike whoop;\r\nthe report of a rifle just at my back deafened me. I glanced over my\r\nshoulder, and the pilot-house was yet full of noise and smoke when I\r\nmade a dash at the wheel. The fool-nigger had dropped everything, to\r\nthrow the shutter open and let off that Martini-Henry. He stood before\r\nthe wide opening, glaring, and I yelled at him to come back, while I\r\nstraightened the sudden twist out of that steamboat. There was no room\r\nto turn even if I had wanted to, the snag was somewhere very near ahead\r\nin that confounded smoke, there was no time to lose, so I just crowded\r\nher into the bank\xe2\x80\x94right into the bank, where I knew the water was deep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs\r\nand flying leaves. The fusillade below stopped short, as I had foreseen\r\nit would when the squirts got empty. I threw my head back to a glinting\r\nwhizz that traversed the pilot-house, in at one shutter-hole and out at\r\nthe other. Looking past that mad helmsman, who was shaking the empty\r\nrifle and yelling at the shore, I saw vague forms of men running bent\r\ndouble, leaping, gliding, distinct, incomplete, evanescent. Something\r\nbig appeared in the air before the shutter, the rifle went overboard,\r\nand the man stepped back swiftly, looked at me over his shoulder in an\r\nextraordinary, profound, familiar manner, and fell upon my feet. The\r\nside of his head hit the wheel twice, and the end of what appeared a\r\nlong cane clattered round and knocked over a little camp-stool. It\r\nlooked as though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had\r\nlost his balance in the effort. The thin smoke had blown away, we were\r\nclear of the snag, and looking ahead I could see that in another\r\nhundred yards or so I would be free to sheer off, away from the bank;\r\nbut my feet felt so very warm and wet that I had to look down. The man\r\nhad rolled on his back and stared straight up at me; both his hands\r\nclutched that cane. It was the shaft of a spear that, either thrown or\r\nlunged through the opening, had caught him in the side, just below the\r\nribs; the blade had gone in out of sight, after making a frightful\r\ngash; my shoes were full; a pool of blood lay very still, gleaming\r\ndark-red under the wheel; his eyes shone with an amazing lustre. The\r\nfusillade burst out again. He looked at me anxiously, gripping the\r\nspear like something precious, with an air of being afraid I would try\r\nto take it away from him. I had to make an effort to free my eyes from\r\nhis gaze and attend to the steering. With one hand I felt above my head\r\nfor the line of the steam whistle, and jerked out screech after screech\r\nhurriedly. The tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly,\r\nand then from the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and\r\nprolonged wail of mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to\r\nfollow the flight of the last hope from the earth. There was a great\r\ncommotion in the bush; the shower of arrows stopped, a few dropping\r\nshots rang out sharply\xe2\x80\x94then silence, in which the languid beat of the\r\nstern-wheel came plainly to my ears. I put the helm hard a-starboard at\r\nthe moment when the pilgrim in pink pyjamas, very hot and agitated,\r\nappeared in the doorway. \xe2\x80\x98The manager sends me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 he began in an\r\nofficial tone, and stopped short. \xe2\x80\x98Good God!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, glaring at the\r\nwounded man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe two whites stood over him, and his lustrous and inquiring glance\r\nenveloped us both. I declare it looked as though he would presently put\r\nto us some questions in an understandable language; but he died without\r\nuttering a sound, without moving a limb, without twitching a muscle.\r\nOnly in the very last moment, as though in response to some sign we\r\ncould not see, to some whisper we could not hear, he frowned heavily,\r\nand that frown gave to his black death-mask an inconceivably sombre,\r\nbrooding, and menacing expression. The lustre of inquiring glance faded\r\nswiftly into vacant glassiness. \xe2\x80\x98Can you steer?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked the agent\r\neagerly. He looked very dubious; but I made a grab at his arm, and he\r\nunderstood at once I meant him to steer whether or no. To tell you the\r\ntruth, I was morbidly anxious to change my shoes and socks. \xe2\x80\x98He is\r\ndead,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the fellow, immensely impressed. \xe2\x80\x98No doubt about it,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid I, tugging like mad at the shoe-laces. \xe2\x80\x98And by the way, I suppose\r\nMr. Kurtz is dead as well by this time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the moment that was the dominant thought. There was a sense of\r\nextreme disappointment, as though I had found out I had been striving\r\nafter something altogether without a substance. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been\r\nmore disgusted if I had travelled all this way for the sole purpose of\r\ntalking with Mr. Kurtz. Talking with... I flung one shoe overboard, and\r\nbecame aware that that was exactly what I had been looking forward to\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ntalk with Kurtz. I made the strange discovery that I had never imagined\r\nhim as doing, you know, but as discoursing. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say to myself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now I will never see him,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Now I will never shake him by the\r\nhand,\xe2\x80\x99 but, \xe2\x80\x98Now I will never hear him.\xe2\x80\x99 The man presented himself as a\r\nvoice. Not of course that I did not connect him with some sort of\r\naction. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I been told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration\r\nthat he had collected, bartered, swindled, or stolen more ivory than\r\nall the other agents together? That was not the point. The point was in\r\nhis being a gifted creature, and that of all his gifts the one that\r\nstood out preeminently, that carried with it a sense of real presence,\r\nwas his ability to talk, his words\xe2\x80\x94the gift of expression, the\r\nbewildering, the illuminating, the most exalted and the most\r\ncontemptible, the pulsating stream of light, or the deceitful flow from\r\nthe heart of an impenetrable darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other shoe went flying unto the devil-god of that river. I\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x98By Jove! it\xe2\x80\x99s all over. We are too late; he has vanished\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ngift has vanished, by means of some spear, arrow, or club. I will never\r\nhear that chap speak after all\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and my sorrow had a startling\r\nextravagance of emotion, even such as I had noticed in the howling\r\nsorrow of these savages in the bush. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have felt more of\r\nlonely desolation somehow, had I been robbed of a belief or had missed\r\nmy destiny in life.... Why do you sigh in this beastly way, somebody?\r\nAbsurd? Well, absurd. Good Lord! mustn\xe2\x80\x99t a man ever\xe2\x80\x94Here, give me some\r\ntobacco.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of profound stillness, then a match flared, and\r\nMarlow\xe2\x80\x99s lean face appeared, worn, hollow, with downward folds and\r\ndropped eyelids, with an aspect of concentrated attention; and as he\r\ntook vigorous draws at his pipe, it seemed to retreat and advance out\r\nof the night in the regular flicker of tiny flame. The match went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsurd!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the worst of trying to tell.... Here you\r\nall are, each moored with two good addresses, like a hulk with two\r\nanchors, a butcher round one corner, a policeman round another,\r\nexcellent appetites, and temperature normal\xe2\x80\x94you hear\xe2\x80\x94normal from year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nend to year\xe2\x80\x99s end. And you say, Absurd! Absurd be\xe2\x80\x94exploded! Absurd! My\r\ndear boys, what can you expect from a man who out of sheer nervousness\r\nhad just flung overboard a pair of new shoes! Now I think of it, it is\r\namazing I did not shed tears. I am, upon the whole, proud of my\r\nfortitude. I was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the\r\ninestimable privilege of listening to the gifted Kurtz. Of course I was\r\nwrong. The privilege was waiting for me. Oh, yes, I heard more than\r\nenough. And I was right, too. A voice. He was very little more than a\r\nvoice. And I heard\xe2\x80\x94him\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x94this voice\xe2\x80\x94other voices\xe2\x80\x94all of them were so\r\nlittle more than voices\xe2\x80\x94and the memory of that time itself lingers\r\naround me, impalpable, like a dying vibration of one immense jabber,\r\nsilly, atrocious, sordid, savage, or simply mean, without any kind of\r\nsense. Voices, voices\xe2\x80\x94even the girl herself\xe2\x80\x94now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a long time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, suddenly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGirl! What? Did I mention a girl? Oh, she is out of it\xe2\x80\x94completely.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x94the women, I mean\xe2\x80\x94are out of it\xe2\x80\x94should be out of it. We must help\r\nthem to stay in that beautiful world of their own, lest ours gets\r\nworse. Oh, she had to be out of it. You should have heard the\r\ndisinterred body of Mr. Kurtz saying, \xe2\x80\x98My Intended.\xe2\x80\x99 You would have\r\nperceived directly then how completely she was out of it. And the lofty\r\nfrontal bone of Mr. Kurtz! They say the hair goes on growing sometimes,\r\nbut this\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94specimen, was impressively bald. The wilderness had patted\r\nhim on the head, and, behold, it was like a ball\xe2\x80\x94an ivory ball; it had\r\ncaressed him, and\xe2\x80\x94lo!\xe2\x80\x94he had withered; it had taken him, loved him,\r\nembraced him, got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed his\r\nsoul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish\r\ninitiation. He was its spoiled and pampered favourite. Ivory? I should\r\nthink so. Heaps of it, stacks of it. The old mud shanty was bursting\r\nwith it. You would think there was not a single tusk left either above\r\nor below the ground in the whole country. \xe2\x80\x98Mostly fossil,\xe2\x80\x99 the manager\r\nhad remarked, disparagingly. It was no more fossil than I am; but they\r\ncall it fossil when it is dug up. It appears these niggers do bury the\r\ntusks sometimes\xe2\x80\x94but evidently they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bury this parcel deep\r\nenough to save the gifted Mr. Kurtz from his fate. We filled the\r\nsteamboat with it, and had to pile a lot on the deck. Thus he could see\r\nand enjoy as long as he could see, because the appreciation of this\r\nfavour had remained with him to the last. You should have heard him\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x98My ivory.\xe2\x80\x99 Oh, yes, I heard him. \xe2\x80\x98My Intended, my ivory, my\r\nstation, my river, my\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 everything belonged to him. It made me hold my\r\nbreath in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious\r\npeal of laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places.\r\nEverything belonged to him\xe2\x80\x94but that was a trifle. The thing was to know\r\nwhat he belonged to, how many powers of darkness claimed him for their\r\nown. That was the reflection that made you creepy all over. It was\r\nimpossible\xe2\x80\x94it was not good for one either\xe2\x80\x94trying to imagine. He had\r\ntaken a high seat amongst the devils of the land\xe2\x80\x94I mean literally. You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t understand. How could you?\xe2\x80\x94with solid pavement under your feet,\r\nsurrounded by kind neighbours ready to cheer you or to fall on you,\r\nstepping delicately between the butcher and the policeman, in the holy\r\nterror of scandal and gallows and lunatic asylums\xe2\x80\x94how can you imagine\r\nwhat particular region of the first ages a man\xe2\x80\x99s untrammelled feet may\r\ntake him into by the way of solitude\xe2\x80\x94utter solitude without a\r\npoliceman\xe2\x80\x94by the way of silence\xe2\x80\x94utter silence, where no warning voice\r\nof a kind neighbour can be heard whispering of public opinion? These\r\nlittle things make all the great difference. When they are gone you\r\nmust fall back upon your own innate strength, upon your own capacity\r\nfor faithfulness. Of course you may be too much of a fool to go\r\nwrong\xe2\x80\x94too dull even to know you are being assaulted by the powers of\r\ndarkness. I take it, no fool ever made a bargain for his soul with the\r\ndevil; the fool is too much of a fool, or the devil too much of a\r\ndevil\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which. Or you may be such a thunderingly exalted\r\ncreature as to be altogether deaf and blind to anything but heavenly\r\nsights and sounds. Then the earth for you is only a standing place\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhether to be like this is your loss or your gain I won\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to\r\nsay. But most of us are neither one nor the other. The earth for us is\r\na place to live in, where we must put up with sights, with sounds, with\r\nsmells, too, by Jove!\xe2\x80\x94breathe dead hippo, so to speak, and not be\r\ncontaminated. And there, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? Your strength comes in, the\r\nfaith in your ability for the digging of unostentatious holes to bury\r\nthe stuff in\xe2\x80\x94your power of devotion, not to yourself, but to an\r\nobscure, back-breaking business. And that\xe2\x80\x99s difficult enough. Mind, I\r\nam not trying to excuse or even explain\xe2\x80\x94I am trying to account to\r\nmyself for\xe2\x80\x94for\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x94for the shade of Mr. Kurtz. This initiated\r\nwraith from the back of Nowhere honoured me with its amazing confidence\r\nbefore it vanished altogether. This was because it could speak English\r\nto me. The original Kurtz had been educated partly in England, and\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nhe was good enough to say himself\xe2\x80\x94his sympathies were in the right\r\nplace. His mother was half-English, his father was half-French. All\r\nEurope contributed to the making of Kurtz; and by and by I learned\r\nthat, most appropriately, the International Society for the Suppression\r\nof Savage Customs had intrusted him with the making of a report, for\r\nits future guidance. And he had written it, too. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nread it. It was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence, but too\r\nhigh-strung, I think. Seventeen pages of close writing he had found\r\ntime for! But this must have been before his\xe2\x80\x94let us say\xe2\x80\x94nerves, went\r\nwrong, and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending with\r\nunspeakable rites, which\xe2\x80\x94as far as I reluctantly gathered from what I\r\nheard at various times\xe2\x80\x94were offered up to him\xe2\x80\x94do you understand?\xe2\x80\x94to Mr.\r\nKurtz himself. But it was a beautiful piece of writing. The opening\r\nparagraph, however, in the light of later information, strikes me now\r\nas ominous. He began with the argument that we whites, from the point\r\nof development we had arrived at, \xe2\x80\x98must necessarily appear to them\r\n[savages] in the nature of supernatural beings\xe2\x80\x94we approach them with\r\nthe might of a deity,\xe2\x80\x99 and so on, and so on. \xe2\x80\x98By the simple exercise of\r\nour will we can exert a power for good practically unbounded,\xe2\x80\x99 etc.,\r\netc. From that point he soared and took me with him. The peroration was\r\nmagnificent, though difficult to remember, you know. It gave me the\r\nnotion of an exotic Immensity ruled by an august Benevolence. It made\r\nme tingle with enthusiasm. This was the unbounded power of eloquence\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94of burning noble words. There were no practical hints to\r\ninterrupt the magic current of phrases, unless a kind of note at the\r\nfoot of the last page, scrawled evidently much later, in an unsteady\r\nhand, may be regarded as the exposition of a method. It was very\r\nsimple, and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic\r\nsentiment it blazed at you, luminous and terrifying, like a flash of\r\nlightning in a serene sky: \xe2\x80\x98Exterminate all the brutes!\xe2\x80\x99 The curious\r\npart was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable\r\npostscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense came to himself, he\r\nrepeatedly entreated me to take good care of \xe2\x80\x98my pamphlet\xe2\x80\x99 (he called\r\nit), as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his\r\ncareer. I had full information about all these things, and, besides, as\r\nit turned out, I was to have the care of his memory. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done enough\r\nfor it to give me the indisputable right to lay it, if I choose, for an\r\neverlasting rest in the dust-bin of progress, amongst all the sweepings\r\nand, figuratively speaking, all the dead cats of civilization. But\r\nthen, you see, I can\xe2\x80\x99t choose. He won\xe2\x80\x99t be forgotten. Whatever he was,\r\nhe was not common. He had the power to charm or frighten rudimentary\r\nsouls into an aggravated witch-dance in his honour; he could also fill\r\nthe small souls of the pilgrims with bitter misgivings: he had one\r\ndevoted friend at least, and he had conquered one soul in the world\r\nthat was neither rudimentary nor tainted with self-seeking. No; I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforget him, though I am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly\r\nworth the life we lost in getting to him. I missed my late helmsman\r\nawfully\xe2\x80\x94I missed him even while his body was still lying in the\r\npilot-house. Perhaps you will think it passing strange this regret for\r\na savage who was no more account than a grain of sand in a black\r\nSahara. Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, he had done something, he had steered; for\r\nmonths I had him at my back\xe2\x80\x94a help\xe2\x80\x94an instrument. It was a kind of\r\npartnership. He steered for me\xe2\x80\x94I had to look after him, I worried about\r\nhis deficiencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created, of which I\r\nonly became aware when it was suddenly broken. And the intimate\r\nprofundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt remains to\r\nthis day in my memory\xe2\x80\x94like a claim of distant kinship affirmed in a\r\nsupreme moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fool! If he had only left that shutter alone. He had no\r\nrestraint, no restraint\xe2\x80\x94just like Kurtz\xe2\x80\x94a tree swayed by the wind. As\r\nsoon as I had put on a dry pair of slippers, I dragged him out, after\r\nfirst jerking the spear out of his side, which operation I confess I\r\nperformed with my eyes shut tight. His heels leaped together over the\r\nlittle doorstep; his shoulders were pressed to my breast; I hugged him\r\nfrom behind desperately. Oh! he was heavy, heavy; heavier than any man\r\non earth, I should imagine. Then without more ado I tipped him\r\noverboard. The current snatched him as though he had been a wisp of\r\ngrass, and I saw the body roll over twice before I lost sight of it for\r\never. All the pilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the\r\nawning-deck about the pilot-house, chattering at each other like a\r\nflock of excited magpies, and there was a scandalized murmur at my\r\nheartless promptitude. What they wanted to keep that body hanging about\r\nfor I can\xe2\x80\x99t guess. Embalm it, maybe. But I had also heard another, and\r\na very ominous, murmur on the deck below. My friends the wood-cutters\r\nwere likewise scandalized, and with a better show of reason\xe2\x80\x94though I\r\nadmit that the reason itself was quite inadmissible. Oh, quite! I had\r\nmade up my mind that if my late helmsman was to be eaten, the fishes\r\nalone should have him. He had been a very second-rate helmsman while\r\nalive, but now he was dead he might have become a first-class\r\ntemptation, and possibly cause some startling trouble. Besides, I was\r\nanxious to take the wheel, the man in pink pyjamas showing himself a\r\nhopeless duffer at the business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis I did directly the simple funeral was over. We were going\r\nhalf-speed, keeping right in the middle of the stream, and I listened\r\nto the talk about me. They had given up Kurtz, they had given up the\r\nstation; Kurtz was dead, and the station had been burnt\xe2\x80\x94and so on\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nso on. The red-haired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that\r\nat least this poor Kurtz had been properly avenged. \xe2\x80\x98Say! We must have\r\nmade a glorious slaughter of them in the bush. Eh? What do you think?\r\nSay?\xe2\x80\x99 He positively danced, the bloodthirsty little gingery beggar. And\r\nhe had nearly fainted when he saw the wounded man! I could not help\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98You made a glorious lot of smoke, anyhow.\xe2\x80\x99 I had seen, from\r\nthe way the tops of the bushes rustled and flew, that almost all the\r\nshots had gone too high. You can\xe2\x80\x99t hit anything unless you take aim and\r\nfire from the shoulder; but these chaps fired from the hip with their\r\neyes shut. The retreat, I maintained\xe2\x80\x94and I was right\xe2\x80\x94was caused by the\r\nscreeching of the steam whistle. Upon this they forgot Kurtz, and began\r\nto howl at me with indignant protests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe manager stood by the wheel murmuring confidentially about the\r\nnecessity of getting well away down the river before dark at all\r\nevents, when I saw in the distance a clearing on the riverside and the\r\noutlines of some sort of building. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. He clapped\r\nhis hands in wonder. \xe2\x80\x98The station!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried. I edged in at once, still\r\ngoing half-speed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough my glasses I saw the slope of a hill interspersed with rare\r\ntrees and perfectly free from undergrowth. A long decaying building on\r\nthe summit was half buried in the high grass; the large holes in the\r\npeaked roof gaped black from afar; the jungle and the woods made a\r\nbackground. There was no enclosure or fence of any kind; but there had\r\nbeen one apparently, for near the house half-a-dozen slim posts\r\nremained in a row, roughly trimmed, and with their upper ends\r\nornamented with round carved balls. The rails, or whatever there had\r\nbeen between, had disappeared. Of course the forest surrounded all\r\nthat. The river-bank was clear, and on the waterside I saw a white man\r\nunder a hat like a cart-wheel beckoning persistently with his whole\r\narm. Examining the edge of the forest above and below, I was almost\r\ncertain I could see movements\xe2\x80\x94human forms gliding here and there. I\r\nsteamed past prudently, then stopped the engines and let her drift\r\ndown. The man on the shore began to shout, urging us to land. \xe2\x80\x98We have\r\nbeen attacked,\xe2\x80\x99 screamed the manager. \xe2\x80\x98I know\xe2\x80\x94I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyelled back the other, as cheerful as you please. \xe2\x80\x98Come along. It\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nright. I am glad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis aspect reminded me of something I had seen\xe2\x80\x94something funny I had\r\nseen somewhere. As I manoeuvred to get alongside, I was asking myself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does this fellow look like?\xe2\x80\x99 Suddenly I got it. He looked like a\r\nharlequin. His clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown\r\nholland probably, but it was covered with patches all over, with bright\r\npatches, blue, red, and yellow\xe2\x80\x94patches on the back, patches on the\r\nfront, patches on elbows, on knees; coloured binding around his jacket,\r\nscarlet edging at the bottom of his trousers; and the sunshine made him\r\nlook extremely gay and wonderfully neat withal, because you could see\r\nhow beautifully all this patching had been done. A beardless, boyish\r\nface, very fair, no features to speak of, nose peeling, little blue\r\neyes, smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance\r\nlike sunshine and shadow on a wind-swept plain. \xe2\x80\x98Look out, captain!\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncried; \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s a snag lodged in here last night.\xe2\x80\x99 What! Another snag?\r\nI confess I swore shamefully. I had nearly holed my cripple, to finish\r\noff that charming trip. The harlequin on the bank turned his little\r\npug-nose up to me. \xe2\x80\x98You English?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, all smiles. \xe2\x80\x98Are you?\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nshouted from the wheel. The smiles vanished, and he shook his head as\r\nif sorry for my disappointment. Then he brightened up. \xe2\x80\x98Never mind!\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncried encouragingly. \xe2\x80\x98Are we in time?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98He is up there,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nreplied, with a toss of the head up the hill, and becoming gloomy all\r\nof a sudden. His face was like the autumn sky, overcast one moment and\r\nbright the next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the manager, escorted by the pilgrims, all of them armed to the\r\nteeth, had gone to the house this chap came on board. \xe2\x80\x98I say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike this. These natives are in the bush,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. He assured me\r\nearnestly it was all right. \xe2\x80\x98They are simple people,\xe2\x80\x99 he added; \xe2\x80\x98well,\r\nI am glad you came. It took me all my time to keep them off.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But you\r\nsaid it was all right,\xe2\x80\x99 I cried. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, they meant no harm,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; and\r\nas I stared he corrected himself, \xe2\x80\x98Not exactly.\xe2\x80\x99 Then vivaciously, \xe2\x80\x98My\r\nfaith, your pilot-house wants a clean-up!\xe2\x80\x99 In the next breath he\r\nadvised me to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in\r\ncase of any trouble. \xe2\x80\x98One good screech will do more for you than all\r\nyour rifles. They are simple people,\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated. He rattled away at\r\nsuch a rate he quite overwhelmed me. He seemed to be trying to make up\r\nfor lots of silence, and actually hinted, laughing, that such was the\r\ncase. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you talk with Mr. Kurtz?\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t talk with\r\nthat man\xe2\x80\x94you listen to him,\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed with severe exaltation. \xe2\x80\x98But\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 He waved his arm, and in the twinkling of an eye was in the\r\nuttermost depths of despondency. In a moment he came up again with a\r\njump, possessed himself of both my hands, shook them continuously,\r\nwhile he gabbled: \xe2\x80\x98Brother sailor... honour... pleasure... delight...\r\nintroduce myself... Russian... son of an arch-priest... Government of\r\nTambov... What? Tobacco! English tobacco; the excellent English\r\ntobacco! Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s brotherly. Smoke? Where\xe2\x80\x99s a sailor that does not\r\nsmoke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pipe soothed him, and gradually I made out he had run away from\r\nschool, had gone to sea in a Russian ship; ran away again; served some\r\ntime in English ships; was now reconciled with the arch-priest. He made\r\na point of that. \xe2\x80\x98But when one is young one must see things, gather\r\nexperience, ideas; enlarge the mind.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Here!\xe2\x80\x99 I interrupted. \xe2\x80\x98You can\r\nnever tell! Here I met Mr. Kurtz,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, youthfully solemn and\r\nreproachful. I held my tongue after that. It appears he had persuaded a\r\nDutch trading-house on the coast to fit him out with stores and goods,\r\nand had started for the interior with a light heart and no more idea of\r\nwhat would happen to him than a baby. He had been wandering about that\r\nriver for nearly two years alone, cut off from everybody and\r\neverything. \xe2\x80\x98I am not so young as I look. I am twenty-five,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At first old Van Shuyten would tell me to go to the devil,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nnarrated with keen enjoyment; \xe2\x80\x98but I stuck to him, and talked and\r\ntalked, till at last he got afraid I would talk the hind-leg off his\r\nfavourite dog, so he gave me some cheap things and a few guns, and told\r\nme he hoped he would never see my face again. Good old Dutchman, Van\r\nShuyten. I\xe2\x80\x99ve sent him one small lot of ivory a year ago, so that he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t call me a little thief when I get back. I hope he got it. And for\r\nthe rest I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I had some wood stacked for you. That was my old\r\nhouse. Did you see?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave him Towson\xe2\x80\x99s book. He made as though he would kiss me, but\r\nrestrained himself. \xe2\x80\x98The only book I had left, and I thought I had lost\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, looking at it ecstatically. \xe2\x80\x98So many accidents happen to\r\na man going about alone, you know. Canoes get upset sometimes\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsometimes you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to clear out so quick when the people get angry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe thumbed the pages. \xe2\x80\x98You made notes in Russian?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. He nodded.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought they were written in cipher,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. He laughed, then\r\nbecame serious. \xe2\x80\x98I had lots of trouble to keep these people off,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x98Did they want to kill you?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, and\r\nchecked himself. \xe2\x80\x98Why did they attack us?\xe2\x80\x99 I pursued. He hesitated,\r\nthen said shamefacedly, \xe2\x80\x98They don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to go.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsaid curiously. He nodded a nod full of mystery and wisdom. \xe2\x80\x98I tell\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, \xe2\x80\x98this man has enlarged my mind.\xe2\x80\x99 He opened his arms\r\nwide, staring at me with his little blue eyes that were perfectly\r\nround.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked at him, lost in astonishment. There he was before me, in\r\nmotley, as though he had absconded from a troupe of mimes,\r\nenthusiastic, fabulous. His very existence was improbable,\r\ninexplicable, and altogether bewildering. He was an insoluble problem.\r\nIt was inconceivable how he had existed, how he had succeeded in\r\ngetting so far, how he had managed to remain\xe2\x80\x94why he did not instantly\r\ndisappear. \xe2\x80\x98I went a little farther,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98then still a little\r\nfarther\xe2\x80\x94till I had gone so far that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever get\r\nback. Never mind. Plenty time. I can manage. You take Kurtz away\r\nquick\xe2\x80\x94quick\xe2\x80\x94I tell you.\xe2\x80\x99 The glamour of youth enveloped his\r\nparti-coloured rags, his destitution, his loneliness, the essential\r\ndesolation of his futile wanderings. For months\xe2\x80\x94for years\xe2\x80\x94his life\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been worth a day\xe2\x80\x99s purchase; and there he was gallantly,\r\nthoughtlessly alive, to all appearances indestructible solely by the\r\nvirtue of his few years and of his unreflecting audacity. I was seduced\r\ninto something like admiration\xe2\x80\x94like envy. Glamour urged him on, glamour\r\nkept him unscathed. He surely wanted nothing from the wilderness but\r\nspace to breathe in and to push on through. His need was to exist, and\r\nto move onwards at the greatest possible risk, and with a maximum of\r\nprivation. If the absolutely pure, uncalculating, unpractical spirit of\r\nadventure had ever ruled a human being, it ruled this bepatched youth.\r\nI almost envied him the possession of this modest and clear flame. It\r\nseemed to have consumed all thought of self so completely, that even\r\nwhile he was talking to you, you forgot that it was he\xe2\x80\x94the man before\r\nyour eyes\xe2\x80\x94who had gone through these things. I did not envy him his\r\ndevotion to Kurtz, though. He had not meditated over it. It came to\r\nhim, and he accepted it with a sort of eager fatalism. I must say that\r\nto me it appeared about the most dangerous thing in every way he had\r\ncome upon so far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had come together unavoidably, like two ships becalmed near each\r\nother, and lay rubbing sides at last. I suppose Kurtz wanted an\r\naudience, because on a certain occasion, when encamped in the forest,\r\nthey had talked all night, or more probably Kurtz had talked. \xe2\x80\x98We\r\ntalked of everything,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, quite transported at the recollection.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I forgot there was such a thing as sleep. The night did not seem to\r\nlast an hour. Everything! Everything!... Of love, too.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah, he talked\r\nto you of love!\xe2\x80\x99 I said, much amused. \xe2\x80\x98It isn\xe2\x80\x99t what you think,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncried, almost passionately. \xe2\x80\x98It was in general. He made me see\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe threw his arms up. We were on deck at the time, and the headman of\r\nmy wood-cutters, lounging near by, turned upon him his heavy and\r\nglittering eyes. I looked around, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but I assure\r\nyou that never, never before, did this land, this river, this jungle,\r\nthe very arch of this blazing sky, appear to me so hopeless and so\r\ndark, so impenetrable to human thought, so pitiless to human weakness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, ever since, you have been with him, of course?\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary. It appears their intercourse had been very much\r\nbroken by various causes. He had, as he informed me proudly, managed to\r\nnurse Kurtz through two illnesses (he alluded to it as you would to\r\nsome risky feat), but as a rule Kurtz wandered alone, far in the depths\r\nof the forest. \xe2\x80\x98Very often coming to this station, I had to wait days\r\nand days before he would turn up,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, it was worth waiting\r\nfor!\xe2\x80\x94sometimes.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What was he doing? exploring or what?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nyes, of course\xe2\x80\x99; he had discovered lots of villages, a lake, too\xe2\x80\x94he did\r\nnot know exactly in what direction; it was dangerous to inquire too\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94but mostly his expeditions had been for ivory. \xe2\x80\x98But he had no\r\ngoods to trade with by that time,\xe2\x80\x99 I objected. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a good lot of\r\ncartridges left even yet,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, looking away. \xe2\x80\x98To speak\r\nplainly, he raided the country,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. He nodded. \xe2\x80\x98Not alone,\r\nsurely!\xe2\x80\x99 He muttered something about the villages round that lake.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kurtz got the tribe to follow him, did he?\xe2\x80\x99 I suggested. He fidgeted a\r\nlittle. \xe2\x80\x98They adored him,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. The tone of these words was so\r\nextraordinary that I looked at him searchingly. It was curious to see\r\nhis mingled eagerness and reluctance to speak of Kurtz. The man filled\r\nhis life, occupied his thoughts, swayed his emotions. \xe2\x80\x98What can you\r\nexpect?\xe2\x80\x99 he burst out; \xe2\x80\x98he came to them with thunder and lightning, you\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94and they had never seen anything like it\xe2\x80\x94and very terrible. He\r\ncould be very terrible. You can\xe2\x80\x99t judge Mr. Kurtz as you would an\r\nordinary man. No, no, no! Now\xe2\x80\x94just to give you an idea\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\ntelling you, he wanted to shoot me, too, one day\xe2\x80\x94but I don\xe2\x80\x99t judge\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Shoot you!\xe2\x80\x99 I cried \xe2\x80\x98What for?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well, I had a small lot of\r\nivory the chief of that village near my house gave me. You see I used\r\nto shoot game for them. Well, he wanted it, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear reason.\r\nHe declared he would shoot me unless I gave him the ivory and then\r\ncleared out of the country, because he could do so, and had a fancy for\r\nit, and there was nothing on earth to prevent him killing whom he jolly\r\nwell pleased. And it was true, too. I gave him the ivory. What did I\r\ncare! But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t clear out. No, no. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave him. I had to be\r\ncareful, of course, till we got friendly again for a time. He had his\r\nsecond illness then. Afterwards I had to keep out of the way; but I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. He was living for the most part in those villages on the\r\nlake. When he came down to the river, sometimes he would take to me,\r\nand sometimes it was better for me to be careful. This man suffered too\r\nmuch. He hated all this, and somehow he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get away. When I had a\r\nchance I begged him to try and leave while there was time; I offered to\r\ngo back with him. And he would say yes, and then he would remain; go\r\noff on another ivory hunt; disappear for weeks; forget himself amongst\r\nthese people\xe2\x80\x94forget himself\xe2\x80\x94you know.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why! he\xe2\x80\x99s mad,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. He\r\nprotested indignantly. Mr. Kurtz couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be mad. If I had heard him\r\ntalk, only two days ago, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare hint at such a thing.... I had\r\ntaken up my binoculars while we talked, and was looking at the shore,\r\nsweeping the limit of the forest at each side and at the back of the\r\nhouse. The consciousness of there being people in that bush, so silent,\r\nso quiet\xe2\x80\x94as silent and quiet as the ruined house on the hill\xe2\x80\x94made me\r\nuneasy. There was no sign on the face of nature of this amazing tale\r\nthat was not so much told as suggested to me in desolate exclamations,\r\ncompleted by shrugs, in interrupted phrases, in hints ending in deep\r\nsighs. The woods were unmoved, like a mask\xe2\x80\x94heavy, like the closed door\r\nof a prison\xe2\x80\x94they looked with their air of hidden knowledge, of patient\r\nexpectation, of unapproachable silence. The Russian was explaining to\r\nme that it was only lately that Mr. Kurtz had come down to the river,\r\nbringing along with him all the fighting men of that lake tribe. He had\r\nbeen absent for several months\xe2\x80\x94getting himself adored, I suppose\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhad come down unexpectedly, with the intention to all appearance of\r\nmaking a raid either across the river or down stream. Evidently the\r\nappetite for more ivory had got the better of the\xe2\x80\x94what shall I\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x94less material aspirations. However he had got much worse suddenly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I heard he was lying helpless, and so I came up\xe2\x80\x94took my chance,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe Russian. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, he is bad, very bad.\xe2\x80\x99 I directed my glass to the\r\nhouse. There were no signs of life, but there was the ruined roof, the\r\nlong mud wall peeping above the grass, with three little square\r\nwindow-holes, no two of the same size; all this brought within reach of\r\nmy hand, as it were. And then I made a brusque movement, and one of the\r\nremaining posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the field of my\r\nglass. You remember I told you I had been struck at the distance by\r\ncertain attempts at ornamentation, rather remarkable in the ruinous\r\naspect of the place. Now I had suddenly a nearer view, and its first\r\nresult was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow. Then I\r\nwent carefully from post to post with my glass, and I saw my mistake.\r\nThese round knobs were not ornamental but symbolic; they were\r\nexpressive and puzzling, striking and disturbing\xe2\x80\x94food for thought and\r\nalso for vultures if there had been any looking down from the sky; but\r\nat all events for such ants as were industrious enough to ascend the\r\npole. They would have been even more impressive, those heads on the\r\nstakes, if their faces had not been turned to the house. Only one, the\r\nfirst I had made out, was facing my way. I was not so shocked as you\r\nmay think. The start back I had given was really nothing but a movement\r\nof surprise. I had expected to see a knob of wood there, you know. I\r\nreturned deliberately to the first I had seen\xe2\x80\x94and there it was, black,\r\ndried, sunken, with closed eyelids\xe2\x80\x94a head that seemed to sleep at the\r\ntop of that pole, and, with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow\r\nwhite line of the teeth, was smiling, too, smiling continuously at some\r\nendless and jocose dream of that eternal slumber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not disclosing any trade secrets. In fact, the manager said\r\nafterwards that Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s methods had ruined the district. I have no\r\nopinion on that point, but I want you clearly to understand that there\r\nwas nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there. They only\r\nshowed that Mr. Kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his\r\nvarious lusts, that there was something wanting in him\xe2\x80\x94some small\r\nmatter which, when the pressing need arose, could not be found under\r\nhis magnificent eloquence. Whether he knew of this deficiency himself I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t say. I think the knowledge came to him at last\xe2\x80\x94only at the very\r\nlast. But the wilderness had found him out early, and had taken on him\r\na terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion. I think it had\r\nwhispered to him things about himself which he did not know, things of\r\nwhich he had no conception till he took counsel with this great\r\nsolitude\xe2\x80\x94and the whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating. It echoed\r\nloudly within him because he was hollow at the core.... I put down the\r\nglass, and the head that had appeared near enough to be spoken to\r\nseemed at once to have leaped away from me into inaccessible distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe admirer of Mr. Kurtz was a bit crestfallen. In a hurried,\r\nindistinct voice he began to assure me he had not dared to take\r\nthese\xe2\x80\x94say, symbols\xe2\x80\x94down. He was not afraid of the natives; they would\r\nnot stir till Mr. Kurtz gave the word. His ascendancy was\r\nextraordinary. The camps of these people surrounded the place, and the\r\nchiefs came every day to see him. They would crawl.... \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nknow anything of the ceremonies used when approaching Mr. Kurtz,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nshouted. Curious, this feeling that came over me that such details\r\nwould be more intolerable than those heads drying on the stakes under\r\nMr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s windows. After all, that was only a savage sight, while I\r\nseemed at one bound to have been transported into some lightless region\r\nof subtle horrors, where pure, uncomplicated savagery was a positive\r\nrelief, being something that had a right to exist\xe2\x80\x94obviously\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nsunshine. The young man looked at me with surprise. I suppose it did\r\nnot occur to him that Mr. Kurtz was no idol of mine. He forgot I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nheard any of these splendid monologues on, what was it? on love,\r\njustice, conduct of life\xe2\x80\x94or what not. If it had come to crawling before\r\nMr. Kurtz, he crawled as much as the veriest savage of them all. I had\r\nno idea of the conditions, he said: these heads were the heads of\r\nrebels. I shocked him excessively by laughing. Rebels! What would be\r\nthe next definition I was to hear? There had been enemies, criminals,\r\nworkers\xe2\x80\x94and these were rebels. Those rebellious heads looked very\r\nsubdued to me on their sticks. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how such a life tries a\r\nman like Kurtz,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s last disciple. \xe2\x80\x98Well, and you?\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I! I! I am a simple man. I have no great thoughts. I want nothing from\r\nanybody. How can you compare me to...?\xe2\x80\x99 His feelings were too much for\r\nspeech, and suddenly he broke down. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x99 he groaned.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing my best to keep him alive, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. I had no\r\nhand in all this. I have no abilities. There hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a drop of\r\nmedicine or a mouthful of invalid food for months here. He was\r\nshamefully abandoned. A man like this, with such ideas. Shamefully!\r\nShamefully! I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94haven\xe2\x80\x99t slept for the last ten nights...\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis voice lost itself in the calm of the evening. The long shadows of\r\nthe forest had slipped downhill while we talked, had gone far beyond\r\nthe ruined hovel, beyond the symbolic row of stakes. All this was in\r\nthe gloom, while we down there were yet in the sunshine, and the\r\nstretch of the river abreast of the clearing glittered in a still and\r\ndazzling splendour, with a murky and overshadowed bend above and below.\r\nNot a living soul was seen on the shore. The bushes did not rustle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly round the corner of the house a group of men appeared, as\r\nthough they had come up from the ground. They waded waist-deep in the\r\ngrass, in a compact body, bearing an improvised stretcher in their\r\nmidst. Instantly, in the emptiness of the landscape, a cry arose whose\r\nshrillness pierced the still air like a sharp arrow flying straight to\r\nthe very heart of the land; and, as if by enchantment, streams of human\r\nbeings\xe2\x80\x94of naked human beings\xe2\x80\x94with spears in their hands, with bows,\r\nwith shields, with wild glances and savage movements, were poured into\r\nthe clearing by the dark-faced and pensive forest. The bushes shook,\r\nthe grass swayed for a time, and then everything stood still in\r\nattentive immobility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Now, if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the Russian at my elbow. The knot of men with the stretcher had\r\nstopped, too, halfway to the steamer, as if petrified. I saw the man on\r\nthe stretcher sit up, lank and with an uplifted arm, above the\r\nshoulders of the bearers. \xe2\x80\x98Let us hope that the man who can talk so\r\nwell of love in general will find some particular reason to spare us\r\nthis time,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. I resented bitterly the absurd danger of our\r\nsituation, as if to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been\r\na dishonouring necessity. I could not hear a sound, but through my\r\nglasses I saw the thin arm extended commandingly, the lower jaw moving,\r\nthe eyes of that apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that\r\nnodded with grotesque jerks. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x94Kurtz\xe2\x80\x94that means short in\r\nGerman\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t it? Well, the name was as true as everything else in his\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94and death. He looked at least seven feet long. His covering had\r\nfallen off, and his body emerged from it pitiful and appalling as from\r\na winding-sheet. I could see the cage of his ribs all astir, the bones\r\nof his arm waving. It was as though an animated image of death carved\r\nout of old ivory had been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless\r\ncrowd of men made of dark and glittering bronze. I saw him open his\r\nmouth wide\xe2\x80\x94it gave him a weirdly voracious aspect, as though he had\r\nwanted to swallow all the air, all the earth, all the men before him. A\r\ndeep voice reached me faintly. He must have been shouting. He fell back\r\nsuddenly. The stretcher shook as the bearers staggered forward again,\r\nand almost at the same time I noticed that the crowd of savages was\r\nvanishing without any perceptible movement of retreat, as if the forest\r\nthat had ejected these beings so suddenly had drawn them in again as\r\nthe breath is drawn in a long aspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of the pilgrims behind the stretcher carried his arms\xe2\x80\x94two\r\nshot-guns, a heavy rifle, and a light revolver-carbine\xe2\x80\x94the thunderbolts\r\nof that pitiful Jupiter. The manager bent over him murmuring as he\r\nwalked beside his head. They laid him down in one of the little\r\ncabins\xe2\x80\x94just a room for a bed place and a camp-stool or two, you know.\r\nWe had brought his belated correspondence, and a lot of torn envelopes\r\nand open letters littered his bed. His hand roamed feebly amongst these\r\npapers. I was struck by the fire of his eyes and the composed languor\r\nof his expression. It was not so much the exhaustion of disease. He did\r\nnot seem in pain. This shadow looked satiated and calm, as though for\r\nthe moment it had had its fill of all the emotions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe rustled one of the letters, and looking straight in my face said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad.\xe2\x80\x99 Somebody had been writing to him about me. These special\r\nrecommendations were turning up again. The volume of tone he emitted\r\nwithout effort, almost without the trouble of moving his lips, amazed\r\nme. A voice! a voice! It was grave, profound, vibrating, while the man\r\ndid not seem capable of a whisper. However, he had enough strength in\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94factitious no doubt\xe2\x80\x94to very nearly make an end of us, as you shall\r\nhear directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe manager appeared silently in the doorway; I stepped out at once\r\nand he drew the curtain after me. The Russian, eyed curiously by the\r\npilgrims, was staring at the shore. I followed the direction of his\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDark human shapes could be made out in the distance, flitting\r\nindistinctly against the gloomy border of the forest, and near the\r\nriver two bronze figures, leaning on tall spears, stood in the sunlight\r\nunder fantastic head-dresses of spotted skins, warlike and still in\r\nstatuesque repose. And from right to left along the lighted shore moved\r\na wild and gorgeous apparition of a woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe walked with measured steps, draped in striped and fringed cloths,\r\ntreading the earth proudly, with a slight jingle and flash of barbarous\r\nornaments. She carried her head high; her hair was done in the shape of\r\na helmet; she had brass leggings to the knee, brass wire gauntlets to\r\nthe elbow, a crimson spot on her tawny cheek, innumerable necklaces of\r\nglass beads on her neck; bizarre things, charms, gifts of witch-men,\r\nthat hung about her, glittered and trembled at every step. She must\r\nhave had the value of several elephant tusks upon her. She was savage\r\nand superb, wild-eyed and magnificent; there was something ominous and\r\nstately in her deliberate progress. And in the hush that had fallen\r\nsuddenly upon the whole sorrowful land, the immense wilderness, the\r\ncolossal body of the fecund and mysterious life seemed to look at her,\r\npensive, as though it had been looking at the image of its own\r\ntenebrous and passionate soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe came abreast of the steamer, stood still, and faced us. Her long\r\nshadow fell to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge. Her face had a tragic and fierce\r\naspect of wild sorrow and of dumb pain mingled with the fear of some\r\nstruggling, half-shaped resolve. She stood looking at us without a\r\nstir, and like the wilderness itself, with an air of brooding over an\r\ninscrutable purpose. A whole minute passed, and then she made a step\r\nforward. There was a low jingle, a glint of yellow metal, a sway of\r\nfringed draperies, and she stopped as if her heart had failed her. The\r\nyoung fellow by my side growled. The pilgrims murmured at my back. She\r\nlooked at us all as if her life had depended upon the unswerving\r\nsteadiness of her glance. Suddenly she opened her bared arms and threw\r\nthem up rigid above her head, as though in an uncontrollable desire to\r\ntouch the sky, and at the same time the swift shadows darted out on the\r\nearth, swept around on the river, gathering the steamer into a shadowy\r\nembrace. A formidable silence hung over the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe turned away slowly, walked on, following the bank, and passed into\r\nthe bushes to the left. Once only her eyes gleamed back at us in the\r\ndusk of the thickets before she disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If she had offered to come aboard I really think I would have tried\r\nto shoot her,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man of patches, nervously. \xe2\x80\x98I have been risking\r\nmy life every day for the last fortnight to keep her out of the house.\r\nShe got in one day and kicked up a row about those miserable rags I\r\npicked up in the storeroom to mend my clothes with. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t decent. At\r\nleast it must have been that, for she talked like a fury to Kurtz for\r\nan hour, pointing at me now and then. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the dialect of\r\nthis tribe. Luckily for me, I fancy Kurtz felt too ill that day to\r\ncare, or there would have been mischief. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.... No\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo much for me. Ah, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s all over now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this moment I heard Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s deep voice behind the curtain: \xe2\x80\x98Save\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x94save the ivory, you mean. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. Save _me!_ Why, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nto save you. You are interrupting my plans now. Sick! Sick! Not so sick\r\nas you would like to believe. Never mind. I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry my ideas out yet\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwill return. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you what can be done. You with your little\r\npeddling notions\xe2\x80\x94you are interfering with me. I will return. I....\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe manager came out. He did me the honour to take me under the arm\r\nand lead me aside. \xe2\x80\x98He is very low, very low,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. He considered\r\nit necessary to sigh, but neglected to be consistently sorrowful. \xe2\x80\x98We\r\nhave done all we could for him\xe2\x80\x94haven\xe2\x80\x99t we? But there is no disguising\r\nthe fact, Mr. Kurtz has done more harm than good to the Company. He did\r\nnot see the time was not ripe for vigorous action. Cautiously,\r\ncautiously\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s my principle. We must be cautious yet. The district\r\nis closed to us for a time. Deplorable! Upon the whole, the trade will\r\nsuffer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny there is a remarkable quantity of ivory\xe2\x80\x94mostly\r\nfossil. We must save it, at all events\xe2\x80\x94but look how precarious the\r\nposition is\xe2\x80\x94and why? Because the method is unsound.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Do you,\xe2\x80\x99 said I,\r\nlooking at the shore, \xe2\x80\x98call it \xe2\x80\x9cunsound method?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Without doubt,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nexclaimed hotly. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99... \xe2\x80\x98No method at all,\xe2\x80\x99 I murmured after a\r\nwhile. \xe2\x80\x98Exactly,\xe2\x80\x99 he exulted. \xe2\x80\x98I anticipated this. Shows a complete\r\nwant of judgment. It is my duty to point it out in the proper quarter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98that fellow\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s his name?\xe2\x80\x94the brickmaker, will make a\r\nreadable report for you.\xe2\x80\x99 He appeared confounded for a moment. It\r\nseemed to me I had never breathed an atmosphere so vile, and I turned\r\nmentally to Kurtz for relief\xe2\x80\x94positively for relief. \xe2\x80\x98Nevertheless I\r\nthink Mr. Kurtz is a remarkable man,\xe2\x80\x99 I said with emphasis. He started,\r\ndropped on me a heavy glance, said very quietly, \xe2\x80\x98he _was_,\xe2\x80\x99 and turned\r\nhis back on me. My hour of favour was over; I found myself lumped along\r\nwith Kurtz as a partisan of methods for which the time was not ripe: I\r\nwas unsound! Ah! but it was something to have at least a choice of\r\nnightmares.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had turned to the wilderness really, not to Mr. Kurtz, who, I was\r\nready to admit, was as good as buried. And for a moment it seemed to me\r\nas if I also were buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets. I\r\nfelt an intolerable weight oppressing my breast, the smell of the damp\r\nearth, the unseen presence of victorious corruption, the darkness of an\r\nimpenetrable night.... The Russian tapped me on the shoulder. I heard\r\nhim mumbling and stammering something about \xe2\x80\x98brother seaman\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconceal\xe2\x80\x94knowledge of matters that would affect Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s reputation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI waited. For him evidently Mr. Kurtz was not in his grave; I suspect\r\nthat for him Mr. Kurtz was one of the immortals. \xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said I at\r\nlast, \xe2\x80\x98speak out. As it happens, I am Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s friend\xe2\x80\x94in a way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stated with a good deal of formality that had we not been \xe2\x80\x98of the\r\nsame profession,\xe2\x80\x99 he would have kept the matter to himself without\r\nregard to consequences. \xe2\x80\x98He suspected there was an active ill-will\r\ntowards him on the part of these white men that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You are right,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsaid, remembering a certain conversation I had overheard. \xe2\x80\x98The manager\r\nthinks you ought to be hanged.\xe2\x80\x99 He showed a concern at this\r\nintelligence which amused me at first. \xe2\x80\x98I had better get out of the way\r\nquietly,\xe2\x80\x99 he said earnestly. \xe2\x80\x98I can do no more for Kurtz now, and they\r\nwould soon find some excuse. What\xe2\x80\x99s to stop them? There\xe2\x80\x99s a military\r\npost three hundred miles from here.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well, upon my word,\xe2\x80\x99 said I,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98perhaps you had better go if you have any friends amongst the savages\r\nnear by.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Plenty,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98They are simple people\xe2\x80\x94and I want\r\nnothing, you know.\xe2\x80\x99 He stood biting his lip, then: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any\r\nharm to happen to these whites here, but of course I was thinking of\r\nMr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s reputation\xe2\x80\x94but you are a brother seaman and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98All right,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid I, after a time. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s reputation is safe with me.\xe2\x80\x99 I did\r\nnot know how truly I spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe informed me, lowering his voice, that it was Kurtz who had ordered\r\nthe attack to be made on the steamer. \xe2\x80\x98He hated sometimes the idea of\r\nbeing taken away\xe2\x80\x94and then again.... But I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand these\r\nmatters. I am a simple man. He thought it would scare you away\xe2\x80\x94that you\r\nwould give it up, thinking him dead. I could not stop him. Oh, I had an\r\nawful time of it this last month.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98He is all\r\nright now.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ye-e-es,\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered, not very convinced apparently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thanks,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98I shall keep my eyes open.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But quiet-eh?\xe2\x80\x99 he urged\r\nanxiously. \xe2\x80\x98It would be awful for his reputation if anybody here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\npromised a complete discretion with great gravity. \xe2\x80\x98I have a canoe and\r\nthree black fellows waiting not very far. I am off. Could you give me a\r\nfew Martini-Henry cartridges?\xe2\x80\x99 I could, and did, with proper secrecy.\r\nHe helped himself, with a wink at me, to a handful of my tobacco.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Between sailors\xe2\x80\x94you know\xe2\x80\x94good English tobacco.\xe2\x80\x99 At the door of the\r\npilot-house he turned round\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I say, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you a pair of shoes you\r\ncould spare?\xe2\x80\x99 He raised one leg. \xe2\x80\x98Look.\xe2\x80\x99 The soles were tied with\r\nknotted strings sandalwise under his bare feet. I rooted out an old\r\npair, at which he looked with admiration before tucking it under his\r\nleft arm. One of his pockets (bright red) was bulging with cartridges,\r\nfrom the other (dark blue) peeped \xe2\x80\x98Towson\xe2\x80\x99s Inquiry,\xe2\x80\x99 etc., etc. He\r\nseemed to think himself excellently well equipped for a renewed\r\nencounter with the wilderness. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! I\xe2\x80\x99ll never, never meet such a man\r\nagain. You ought to have heard him recite poetry\xe2\x80\x94his own, too, it was,\r\nhe told me. Poetry!\xe2\x80\x99 He rolled his eyes at the recollection of these\r\ndelights. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, he enlarged my mind!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye,\xe2\x80\x99 said I. He shook hands\r\nand vanished in the night. Sometimes I ask myself whether I had ever\r\nreally seen him\xe2\x80\x94whether it was possible to meet such a phenomenon!...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I woke up shortly after midnight his warning came to my mind with\r\nits hint of danger that seemed, in the starred darkness, real enough to\r\nmake me get up for the purpose of having a look round. On the hill a\r\nbig fire burned, illuminating fitfully a crooked corner of the\r\nstation-house. One of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks,\r\narmed for the purpose, was keeping guard over the ivory; but deep\r\nwithin the forest, red gleams that wavered, that seemed to sink and\r\nrise from the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense\r\nblackness, showed the exact position of the camp where Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadorers were keeping their uneasy vigil. The monotonous beating of a\r\nbig drum filled the air with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration.\r\nA steady droning sound of many men chanting each to himself some weird\r\nincantation came out from the black, flat wall of the woods as the\r\nhumming of bees comes out of a hive, and had a strange narcotic effect\r\nupon my half-awake senses. I believe I dozed off leaning over the rail,\r\ntill an abrupt burst of yells, an overwhelming outbreak of a pent-up\r\nand mysterious frenzy, woke me up in a bewildered wonder. It was cut\r\nshort all at once, and the low droning went on with an effect of\r\naudible and soothing silence. I glanced casually into the little cabin.\r\nA light was burning within, but Mr. Kurtz was not there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I would have raised an outcry if I had believed my eyes. But I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t believe them at first\xe2\x80\x94the thing seemed so impossible. The fact\r\nis I was completely unnerved by a sheer blank fright, pure abstract\r\nterror, unconnected with any distinct shape of physical danger. What\r\nmade this emotion so overpowering was\xe2\x80\x94how shall I define it?\xe2\x80\x94the moral\r\nshock I received, as if something altogether monstrous, intolerable to\r\nthought and odious to the soul, had been thrust upon me unexpectedly.\r\nThis lasted of course the merest fraction of a second, and then the\r\nusual sense of commonplace, deadly danger, the possibility of a sudden\r\nonslaught and massacre, or something of the kind, which I saw\r\nimpending, was positively welcome and composing. It pacified me, in\r\nfact, so much that I did not raise an alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster and sleeping on a\r\nchair on deck within three feet of me. The yells had not awakened him;\r\nhe snored very slightly; I left him to his slumbers and leaped ashore.\r\nI did not betray Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x94it was ordered I should never betray him\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas written I should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice. I was\r\nanxious to deal with this shadow by myself alone\xe2\x80\x94and to this day I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know why I was so jealous of sharing with any one the peculiar\r\nblackness of that experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I got on the bank I saw a trail\xe2\x80\x94a broad trail through the\r\ngrass. I remember the exultation with which I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98He can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwalk\xe2\x80\x94he is crawling on all-fours\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve got him.\xe2\x80\x99 The grass was wet with\r\ndew. I strode rapidly with clenched fists. I fancy I had some vague\r\nnotion of falling upon him and giving him a drubbing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\r\nhad some imbecile thoughts. The knitting old woman with the cat\r\nobtruded herself upon my memory as a most improper person to be sitting\r\nat the other end of such an affair. I saw a row of pilgrims squirting\r\nlead in the air out of Winchesters held to the hip. I thought I would\r\nnever get back to the steamer, and imagined myself living alone and\r\nunarmed in the woods to an advanced age. Such silly things\xe2\x80\x94you know.\r\nAnd I remember I confounded the beat of the drum with the beating of my\r\nheart, and was pleased at its calm regularity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kept to the track though\xe2\x80\x94then stopped to listen. The night was very\r\nclear; a dark blue space, sparkling with dew and starlight, in which\r\nblack things stood very still. I thought I could see a kind of motion\r\nahead of me. I was strangely cocksure of everything that night. I\r\nactually left the track and ran in a wide semicircle (I verily believe\r\nchuckling to myself) so as to get in front of that stir, of that motion\r\nI had seen\xe2\x80\x94if indeed I had seen anything. I was circumventing Kurtz as\r\nthough it had been a boyish game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came upon him, and, if he had not heard me coming, I would have\r\nfallen over him, too, but he got up in time. He rose, unsteady, long,\r\npale, indistinct, like a vapour exhaled by the earth, and swayed\r\nslightly, misty and silent before me; while at my back the fires loomed\r\nbetween the trees, and the murmur of many voices issued from the\r\nforest. I had cut him off cleverly; but when actually confronting him I\r\nseemed to come to my senses, I saw the danger in its right proportion.\r\nIt was by no means over yet. Suppose he began to shout? Though he could\r\nhardly stand, there was still plenty of vigour in his voice. \xe2\x80\x98Go\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94hide yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in that profound tone. It was very awful.\r\nI glanced back. We were within thirty yards from the nearest fire. A\r\nblack figure stood up, strode on long black legs, waving long black\r\narms, across the glow. It had horns\xe2\x80\x94antelope horns, I think\xe2\x80\x94on its\r\nhead. Some sorcerer, some witch-man, no doubt: it looked fiendlike\r\nenough. \xe2\x80\x98Do you know what you are doing?\xe2\x80\x99 I whispered. \xe2\x80\x98Perfectly,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nanswered, raising his voice for that single word: it sounded to me far\r\noff and yet loud, like a hail through a speaking-trumpet. \xe2\x80\x98If he makes\r\na row we are lost,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought to myself. This clearly was not a case\r\nfor fisticuffs, even apart from the very natural aversion I had to beat\r\nthat Shadow\xe2\x80\x94this wandering and tormented thing. \xe2\x80\x98You will be lost,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98utterly lost.\xe2\x80\x99 One gets sometimes such a flash of inspiration,\r\nyou know. I did say the right thing, though indeed he could not have\r\nbeen more irretrievably lost than he was at this very moment, when the\r\nfoundations of our intimacy were being laid\xe2\x80\x94to endure\xe2\x80\x94to endure\xe2\x80\x94even to\r\nthe end\xe2\x80\x94even beyond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I had immense plans,\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered irresolutely. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nif you try to shout I\xe2\x80\x99ll smash your head with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 There was not a stick\r\nor a stone near. \xe2\x80\x98I will throttle you for good,\xe2\x80\x99 I corrected myself. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwas on the threshold of great things,\xe2\x80\x99 he pleaded, in a voice of\r\nlonging, with a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold. \xe2\x80\x98And\r\nnow for this stupid scoundrel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Your success in Europe is assured in\r\nany case,\xe2\x80\x99 I affirmed steadily. I did not want to have the throttling\r\nof him, you understand\xe2\x80\x94and indeed it would have been very little use\r\nfor any practical purpose. I tried to break the spell\xe2\x80\x94the heavy, mute\r\nspell of the wilderness\xe2\x80\x94that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast\r\nby the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the memory of\r\ngratified and monstrous passions. This alone, I was convinced, had\r\ndriven him out to the edge of the forest, to the bush, towards the\r\ngleam of fires, the throb of drums, the drone of weird incantations;\r\nthis alone had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of\r\npermitted aspirations. And, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, the terror of the position\r\nwas not in being knocked on the head\xe2\x80\x94though I had a very lively sense\r\nof that danger, too\xe2\x80\x94but in this, that I had to deal with a being to\r\nwhom I could not appeal in the name of anything high or low. I had,\r\neven like the niggers, to invoke him\xe2\x80\x94himself\xe2\x80\x94his own exalted and\r\nincredible degradation. There was nothing either above or below him,\r\nand I knew it. He had kicked himself loose of the earth. Confound the\r\nman! he had kicked the very earth to pieces. He was alone, and I before\r\nhim did not know whether I stood on the ground or floated in the air.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been telling you what we said\xe2\x80\x94repeating the phrases we\r\npronounced\xe2\x80\x94but what\xe2\x80\x99s the good? They were common everyday words\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfamiliar, vague sounds exchanged on every waking day of life. But what\r\nof that? They had behind them, to my mind, the terrific suggestiveness\r\nof words heard in dreams, of phrases spoken in nightmares. Soul! If\r\nanybody ever struggled with a soul, I am the man. And I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t arguing\r\nwith a lunatic either. Believe me or not, his intelligence was\r\nperfectly clear\xe2\x80\x94concentrated, it is true, upon himself with horrible\r\nintensity, yet clear; and therein was my only chance\xe2\x80\x94barring, of\r\ncourse, the killing him there and then, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so good, on\r\naccount of unavoidable noise. But his soul was mad. Being alone in the\r\nwilderness, it had looked within itself, and, by heavens! I tell you,\r\nit had gone mad. I had\xe2\x80\x94for my sins, I suppose\xe2\x80\x94to go through the ordeal\r\nof looking into it myself. No eloquence could have been so withering to\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s belief in mankind as his final burst of sincerity. He struggled\r\nwith himself, too. I saw it\xe2\x80\x94I heard it. I saw the inconceivable mystery\r\nof a soul that knew no restraint, no faith, and no fear, yet struggling\r\nblindly with itself. I kept my head pretty well; but when I had him at\r\nlast stretched on the couch, I wiped my forehead, while my legs shook\r\nunder me as though I had carried half a ton on my back down that hill.\r\nAnd yet I had only supported him, his bony arm clasped round my\r\nneck\xe2\x80\x94and he was not much heavier than a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen next day we left at noon, the crowd, of whose presence behind the\r\ncurtain of trees I had been acutely conscious all the time, flowed out\r\nof the woods again, filled the clearing, covered the slope with a mass\r\nof naked, breathing, quivering, bronze bodies. I steamed up a bit, then\r\nswung down stream, and two thousand eyes followed the evolutions of the\r\nsplashing, thumping, fierce river-demon beating the water with its\r\nterrible tail and breathing black smoke into the air. In front of the\r\nfirst rank, along the river, three men, plastered with bright red earth\r\nfrom head to foot, strutted to and fro restlessly. When we came abreast\r\nagain, they faced the river, stamped their feet, nodded their horned\r\nheads, swayed their scarlet bodies; they shook towards the fierce\r\nriver-demon a bunch of black feathers, a mangy skin with a pendent\r\ntail\xe2\x80\x94something that looked a dried gourd; they shouted periodically\r\ntogether strings of amazing words that resembled no sounds of human\r\nlanguage; and the deep murmurs of the crowd, interrupted suddenly, were\r\nlike the responses of some satanic litany.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had carried Kurtz into the pilot-house: there was more air there.\r\nLying on the couch, he stared through the open shutter. There was an\r\neddy in the mass of human bodies, and the woman with helmeted head and\r\ntawny cheeks rushed out to the very brink of the stream. She put out\r\nher hands, shouted something, and all that wild mob took up the shout\r\nin a roaring chorus of articulated, rapid, breathless utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do you understand this?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe kept on looking out past me with fiery, longing eyes, with a\r\nmingled expression of wistfulness and hate. He made no answer, but I\r\nsaw a smile, a smile of indefinable meaning, appear on his colourless\r\nlips that a moment after twitched convulsively. \xe2\x80\x98Do I not?\xe2\x80\x99 he said\r\nslowly, gasping, as if the words had been torn out of him by a\r\nsupernatural power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pulled the string of the whistle, and I did this because I saw the\r\npilgrims on deck getting out their rifles with an air of anticipating a\r\njolly lark. At the sudden screech there was a movement of abject terror\r\nthrough that wedged mass of bodies. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t! don\xe2\x80\x99t you frighten them\r\naway,\xe2\x80\x99 cried some one on deck disconsolately. I pulled the string time\r\nafter time. They broke and ran, they leaped, they crouched, they\r\nswerved, they dodged the flying terror of the sound. The three red\r\nchaps had fallen flat, face down on the shore, as though they had been\r\nshot dead. Only the barbarous and superb woman did not so much as\r\nflinch, and stretched tragically her bare arms after us over the sombre\r\nand glittering river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then that imbecile crowd down on the deck started their little\r\nfun, and I could see nothing more for smoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us\r\ndown towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress; and\r\nKurtz\xe2\x80\x99s life was running swiftly, too, ebbing, ebbing out of his heart\r\ninto the sea of inexorable time. The manager was very placid, he had no\r\nvital anxieties now, he took us both in with a comprehensive and\r\nsatisfied glance: the \xe2\x80\x98affair\xe2\x80\x99 had come off as well as could be wished.\r\nI saw the time approaching when I would be left alone of the party of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98unsound method.\xe2\x80\x99 The pilgrims looked upon me with disfavour. I was, so\r\nto speak, numbered with the dead. It is strange how I accepted this\r\nunforeseen partnership, this choice of nightmares forced upon me in the\r\ntenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phantoms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKurtz discoursed. A voice! a voice! It rang deep to the very last. It\r\nsurvived his strength to hide in the magnificent folds of eloquence the\r\nbarren darkness of his heart. Oh, he struggled! he struggled! The\r\nwastes of his weary brain were haunted by shadowy images now\xe2\x80\x94images of\r\nwealth and fame revolving obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift\r\nof noble and lofty expression. My Intended, my station, my career, my\r\nideas\xe2\x80\x94these were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated\r\nsentiments. The shade of the original Kurtz frequented the bedside of\r\nthe hollow sham, whose fate it was to be buried presently in the mould\r\nof primeval earth. But both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of\r\nthe mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that soul\r\nsatiated with primitive emotions, avid of lying fame, of sham\r\ndistinction, of all the appearances of success and power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes he was contemptibly childish. He desired to have kings meet\r\nhim at railway-stations on his return from some ghastly Nowhere, where\r\nhe intended to accomplish great things. \xe2\x80\x98You show them you have in you\r\nsomething that is really profitable, and then there will be no limits\r\nto the recognition of your ability,\xe2\x80\x99 he would say. \xe2\x80\x98Of course you must\r\ntake care of the motives\xe2\x80\x94right motives\xe2\x80\x94always.\xe2\x80\x99 The long reaches that\r\nwere like one and the same reach, monotonous bends that were exactly\r\nalike, slipped past the steamer with their multitude of secular trees\r\nlooking patiently after this grimy fragment of another world, the\r\nforerunner of change, of conquest, of trade, of massacres, of\r\nblessings. I looked ahead\xe2\x80\x94piloting. \xe2\x80\x98Close the shutter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Kurtz\r\nsuddenly one day; \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to look at this.\xe2\x80\x99 I did so. There was a\r\nsilence. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, but I will wring your heart yet!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried at the\r\ninvisible wilderness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe broke down\xe2\x80\x94as I had expected\xe2\x80\x94and had to lie up for repairs at the\r\nhead of an island. This delay was the first thing that shook Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfidence. One morning he gave me a packet of papers and a\r\nphotograph\xe2\x80\x94the lot tied together with a shoe-string. \xe2\x80\x98Keep this for\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98This noxious fool\xe2\x80\x99 (meaning the manager) \xe2\x80\x98is capable of\r\nprying into my boxes when I am not looking.\xe2\x80\x99 In the afternoon I saw\r\nhim. He was lying on his back with closed eyes, and I withdrew quietly,\r\nbut I heard him mutter, \xe2\x80\x98Live rightly, die, die...\xe2\x80\x99 I listened. There\r\nwas nothing more. Was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep, or was it\r\na fragment of a phrase from some newspaper article? He had been writing\r\nfor the papers and meant to do so again, \xe2\x80\x98for the furthering of my\r\nideas. It\xe2\x80\x99s a duty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis was an impenetrable darkness. I looked at him as you peer down at\r\na man who is lying at the bottom of a precipice where the sun never\r\nshines. But I had not much time to give him, because I was helping the\r\nengine-driver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders, to straighten a\r\nbent connecting-rod, and in other such matters. I lived in an infernal\r\nmess of rust, filings, nuts, bolts, spanners, hammers,\r\nratchet-drills\xe2\x80\x94things I abominate, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t get on with them. I\r\ntended the little forge we fortunately had aboard; I toiled wearily in\r\na wretched scrap-heap\xe2\x80\x94unless I had the shakes too bad to stand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne evening coming in with a candle I was startled to hear him say a\r\nlittle tremulously, \xe2\x80\x98I am lying here in the dark waiting for death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe light was within a foot of his eyes. I forced myself to murmur,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 and stood over him as if transfixed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything approaching the change that came over his features I have\r\nnever seen before, and hope never to see again. Oh, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t touched. I\r\nwas fascinated. It was as though a veil had been rent. I saw on that\r\nivory face the expression of sombre pride, of ruthless power, of craven\r\nterror\xe2\x80\x94of an intense and hopeless despair. Did he live his life again\r\nin every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that\r\nsupreme moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some\r\nimage, at some vision\xe2\x80\x94he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a\r\nbreath:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The horror! The horror!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI blew the candle out and left the cabin. The pilgrims were dining in\r\nthe mess-room, and I took my place opposite the manager, who lifted his\r\neyes to give me a questioning glance, which I successfully ignored. He\r\nleaned back, serene, with that peculiar smile of his sealing the\r\nunexpressed depths of his meanness. A continuous shower of small flies\r\nstreamed upon the lamp, upon the cloth, upon our hands and faces.\r\nSuddenly the manager\xe2\x80\x99s boy put his insolent black head in the doorway,\r\nand said in a tone of scathing contempt:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mistah Kurtz\xe2\x80\x94he dead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the pilgrims rushed out to see. I remained, and went on with my\r\ndinner. I believe I was considered brutally callous. However, I did not\r\neat much. There was a lamp in there\xe2\x80\x94light, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know\xe2\x80\x94and outside\r\nit was so beastly, beastly dark. I went no more near the remarkable man\r\nwho had pronounced a judgment upon the adventures of his soul on this\r\nearth. The voice was gone. What else had been there? But I am of course\r\naware that next day the pilgrims buried something in a muddy hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then they very nearly buried me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, as you see, I did not go to join Kurtz there and then. I did\r\nnot. I remained to dream the nightmare out to the end, and to show my\r\nloyalty to Kurtz once more. Destiny. My destiny! Droll thing life\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose.\r\nThe most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself\xe2\x80\x94that comes\r\ntoo late\xe2\x80\x94a crop of unextinguishable regrets. I have wrestled with\r\ndeath. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes\r\nplace in an impalpable greyness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing\r\naround, without spectators, without clamour, without glory, without the\r\ngreat desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly\r\natmosphere of tepid scepticism, without much belief in your own right,\r\nand still less in that of your adversary. If such is the form of\r\nultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it\r\nto be. I was within a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth of the last opportunity for\r\npronouncement, and I found with humiliation that probably I would have\r\nnothing to say. This is the reason why I affirm that Kurtz was a\r\nremarkable man. He had something to say. He said it. Since I had peeped\r\nover the edge myself, I understand better the meaning of his stare,\r\nthat could not see the flame of the candle, but was wide enough to\r\nembrace the whole universe, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts\r\nthat beat in the darkness. He had summed up\xe2\x80\x94he had judged. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nhorror!\xe2\x80\x99 He was a remarkable man. After all, this was the expression of\r\nsome sort of belief; it had candour, it had conviction, it had a\r\nvibrating note of revolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a\r\nglimpsed truth\xe2\x80\x94the strange commingling of desire and hate. And it is\r\nnot my own extremity I remember best\xe2\x80\x94a vision of greyness without form\r\nfilled with physical pain, and a careless contempt for the evanescence\r\nof all things\xe2\x80\x94even of this pain itself. No! It is his extremity that I\r\nseem to have lived through. True, he had made that last stride, he had\r\nstepped over the edge, while I had been permitted to draw back my\r\nhesitating foot. And perhaps in this is the whole difference; perhaps\r\nall the wisdom, and all truth, and all sincerity, are just compressed\r\ninto that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the\r\nthreshold of the invisible. Perhaps! I like to think my summing-up\r\nwould not have been a word of careless contempt. Better his cry\xe2\x80\x94much\r\nbetter. It was an affirmation, a moral victory paid for by innumerable\r\ndefeats, by abominable terrors, by abominable satisfactions. But it was\r\na victory! That is why I have remained loyal to Kurtz to the last, and\r\neven beyond, when a long time after I heard once more, not his own\r\nvoice, but the echo of his magnificent eloquence thrown to me from a\r\nsoul as translucently pure as a cliff of crystal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they did not bury me, though there is a period of time which I\r\nremember mistily, with a shuddering wonder, like a passage through some\r\ninconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire. I found\r\nmyself back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people\r\nhurrying through the streets to filch a little money from each other,\r\nto devour their infamous cookery, to gulp their unwholesome beer, to\r\ndream their insignificant and silly dreams. They trespassed upon my\r\nthoughts. They were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an\r\nirritating pretence, because I felt so sure they could not possibly\r\nknow the things I knew. Their bearing, which was simply the bearing of\r\ncommonplace individuals going about their business in the assurance of\r\nperfect safety, was offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of\r\nfolly in the face of a danger it is unable to comprehend. I had no\r\nparticular desire to enlighten them, but I had some difficulty in\r\nrestraining myself from laughing in their faces so full of stupid\r\nimportance. I daresay I was not very well at that time. I tottered\r\nabout the streets\xe2\x80\x94there were various affairs to settle\xe2\x80\x94grinning\r\nbitterly at perfectly respectable persons. I admit my behaviour was\r\ninexcusable, but then my temperature was seldom normal in these days.\r\nMy dear aunt\xe2\x80\x99s endeavours to \xe2\x80\x98nurse up my strength\xe2\x80\x99 seemed altogether\r\nbeside the mark. It was not my strength that wanted nursing, it was my\r\nimagination that wanted soothing. I kept the bundle of papers given me\r\nby Kurtz, not knowing exactly what to do with it. His mother had died\r\nlately, watched over, as I was told, by his Intended. A clean-shaved\r\nman, with an official manner and wearing gold-rimmed spectacles, called\r\non me one day and made inquiries, at first circuitous, afterwards\r\nsuavely pressing, about what he was pleased to denominate certain\r\n\xe2\x80\x98documents.\xe2\x80\x99 I was not surprised, because I had had two rows with the\r\nmanager on the subject out there. I had refused to give up the smallest\r\nscrap out of that package, and I took the same attitude with the\r\nspectacled man. He became darkly menacing at last, and with much heat\r\nargued that the Company had the right to every bit of information about\r\nits \xe2\x80\x98territories.\xe2\x80\x99 And said he, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of unexplored\r\nregions must have been necessarily extensive and peculiar\xe2\x80\x94owing to his\r\ngreat abilities and to the deplorable circumstances in which he had\r\nbeen placed: therefore\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 I assured him Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, however\r\nextensive, did not bear upon the problems of commerce or\r\nadministration. He invoked then the name of science. \xe2\x80\x98It would be an\r\nincalculable loss if,\xe2\x80\x99 etc., etc. I offered him the report on the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppression of Savage Customs,\xe2\x80\x99 with the postscriptum torn off. He\r\ntook it up eagerly, but ended by sniffing at it with an air of\r\ncontempt. \xe2\x80\x98This is not what we had a right to expect,\xe2\x80\x99 he remarked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Expect nothing else,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98There are only private letters.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nwithdrew upon some threat of legal proceedings, and I saw him no more;\r\nbut another fellow, calling himself Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s cousin, appeared two days\r\nlater, and was anxious to hear all the details about his dear\r\nrelative\xe2\x80\x99s last moments. Incidentally he gave me to understand that\r\nKurtz had been essentially a great musician. \xe2\x80\x98There was the making of\r\nan immense success,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, who was an organist, I believe, with\r\nlank grey hair flowing over a greasy coat-collar. I had no reason to\r\ndoubt his statement; and to this day I am unable to say what was\r\nKurtz\xe2\x80\x99s profession, whether he ever had any\xe2\x80\x94which was the greatest of\r\nhis talents. I had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers, or\r\nelse for a journalist who could paint\xe2\x80\x94but even the cousin (who took\r\nsnuff during the interview) could not tell me what he had been\xe2\x80\x94exactly.\r\nHe was a universal genius\xe2\x80\x94on that point I agreed with the old chap, who\r\nthereupon blew his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and\r\nwithdrew in senile agitation, bearing off some family letters and\r\nmemoranda without importance. Ultimately a journalist anxious to know\r\nsomething of the fate of his \xe2\x80\x98dear colleague\xe2\x80\x99 turned up. This visitor\r\ninformed me Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s proper sphere ought to have been politics \xe2\x80\x98on the\r\npopular side.\xe2\x80\x99 He had furry straight eyebrows, bristly hair cropped\r\nshort, an eyeglass on a broad ribbon, and, becoming expansive,\r\nconfessed his opinion that Kurtz really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t write a bit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98but\r\nheavens! how that man could talk. He electrified large meetings. He had\r\nfaith\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x94he had the faith. He could get himself to believe\r\nanything\xe2\x80\x94anything. He would have been a splendid leader of an extreme\r\nparty.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What party?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98Any party,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the other. \xe2\x80\x98He was\r\nan\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x94extremist.\xe2\x80\x99 Did I not think so? I assented. Did I know, he asked,\r\nwith a sudden flash of curiosity, \xe2\x80\x98what it was that had induced him to\r\ngo out there?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, and forthwith handed him the famous\r\nReport for publication, if he thought fit. He glanced through it\r\nhurriedly, mumbling all the time, judged \xe2\x80\x98it would do,\xe2\x80\x99 and took\r\nhimself off with this plunder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus I was left at last with a slim packet of letters and the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nportrait. She struck me as beautiful\xe2\x80\x94I mean she had a beautiful\r\nexpression. I know that the sunlight can be made to lie, too, yet one\r\nfelt that no manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the\r\ndelicate shade of truthfulness upon those features. She seemed ready to\r\nlisten without mental reservation, without suspicion, without a thought\r\nfor herself. I concluded I would go and give her back her portrait and\r\nthose letters myself. Curiosity? Yes; and also some other feeling\r\nperhaps. All that had been Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s had passed out of my hands: his\r\nsoul, his body, his station, his plans, his ivory, his career. There\r\nremained only his memory and his Intended\xe2\x80\x94and I wanted to give that up,\r\ntoo, to the past, in a way\xe2\x80\x94to surrender personally all that remained of\r\nhim with me to that oblivion which is the last word of our common fate.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t defend myself. I had no clear perception of what it was I\r\nreally wanted. Perhaps it was an impulse of unconscious loyalty, or the\r\nfulfilment of one of those ironic necessities that lurk in the facts of\r\nhuman existence. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell. But I went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that\r\naccumulate in every man\xe2\x80\x99s life\xe2\x80\x94a vague impress on the brain of shadows\r\nthat had fallen on it in their swift and final passage; but before the\r\nhigh and ponderous door, between the tall houses of a street as still\r\nand decorous as a well-kept alley in a cemetery, I had a vision of him\r\non the stretcher, opening his mouth voraciously, as if to devour all\r\nthe earth with all its mankind. He lived then before me; he lived as\r\nmuch as he had ever lived\xe2\x80\x94a shadow insatiable of splendid appearances,\r\nof frightful realities; a shadow darker than the shadow of the night,\r\nand draped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous eloquence. The vision\r\nseemed to enter the house with me\xe2\x80\x94the stretcher, the phantom-bearers,\r\nthe wild crowd of obedient worshippers, the gloom of the forests, the\r\nglitter of the reach between the murky bends, the beat of the drum,\r\nregular and muffled like the beating of a heart\xe2\x80\x94the heart of a\r\nconquering darkness. It was a moment of triumph for the wilderness, an\r\ninvading and vengeful rush which, it seemed to me, I would have to keep\r\nback alone for the salvation of another soul. And the memory of what I\r\nhad heard him say afar there, with the horned shapes stirring at my\r\nback, in the glow of fires, within the patient woods, those broken\r\nphrases came back to me, were heard again in their ominous and\r\nterrifying simplicity. I remembered his abject pleading, his abject\r\nthreats, the colossal scale of his vile desires, the meanness, the\r\ntorment, the tempestuous anguish of his soul. And later on I seemed to\r\nsee his collected languid manner, when he said one day, \xe2\x80\x98This lot of\r\nivory now is really mine. The Company did not pay for it. I collected\r\nit myself at a very great personal risk. I am afraid they will try to\r\nclaim it as theirs though. H\xe2\x80\x99m. It is a difficult case. What do you\r\nthink I ought to do\xe2\x80\x94resist? Eh? I want no more than justice.\xe2\x80\x99... He\r\nwanted no more than justice\xe2\x80\x94no more than justice. I rang the bell\r\nbefore a mahogany door on the first floor, and while I waited he seemed\r\nto stare at me out of the glassy panel\xe2\x80\x94stare with that wide and immense\r\nstare embracing, condemning, loathing all the universe. I seemed to\r\nhear the whispered cry, \xe2\x80\x9cThe horror! The horror!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dusk was falling. I had to wait in a lofty drawing-room with three\r\nlong windows from floor to ceiling that were like three luminous and\r\nbedraped columns. The bent gilt legs and backs of the furniture shone\r\nin indistinct curves. The tall marble fireplace had a cold and\r\nmonumental whiteness. A grand piano stood massively in a corner; with\r\ndark gleams on the flat surfaces like a sombre and polished\r\nsarcophagus. A high door opened\xe2\x80\x94closed. I rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe came forward, all in black, with a pale head, floating towards me\r\nin the dusk. She was in mourning. It was more than a year since his\r\ndeath, more than a year since the news came; she seemed as though she\r\nwould remember and mourn forever. She took both my hands in hers and\r\nmurmured, \xe2\x80\x98I had heard you were coming.\xe2\x80\x99 I noticed she was not very\r\nyoung\xe2\x80\x94I mean not girlish. She had a mature capacity for fidelity, for\r\nbelief, for suffering. The room seemed to have grown darker, as if all\r\nthe sad light of the cloudy evening had taken refuge on her forehead.\r\nThis fair hair, this pale visage, this pure brow, seemed surrounded by\r\nan ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at me. Their glance\r\nwas guileless, profound, confident, and trustful. She carried her\r\nsorrowful head as though she were proud of that sorrow, as though she\r\nwould say, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x94I alone know how to mourn for him as he deserves.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\nwhile we were still shaking hands, such a look of awful desolation came\r\nupon her face that I perceived she was one of those creatures that are\r\nnot the playthings of Time. For her he had died only yesterday. And, by\r\nJove! the impression was so powerful that for me, too, he seemed to\r\nhave died only yesterday\xe2\x80\x94nay, this very minute. I saw her and him in\r\nthe same instant of time\xe2\x80\x94his death and her sorrow\xe2\x80\x94I saw her sorrow in\r\nthe very moment of his death. Do you understand? I saw them together\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nheard them together. She had said, with a deep catch of the breath, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhave survived\xe2\x80\x99 while my strained ears seemed to hear distinctly,\r\nmingled with her tone of despairing regret, the summing up whisper of\r\nhis eternal condemnation. I asked myself what I was doing there, with a\r\nsensation of panic in my heart as though I had blundered into a place\r\nof cruel and absurd mysteries not fit for a human being to behold. She\r\nmotioned me to a chair. We sat down. I laid the packet gently on the\r\nlittle table, and she put her hand over it.... \xe2\x80\x98You knew him well,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nmurmured, after a moment of mourning silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Intimacy grows quickly out there,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98I knew him as well as it\r\nis possible for one man to know another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And you admired him,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98It was impossible to know him and\r\nnot to admire him. Was it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98He was a remarkable man,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, unsteadily. Then before the\r\nappealing fixity of her gaze, that seemed to watch for more words on my\r\nlips, I went on, \xe2\x80\x98It was impossible not to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Love him,\xe2\x80\x99 she finished eagerly, silencing me into an appalled\r\ndumbness. \xe2\x80\x98How true! how true! But when you think that no one knew him\r\nso well as I! I had all his noble confidence. I knew him best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You knew him best,\xe2\x80\x99 I repeated. And perhaps she did. But with every\r\nword spoken the room was growing darker, and only her forehead, smooth\r\nand white, remained illumined by the inextinguishable light of belief\r\nand love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You were his friend,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on. \xe2\x80\x98His friend,\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated, a\r\nlittle louder. \xe2\x80\x98You must have been, if he had given you this, and sent\r\nyou to me. I feel I can speak to you\xe2\x80\x94and oh! I must speak. I want\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94you who have heard his last words\xe2\x80\x94to know I have been worthy of\r\nhim.... It is not pride.... Yes! I am proud to know I understood him\r\nbetter than any one on earth\xe2\x80\x94he told me so himself. And since his\r\nmother died I have had no one\xe2\x80\x94no one\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI listened. The darkness deepened. I was not even sure whether he had\r\ngiven me the right bundle. I rather suspect he wanted me to take care\r\nof another batch of his papers which, after his death, I saw the\r\nmanager examining under the lamp. And the girl talked, easing her pain\r\nin the certitude of my sympathy; she talked as thirsty men drink. I had\r\nheard that her engagement with Kurtz had been disapproved by her\r\npeople. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t rich enough or something. And indeed I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhether he had not been a pauper all his life. He had given me some\r\nreason to infer that it was his impatience of comparative poverty that\r\ndrove him out there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98... Who was not his friend who had heard him speak once?\xe2\x80\x99 she was\r\nsaying. \xe2\x80\x98He drew men towards him by what was best in them.\xe2\x80\x99 She looked\r\nat me with intensity. \xe2\x80\x98It is the gift of the great,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on, and\r\nthe sound of her low voice seemed to have the accompaniment of all the\r\nother sounds, full of mystery, desolation, and sorrow, I had ever\r\nheard\xe2\x80\x94the ripple of the river, the soughing of the trees swayed by the\r\nwind, the murmurs of the crowds, the faint ring of incomprehensible\r\nwords cried from afar, the whisper of a voice speaking from beyond the\r\nthreshold of an eternal darkness. \xe2\x80\x98But you have heard him! You know!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I know,\xe2\x80\x99 I said with something like despair in my heart, but\r\nbowing my head before the faith that was in her, before that great and\r\nsaving illusion that shone with an unearthly glow in the darkness, in\r\nthe triumphant darkness from which I could not have defended her\xe2\x80\x94from\r\nwhich I could not even defend myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What a loss to me\xe2\x80\x94to us!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94she corrected herself with beautiful\r\ngenerosity; then added in a murmur, \xe2\x80\x98To the world.\xe2\x80\x99 By the last gleams\r\nof twilight I could see the glitter of her eyes, full of tears\xe2\x80\x94of tears\r\nthat would not fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I have been very happy\xe2\x80\x94very fortunate\xe2\x80\x94very proud,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on. \xe2\x80\x98Too\r\nfortunate. Too happy for a little while. And now I am unhappy for\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe stood up; her fair hair seemed to catch all the remaining light in\r\na glimmer of gold. I rose, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And of all this,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on mournfully, \xe2\x80\x98of all his promise, and of\r\nall his greatness, of his generous mind, of his noble heart, nothing\r\nremains\xe2\x80\x94nothing but a memory. You and I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We shall always remember him,\xe2\x80\x99 I said hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried. \xe2\x80\x98It is impossible that all this should be lost\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nsuch a life should be sacrificed to leave nothing\xe2\x80\x94but sorrow. You know\r\nwhat vast plans he had. I knew of them, too\xe2\x80\x94I could not perhaps\r\nunderstand\xe2\x80\x94but others knew of them. Something must remain. His words,\r\nat least, have not died.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98His words will remain,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And his example,\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered to herself. \xe2\x80\x98Men looked up to him\xe2\x80\x94his\r\ngoodness shone in every act. His example\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98True,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98his example, too. Yes, his example. I forgot that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But I do not. I cannot\xe2\x80\x94I cannot believe\xe2\x80\x94not yet. I cannot believe\r\nthat I shall never see him again, that nobody will see him again,\r\nnever, never, never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe put out her arms as if after a retreating figure, stretching them\r\nback and with clasped pale hands across the fading and narrow sheen of\r\nthe window. Never see him! I saw him clearly enough then. I shall see\r\nthis eloquent phantom as long as I live, and I shall see her, too, a\r\ntragic and familiar Shade, resembling in this gesture another one,\r\ntragic also, and bedecked with powerless charms, stretching bare brown\r\narms over the glitter of the infernal stream, the stream of darkness.\r\nShe said suddenly very low, \xe2\x80\x98He died as he lived.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98His end,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, with dull anger stirring in me, \xe2\x80\x98was in every way\r\nworthy of his life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And I was not with him,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured. My anger subsided before a\r\nfeeling of infinite pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Everything that could be done\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 I mumbled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ah, but I believed in him more than any one on earth\xe2\x80\x94more than his\r\nown mother, more than\xe2\x80\x94himself. He needed me! Me! I would have treasured\r\nevery sigh, every word, every sign, every glance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt like a chill grip on my chest. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, in a muffled\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Forgive me. I\xe2\x80\x94I have mourned so long in silence\xe2\x80\x94in silence.... You\r\nwere with him\xe2\x80\x94to the last? I think of his loneliness. Nobody near to\r\nunderstand him as I would have understood. Perhaps no one to hear....\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98To the very end,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, shakily. \xe2\x80\x98I heard his very last words....\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI stopped in a fright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Repeat them,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured in a heart-broken tone. \xe2\x80\x98I want\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwant\xe2\x80\x94something\xe2\x80\x94something\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94to live with.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was on the point of crying at her, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear them?\xe2\x80\x99 The dusk\r\nwas repeating them in a persistent whisper all around us, in a whisper\r\nthat seemed to swell menacingly like the first whisper of a rising\r\nwind. \xe2\x80\x98The horror! The horror!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98His last word\xe2\x80\x94to live with,\xe2\x80\x99 she insisted. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand I\r\nloved him\xe2\x80\x94I loved him\xe2\x80\x94I loved him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pulled myself together and spoke slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The last word he pronounced was\xe2\x80\x94your name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard a light sigh and then my heart stood still, stopped dead short\r\nby an exulting and terrible cry, by the cry of inconceivable triumph\r\nand of unspeakable pain. \xe2\x80\x98I knew it\xe2\x80\x94I was sure!\xe2\x80\x99... She knew. She was\r\nsure. I heard her weeping; she had hidden her face in her hands. It\r\nseemed to me that the house would collapse before I could escape, that\r\nthe heavens would fall upon my head. But nothing happened. The heavens\r\ndo not fall for such a trifle. Would they have fallen, I wonder, if I\r\nhad rendered Kurtz that justice which was his due? Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he said he\r\nwanted only justice? But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I could not tell her. It would\r\nhave been too dark\xe2\x80\x94too dark altogether....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarlow ceased, and sat apart, indistinct and silent, in the pose of a\r\nmeditating Buddha. Nobody moved for a time. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have lost the first of\r\nthe ebb,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Director suddenly. I raised my head. The offing was\r\nbarred by a black bank of clouds, and the tranquil waterway leading to\r\nthe uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast\r\nsky\xe2\x80\x94seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HEART OF DARKNESS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 219-0.txt or 219-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/219/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
