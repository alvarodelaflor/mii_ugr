He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes\r\nhe had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his\r\nsword-hilt.\r\n\r\nHe was very much admired indeed.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe is as beautiful as a weathercock,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nremarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for\r\nhaving artistic tastes; \xe2\x80\x9conly not quite so useful,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, fearing\r\nlest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you be like the Happy Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a sensible mother of her\r\nlittle boy who was crying for the moon.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Happy Prince never dreams\r\nof crying for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered a\r\ndisappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks just like an angel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Charity Children as they came out\r\nof the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white\r\npinafores.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mathematical Master, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have never seen\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but we have, in our dreams,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the children; and the\r\nMathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not\r\napprove of children dreaming.\r\n\r\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had\r\ngone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was\r\nin love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring\r\nas he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so\r\nattracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I love you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at\r\nonce, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her,\r\ntouching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was\r\nhis courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a ridiculous attachment,\xe2\x80\x9d twittered the other Swallows; \xe2\x80\x9cshe has\r\nno money, and far too many relations\xe2\x80\x9d; and indeed the river was quite\r\nfull of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.\r\n\r\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has no conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am afraid that she is a\r\ncoquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.\xe2\x80\x9d  And certainly,\r\nwhenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nadmit that she is domestic,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I love travelling, and my\r\nwife, consequently, should love travelling also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come away with me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said finally to her; but the Reed shook\r\nher head, she was so attached to her home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been trifling with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am off to the Pyramids.\r\nGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d and he flew away.\r\n\r\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\nshall I put up?\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI hope the town has made preparations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will put up there,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9cit is a fine position, with plenty of\r\nfresh air.\xe2\x80\x9d  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a golden bedroom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said softly to himself as he looked round,\r\nand he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under\r\nhis wing a large drop of water fell on him.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a curious thing!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear\r\nand bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is\r\nreally dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her\r\nselfishness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen another drop fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust look for a good chimney-pot,\xe2\x80\x9d and he determined to fly away.\r\n\r\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up,\r\nand saw\xe2\x80\x94Ah! what did he see?\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were\r\nrunning down his golden cheeks.  His face was so beautiful in the\r\nmoonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the Happy Prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you weeping then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Swallow; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have quite drenched\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was alive and had a human heart,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the statue, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not\r\nknow what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where\r\nsorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my\r\ncompanions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great\r\nHall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask\r\nwhat lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers\r\ncalled me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be\r\nhappiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have\r\nset me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery\r\nof my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but\r\nweep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! is he not solid gold?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swallow to himself.  He was too\r\npolite to make any personal remarks out loud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar away,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the statue in a low musical voice, \xe2\x80\x9cfar away in a\r\nlittle street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and\r\nthrough it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and\r\nworn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she\r\nis a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for\r\nthe loveliest of the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s maids-of-honour to wear at the next\r\nCourt-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying\r\nill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing\r\nto give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little\r\nSwallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet\r\nare fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waited for in Egypt,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swallow.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy friends are flying up\r\nand down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they\r\nwill go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.  The King is there\r\nhimself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and\r\nembalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and\r\nhis hands are like withered leaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you not stay\r\nwith me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and\r\nthe mother so sad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I like boys,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Swallow.  \xe2\x80\x9cLast summer, when I\r\nwas staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller\xe2\x80\x99s sons,\r\nwho were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we\r\nswallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family\r\nfamous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very cold here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will stay with you for one night,\r\nand be your messenger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, little Swallow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince.\r\n\r\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s sword, and\r\nflew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\r\n\r\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were\r\nsculptured.  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.  A\r\nbeautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow wonderful\r\nthe stars are,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cand how wonderful is the power of love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the\r\nseamstresses are so lazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of\r\nthe ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining\r\nwith each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he\r\ncame to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on\r\nhis bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he\r\nhopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman\xe2\x80\x99s thimble.\r\nThen he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy\xe2\x80\x99s forehead with his\r\nwings.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow cool I feel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, \xe2\x80\x9cI must be getting better\xe2\x80\x9d; and\r\nhe sank into a delicious slumber.\r\n\r\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had\r\ndone.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is curious,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I feel quite warm now, although\r\nit is so cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is because you have done a good action,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince.  And the\r\nlittle Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.  Thinking always\r\nmade him sleepy.\r\n\r\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\r\nremarkable phenomenon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor of Ornithology as he was\r\npassing over the bridge.  \xe2\x80\x9cA swallow in winter!\xe2\x80\x9d  And he wrote a long\r\nletter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full\r\nof so many words that they could not understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night I go to Egypt,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at\r\nthe prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time\r\non top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped,\r\nand said to each other, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a distinguished stranger!\xe2\x80\x9d so he enjoyed\r\nhimself very much.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any\r\ncommissions for Egypt?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9cI am just starting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you not stay\r\nwith me one night longer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waited for in Egypt,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Swallow.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow my friends\r\nwill fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among\r\nthe bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All\r\nnight long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he\r\nutters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions\r\ncome down to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge to drink.  They have eyes like green\r\nberyls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cfar away across the\r\ncity I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered\r\nwith papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered\r\nviolets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a\r\npomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a\r\nplay for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any\r\nmore.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will wait with you one night longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swallow, who really had\r\na good heart.  \xe2\x80\x9cShall I take him another ruby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!  I have no ruby now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince; \xe2\x80\x9cmy eyes are all that I\r\nhave left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of\r\nIndia a thousand years ago.  Pluck out one of them and take it to him.\r\nHe will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish\r\nhis play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swallow, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot do that\xe2\x80\x9d; and he began to\r\nweep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cdo as I command\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the Swallow plucked out the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and flew away to the\r\nstudent\xe2\x80\x99s garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in\r\nthe roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man\r\nhad his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the\r\nbird\xe2\x80\x99s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying\r\non the withered violets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am beginning to be appreciated,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is from some great\r\nadmirer.  Now I can finish my play,\xe2\x80\x9d and he looked quite happy.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of\r\na large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold\r\nwith ropes.  \xe2\x80\x9cHeave a-hoy!\xe2\x80\x9d they shouted as each chest came up.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ngoing to Egypt\xe2\x80\x9d! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon\r\nrose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am come to bid you good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you not stay\r\nwith me one night longer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is winter,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Swallow, \xe2\x80\x9cand the chill snow will soon be\r\nhere.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the\r\ncrocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are\r\nbuilding a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves\r\nare watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave\r\nyou, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back\r\ntwo beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby\r\nshall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the\r\ngreat sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the square below,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Happy Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cthere stands a little\r\nmatch-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all\r\nspoiled.  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money,\r\nand she is crying.  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is\r\nbare.  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will\r\nnot beat her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will stay with you one night longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swallow, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I cannot\r\npluck out your eye.  You would be quite blind then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cdo as I command\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he plucked out the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s other eye, and darted down with it.  He\r\nswooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her\r\nhand.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lovely bit of glass,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the little girl; and she ran\r\nhome, laughing.\r\n\r\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou are blind now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cso I will stay with you always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, little Swallow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must go away to Egypt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will stay with you always,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swallow, and he slept at the\r\nPrince\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and told him stories of\r\nwhat he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who\r\nstand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their\r\nbeaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the\r\ndesert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the\r\nside of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King\r\nof the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a\r\nlarge crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and\r\nhas twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who\r\nsail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the\r\nbutterflies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear little Swallow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cyou tell me of marvellous\r\nthings, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of\r\nwomen.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little\r\nSwallow, and tell me what you see there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in\r\ntheir beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He\r\nflew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children\r\nlooking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a\r\nbridge two little boys were lying in one another\xe2\x80\x99s arms to try and keep\r\nthemselves warm.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow hungry we are!\xe2\x80\x9d they said.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou must not lie\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\r\n\r\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am covered with fine gold,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must take it off,\r\nleaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold\r\ncan make them happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy\r\nPrince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he\r\nbrought to the poor, and the children\xe2\x80\x99s faces grew rosier, and they\r\nlaughed and played games in the street.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe have bread now!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried.\r\n\r\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets\r\nlooked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and\r\nglistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of\r\nthe houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore\r\nscarlet caps and skated on the ice.\r\n\r\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave\r\nthe Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the\r\nbaker\xe2\x80\x99s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself\r\nwarm by flapping his wings.\r\n\r\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to\r\nfly up to the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder once more.  \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, dear Prince!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmurmured, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you let me kiss your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nPrince, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips,\r\nfor I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not to Egypt that I am going,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swallow.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to\r\nthe House of Death.  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something\r\nhad broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.\r\nIt certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in\r\ncompany with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked\r\nup at the statue: \xe2\x80\x9cDear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow shabby indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with\r\nthe Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is\r\ngolden no longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mayor in fact, \xe2\x80\x9che is litttle better than a\r\nbeggar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle better than a beggar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Town Councillors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here is actually a dead bird at his feet!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Mayor.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nmust really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.\r\n\r\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  \xe2\x80\x9cAs he is no longer\r\nbeautiful he is no longer useful,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Art Professor at the\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of\r\nthe Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe must\r\nhave another statue, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand it shall be a statue of\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.\r\nWhen I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a strange thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  We must throw it\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also\r\nlying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me the two most precious things in the city,\xe2\x80\x9d said God to one of\r\nHis Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have rightly chosen,\xe2\x80\x9d said God, \xe2\x80\x9cfor in my garden of Paradise this\r\nlittle bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy\r\nPrince shall praise me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                [Picture: Decorative graphic of two birds]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nightingale and the Rose.\r\n\r\n\r\n        [Picture: Decorative graphic of young man lying on grass]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nthe young Student; \xe2\x80\x9cbut in all my garden there is no red rose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she\r\nlooked out through the leaves, and wondered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo red rose in all my garden!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled\r\nwith tears.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh, on what little things does happiness depend!  I have\r\nread all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of\r\nphilosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made\r\nwretched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere at last is a true lover,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nightingale.  \xe2\x80\x9cNight after night\r\nhave I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told\r\nhis story to the stars, and now I see him.  His hair is dark as the\r\nhyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but\r\npassion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal\r\nupon his brow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the young Student,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand my love will be of the company.  If I bring her a red rose she will\r\ndance with me till dawn.  If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in\r\nmy arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will\r\nbe clasped in mine.  But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall\r\nsit lonely, and she will pass me by.  She will have no heed of me, and my\r\nheart will break.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere indeed is the true lover,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nightingale.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I sing of,\r\nhe suffers\xe2\x80\x94what is joy to me, to him is pain.  Surely Love is a wonderful\r\nthing.  It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.\r\nPearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the\r\nmarketplace.  It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be\r\nweighed out in the balance for gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe musicians will sit in their gallery,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young Student, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nplay upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound\r\nof the harp and the violin.  She will dance so lightly that her feet will\r\nnot touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng\r\nround her.  But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to\r\ngive her\xe2\x80\x9d; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in\r\nhis hands, and wept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is he weeping?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with\r\nhis tail in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a\r\nsunbeam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is weeping for a red rose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nightingale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a red rose?\xe2\x80\x9d they cried; \xe2\x80\x9chow very ridiculous!\xe2\x80\x9d and the little\r\nLizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.\r\n\r\nBut the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow, and\r\nshe sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.\r\nShe passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed\r\nacross the garden.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and\r\nwhen she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a red rose,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will sing you my sweetest song.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Tree shook its head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy roses are white,\xe2\x80\x9d it answered; \xe2\x80\x9cas white as the foam of the sea, and\r\nwhiter than the snow upon the mountain.  But go to my brother who grows\r\nround the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the\r\nold sun-dial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a red rose,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will sing you my sweetest song.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Tree shook its head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy roses are yellow,\xe2\x80\x9d it answered; \xe2\x80\x9cas yellow as the hair of the\r\nmermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil\r\nthat blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.  But go\r\nto my brother who grows beneath the Student\xe2\x80\x99s window, and perhaps he will\r\ngive you what you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath\r\nthe Student\xe2\x80\x99s window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a red rose,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will sing you my sweetest song.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Tree shook its head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy roses are red,\xe2\x80\x9d it answered, \xe2\x80\x9cas red as the feet of the dove, and\r\nredder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the\r\nocean-cavern.  But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has\r\nnipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no\r\nroses at all this year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne red rose is all I want,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Nightingale, \xe2\x80\x9conly one red rose!\r\nIs there no way by which I can get it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a way,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Tree; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is so terrible that I dare\r\nnot tell it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell it to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nightingale, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want a red rose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Tree, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must build it out of music\r\nby moonlight, and stain it with your own heart\xe2\x80\x99s-blood.  You must sing to\r\nme with your breast against a thorn.  All night long you must sing to me,\r\nand the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into\r\nmy veins, and become mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeath is a great price to pay for a red rose,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Nightingale,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand Life is very dear to all.  It is pleasant to sit in the green wood,\r\nand to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot\r\nof pearl.  Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the\r\nbluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the\r\nhill.  Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird\r\ncompared to the heart of a man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.  She\r\nswept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through\r\nthe grove.\r\n\r\nThe young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him,\r\nand the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe happy,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Nightingale, \xe2\x80\x9cbe happy; you shall have your red\r\nrose.  I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my\r\nown heart\xe2\x80\x99s-blood.  All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a\r\ntrue lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and\r\nmightier than Power, though he is mighty.  Flame-coloured are his wings,\r\nand coloured like flame is his body.  His lips are sweet as honey, and\r\nhis breath is like frankincense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not\r\nunderstand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the\r\nthings that are written down in books.\r\n\r\nBut the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the\r\nlittle Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSing me one last song,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall feel very lonely when you\r\nare gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water\r\nbubbling from a silver jar.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book\r\nand a lead-pencil out of his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has form,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, as he walked away through the\r\ngrove\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?  I am\r\nafraid not.  In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without\r\nany sincerity.  She would not sacrifice herself for others.  She thinks\r\nmerely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.  Still,\r\nit must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.  What\r\na pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and\r\nbegan to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nAnd when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the\r\nRose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.  All night long she sang\r\nwith her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down\r\nand listened.  All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and\r\ndeeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.\r\n\r\nShe sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.\r\nAnd on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous\r\nrose, petal following petal, as song followed song.  Pale was it, at\r\nfirst, as the mist that hangs over the river\xe2\x80\x94pale as the feet of the\r\nmorning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.  As the shadow of a rose in\r\na mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the\r\nrose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.\r\n\r\nBut the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPress closer, little Nightingale,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Tree, \xe2\x80\x9cor the Day will come\r\nbefore the rose is finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and\r\nlouder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of\r\na man and a maid.\r\n\r\nAnd a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the\r\nflush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.\r\nBut the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose\xe2\x80\x99s heart remained\r\nwhite, for only a Nightingale\xe2\x80\x99s heart\xe2\x80\x99s-blood can crimson the heart of a\r\nrose.\r\n\r\nAnd the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPress closer, little Nightingale,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Tree, \xe2\x80\x9cor the Day will come\r\nbefore the rose is finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn\r\ntouched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.  Bitter,\r\nbitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of\r\nthe Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\nAnd the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.\r\nCrimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.\r\n\r\nBut the Nightingale\xe2\x80\x99s voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to\r\nbeat, and a film came over her eyes.  Fainter and fainter grew her song,\r\nand she felt something choking her in her throat.\r\n\r\nThen she gave one last burst of music.  The white Moon heard it, and she\r\nforgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.  The red rose heard it, and\r\nit trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold\r\nmorning air.  Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke\r\nthe sleeping shepherds from their dreams.  It floated through the reeds\r\nof the river, and they carried its message to the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, look!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Tree, \xe2\x80\x9cthe rose is finished now\xe2\x80\x9d; but the\r\nNightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass,\r\nwith the thorn in her heart.\r\n\r\nAnd at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what a wonderful piece of luck!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9chere is a red rose!  I\r\nhave never seen any rose like it in all my life.  It is so beautiful that\r\nI am sure it has a long Latin name\xe2\x80\x9d; and he leaned down and plucked it.\r\n\r\nThen he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor\xe2\x80\x99s house with the rose\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue\r\nsilk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried the Student.  \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the reddest rose in all the world.  You will\r\nwear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell\r\nyou how I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the girl frowned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid it will not go with my dress,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; \xe2\x80\x9cand, besides,\r\nthe Chamberlain\xe2\x80\x99s nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody\r\nknows that jewels cost far more than flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Student angrily;\r\nand he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and\r\na cart-wheel went over it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUngrateful!\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl.  \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what, you are very rude; and,\r\nafter all, who are you?  Only a Student.  Why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you have\r\neven got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain\xe2\x80\x99s nephew has\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand she got up from her chair and went into the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a silly thing Love is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Student as he walked away.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is\r\nalways telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one\r\nbelieve things that are not true.  In fact, it is quite unpractical, and,\r\nas in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to\r\nPhilosophy and study Metaphysics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began\r\nto read.\r\n\r\n          [Picture: Decorative graphic of nightingale and rose]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Selfish Giant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       [Picture: The Selfish Giant]\r\n\r\nEVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go\r\nand play in the Giant\xe2\x80\x99s garden.\r\n\r\nIt was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass.  Here and there over\r\nthe grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve\r\npeach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of\r\npink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit.  The birds sat on the\r\ntrees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in\r\norder to listen to them.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow happy we are here!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n           [Picture: Decorative graphic of children in garden]\r\n\r\nOne day the Giant came back.  He had been to visit his friend the Cornish\r\nogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.  After the seven years\r\nwere over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was\r\nlimited, and he determined to return to his own castle.  When he arrived\r\nhe saw the children playing in the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in a very gruff voice, and the\r\nchildren ran away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own garden is my own garden,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Giant; \xe2\x80\x9cany one can understand\r\nthat, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.\xe2\x80\x9d  So he built a\r\nhigh wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.\r\n\r\n          TRESPASSERS\r\n\r\n            WILL BE\r\n\r\n           PROSECUTED\r\n\r\nHe was a very selfish Giant.\r\n\r\nThe poor children had now nowhere to play.  They tried to play on the\r\nroad, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did\r\nnot like it.  They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons\r\nwere over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow happy we\r\nwere there,\xe2\x80\x9d they said to each other.\r\n\r\nThen the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms\r\nand little birds.  Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still\r\nwinter.  The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children,\r\nand the trees forgot to blossom.  Once a beautiful flower put its head\r\nout from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for\r\nthe children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to\r\nsleep.  The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpring has forgotten this garden,\xe2\x80\x9d they cried, \xe2\x80\x9cso we will live here all\r\nthe year round.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Snow covered up the grass with her great white\r\ncloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver.  Then they invited the\r\nNorth Wind to stay with them, and he came.  He was wrapped in furs, and\r\nhe roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a delightful spot,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must ask the Hail on a visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSo the Hail came.  Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of\r\nthe castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and\r\nround the garden as fast as he could go.  He was dressed in grey, and his\r\nbreath was like ice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nSelfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white\r\ngarden; \xe2\x80\x9cI hope there will be a change in the weather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Spring never came, nor the Summer.  The Autumn gave golden fruit\r\nto every garden, but to the Giant\xe2\x80\x99s garden she gave none.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe is too\r\nselfish,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind,\r\nand the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.\r\n\r\nOne morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely\r\nmusic.  It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s musicians passing by.  It was really only a little linnet singing\r\noutside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in\r\nhis garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the\r\nworld.  Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind\r\nceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open\r\ncasement.  \xe2\x80\x9cI believe the Spring has come at last,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Giant; and\r\nhe jumped out of bed and looked out.\r\n\r\nWhat did he see?\r\n\r\nHe saw a most wonderful sight.  Through a little hole in the wall the\r\nchildren had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the\r\ntrees.  In every tree that he could see there was a little child.  And\r\nthe trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had\r\ncovered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above\r\nthe children\xe2\x80\x99s heads.  The birds were flying about and twittering with\r\ndelight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and\r\nlaughing.  It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.\r\nIt was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little\r\nboy.  He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the\r\ntree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.  The poor tree\r\nwas still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was\r\nblowing and roaring above it.  \xe2\x80\x9cClimb up! little boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Tree, and\r\nit bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.\r\n\r\nAnd the Giant\xe2\x80\x99s heart melted as he looked out.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow selfish I have\r\nbeen!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cnow I know why the Spring would not come here.  I will\r\nput that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock\r\ndown the wall, and my garden shall be the children\xe2\x80\x99s playground for ever\r\nand ever.\xe2\x80\x9d  He was really very sorry for what he had done.\r\n\r\nSo he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went\r\nout into the garden.  But when the children saw him they were so\r\nfrightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.\r\nOnly the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that\r\nhe did not see the Giant coming.  And the Giant stole up behind him and\r\ntook him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.  And the tree\r\nbroke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the\r\nlittle boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneck, and kissed him.  And the other children, when they saw that the\r\nGiant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came\r\nthe Spring.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is your garden now, little children,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Giant,\r\nand he took a great axe and knocked down the wall.  And when the people\r\nwere going to market at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock they found the Giant playing with\r\nthe children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.\r\n\r\nAll day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to\r\nbid him good-bye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where is your little companion?\xe2\x80\x9d he said: \xe2\x80\x9cthe boy I put into the\r\ntree.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the children; \xe2\x80\x9che has gone away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Giant.\r\nBut the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had\r\nnever seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.\r\n\r\nEvery afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with\r\nthe Giant.  But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.\r\nThe Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first\r\nlittle friend, and often spoke of him.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow I would like to see him!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nused to say.\r\n\r\nYears went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble.  He could not\r\nplay about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the\r\nchildren at their games, and admired his garden.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have many beautiful\r\nflowers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the children are the most beautiful flowers of\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing.  He\r\ndid not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring\r\nasleep, and that the flowers were resting.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked.  It\r\ncertainly was a marvellous sight.  In the farthest corner of the garden\r\nwas a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.  Its branches were\r\nall golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood\r\nthe little boy he had loved.\r\n\r\nDownstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden.  He\r\nhastened across the grass, and came near to the child.  And when he came\r\nquite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWho hath dared to\r\nwound thee?\xe2\x80\x9d  For on the palms of the child\xe2\x80\x99s hands were the prints of\r\ntwo nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho hath dared to wound thee?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Giant; \xe2\x80\x9ctell me, that I may\r\ntake my big sword and slay him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the child; \xe2\x80\x9cbut these are the wounds of Love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he\r\nknelt before the little child.\r\n\r\nAnd the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou let me play once\r\nin your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is\r\nParadise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying\r\ndead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.\r\n\r\n                 [Picture: Decorative graphic of wreath]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Devoted Friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Hans and the Miller]\r\n\r\nONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.  He had\r\nbright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long\r\nbit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming about in the\r\npond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who\r\nwas pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand\r\non their heads in the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your\r\nheads,\xe2\x80\x9d she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them\r\nhow it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.  They\r\nwere so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in\r\nsociety at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat disobedient children!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old Water-rat; \xe2\x80\x9cthey really\r\ndeserve to be drowned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the kind,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Duck, \xe2\x80\x9cevery one must make a\r\nbeginning, and parents cannot be too patient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Water-rat;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married, and I never\r\nintend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much\r\nhigher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or\r\nrarer than a devoted friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a\r\nGreen Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is just what I want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duck; and she swam away\r\nto the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her\r\nchildren a good example.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a silly question!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Water-rat.  \xe2\x80\x9cI should expect my\r\ndevoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what would you do in return?\xe2\x80\x9d said the little bird, swinging upon a\r\nsilver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Water-rat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you a story on the subject,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Linnet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the story about me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Water-rat.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf so, I will listen to\r\nit, for I am extremely fond of fiction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is applicable to you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and\r\nalighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce upon a time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Linnet, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was an honest little fellow\r\nnamed Hans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he very distinguished?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Water-rat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Linnet, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he was distinguished at all,\r\nexcept for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.  He\r\nlived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his\r\ngarden.  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.\r\nSweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds\xe2\x80\x99-purses, and\r\nFair-maids of France.  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac\r\nCrocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock,\r\nMarjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil\r\nand the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the\r\nmonths went by, one flower taking another flower\xe2\x80\x99s place, so that there\r\nwere always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all\r\nwas big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to\r\nlittle Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over\r\nthe wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or\r\nfilling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Real friends should have everything in common,\xe2\x80\x99 the Miller used to say,\r\nand little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend\r\nwith such noble ideas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich\r\nMiller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred\r\nsacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large\r\nflock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these\r\nthings, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the\r\nwonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the\r\nsummer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and\r\nhe had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good\r\ndeal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper\r\nbut a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the winter, also, he was\r\nextremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow\r\nlasts,\xe2\x80\x99 the Miller used to say to his wife, \xe2\x80\x98for when people are in\r\ntrouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.  That\r\nat least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.  So I\r\nshall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and\r\nhe will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make\r\nhim so happy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You are certainly very thoughtful about others,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the Wife, as\r\nshe sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; \xe2\x80\x98very\r\nthoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about\r\nfriendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful\r\nthings as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear\r\na gold ring on his little finger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But could we not ask little Hans up here?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller\xe2\x80\x99s youngest\r\nson.  \xe2\x80\x98If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and\r\nshow him my white rabbits.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What a silly boy you are!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the Miller; \xe2\x80\x98I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nis the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn anything.\r\nWhy, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good\r\nsupper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is\r\na most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody\xe2\x80\x99s nature.  I certainly\r\nwill not allow Hans\xe2\x80\x99 nature to be spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I\r\nwill always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any\r\ntemptations.  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have\r\nsome flour on credit, and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and\r\nfriendship is another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words\r\nare spelt differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can\r\nsee that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How well you talk!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller\xe2\x80\x99s Wife, pouring herself out a large\r\nglass of warm ale; \xe2\x80\x98really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just like being in\r\nchurch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Lots of people act well,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the Miller; \xe2\x80\x98but very few people\r\ntalk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of\r\nthe two, and much the finer thing also\xe2\x80\x99; and he looked sternly across the\r\ntable at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his\r\nhead down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.\r\nHowever, he was so young that you must excuse him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the end of the story?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Water-rat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Linnet, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are quite behind the age,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Water-rat.  \xe2\x80\x9cEvery good\r\nstory-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the\r\nbeginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new method.  I\r\nheard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the\r\npond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am\r\nsure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head,\r\nand whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered \xe2\x80\x98Pooh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut pray go on with your story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all\r\nkinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy\r\nbetween us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nsoon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale\r\nyellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see\r\nlittle Hans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why, what a good heart you have!\xe2\x80\x99 cried his Wife; \xe2\x80\x98you are always\r\nthinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for the\r\nflowers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron\r\nchain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Good morning, little Hans,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Good morning,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to\r\near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And how have you been all the winter?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, really,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Hans, \xe2\x80\x98it is very good of you to ask, very good\r\nindeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring\r\nhas come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nwondered how you were getting on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That was kind of you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hans; \xe2\x80\x98I was half afraid you had forgotten\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Hans, I am surprised at you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller; \xe2\x80\x98friendship never\r\nforgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are looking,\r\nby-the-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98They are certainly very lovely,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hans, \xe2\x80\x98and it is a most lucky\r\nthing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them into the\r\nmarket and sell them to the Burgomaster\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and buy back my\r\nwheelbarrow with the money.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you have sold it?\r\nWhat a very stupid thing to do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, the fact is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hans, \xe2\x80\x98that I was obliged to.  You see the\r\nwinter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to\r\nbuy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,\r\nand then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last\r\nI sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy them all back again now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Hans,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller, \xe2\x80\x98I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is not in\r\nvery good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong\r\nwith the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.  I\r\nknow it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me\r\nextremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the\r\nworld.  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and,\r\nbesides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.  Yes, you may set your\r\nmind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, really, that is generous of you,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Hans, and his funny\r\nround face glowed all over with pleasure.  \xe2\x80\x98I can easily put it in\r\nrepair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A plank of wood!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller; \xe2\x80\x98why, that is just what I want for\r\nthe roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will\r\nall get damp if I don\xe2\x80\x99t stop it up.  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is\r\nquite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.  I have given\r\nyou my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.  Of\r\ncourse, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true,\r\nfriendship never notices things like that.  Pray get it at once, and I\r\nwill set to work at my barn this very day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the\r\nplank out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is not a very big plank,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller, looking at it, \xe2\x80\x98and I am\r\nafraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any left for\r\nyou to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault.\r\nAnd now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to\r\ngive me some flowers in return.  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it\r\nquite full.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Quite full?\xe2\x80\x99 said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a\r\nvery big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no\r\nflowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver\r\nbuttons back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, really,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the Miller, \xe2\x80\x98as I have given you my\r\nwheelbarrow, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.\r\nI may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true\r\nfriendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My dear friend, my best friend,\xe2\x80\x99 cried little Hans, \xe2\x80\x98you are welcome to\r\nall the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have your good opinion\r\nthan my silver buttons, any day\xe2\x80\x99; and he ran and plucked all his pretty\r\nprimroses, and filled the Miller\xe2\x80\x99s basket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, little Hans,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller, as he went up the hill with\r\nthe plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he\r\nwas so pleased about the wheelbarrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when\r\nhe heard the Miller\xe2\x80\x99s voice calling to him from the road.  So he jumped\r\noff the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Dear little Hans,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller, \xe2\x80\x98would you mind carrying this sack\r\nof flour for me to market?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I am so sorry,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hans, \xe2\x80\x98but I am really very busy to-day.  I\r\nhave got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all\r\nmy grass to roll.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, really,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller, \xe2\x80\x98I think that, considering that I am\r\ngoing to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to\r\nrefuse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that,\xe2\x80\x99 cried little Hans, \xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be unfriendly for\r\nthe whole world\xe2\x80\x99; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big\r\nsack on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans\r\nhad reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down\r\nand rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the\r\nmarket.  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour\r\nfor a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was\r\nafraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It has certainly been a hard day,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Hans to himself as he\r\nwas going to bed, \xe2\x80\x98but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is\r\nmy best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEarly the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his\r\nsack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller, \xe2\x80\x98you are very lazy.  Really,\r\nconsidering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might\r\nwork harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t like any of\r\nmy friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind my speaking quite\r\nplainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not\r\nyour friend.  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say\r\nexactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to\r\nplease and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things,\r\nand does not mind giving pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he\r\nprefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off\r\nhis night-cap, \xe2\x80\x98but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for\r\na little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you know that I\r\nalways work better after hearing the birds sing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, I am glad of that,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the\r\nback, \xe2\x80\x98for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed,\r\nand mend my barn-roof for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his\r\nflowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse\r\nthe Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ninquired in a shy and timid voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, really,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the Miller, \xe2\x80\x98I do not think it is much to ask\r\nof you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of\r\ncourse if you refuse I will go and do it myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh! on no account,\xe2\x80\x99 cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and\r\ndressed himself, and went up to the barn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came\r\nto see how he was getting on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?\xe2\x80\x99 cried the\r\nMiller in a cheery voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is quite mended,\xe2\x80\x99 answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller, \xe2\x80\x98there is no work so delightful as the work one\r\ndoes for others.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,\xe2\x80\x99 answered little\r\nHans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, \xe2\x80\x98a very great privilege.\r\nBut I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh! they will come to you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller, \xe2\x80\x98but you must take more\r\npains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you\r\nwill have the theory also.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do you really think I shall?\xe2\x80\x99 asked little Hans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I have no doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the Miller, \xe2\x80\x98but now that you have\r\nmended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive\r\nmy sheep to the mountain to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next\r\nmorning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans\r\nstarted off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole day to get\r\nthere and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to\r\nsleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, and he went\r\nto work at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his\r\nfriend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long\r\nerrands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little Hans was very much\r\ndistressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had\r\nforgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller\r\nwas his best friend.  \xe2\x80\x98Besides,\xe2\x80\x99 he used to say, \xe2\x80\x98he is going to give me\r\nhis wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds\r\nof beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a\r\nnote-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good\r\nscholar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside\r\nwhen a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild night, and the wind\r\nwas blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he\r\nthought it was merely the storm.  But a second rap came, and then a\r\nthird, louder than any of the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is some poor traveller,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Hans to himself, and he ran to\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Dear little Hans,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the Miller, \xe2\x80\x98I am in great trouble.  My little\r\nboy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the\r\nDoctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it\r\nhas just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead\r\nof me.  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is\r\nonly fair that you should do something for me in return.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 cried little Hans, \xe2\x80\x98I take it quite as a compliment your\r\ncoming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend me your\r\nlantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the\r\nditch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the Miller, \xe2\x80\x98but it is my new lantern, and\r\nit would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, never mind, I will do without it,\xe2\x80\x99 cried little Hans, and he took\r\ndown his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler\r\nround his throat, and started off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans\r\ncould hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely\r\nstand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking\r\nabout three hours, he arrived at the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s house, and knocked at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Who is there?\xe2\x80\x99 cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Little Hans, Doctor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99What do you want, little Hans?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Miller\xe2\x80\x99s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and\r\nthe Miller wants you to come at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98All right!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big\r\nboots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the\r\ndirection of the Miller\xe2\x80\x99s house, little Hans trudging behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and\r\nlittle Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.\r\nAt last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very\r\ndangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans\r\nwas drowned.  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating\r\nin a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody went to little Hans\xe2\x80\x99 funeral, as he was so popular, and the\r\nMiller was the chief mourner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98As I was his best friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Miller, \xe2\x80\x98it is only fair that I\r\nshould have the best place\xe2\x80\x99; so he walked at the head of the procession\r\nin a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a\r\nbig pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nBlacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated\r\ncomfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A great loss to me at any rate,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the Miller; \xe2\x80\x98why, I had as\r\ngood as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do\r\nwith it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair\r\nthat I could not get anything for it if I sold it.  I will certainly take\r\ncare not to give away anything again.  One always suffers for being\r\ngenerous.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Water-rat, after a long pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is the end,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Linnet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what became of the Miller?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Water-rat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!  I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Linnet; \xe2\x80\x9cand I am sure that I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Water-rat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see the moral of the story,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the\r\nLinnet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe what?\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the Water-rat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe moral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say that the story has a moral?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Linnet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, really,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\r\nshould have told me that before you began.  If you had done so, I\r\ncertainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh,\xe2\x80\x99 like the critic.  However, I can say it now\xe2\x80\x9d; so he shouted out\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh\xe2\x80\x9d at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back\r\ninto his hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you like the Water-rat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duck, who came paddling up\r\nsome minutes afterwards.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe has a great many good points, but for my\r\nown part I have a mother\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed\r\nbachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Linnet.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nfact is, that I told him a story with a moral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duck.\r\n\r\nAnd I quite agree with her.\r\n\r\n     [Picture: Decorative graphic of windmill and overturned barrow]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Remarkable Rocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Picture: The Remarkable Rocket]\r\n\r\nTHE King\xe2\x80\x99s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.\r\nHe had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.\r\nShe was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a\r\nsledge drawn by six reindeer.  The sledge was shaped like a great golden\r\nswan, and between the swan\xe2\x80\x99s wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her\r\nlong ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny\r\ncap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she\r\nhad always lived.  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets\r\nall the people wondered.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe is like a white rose!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried, and\r\nthey threw down flowers on her from the balconies.\r\n\r\n  [Picture: Decorative graphic of young man kissing the princess\xe2\x80\x99 hand]\r\n\r\nAt the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had\r\ndreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he\r\nsank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour picture was beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are more beautiful\r\nthan your picture\xe2\x80\x9d; and the little Princess blushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was like a white rose before,\xe2\x80\x9d said a young Page to his neighbour,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut she is like a red rose now\xe2\x80\x9d; and the whole Court was delighted.\r\n\r\nFor the next three days everybody went about saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhite rose, Red\r\nrose, Red rose, White rose\xe2\x80\x9d; and the King gave orders that the Page\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsalary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not\r\nof much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly\r\npublished in the Court Gazette.\r\n\r\nWhen the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a\r\nmagnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand\r\nunder a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then\r\nthere was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and\r\nPrincess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear\r\ncrystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips\r\ntouched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite clear that they love each other,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little Page, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nclear as crystal!\xe2\x80\x9d and the King doubled his salary a second time.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nan honour!\xe2\x80\x9d cried all the courtiers.\r\n\r\nAfter the banquet there was to be a Ball.  The bride and bridegroom were\r\nto dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the\r\nflute.  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so,\r\nbecause he was the King.  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never\r\nquite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for,\r\nwhatever he did, everybody cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cCharming! charming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be\r\nlet off exactly at midnight.  The little Princess had never seen a\r\nfirework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal\r\nPyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are fireworks like?\xe2\x80\x9d she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she\r\nwas walking on the terrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are like the Aurora Borealis,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, who always answered\r\nquestions that were addressed to other people, \xe2\x80\x9conly much more natural.\r\nI prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to\r\nappear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.  You must\r\ncertainly see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo at the end of the King\xe2\x80\x99s garden a great stand had been set up, and as\r\nsoon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place,\r\nthe fireworks began to talk to each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe world is certainly very beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d cried a little Squib.  \xe2\x80\x9cJust\r\nlook at those yellow tulips.  Why! if they were real crackers they could\r\nnot be lovelier.  I am very glad I have travelled.  Travel improves the\r\nmind wonderfully, and does away with all one\xe2\x80\x99s prejudices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King\xe2\x80\x99s garden is not the world, you foolish squib,\xe2\x80\x9d said a big Roman\r\nCandle; \xe2\x80\x9cthe world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days\r\nto see it thoroughly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny place you love is the world to you,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed a pensive Catherine\r\nWheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided\r\nherself on her broken heart; \xe2\x80\x9cbut love is not fashionable any more, the\r\npoets have killed it.  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed\r\nthem, and I am not surprised.  True love suffers, and is silent.  I\r\nremember myself once\xe2\x80\x94But it is no matter now.  Romance is a thing of the\r\npast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Roman Candle, \xe2\x80\x9cRomance never dies.  It is like the\r\nmoon, and lives for ever.  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love\r\neach other very dearly.  I heard all about them this morning from a\r\nbrown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as\r\nmyself, and knew the latest Court news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Catherine Wheel shook her head.  \xe2\x80\x9cRomance is dead, Romance is\r\ndead, Romance is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.  She was one of those people who\r\nthink that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times,\r\nit becomes true in the end.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.\r\n\r\nIt came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end\r\nof a long stick.  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as\r\nto attract attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAhem! ahem!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine\r\nWheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, \xe2\x80\x9cRomance is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrder! order!\xe2\x80\x9d cried out a Cracker.  He was something of a politician,\r\nand had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew\r\nthe proper Parliamentary expressions to use.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite dead,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.\r\n\r\nAs soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and\r\nbegan.  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating\r\nhis memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he\r\nwas talking.  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow fortunate it is for the King\xe2\x80\x99s son,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he is to be\r\nmarried on the very day on which I am to be let off.  Really, if it had\r\nbeen arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him;\r\nbut, Princes are always lucky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the little Squib, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was quite the other way,\r\nand that we were to be let off in the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be so with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; \xe2\x80\x9cindeed, I have no doubt that it\r\nis, but with me it is different.  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come\r\nof remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel\r\nof her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her\r\ngreat public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went\r\nout, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink\r\nstars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very\r\nbest gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French\r\nextraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would\r\nnever come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly\r\ndisposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden\r\nrain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering\r\nterms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic\r\nart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Bengal Light; \xe2\x80\x9cI know it is\r\nPyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I said Pylotechnic,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of\r\nvoice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to\r\nbully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of\r\nsome importance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was saying,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Rocket, \xe2\x80\x9cI was saying\xe2\x80\x94What was I saying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were talking about yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Roman Candle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was\r\nso rudely interrupted.  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind,\r\nfor I am extremely sensitive.  No one in the whole world is so sensitive\r\nas I am, I am quite sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a sensitive person?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s toes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the\r\nCracker nearly exploded with laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, what are you laughing at?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Rocket; \xe2\x80\x9cI am not\r\nlaughing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am laughing because I am happy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Cracker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a very selfish reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket angrily.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat right\r\nhave you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.  In fact, you\r\nshould be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I\r\nexpect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy.\r\nIt is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose,\r\nfor instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that\r\nwould be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy\r\nagain, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I\r\nknow he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the\r\nimportance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to give pleasure to others,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Roman Candle, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nhad better keep yourself dry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat is only common sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommon sense, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket indignantly; \xe2\x80\x9cyou forget that I\r\nam very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common\r\nsense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination,\r\nfor I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as\r\nbeing quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no\r\none here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for\r\nmyself, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is\r\nthe consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this\r\nis a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any\r\nhearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and\r\nPrincess had not just been married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, really,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not?  It is a most\r\njoyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the\r\nstars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about\r\nthe pretty bride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! what a trivial view of life!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is only what\r\nI expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why,\r\nperhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there\r\nis a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little\r\nfair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps\r\nsome day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may\r\ngo to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall\r\ninto the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor\r\npeople, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall\r\nnever get over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they have not lost their only son,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Roman Candle; \xe2\x80\x9cno\r\nmisfortune has happened to them at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never said that they had,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rocket; \xe2\x80\x9cI said that they\r\nmight.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying\r\nanything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.\r\nBut when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very\r\nmuch affected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly are!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Bengal Light.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, you are the most\r\naffected person I ever met.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the rudest person I ever met,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket, \xe2\x80\x9cand you cannot\r\nunderstand my friendship for the Prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know him,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the Roman Candle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never said I knew him,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Rocket.  \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say that if I\r\nknew him I should not be his friend at all.  It is a very dangerous thing\r\nto know one\xe2\x80\x99s friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had really better keep yourself dry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Fire-balloon.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nis the important thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery important for you, I have no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Rocket, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nshall weep if I choose\xe2\x80\x9d; and he actually burst into real tears, which\r\nflowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little\r\nbeetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were\r\nlooking for a nice dry spot to live in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have a truly romantic nature,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Catherine Wheel, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he\r\nweeps when there is nothing at all to weep about\xe2\x80\x9d; and she heaved a deep\r\nsigh, and thought about the deal box.\r\n\r\nBut the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cHumbug! humbug!\xe2\x80\x9d at the top of their voices.  They were\r\nextremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called\r\nit humbug.\r\n\r\nThen the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to\r\nshine, and a sound of music came from the palace.\r\n\r\nThe Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so\r\nbeautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and\r\nwatched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.\r\n\r\nThen ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the\r\nlast stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King\r\nsent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the fireworks begin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made\r\na low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six\r\nattendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a\r\nlong pole.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a magnificent display.\r\n\r\nWhizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.\r\nBoom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the\r\nplace, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.\r\nBang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves\r\nimmensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.\r\nHe was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best\r\nthing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it\r\nwas of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak,\r\nexcept with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers\r\nwith blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little\r\nPrincess laughed with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nRocket; \xe2\x80\x9cno doubt that is what it means,\xe2\x80\x9d and he looked more supercilious\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nThe next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis is evidently\r\na deputation,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket; \xe2\x80\x9cI will receive them with becoming\r\ndignity\xe2\x80\x9d so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if\r\nhe were thinking about some very important subject.  But they took no\r\nnotice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them\r\ncaught sight of him.  \xe2\x80\x9cHallo!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a bad rocket!\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nthrew him over the wall into the ditch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBAD Rocket?  BAD Rocket?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he whirled through the air;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cimpossible!  GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.  BAD and GRAND\r\nsound very much the same, indeed they often are the same\xe2\x80\x9d; and he fell\r\ninto the mud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not comfortable here,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cbut no doubt it is some\r\nfashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my\r\nhealth.  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require\r\nrest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat,\r\nswam up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA new arrival, I see!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Frog.  \xe2\x80\x9cWell, after all there is nothing\r\nlike mud.  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.  Do\r\nyou think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky\r\nis quite blue and cloudless.  What a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAhem! ahem!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket, and he began to cough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a delightful voice you have!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Frog.  \xe2\x80\x9cReally it is quite\r\nlike a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the\r\nworld.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck\r\npond close by the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.\r\nIt is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact,\r\nit was only yesterday that I heard the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife say to her mother\r\nthat she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is\r\nmost gratifying to find oneself so popular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAhem! ahem!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket angrily.  He was very much annoyed that he\r\ncould not get a word in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA delightful voice, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Frog; \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will\r\ncome over to the duck-pond.  I am off to look for my daughters.  I have\r\nsix beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He\r\nis a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off\r\nthem.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I\r\nassure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConversation, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou have talked the whole time\r\nyourself.  That is not conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody must listen,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Frog, \xe2\x80\x9cand I like to do all the\r\ntalking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I like arguments,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Frog complacently.  \xe2\x80\x9cArguments are extremely\r\nvulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.\r\nGood-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little\r\nFrog swam away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a very irritating person,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket, \xe2\x80\x9cand very ill-bred.\r\nI hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to\r\ntalk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and\r\nselfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my\r\ntemperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you\r\nshould take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.\r\nNow that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I\r\nam going back to Court almost immediately.  I am a great favourite at\r\nCourt; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my\r\nhonour.  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a\r\nprovincial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no good talking to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on\r\nthe top of a large brown bulrush; \xe2\x80\x9cno good at all, for he has gone away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is his loss, not mine,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Rocket.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going\r\nto stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.  I like\r\nhearing myself talk.  It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have\r\nlong conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t understand a single word of what I am saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dragon-fly;\r\nand he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow very silly of him not to stay here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure\r\nthat he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a bit.  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some\r\nday\xe2\x80\x9d; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.\r\n\r\nAfter some time a large White Duck swam up to him.  She had yellow legs,\r\nand webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her\r\nwaddle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuack, quack, quack,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a curious shape you are!  May I\r\nask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nthe Rocket, \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your\r\nignorance.  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable\r\nas oneself.  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up\r\ninto the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think much of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duck, \xe2\x80\x9cas I cannot see what use it\r\nis to any one.  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw\r\na cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that\r\nwould be something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good creature,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsee that you belong to the lower orders.  A person of my position is\r\nnever useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than\r\nsufficient.  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least\r\nof all with such industries as you seem to recommend.  Indeed, I have\r\nalways been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who\r\nhave nothing whatever to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and\r\nnever quarrelled with any one, \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody has different tastes.  I hope,\r\nat any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear no,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Rocket.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am merely a visitor, a distinguished\r\nvisitor.  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.  There is\r\nneither society here, nor solitude.  In fact, it is essentially suburban.\r\nI shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make\r\na sensation in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had thoughts of entering public life once myself,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the Duck;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair\r\nat a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning\r\neverything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much\r\neffect.  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am made for public life,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket, \xe2\x80\x9cand so are all my\r\nrelations, even the humblest of them.  Whenever we appear we excite great\r\nattention.  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will\r\nbe a magnificent sight.  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and\r\ndistracts one\xe2\x80\x99s mind from higher things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the higher things of life, how fine they are!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duck; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthat reminds me how hungry I feel\xe2\x80\x9d: and she swam away down the stream,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cQuack, quack, quack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back! come back!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the Rocket, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a great deal to say\r\nto you\xe2\x80\x9d; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad that she has\r\ngone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cshe has a decidedly middle-class mind\xe2\x80\x9d; and\r\nhe sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the\r\nloneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came\r\nrunning down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis must be the deputation,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket, and he tried to look very\r\ndignified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the boys, \xe2\x80\x9clook at this old stick!  I wonder how it\r\ncame here\xe2\x80\x9d; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOLD Stick!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rocket, \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible!  GOLD Stick, that is what he\r\nsaid.  Gold Stick is very complimentary.  In fact, he mistakes me for one\r\nof the Court dignitaries!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us put it into the fire!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other boy, \xe2\x80\x9cit will help to boil\r\nthe kettle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is magnificent,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Rocket, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are going to let me off in\r\nbroad day-light, so that every one can see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will go to sleep now,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cand when we wake up the kettle\r\nwill be boiled\xe2\x80\x9d; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  At last,\r\nhowever, the fire caught him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I am going off!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and he made himself very stiff and\r\nstraight.  \xe2\x80\x9cI know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher\r\nthan the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelightful!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go on like this for ever.  What a\r\nsuccess I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut nobody saw him.\r\n\r\nThen he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I am going to explode,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.  \xe2\x80\x9cI shall set the whole world on\r\nfire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for\r\na whole year.\xe2\x80\x9d  And he certainly did explode.  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the\r\ngunpowder.  There was no doubt about it.\r\n\r\nBut nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nThen all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the\r\nback of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Goose.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is going to rain sticks\xe2\x80\x9d; and she\r\nrushed into the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew I should create a great sensation,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped the Rocket, and he\r\nwent out.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n                   Printed by BALLANTYNE & CO.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
