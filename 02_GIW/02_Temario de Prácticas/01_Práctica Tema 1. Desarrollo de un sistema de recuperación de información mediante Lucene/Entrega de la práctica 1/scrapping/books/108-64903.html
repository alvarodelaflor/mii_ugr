<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>


<p>As time passes, the famous Lewis and Clark Expedition,
fathered by the great President Jefferson,
should shine brighter and brighter amidst the other
pages of American history.</p>

<p>The purchase of the Province of Louisiana was
opposed by many citizens. They were ignorant and
short-sighted; they asserted that here was a useless
burden of waste land fitted only to the Indian and
the fur-trader; that the people of the United States
should occupy themselves with the land east of the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>But wiser men prevailed. The expedition launched
boldly out into the unknown, to carry the flag now into
the new country, and perhaps to make possible the
ownership of still a farther country, at the Pacific
Ocean.</p>

<p>Time proved the wisdom of President Jefferson’s
preparations made even before the territory had been
bought. Just at the right moment the trail across the
continent was opened. Louisiana Territory was valued
at its future worth; the people were informed of its
merits and possibilities; after the return of the explorers,
the American citizens pressed forward, to see
for themselves. And in due course the flag floated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
unchallenged in that Oregon where, also, the Lewis
and Clark men had blazed the way.</p>

<p>I should like to have been under Captain Meriwether
Lewis, turning thirty, and Captain William Clark, scant
thirty-four. They were true leaders: brave, patient,
resourceful and determined. And the company that
followed them were likewise, brave, patient, resourceful
and determined. These qualities are what bound
them all together—the American, the Frenchman, the
Indian—as one united band, and brought them through,
triumphant.</p>

<p class="noic"><i>Captain Meriwether Lewis</i><br />
(The Long Knife)</p>

<p>Born August 18, 1774, of
Scotch ancestry, on the Ivy
Creek plantation near Charlottesville,
Albemarle Co., Virginia,
and three miles from
Monticello, the estate of
Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<p>Father—William Lewis.</p>

<p>Mother—Lucy Meriwether.</p>

<p>Having fought bravely

cabin in present Lewis
Co., Tennessee, 72 miles southwest
of Nashville, he is shot,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15L"></a>[15L]</span>
either by himself or by an assassin,
and dies the next day,
October 11. He is there buried.
A monument has been erected
over his grave.</p>

have red hair. Five of his
brothers enlist in the Revolution.
One of these was the
famous General George Rogers
Clark, the “Hannibal of the
West,” who saved Kentucky
and the Ohio country from the
British and Indians.</p>

<p>The Clarks and the Lewises
are well acquainted. George
Rogers Clark was born at Charlottesville,
and members of the
Clark family frequently ride
over there.</p>

<p>Little William early shows a
love for frontier life.</p>

<p>After the close of the Revolution
the Clarks remove, by
horse and wagon, from Caroline
Co., Virginia, to Western<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14R"></a>[14R]</span>
Kentucky, and establish themselves
in a stockade and blockhouse
overlooking the Ohio
River, three miles below Louisville,
then known as the Falls
of the Ohio; Mulberry Hill,
the new home is christened.</p>

<p>Young William wears buckskins
and moccasins, shoots
deer and buffalo, takes many
trips with the famous Kentucky
frontiersmen, and has for
friend and teacher Daniel
Boone.</p>

<p>In 1788, at seventeen years of
age, he is commissioned ensign
in the regular army.</p>

<p>Accompanies his brother,
General George Rogers Clark,
on the campaign to prevent the
Indians from keeping the
whites east of the Ohio River,
and the Spaniards from closing
the Mississippi to American
commerce.</p>

<p>1790, acts as captain of
militia.</p>

<p>In 1791 is commissioned first
lieutenant, Fourth Sub-Legion
of the army. Serves under
“Mad Anthony” Wayne
against the Indians in Ohio.
Leads a charge at the battle of
Fallen Timbers, August 20,
1794, where the celebrated
chief Tecumseh is defeated.</p>

<p>Because of ill health, he retires
from military service, in
1796, and lives at Mulberry
Hill, to help his brother, the
general, in business matters.</p>

<p>In July, 1803, accepts an offer
from his friend and fellow officer,
Captain Meriwether Lewis,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15R"></a>[15R]</span>
requesting his company and
assistance on an exploring trip
up the Missouri River, through
the Province of Louisiana, for
the Government.</p>

<p>Is commissioned by President
Jefferson second lieutenant
of artillerists.</p>

<p>In October, 1803, he leaves
with part of the expedition for
St. Louis.</p>

<p>1804—1805—1806 is engaged in
exploring to the Pacific Ocean
and back. The Indians name
him the Red Head.</p>

<p>1806, resigns his commission
in the army.</p>

<p>1807, appointed by President
Jefferson brigadier-general of
the militia of Louisiana Territory
and Indian agent for the
Territory. Is very popular
with the Indians, who revere
his justness and honesty.</p>

<p>In 1808 marries Julia Hancock.</p>

<p>In 1813 is appointed governor
of the Territory of Missouri.</p>

<p>In 1821 marries Harriet
Kennerly-Radford, but is defeated
in his candidacy for the
governorship of the new State
of Missouri.</p>

<p>1822, appointed by President
Madison superintendent of Indian
Affairs, an office which he
holds until he dies.</p>

<p>1824 is appointed surveyor-general
of Missouri, Illinois,
and Arkansas Territory.</p>

<p>Dies September 1, 1838, at
St. Louis, his long-time home,

<small>MAKING READY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When in 1801 Thomas Jefferson became third
President of the United States the nation was young.
The War for Independence had been won only twenty
years previous. George Washington himself had been
gone but a year and four months. The Capitol was
being erected on the site that he had chosen. And the
western boundary of the nation was the Mississippi
River.</p>

<p>Beyond the Mississippi extended onward to the
Rocky Mountains the foreign territory of Louisiana
Province. New Orleans was the capital of its lower
portion, St. Louis was the capital of its upper portion.
It all was assumed to be the property of Spain, until,
before President Jefferson had held office a year, there
spread the rumor that by a secret treaty in 1800 Spain
had ceded Louisiana back to France, the first owner.</p>

<p>Almost another year passed. The treaty transferring
Louisiana Province from Spain to France
seemed to be hanging fire. The Spanish flag still
floated over New Orleans and St. Louis. Then, in
October, 1802, the Spanish governor at New Orleans
informed the American traders and merchants that
their flat-boats no longer might use the Mississippi
River. New Orleans, the port through which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Mississippi River traffic reached the Gulf of Mexico,
was closed to them.</p>

<p>From the west to the east of the United States
swelled a vigorous cry of indignation against this decree
that closed the Mississippi to American commerce. Hot
words issued, threats were loudly spoken, and the
people of the Ohio Valley, particularly, were ripe to
seize New Orleans and re-open the big river by force
of arms.</p>

<p>However, the Spanish governor was not within his
rights, anyway. By that secret treaty, the Island of
New Orleans (as it was called), through which the
currents of the Mississippi flowed to the Gulf, was
French property. So instead of disputing further
with Spain, President Jefferson, in January, 1803, sent
Robert R. Livingston, United States minister to France,
the authority to buy the New Orleans gateway for
$2,000,000, or, if necessitated, to offer $10,000,000.</p>

<p>President Jefferson was a gaunt, thin-legged, sandy-haired,
homely man, careless of his clothes and simple
in his customs, but he passionately loved his country,
and he had great dreams for it. His dreams he made
come true.</p>

<p>He long had been fascinated by the western half
of the continent. His keen hazel eyes had pored over
the rude maps, largely guesswork, sketched by adventurers
and fur-hunters. These eyes had travelled
up the water-way of the uncertain Missouri, to the
Stony Mountains, as they were called; thence across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the Stony Mountains, in search of that mysterious
Columbia River, discovered and christened by an
American. Twice he had urged the exploration of
the Columbia region, and twice explorers had started,
but had been turned back. Now, as President, he
clung to his dream of gaining new lands and new commerce
to the American flag; and scarcely had Minister
Livingston been sent the instructions to open the Mississippi,
than President Jefferson proceeded with plans
for opening another, longer trail, that should reach
from the Mississippi to the Pacific.</p>

<p>He had in mind the person who could lead on such
a trip: young Captain Meriwether Lewis of the First
Infantry, U. S. A.; his private secretary at $500 a
year, and to him like an own son. They were together
day and night, they loved each other.</p>

<p>A Virginian, of prominent family, was Captain
Lewis, and now barely twenty-nine years of age. Slim,
erect, sunny-haired, flashing blue-eyed, handsome and
brave, he had volunteered before to explore through
the farthest Northwest, but had been needed elsewhere.
This time President Jefferson wisely granted
him his wish, and asked him to make an estimate of
the expenses for a Government exploring expedition
by officers and men, from St. Louis up the Missouri
River and across the mountains to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Young Captain Lewis figured, and soon handed in
his estimate. He was of the opinion that at an expense
of $2500, which would cover everything, a party<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of eighteen men might travel across-country from the
Mississippi River, over the mountains, and to the
Pacific Ocean and back again! He had figured very
closely, had young Captain Lewis—perhaps because
he was so anxious to go.</p>

<p>President Jefferson accepted the estimate of $2500,
and in his message of January 18, 1803, to Congress,
he proposed the expedition. He urged that at this
small expense a party of soldiers, well led, could in
two summers map a trail clear to the western ocean;
bring back valuable information upon climate, soil and
peoples, and make Americans better acquainted with
their own continent; also encourage the traders and
trappers to use the Missouri River as a highway to
and from the Indians, thus competing with the British
of Canada.</p>

<p>Congress voted to apply the $2500 on the proposed
expedition. We may imagine how the tall, homely
President Jefferson beamed—he, who so firmly believed
in the expansion of American trade, and the
onward march of the American flag. And we may
imagine how young Captain Lewis glowed with joy,
when now he might be definitely named as the leader
to carry the flag.</p>

<p>President Jefferson advised him to go at once to
Philadelphia, and study botany, geology, astronomy,
surveying, and all the other sciences and methods that
would enable him to make a complete report upon the
new country. At Lancaster, nearby, the celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Henry flint-lock rifles were manufactured, and he
could attend to equipping his party with these high-grade
guns, turned out according to his own directions.</p>

<p>There should be two leaders, to provide against
accident to one. Whom would he have, as comrade?
He asked for his friend, William Clark, younger
brother to the famed General George Rogers Clark,
who in the Revolution had won the country west of
the Alleghanies from the British and the Indians, afterward
had saved the Ohio Valley from the angry redmen,
and then had defied the Spaniards who would
claim the Mississippi.</p>

<p>As cadet only seventeen years old, and as stripling
lieutenant appointed by Washington, William Clark
himself had fought to keep this fertile region white.
“A youth of solid and promising parts and as brave
as Cæsar,” was said of him, in those terrible days when
the Shawnees, the Mohawks and all declared: “No
white man’s cabin shall smoke beyond the Ohio.”</p>

<p>He, too, was a Virginian born, but raised in Kentucky.
Now in this spring of 1803 he was verging on
thirty-three years of age. He was russet-haired, gray-eyed,
round-faced and large-framed—kindly, firm, and
very honest.</p>

<p>He had retired from the army, but by rank in the
militia was entitled captain. For the purposes of the
expedition President Jefferson commissioned him
second lieutenant of artillery.</p>

<p>Captain Clark was at the Clark family home of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Mulberry Hill, three miles south of Louisville, Kentucky;
Captain Lewis pursued his studies at Philadelphia.
Meanwhile, what of Minister Livingston and the
purchase from France of New Orleans—the mouth
of the Mississippi?</p>

<p>The famous Napoleon Bonaparte was the ruler of
France. He, like President Jefferson, had his dreams
for the Province of Louisiana. He refused to sell the
port of New Orleans. Here he intended to land soldiers
and colonists, that they might proceed up-river
and make of his Province of Louisiana another France.</p>

<p>Trouble loomed. Congress appointed James Monroe
as Envoy Extraordinary and on March 8 he started
for France to aid Minister Livingston. He arrived at
Paris on April 12; but, lo, on the day before he
arrived, a most astonishing new bargain had been
offered by Napoleon and Minister Livingston was
ready to accept.</p>

<p>The dream of Napoleon had faded. For war with
England was again upon him; the British held Canada,
their men-of-war were assembling off the Gulf of
Mexico, Louisiana Province and New Orleans would
be seized before ever France could muster a force
there to resist. So rather than let England gain all
this territory and wax more powerful, Napoleon, on
April 11, directed his ministers to proffer to the United
States not only New Orleans, but all Louisiana Province—and
the deal must be closed at once!</p>

<p>“Take all, at 80,000,000 francs, or $15,000,000, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
take nothing,” was the astounding proposal from
Minister Marbois.</p>

<p>“I am authorized to buy New Orleans,” replied
Minister Livingston.</p>

<p>There was no time in which to inform President
Jefferson and Congress. News crossed the ocean only
by slow sailing vessels. Envoy Monroe arrived; he
and Minister Livingston consulted together; Napoleon
was impatient, they should act quickly——</p>

<p>“We must do it,” they agreed. “Our country
shall not lose this opportunity.”</p>

<p>Little minds are afraid of responsibilities; great
minds are not afraid. They prefer to act as seems to
them they ought to act, rather than merely to play
safe. Monroe and Livingston were true patriots. They
thought not of themselves, but of their country, and
risked rebuke for exceeding their instructions.</p>

<p>On April 30 they signed the papers which engaged
the United States to purchase all of Louisiana. The
French ministers signed. On May 2 Napoleon signed.
The papers were immediately mailed for the approval
of Congress.</p>

<p>And Congress did approve, on October 17. Thus,
for less than three cents an acre, the United States
acquired from the Mississippi River to the summits of
the Rocky Mountains. The amount paid over was
$11,400,000; $3,750,000 was applied on French debts.</p>

<p>The ship bearing the papers signed by Ministers
Livingston and Monroe, and by the government of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
France, did not reach the United States until July.
Down to that time President Jefferson had no knowledge
of the fact that his expedition, as planned, was
to explore not French territory, but American. But
when the news broke, he was all ready for it—he needed
only to go ahead. That is one secret of success: to be
prepared to step instantly from opportunity to opportunity
as fast as they occur. The successful, energetic
man is never surprised by the unexpected.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis had been kept very busy: studying
science at Philadelphia, inspecting his flint-locks at
Lancaster, storing them and gathering supplies at the
arsenal of Harper’s Ferry. June 20 he received his
written instructions.</p>

<p>He was to ascend the Missouri River from St.
Louis to its source, and by crossing the mountains and
following down other streams, endeavor to come out
at the mouth of the Columbia on the Pacific coast. It
was hoped that he would find a way by water clear
through. He was to make a complete record of his
journey: noting the character of the country, its rivers,
climate, soil, animals, products, and peoples; and particularly
the Indians, their laws, languages, occupations—was
to urge peace upon them, inform them of
the greatness of the white United States, encourage
them to sell us their goods and to visit us.</p>

<p>When he reached the Pacific Ocean, he was to ship
two of his party by vessel, if he found one there, for
the United States, by way of Cape Horn, of South<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
America, or the Cape of Good Hope, of Africa, and
send a copy of his notes with them. Or he and all his
party were at liberty to return that way, themselves.
He was given letters to the United States consuls at
Java, and the Isles of France off the African coast,
and the Cape of Good Hope, and one authorizing him
to obtain money, in the name of the United States, at
any part of the civilized world.</p>

<p>All this was a large order, placed upon the shoulders
of a youth of twenty-nine years; but who knew where
the Missouri River trail might lead? No white man
yet had followed it to its end.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis was at Washington, receiving those
final instructions. On July 5 he should start for the
west. On July 3 he wrote a farewell letter to his
mother in Virginia, bidding her not to worry, and assuring
her that he felt he should return safely in fifteen
to eighteen months.</p>

<p>He did not dream—President Jefferson, his friend
and backer, did not dream, or, at least, had not voiced
that dream—but even while the loving letter was being
penned, into the harbor of New York had sailed a ship
from France, bringing the dispatches of Ministers
Monroe and Livingston. The next day the news was
announced at Washington. The Province of Louisiana
had been bought by the United States!</p>

<p>This was a Fourth of July celebration with a
vengeance.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis scarcely had time to comprehend.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
To-morrow he was to start, and his mind was filled
with the details of preparation. But a glowing joy
must have thrilled him as he realized that he was to
be the first to carry the flag through that new America
now a part of his own United States. Hurrah!</p>

<p>He had no occasion for delaying. His instructions
required no change. He was eager to be off. Therefore
on July 5, this 1803, he set out, and from the
White House President Jefferson wished him good-speed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" title="PII" id="PII">II<br />
<small>THE START</small></h2>
</div>


<p>By boat up the Potomac River from Washington
hastened young Captain Lewis, to pack his arms and
supplies at Harper’s Ferry, and forward them by wagon
for Pittsburg. He got to Pittsburg ahead of them;
and there remained until the last of August, overseeing
the building of a barge or flat-boat. He enlisted some
men, too—six of them, picked with care, and sworn
into the service of the United States Army.</p>

<p>On August 31, with his recruits, on his laden flat-boat
he launched out to sail, row, and float, towed by
oxen (a “horn breeze,” this was termed), down the
Ohio.</p>

<p>At Mulberry Hill, near Louisville, Captain William
Clark was impatiently awaiting. He had enlisted nine
men, all of Kentucky, the “dark and bloody ground.”
If any men could be relied on, they would be Kentuckians,
he knew. His negro servant, York, who had
been his faithful body-guard since boyhood, was going,
too.</p>

<p>Captain Clark took charge of the barge, to proceed
with it and the recruits and York down the Ohio into
the Mississippi, and thence up the Mississippi to St.
Louis. Captain Lewis turned across country, by horse,
on a short cut, to pick up more men along the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>He struck the Mississippi River fifty miles below
St. Louis, where the United States Army post of Kaskaskia
faced the Province of Louisiana across the river.
Here he enlisted four men more, selected from a score
that eagerly volunteered. Word of the great expedition
had travelled ahead of him, and he could have filled
the ranks seven times over. But only the strongest,
and those of clean reputation, could qualify for such a
trip. These thought themselves fortunate.</p>

<p>Now up along the river, by military road, hastened
Captain Lewis, for the old town of Cahokia, and crossed
the river to St. Louis at last. He was in a hurry.</p>

<p>“We’ll winter at La Charette, Captain,” he had
said to Captain Clark, “where Daniel Boone lives.
Boone can give us valuable information, and we’ll be
that far on our journey, ready for spring. Charette
will be better for our men than St. Louis.”</p>

<p>Glad was Captain Clark to spend the months at
La Charette. Daniel Boone had been his boyhood
friend in Kentucky—had taught him much wood-craft.
But when, in mid-December, Captain Clark, the redhead,
anxious to push on to La Charette, seventy
miles up the Missouri, before the ice closed, with York
and his nine Kentuckians and five other recruits whom
he had enlisted from Fort Massac at the mouth of
the Ohio tied his keel-boat at the St. Louis levee, he
was met by disagreeable information.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to winter here,” informed Captain
Lewis. “The Spanish lieutenant-governor won’t pass<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
us on. He claims that he has not been officially notified
yet to transfer Upper Louisiana to the United States—or,
for that matter, even to France. So all we can do
is to make winter camp on United States soil, on the
east side of the river, and wait. I’m sorry—I’ve engaged
two more boats—but that’s the case.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Captain Clark. “Both sides
of the river are ours, but I suppose we ought to avoid
trouble.”</p>

<p>So the winter camp was placed near the mouth of
Wood River, on the east bank of the Mississippi, about
twenty miles above St. Louis. Log cabins were erected;
and besides, the big keel-boat was decked fore and aft,
and had a cabin and men’s quarters. Consequently
nobody need suffer from the cold.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis stayed most of the time in St. Louis,
arranging for supplies, studying medicine, astronomy,
botany and other sciences, and learning much about
the Indians up the Missouri. Captain Clark looked
after the camp, and drilled the men almost every day.</p>

<p>St. Louis was then forty years old; it contained
less than 200 houses, of stone and log, and about 1000
people, almost all French. The lieutenant-governor,
who lived here in charge of Upper Louisiana of “the
Illinois Country” (as all this section was called), was
Don Carlos Dehault Delassus, also of French blood,
but appointed by Spain.</p>

<p>Indignant now was Spain, objecting to the new
ownership by the United States, and asserting that by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
the terms of the bargain with France that government
had promised not to dispose of the province to any
other nation. But this evidently had made no difference
to Napoleon.</p>

<p>Not until November 30, of 1803, while Captain
Lewis was on his road from Kaskaskia to St. Louis
and Captain Clark was toiling with his keel-boat up
from the mouth of the Ohio (both captains thinking
that they had a clear way ahead), was the Spanish
flag in New Orleans hauled down, and the French flag
hoisted. On December 20 the representative of the
French government there, Monsieur Pierre Clement
Laussat, and his men, saluted the hoisting of the Stars
and Stripes, formally delivered Lower and Upper
Louisiana to the United States.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Lieutenant-Governor Delassus, of
Upper Louisiana, waited for official instruction. Distances
were great, he wished to receive orders what
to do. In St. Louis Captain Lewis waited; in the
camp at Wood River Captain Clark waited; the Missouri
froze over and they could not go on anyway.</p>

<p>Christmas was celebrated, and the memorable year
1803 merged into the new year 1804. Finally, by letter,
date of January 12, 1804, from Monsieur Laussat
at New Orleans, Lieutenant-Governor Delassus was
notified that dispatches were on the road to Captain
Amos Stoddard, of the United States Artillery, and
commanding at Fort Kaskaskia, empowering him to
represent France at St. Louis and take over from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Spain the district of Upper Louisiana. He was then
to turn it over to himself as representative of the
United States.</p>

<p>On February 25 Captain Stoddard announced that
he was ready to receive Upper Louisiana in the name
of France. March 9 was set as the day. Captain Lewis
was invited to be present at the ceremony, as an official
witness. Captain Clark probably came over; perhaps
some of the men, for all the countryside gathered at
the great event.</p>

<p>A number of Indians from up the Mississippi and
up the Missouri, and out of the plains to the west, had
witnessed the ceremony of transfer. They did not
understand it all. They said that the United States
had captured St. Louis. On March 12 their good
friend, Lieutenant-Governor Delassus, issued an address
to them, explaining that now they had a new
father, and he introduced to them the new United
States chiefs who had come—Captain Stoddard and
Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>But the Delawares, the Sacs, the Osages, and others—they
still were dissatisfied, and especially the Osages.
Captain Lewis was particularly anxious to please the
Osages, for they were the first of the powerful tribes
whom he might encounter, up the Missouri. He tried
to talk with the chiefs in St. Louis; by a trader sent
a letter on to the Osage village, asking the head chiefs
to meet him at the river and exchange peace presents.</p>

<p>Beyond the Osages dwelt the Otoes, the Missouris,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
the ’Mahas (Omahas), the Sioux, the Arikaras, the
Mandans, the Minnetarees; and then, who could say?
Few white men, even the French traders, had been
farther. How would all these tribes, known and unknown,
receive the strange Americans?</p>

<p>Spring had come, the ice was whirling down, in
rotted floes, out of the north, the channel of the crooked
Missouri was clearing, and every man in the expedition
was keen to be away, following the honking geese into
this new America over which the flag of the United
States waved at last.</p>

<p>Now the expedition had grown to full strength.
There were the two captains; the fourteen soldiers
enlisted at Pittsburg, Fort Massac and Fort Kaskaskia;
the nine Kentuckians, enrolled at Mulberry Hill near
Louisville; George Drouillard (or Drewyer, as he was
called), the hunter from Kaskaskia who had been
recommended by Captain Clark’s brother the general;
Labiche and one-eyed old Cruzatte, French voyageurs
or boatmen engaged by Captain Lewis at St. Louis;
nine other boatmen, and Corporal Warfington and six
privates from the Kaskaskia troops in St. Louis, who
were to go as far as the next winter camp, and then
return with records and trophies; and black York,
Captain Clark’s faithful servant, who was going just
as far as his master did.</p>

<p>So forty-five there were in all, to start. Except
York, those who were going through had been sworn
in as privates in the United States Army, to serve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
during the expedition, or until discharged on the way,
if so happened. Charles Floyd, one of the young Kentuckians;
Nathaniel Pryor, his cousin, and John Ordway,
enrolled at Kaskaskia from among the New
Hampshire company, were appointed sergeants.</p>

<p>For outfit they had their flint-lock rifles, especially
manufactured; flint-lock pistols, hunting knives, powder
contained in lead canisters or pails to be melted
into bullets when emptied, tents, tools, provisions of
pork, flour, etc., warm extra clothing for winter, old
Cruzatte’s fiddle, George Gibson’s fiddle, medicines, including
the new kine-pox with which to vaccinate the
Indians, the captains’ scientific instruments, a wonderful
air-gun that shot forty times without reloading,
and a cannon or blunderbuss.</p>

<p>Seven large bales and one emergency box had been
packed with their stores; and there were fourteen other
bales and one sample box of gifts for the Indians:
gay laced coats, flags, knives, iron tomahawks, beads,
looking-glasses, handkerchiefs (red and blue), paints
(yellow, blue and crimson), not forgetting three kinds
of medals—first-class and second-class, of silver, and
third-class, of pewter—for chiefs to hang about their
necks as token of friendship from their new great
white father at Washington. The knives and tomahawks
had been made at Harper’s Ferry.</p>

<p>Three boats were ready: the keel-boat built at
Pittsburg, and two pirogues bought at St. Louis. The
keel-boat or batteau was to be the flag-ship. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
kind of flat-boat or barge, fifty-five feet long; of heavy
planks, with bow overhanging and a little pointed, and
square overhanging stern fitted with a keel and with
a tiller rudder. It had places for eleven oars on a
side, and carried a sail. Along either gunwale was a
plank path or walking-board, from which the men
might push with poles.</p>

<p>Much ingenuity and care had Captain Lewis spent
on this flag-ship. Under a deck at the bows the crew
might sleep; and under the deck at the stern was the
cabin for the officers; in the middle were lockers, for
stowing stuff—and the lids when raised formed a line
of breastworks against bullets and arrows! The
blunderbuss was mounted in the bows, the flag floated
from a staff. The boat drew only three feet of water.</p>

<p>The two pirogues were smaller, open flat-boats or
barges; one painted red, the other white; one fitted with
six oars, the other with seven. They also had sails.</p>

<p>At Harper’s Ferry Captain Lewis had ordered the
steel framework of a canoe. This was “knocked
down,” in sections, and stowed in the keel-boat, later
to be put together and covered with bark or skins, for
use in the shallow waters far up-river.</p>

<p>And there were two horses, which should accompany
the boats by land, for scouting and hunting
purposes.</p>

<p>April passed; May arrived. The Missouri was reported
free of ice, and was rising rapidly. The trees
had budded and greened, the grasses were getting high,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
game would be plentiful, the Indians would be leaving
their villages for their spring hunts, and ’twas time
that the expedition should start. In their camp at
Wood River the men drew on the supply of quill pens,
ink horns and paper and wrote farewell letters home.
In St. Louis Captain Clark and Captain Lewis were
given farewell dinners. By Doctor Saugrain, the
learned physician and scientist under whom he was
studying, Captain Lewis was presented with a handful
of matches—curious little sticks which, when briskly
rubbed against something, burst into flame. The
Indians would marvel at these.</p>

<p>Shortly before four o’clock in the afternoon of
May 14, this 1804, the start was made. The St. Louis
people gathered along the river bank on that side, to
watch the boats move up. The blunderbuss was discharged,
in salute; the cannon of the fort answered.
Captain Clark, bidding goodbye from the deck of the
keel-boat, was in full dress uniform of red-trimmed
blue coat and trousers, and gold epaulets, his sword
at his belt, his three-cornered chapeau on his red head.
The sails swelled in the breeze, the men at the oars
sang in French and shouted in English. Drewyer
the hunter rode one horse and led the other. All, save
Captain Clark, were dressed for business—Corporal
Warfington’s squad from St. Louis in United States
uniform, the nine Kentuckians in buckskins, the fourteen
soldiers and civilians, enlisted at the posts, in
flannel shirts and trousers of buckskin or coarse army<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
cloth, the French boatmen in brightly fringed woollens,
with scarlet ’kerchiefs about their heads. Rain was
falling, but who cared!</p>

<p>Captain Lewis did not accompany. He was detained
to talk more with the Osages who had come
down. He hoped yet to make things clear to them.
But he would join the boats at the village of St. Charles,
twenty miles above.</p>

<p>In the sunshine of May 16 they tied to the bank at
St. Charles. At the report of the cannon—boom!—the
French villagers, now Americans all, came running
down and gave welcome.</p>

<p>Sunday the 20th Captain Lewis arrived by skiff
from St. Louis, and with him an escort of the St. Louis
people, again to cheer the expedition on its way. Not
until Monday afternoon, the 21st, was the expedition
enabled to tear itself from the banquets and hand-shakings,
and onward fare in earnest, against the wind
and rain.</p>

<p>Tawny ran the great Missouri River, flooded with
the melted snows of the wild north, bristling with
black snags, and treacherous with shifting bars. On
either hand the banks crashed in, undermined by the
changing currents. But rowing, poling, hauling with
ropes, and even jumping overboard to shove, only
occasionally aided by favoring breeze, the men, soldiers
and voyageurs alike, worked hard and kept going.
On leaving St. Charles the two captains doffed their
uniforms until the next dress-up event, and donned
buckskins and moccasins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>Past La Charette, the settlement where Daniel
Boone lived—the very last white settlement on the
Missouri, toiled the boats; now, beyond, the country
was red. Past the mouth of the Osage River up which
lived the Osage Indian; but no Osages were there to
treat with them. Past the mouth of the Kansas River,
and the Little Platte; and still no Indians appeared,
except some Kickapoos bringing deer. Rafts were
encountered, descending with the first of the traders
bringing down their winter’s furs: a raft from the
Osages, shouting that the Osages would not believe that
St. Louis had been “captured,” and had burnt the
Captain Lewis message; from the Kansas, from the
Pawnees up the Big Platte, from the Sioux of the far
north.</p>

<p>Off a Sioux raft old Pierre Dorion, one of the
traders, was hired by the captains to go with the expedition
up to the Sioux, and make them friendly. He had
lived among the Yankton Sioux twenty years.</p>

<p>Through June and July, without especial incident,
the expedition voyaged ever up-river into the northwest,
constantly on the look-out for Indians with whom
to talk.</p>

<p>The two captains regularly wrote down what they
saw and did and heard; a number of the men also
kept diaries. Sergeant Charles Floyd, Sergeant John
Ordway, Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor, Private Patrick
Gass, Private Joseph Whitehouse, Private Robert
Frazier and Private Alexander Willard—they faithfully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
scrawled with their quill pens, recording each
day’s events as they saw them. The journals of Floyd,
Gass, and Whitehouse have been published, so that we
may read them as well as the journals of the captains.</p>

<p>Not until the first of August, and when almost fifty
miles above the mouth of the Platte River, was the first
council with the Indians held. Here a few Otoes and
Missouris came in, at a camping-place on the Nebraska
side of the Missouri, christened by the two captains
the Council-bluffs, from which the present Iowa city
of Council Bluffs, twenty miles below and opposite,
takes its name.</p>

<p>Now in the middle of August the expedition is encamped
at the west side of the river, about fifteen
miles below present Sioux City, Iowa, waiting to talk
with the principal chiefs of the Otoes and the Omahas,
and hoping to establish a peace between them. But
the Omahas had fled from the small-pox, and the
Otoes were slow to come in.</p>

<p>The voyageur Liberté and the soldier Moses Reed
were missing from the camp; a party had been sent
out to capture them as deserters.</p>

<p>Eight hundred and thirty-six miles had been logged
off, from St. Louis, in the three months.</p>

<p>Here the story opens.</p>

<p class="noi title">OPENING THE WEST
WITH LEWIS AND CLARK</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I<br />
<small>THE COMING OF THE WHITE CHIEFS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“They are many,” reported Shon-go-ton-go, or
Big Horse, sub-chief of the Otoes.</p>

<p>“How many?” asked We-ah-rush-hah, or Little
Thief, the head chief.</p>

<p>“As many,” replied Big Horse, “as five times the
fingers on two hands.”</p>

<p>“Wah!” gravely grunted the circle, where the
chiefs and warriors squatted in their blankets and
buffalo robes.</p>

<p>For August, the Ripe Corn month, of 1804, had
arrived to the Oto Indians’ country in present Nebraska
beyond the Missouri River; but now at their buffalo-hunt
camp north of the River Platte the chiefs of the
combined Oto and Missouri nations sat in solemn
council instead of chasing the buffalo.</p>

<p>Through a long time, or since the month when
the buffalo begin to shed, the air had been full of
rumors. Five moons back, when the cottonwood buds
first swelled, down at the big white village of “San
Loui’” there had been a ceremony by which, according
to the best word, all this vast land watered by the
Missouri River had changed white fathers. The Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
father’s flag had been hauled down, and a different
flag had been raised. Indians had been there and had
seen; yes, Shawnees, Saukies, Delawares, Osages—they
had been there, and had seen. The Spanish governor,
whose name was Delassus, had made a speech,
to the white people. He had said:</p>

<div class="blockquot smfont">

<p class="noic">PROCLAMATION</p>

<p class="right">March 9, 1804.</p>

<p class="noi"><i>Inhabitants of Upper Louisiana</i>:</p>

<p>By the King’s command, I am about to deliver up this post
and its dependences!</p>

<p>The flag under which you have been protected for a period
of nearly thirty-six years is to be withdrawn. From this moment
you are released from the oath of fidelity you took to support it.</p>
</div>

<p>The speech was hard to understand, but there it
was, tacked up on the white man’s talking paper. Moreover,
the good governor had made a talk for the Indians
also, his red children. He had said:</p>

<div class="blockquot smfont">

<p>Your old fathers, the Spaniard and the Frenchman, who
grasp by the hand your new father, the head chief of the United
States, by an act of their good will, and in virtue of their
last treaty, have delivered up to them all these lands. They
will keep and defend them, and protect all the white and red
skins who live thereon.</p>

<p>For several days we have fired off cannon shots to announce
to all the nations that your father, the Spaniard, is going, his
heart happy to know that you will be protected and sustained
by your new father, and that the smoke of the powder may
ascend to the Master of Life, praying him to shower on you
all a happy destiny and prosperity in always living in good union
with the whites.</p>
</div>

<p>Up the great river and into the west, by traders and
runners had come the tidings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>Who were these United States? What kind of a
man was the new white father? He was sending a
party of his warriors, bearing presents and peace talk.
They already had ascended the big river, past the
mouth of the Platte. They had dispatched messengers
to the Otoes and the Missouris, asking them to come
in to council. But the Otoes and Missouris had left
their village where they lived with their friends the
Pawnees, in order to hunt the buffalo before gathering
their corn, and only by accident had the invitation
reached them.</p>

<p>Then Shon-go-ton-go and We-the-a and Shos-gus-can
and others had gone; and had returned safe and
satisfied. They had returned laden with gifts—paint
and armlets and powder, and medals curiously figured,
hung around their necks by the two white chiefs themselves.
They had hastened to seek out We-ah-rush-hah,
the head chief, in his camp, and report.</p>

<p>The white chiefs were waiting to treat with him,
as was proper, and they had sent to him a bright colored
flag, and ornaments, and a medal.</p>

<p>“What do the white chiefs want?” queried We-ah-rush-hah.</p>

<p>“They say that the new white father will be generous
with the Otoes and Missouris, and wishes us to
be at peace with our enemies.”</p>

<p>“Will he protect us from those robbers, the
Omahas?”</p>

<p>“He wishes us to make peace with the Omahas.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
The United States would go with us to the Omahas,
but we told them we were afraid. We are poor and
weak and the Omahas would kill us.”</p>

<p>“Good,” approved We-ah-rush-hah.</p>

<p>“There are two of the white chiefs,” added We-the-a,
or Hospitable One, the Missouri chief. “They
wear long knives by their sides. Their hair is of
strange color. The hair of one is yellow like ripe corn;
the hair of the other is red as pipe-stone. The Red
Head is big and pleasant; the yellow-haired one is slim
and very straight, and when he speaks he does not
smile. Yes, the Red Head is a buffalo, but the other
is an elk.”</p>

<p>“They have three boats,” added Shos-gus-can, or
White Horse, who was an Oto. “One boat is larger
than any boat of any trader. It has a gun that talks
in thunder. Of the other boats, one is painted white,
one is painted red. The chiefs are dressed in long
blue shirts that glitter with shining metal. The party
are strong in arms. They have much guns, and powder
and lead, and much medicine. They have a gun that
shoots with air, and shoots many times. It is great
medicine. They have a man all black like a buffalo
in fall, with very white teeth and short black hair,
curly like a buffalo’s. He is great medicine. They
carry a white flag with blue and red borders. Red,
white and blue are their medicine colors. The flag is
their peace sign. There are French with them, from
below, and another, a trader from the Sioux. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
received us under a white lodge, and have named the
place the Council-bluffs. They must be of a great
nation.”</p>

<p>“I will go and see these United States, and talk
with them,” announced Little Thief, majestically.
“Their presents have been good, their words sound
good. It is unwise to refuse gifts laid upon the prairie.
If indeed we have a new father for all the Indians,
maybe by listening to his chiefs we can get more from
him than we did from our Spanish father. I will go
and talk, at the burnt Omaha village. Let the four
white men who have come with gifts and a message,
seeking brothers-who-have-run-away, be well treated,
so that we shall be well treated also.”</p>

<p>Then the council broke up.</p>

<p>On the outskirts, a boy, Little White Osage, had
listened with all his ears. The affair was very interesting.
A hot desire filled his heart to go, himself, and
see these United States warriors, with their painted
boats and their marvelous guns and their black medicine-man
and their two chiefs whose hair was different,
like his own hair.</p>

<p>His own hair was brown and fine instead of being
black and coarse, and his eyes were blue instead of
black, and his skin, even in its tan, was light instead of
dark. Sometimes he was puzzled to remember just
how he had come among the Otoes. He did not always
feel like an Indian. To be sure, he had been bought
from the Osages by the Otoes; but away, ’way back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
there had been a woman, a light-haired, soft-skinned
woman, among the Osages, who had kissed him and
hugged him and had taught him a language that he
well-nigh had forgotten.</p>

<p>Occasionally one of those strange words rose to
his lips, but he rarely used it, because the Osages, and
now the Otoes, did not wish him to use it.</p>

<p>The Otoes called him Little White Osage, as a
kind of slur. Nobody kissed him and hugged him, but
in their ill-natured moments the Oto squaws beat him,
and the children teased him. The squaws never beat
the other boys. Antoine, the French trader, was kinder
to him. But Antoine had married an Oto woman, and
all his children were dark and Indian.</p>

<p>“At the burnt Omaha village,” had said Chief Little
Thief.</p>

<p>Little White Osage knew where this was. The
United States chiefs, by their messengers, had invited
Little Thief to meet them at the principal Omaha
Indian village, so that peace might be made between
the Omahas and the Otoes. But the village had been
smitten by a sickness—the smallpox, old Antoine had
named it, and the frightened Omahas had burned their
lodges and had fled, such as were able. Only the site
of the village remained, and its graves.</p>

<p>It would be of no use to try to go with the chief’s
party. They would not want boys, and especially a
boy who was not like other Indian boys, and bore a
name of the hated Osages. Therefore, this night, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
the dusk, he slipped from under his thin blanket in
the skin lodge, where slumbered old Antoine and
family, and scuttled, bending low, out into the prairie.</p>

<p>He would have sought the four white men who
had come from the United States chiefs’ camp, but
they had left, looking for two other men who had
strayed. And besides, he didn’t feel certain that they
would help him.</p>

<p>The prairie was thick with high grasses, and with
bushes whereon berries were ripening; he wore only
a cloth about his waist, on his feet moccasins, but he
did not mind, for his skin was tough. He carried his
bow, of the yellow osage wood, and slung under his
left arm his badger-hide quiver containing blunt reed
arrows.</p>

<p>The damp night air was heavy with smoke, for
the prairies had been fired in order to drive out the
game. Now and then he startled some animal. Eyes
glowed at him, and disappeared, and a shadowy form
loped away. That was a wolf. He was not afraid of
any cowardly wolf. Larger forms bolted, with snorts.
They were antelope. To a tremendous snort a much
larger form bounded from his path. That was an
elk. But he hastened on at a trot and fast walk, alert
and excited, his nostrils and eyes and ears wide, while
he ever kept the North Star before him on his left.</p>

<p>It seemed long ere in the east, whither he was
hurrying, the stars were paling. On his swift young
legs he had covered many miles. None of the Oto or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Missouri boys could have done better, but he simply
had to rest. The dawn brightened; he should eat and
hide himself and sleep. So he paused, to make plans.</p>

<p>“Wah!” And “Hoorah!” “Hoorah!” was one
of those strange words which would rise to his lips. Far
before him, although not more than three or four hours’
travel, was a low line of trees marking the course of
the big river. He took a step; from a clump of brush
leaped a rabbit—and stopped to squat. Instantly Little
White Osage had strung bow, fitted arrow, and shot.
The arrow thudded, the rabbit scarcely kicked. Picking
him up, Little White Osage trotted on, his breakfast
in hand.</p>

<p>Now he smelled smoke stronger, and scouting about
he cautiously approached a smouldering camp-fire.
Omahas? But he espied nobody moving, or lying
down. It was an old camp-fire. Around it he discovered
in the dust that had been stirred up, the prints
of boots. The white men had been here—perhaps the
messengers to the camp of Little Thief. Good! He
might cook his rabbit; and sitting, he did cook it after
he had built the fire into more heat. He ate. Then he
curled in the grass, like a brown rabbit himself, and
slept.</p>

<p>When he wakened, the sun was high. He stretched;
peered, to be safe; drank from a nearby creek, and
set forward again. Nearer he drew to the big river,
and nearer; and he had to move more carefully lest the
Omahas should be lurking at their village, and sight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
him. The Omahas would be glad to capture anybody
from the Otoes. There was no peace between the two
peoples.</p>

<p>The ruined village lay lifeless and black, with its
graves on the hill above it. He circled the village,
and found a spot whence he could gaze down.</p>

<p>The broad big river flowed evenly between its low
banks; curving amidst the willows and cottonwoods
and sand-bars, it was the highway for the great white
village of “San Loui’,” at its mouth many days to the
south. It led also up into the country of the Mandans
and the fierce Sioux, in the unknown north. And
yonder, on a sand sprit above the mouth of the Omaha
Creek, was the white chiefs’ camp!</p>

<p>With his sharp eyes Little White Osage eagerly
surveyed. Three boats there were, just as said by
Shos-gus-can: one painted white, and one painted red,
and one very large, fastened in the shallows. On the
sand were kettles, over fires, and many men moving
about, or lying under a canopy; and a red, white and
blue flag flying in the breeze.</p>

<p>A party were leaving the camp, and coming toward
him. They could not see him—he was too cleverly
hidden in the bushes, above. Wading through the
grasses waist high they made for the creek and halted
where the beavers had dammed it into a pond. These
were white men, surely. They numbered the fingers
on two hands, and three more fingers. They carried
guns, and a net of branches and twigs; and one, a tall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
straight man, wore at his side a long knife in a sheath
which flashed. He had on his head a queer three-cornered
covering. He was the leader, for when he
spoke and pointed, the other men jumped to obey.</p>

<p>They walked into the water, to net fish. They
hauled and tugged and plashed and laughed and
shouted; and when they emerged upon the bank again
their net was so heavy that the leader sprang to help
them. He tossed aside his head covering. His hair
was bright like ripe corn. One of the two chiefs, he!</p>

<p>What a lot of fish they brought out! Hundreds of
them sparkled in the sun. This sport continued until
near sunset, when the men all went away, to eat and
sleep.</p>

<p>At dusk Little White Osage stole down to the creek.
Some of the fish were scattered about, but they were
stiff and dull; he could not eat them without cooking
them and he was afraid to risk a fire. So he gathered
mussels and clams, and these were pretty good, raw.</p>

<p>That night the camp-fires of the “’Nited States”
warriors blazed on the beach at the river; in the grasses
of a hollow above the creek Little White Osage finally
slept.</p>

<p>Therefore another morning dawned and found him
still here, waiting to see what the new whites would
do next. But he must not be caught by Chief Little
Thief and old Antoine, or they would punish him.</p>

<p>The United States were eating. Almost could he
smell the meat on the fires. After eating, the camp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
busied itself in many ways. Some of the men again
walked up the creek. Others raised a pole, or mast, on
the largest boat. Others swam and frolicked in the
river. Evidently the camp was staying for the arrival
of We-ah-rush-hah.</p>

<p>But that meat! The thought of it made the mouth
of Little White Osage to water. Well, he must go
and find something and cook it where he would be
safe, and then return to those women and children who
did not like him. He had seen the “’Nited States,”
and their chief with the yellow hair. Maybe he had
seen the red-hair chief, too.</p>

<p>He crept on hands and knees, until he might trudge
boldly, aiming northward so as not to meet with Little
Thief. When after a time he looked back, toward the
river, he saw a great smoke rising. The United States
had set the prairie afire!</p>

<p>Hah! That they had! <a href="#i_frontis">Did they set the prairie
afire just to burn him, a boy?</a> Had they known that
he was watching them, and had that made them angry?
The smoke increased rapidly—broadened and billowed.
The prairie breeze puffed full and strong from the
southeast, and the pungent odor of burning grasses
swept across his quivering nostrils. The fire was pursuing
him. It had cut off any retreat to the big river
waters; it was swifter than an antelope, on his trail.
Very cunning and cruel were those “’Nited States”
men.</p>

<p>Through the tall dry grasses strained Little White<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
Osage, seeking refuge. He sobbed in his husky throat.
If he might but reach that line of sand hills, yonder,
they would break the wall of fire and save him. It
was such a big fire to send after such a small boy.
Now the sun was veiled by the scudding smoke, and
the wind blew acrid and hot. Before him fled animals—racing
antelope and bounding elk, galloping wolves
and darting birds. They were fast; but he—alas, he
was too slow, and he was weak and tired. Was he to
be burned? He threw aside his quiver, and next his
bow. They felt so heavy.</p>

<p>The fire was close. He could hear the crackle and
the popping as it devoured everything. The sand hills
were mocking him; they seemed to sneak backward as
he toiled forward. Suddenly, panting and stumbling,
he burst into a little clearing, where the grasses were
short. In the midst of the clearing lay the carcass of
a buffalo bull.</p>

<p>With dimmed staring eyes Little White Osage, casting
wildly about for shelter, saw. He saw the carcass,
partially cut up; the meat had been piled on the hide,
as if the hunters had left, to get it another time; and
on the meat was planted a ramrod or wiping-stick,
with a coat hung on it, to keep off the wolves. But
nobody was here.</p>

<p>Not in vain had Little White Osage been trained to
look out for himself. Now he knew what he could do.
He staggered for the meat-pile; frantically tore it away,
but not to eat it. He barely could lift the great hide,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
but lift it he did; wriggled underneath, drew it over
him, and crouched there, gasping.</p>

<p>Crackle, pop, roar—and the wall of fire charged
the clearing, dashed into it, licked hotly across it, and
snatched at the robe. He felt the robe shrivel and
writhe, and smelled the stench of sizzling flesh and hair.
He could scarcely breathe. Over him the buffalo hide
was scorching through and through. How the fire
roared, how the wind blew; but neither fire nor wind
could get at him through that tough, inch-thick canopy.
Almost smothered by heat and smoke, Little White
Osage cringed, waiting. He was a wee bit afraid.</p>

<p>Soon he knew that the fire had passed. He ventured
to raise an edge of the hide and peek from under.
Smoke wafted into his face and choked him. Black
lay the cindered land around; the fire was surging on
to the west, where the sand hills would stop it, but it
had mowed a path too hot to walk on, yet. He must
stay awhile.</p>

<p>He reached out a hand and dragged to him a piece
of the charred bloody buffalo meat, and nibbled at it.
Over him the buffalo hide had stiffened, to form a pup-tent;
and really he was not so very uncomfortable. He
ate, and stretching the best that he might, pillowed
his face on his bended arm. Next, he was asleep—tired
Little White Osage.</p>

<p>He slept with an ear open, for voices and tread of
feet aroused him. People were coming. He craned
his neck to peer about—and ducked further inside, like
a turtle inside its shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>Two persons had arrived in the clearing. They
were walking straight toward him. They were white
men. They were some of those United States warriors!</p>

<p>A moment more, and a heavy foot kicked the hide—thump!—and
hands ruthlessly overthrew it. Exposed,
Little White Osage sprang erect, gained his feet at a
bound, stood bravely facing the two warriors of the
“’Nited States.” He would not show them that he
feared.</p>

<p>“B’gorry,” exclaimed a voice, “here’s a quare pea
in a pod!”</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II<br />
<small>PETER GOES ABOARD</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Little White Osage did not understand the
words, but they were said with a laugh. He could only
stare.</p>

<p>Two, were these United States men. The one who
had spoken was short and broad and quick, like a bear.
He had a lean freckled face and shrewd twinkling
grey eyes. He wore a blue shirt, and belted trousers,
and boots, and on his head a wide-brimmed black hat.
Leaning upon a long-barrelled flint-lock gun, he
laughed.</p>

<p>The other man was younger—much younger,
almost too young to take the war path. He was smooth-faced
and very blue-eyed. He wore a blue shirt, too,
and fringed buckskin trousers, and moccasins, and
around his black hair a red handkerchief, gaily tied.</p>

<p>But as his hair was black, he could not be one of
the chiefs. The short man’s hair was not black, but it
was the color of wet sand—and so he could not be one
of the chiefs.</p>

<p>Now the young warrior spoke and his voice was
sweet.</p>

<p>“Who are you, boy?”</p>

<p>This Little White Osage did understand. The
words penetrated through as from a distance. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
had been a long time since he had heard such words.
His throat swelled to answer.</p>

<p>“Boy,” he stammered.</p>

<p>“I see. What boy? Oto?”</p>

<p>Little White Osage shook his head.</p>

<p>“Missouri?”</p>

<p>Little White Osage shook his head.</p>

<p>“’Maha?”</p>

<p>Little White Osage shook his head more vigorously.</p>

<p>“What tribe, then?”</p>

<p>Little White Osage struggled hard to reply in that
language. But his throat closed tight. The young
warrior was so handsome and so kind, and the broad
warrior was so homely and so alert, and he himself
was so small and so full of hopes and fears, that he
choked. He could not speak at all.</p>

<p>“See what you can make out of him, Pat,” bade
the young warrior. “He seems afraid of me. But he
understands English.”</p>

<p>“Faith, now,” drawled the bold warrior, “sure,
mebbe he’s wan o’ them Mandan Injuns, from up-river.
Haven’t they the eyes an’ complexion same as a white
man?” And he addressed Little White Osage.
“Mandan?”</p>

<p>Little White Osage again shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re not Oto or Missouri or ’Maha or
Mandan, who be ye? My name’s Patrick Gass; what’s
your name?”</p>

<p>The throat of Little White Osage swelled. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
strove—and suddenly out popped the word, long, long
unused.</p>

<p>“Kerr.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Kerr—white boy.”</p>

<p>“Holy saints!” exclaimed Patrick Gass, astonished.
“Did you hear that, George, lad? An’ sure he’s white,
an’ by the name o’ him Irish! Ye’ll find the Irish,
wherever ye go. An’ what might be your first name,
me boy? Is it Pat, or Terry, or Mike?”</p>

<p>That was too much talk all at once, for Little White
Osage. The man called George helped him out.</p>

<p>“How can he understand your villainous brogue,
Pat! Let me talk to him.” And he invited, of Little
White Osage: “Kerr, you say?”</p>

<p>Little White Osage nodded.</p>

<p>“You are white?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where’d you come from?”</p>

<p>“Oto.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>A boldness seized upon Little White Osage.</p>

<p>“You,” he said. “Up big river—with ’Nited
States.”</p>

<p>“Oho!” laughed Patrick Gass. “Another recruit,
is it? Does your mother say you might?”</p>

<p>Little White Osage shook his head. Somehow, a
lump rose in his throat. “Mother?” What was
“mother?” That soft white woman, who away back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
in the Osage village had hugged him and kissed him
and taught him these words which thronged inside him,
must have been “mother.”</p>

<p>“No mother. No f-f-father.” He carefully felt
his way. “Ken—Kentucky. Peter—Peter Kerr. Go up
river with ’Nited States.” And he managed another
word. “Please.”</p>

<p>“An’ we set the prairie afire to call in the Injuns,
an’ here’s what we caught,” ejaculated Patrick Gass.
“Peter Kerr, be it? Likely that was his father’s name,
an’ he’s young Peter. Well, what’ll we do with him?”</p>

<p>“We can take him back to the boats with us, I
suppose,” mused George. “But as for his going on
with the expedition, Pat, I don’t know what the captains
would say, or the Otoes, either. He’s from the
Otoes, he claims.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sure ain’t he an Irishman from Kentucky?”
reminded Pat. “An’ ain’t we Irish, too? Mebbe we
can buy the young spalpeen, for a trifle o’ paint an’
powder.”</p>

<p>George didn’t think so.</p>

<p>“I doubt if the Otoes would sell him. How long
have you been with the Otoes, Peter?”</p>

<p>Little White Osage had been listening as hard as
he could, trying to guess what these long speeches
were about. That last question, to him, awakened an
answer.</p>

<p>“Al-ways,” he uttered, slowly. “First Osage, then
Oto.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>“Do you know where Kentucky is?”</p>

<p>Little White Osage shook his head.</p>

<p>“No.” But he pointed to the east. “There.”</p>

<p>“Where are your father and mother?”</p>

<p>“There,” and Little White Osage pointed to the
sky.</p>

<p>“Do you know where St. Louis is?”</p>

<p>“There,” and he pointed south.</p>

<p>“Do you know where we’re going?”</p>

<p>“There,” and he pointed north.</p>

<p>“When did you leave the Otoes?”</p>

<p>“Two days.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Me—white; you white. I ’Nited States.” And
Little White Osage stiffened proudly.</p>

<p>“Bedad, spoken like a good citizen,” approved
Patrick Gass. “Faith, George, lad, ’twould be a shame
to return him to the Injuns—to them oncivilized rascals.
Can’t we smuggle him aboard? An’ then after
we’re all under way the two captains can do with him
as they plaze.” His gray eyes danced at the thought,
and he scanned George questioningly.</p>

<p>George’s blue eyes were twinkling.</p>

<p>“I dare say that on our way up river we’ll meet
more traders coming down, and he can be sent to St.
Louis that way. But we’re liable to be in a scrape,
Pat, if we’re found out.”</p>

<p>“What’s an Irishman without a scrape?” laughed
Pat “Listen, now,” he bade, to Little White Osage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
who had been attending very keenly. “After dusk ye
slip aboard the big boat. Understand?”</p>

<p>Little White Osage nodded. They had planned
something good for him, and he was willing to agree
to whatever it was.</p>

<p>“Slip aboard the big boat,” and Pat pointed and
signed, to make plain, “an’ hide yourself away for’d
down among the supplies. Kape quiet till after the
council, or the Otoes’ll get ye. I’ll be findin’ ye an’
passin’ ye a bit to ate. An’ when we’re a-sailin’ up
the big river wance more, then ye’ll have to face the
captains, an’ what they’ll say I dunno, but I’ll bet my
hat that Cap’n Clark’ll talk the heart o’ Cap’n Lewis,
who’s an officer an’ a gintleman, into lettin’ ye stay
if there’s proof ye have no-wheres else to go.” And
Patrick Gass chuckled. “Sure, they can’t set ye afoot
on the prairie.”</p>

<p>There were too many strange words in this speech,
but Little White Osage caught the import.</p>

<p>“I hide,” he said, obediently. “In big boat.”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” encouraged George. “And if you’re
found, stand up for yourself.”</p>

<p>“No tell,” blurted Little White Osage. “Talk to
’Nited States chiefs. No tell.”</p>

<p>“B’jabbers, there’s pluck!” approved Patrick
Gass. “Now, we be goin’ to take some o’ this meat
back wid us, but we’ll lave you enough to chew on.
You have plenty fire. ’Twas only for signal to the
Injuns to come in to council. We had no thought o’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
burnin’ annywan, ’specially a boy. No, or of burnin’
me own coat, nayther, till I see the wind changin’.”
He and George rapidly made up a parcel of the meat,
blackened and charred though the hunks were. “But
we cooked our supper by it. Goodbye to ye. Chance
be we’ll see ye later.” With airy wave of hand he
trudged away.</p>

<p>“His name is Patrick Gass. My name is George
Shannon,” emphasized George, lingering a moment.
“Yours is Peter Kerr. All right, Peter. Watch out
for the Otoes, that they don’t spy you when you come
in after dark.”</p>

<p>“I come,” answered Peter, carefully. “Oto no
catch.”</p>

<p>Away they hastened, toward the river. Standing
stock-still, Peter watched them go. Good men they
were. They were white; he was white. They were
’Nited States; he was to be ’Nited States, too.</p>

<p>He did not pause to eat now. He grabbed a chunk
of the buffalo meat left for him, and trotted for the
nearest sand-hill. The fire had burned before him, and
the earth was still warm, but the sand-hills were
untouched.</p>

<p>He drank, at last, from a branch of the Omaha
Creek; and among the sand-hills he stayed all day.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he heard, from off toward the
United States camp at the river, a rumble like thunder.
It was the big gun! At dusk he saw a glow redly
lighting the eastern horizon over the river. Maybe the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
United States were having a war-dance. At any rate,
the man named Pat had told him to come; this seemed
to be the best time; and, guided by the glow, he hurried
for the river.</p>

<p>When he had struck the river well above the camp,
the boats and the beach were ruddy. People had gathered
about a huge fire. They were making music and
dancing; and some were white men and others were
Indians: Otoes! Chief Little Thief had arrived.</p>

<p>Somewhat fearing, but very determined, Peter
cautiously waded out into the water, and from waist-deep
slipping into the current silently swam down,
down, outside the edge of the firelight, until obliquing
in he might use the big boat as a shield. With his
hand he felt along it; encountered a rope stretched
taut from boat to water. Wah! Or—hoorah, he
meant.</p>

<p>As neatly as a cat he swarmed up the rope and
hoisted himself over the gunwale. Sprawling in, he
dropped flat, to cower in the shadow of the mast. A
dark figure, with a gun, had seen him—was making
for him, from down the deck.</p>

<p>“Hist, Peter!” huskily spoke a voice. “’Tis Pat.
Ye’re all right. Stay where ye are, now!”</p>

<p>Yes, except for Pat, the sentry, all the big boat
was deserted. There was a great time ashore.
Crouched panting and dripping, Peter witnessed, from
behind the mast. The shore was bright, the figures
plainly outlined. There were the two white chiefs. Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
this he was certain. They had on their heads the queer
hats; they wore long tight blue shirts that glittered
with ornaments; they carried the long knives, in
sheathes at their sides; the one was the chief with the
yellow hair, and the other was the chief with the red
hair.</p>

<p>The ’Nited States were giving a feast and dance,
evidently. Two of them were making music by drawing
a stick across a box held to their chins; and the
others, and the Indians, sat in a circle, around the
fire, watching the dances.</p>

<p>It was now the turn of the Otoes, for they sprang
up, and into the centre, to dance. Peter knew them,
one by one: Head Chief Little Thief, Big Horse,
Crow’s Head, Black Cat, Iron Eyes, Bix Ox, Brave
Man, and Big Blue Eyes—all Otoes except Crow’s
Head and Black Cat, who were Missouris.</p>

<p>They danced. It was the Oto Buffalo Dance.
The ’Nited States warriors cheered—and on a sudden
cheered louder and clapped their hands together, for
into the centre had leaped a new figure, to dance by
himself.</p>

<p>He was the black medicine man!</p>

<p>His eyes rolled white; his teeth were white; but
all the rest of him was black—and he was very large.
Assuredly, the ’Nited States must be a great and powerful
nation, with such medicine men, decided little Peter,
watching.</p>

<p>Along the deck Patrick Gass hissed and beckoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>“Here,” he bade. Peter scurried to him. “Get
down in for’d,” and Pat pointed to the open door of
the forecastle or wooden house that had been built in
the bows, under a higher deck. “Stow yourself away
an’ kape quiet. Ye’ll find a place.”</p>

<p>Peter darted in. It was a room lined with beds
in tiers from floor to ceiling: the white warriors’ sleeping-room.
Clothing was hanging against the far end;
down the centre was a narrow table. Like a cat again,
Peter sprang upon the table, scrambled into the highest
of the bunks on this side, and came to the far-end
wall. The wall did not meet the roof; it was a bulkhead
partition dividing off the room from the remainder
of the bows. Peter thrust his arm in over
the top, and could feel, there beyond, a solid bale on a
level with the bunk. He wriggled in over, landed
cautiously, explored with hands and feet, in the darkness—and
stretched out in a space that had been left
between the ballast of extra supplies and the deck
above. Good!</p>

<p>That warm August night the “’Nited States” men
of Captains Lewis and Clark slept on the sand, in the
open air, by the river; and in the tent of the captains
slept Chief Little Thief. But Patrick Gass, when relieved
from guard duty, slept in the forecastle, near
Peter—that being, as he yawned, “more convanient.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III<br />
<small>PETER MEETS THE CHIEFS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The hour was early when Pat stuck his head over
the partition, and to Peter said: “Whisht! Are ye
awake, Peter?”</p>

<p>“H’lo,” answered Peter.</p>

<p>“I’ll fetch ye a bite to eat, an’ wather to drink,”
said Patrick. “An’ ye best lie hid till we start, when
the Injuns go. ’Twon’t be long.”</p>

<p>“Aw-right,” answered Peter.</p>

<p>Patrick passed in to him some dried meat and a
canteen of water. After that the day seemed to move
very slowly. Here on the boat all was quiet, particularly
in Peter’s end. However, outside on the shore
there was a constant sound of voices, from the ’Nited
States camp.</p>

<p>The sun rose high, as betokened by the close warmth
where Peter lay hidden. He felt as though he must get
out and see what was going on. So he peered over the
top of the partition, to find whether the forecastle was
empty. It was. He slipped down into it, and stealing
through and worming flat across the deck, peeped
through a crack in the gunwale.</p>

<p>Little Thief and his Otoes and Missouris had not
yet gone. They were holding another council with the
’Nited States. More talk! The ’Nited States chiefs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
and warriors were sitting, and the Otoes and Missouris
were sitting, all forming a great circle.</p>

<p>One after another the Otoes and the Missouris
arose and talked, and the white chiefs replied; but of
all this talk Peter understood little. After a time he
grew tired; the sun was hot, and he went back into his
nook. He still had meat and water enough.</p>

<p>It was much later when he awakened, to hear
people in the room beyond his partition. There were
white men’s voices—one voice sounded like that of his
other friend, George Shannon. And there were groans.
Soon the white men left—all except the man who
groaned. He stayed. Evidently one of the white men
was sick, and had been put into a bed.</p>

<p>Dusk was falling, and Peter thought that he might
venture out and stretch his legs. The sounds from the
sick man had ceased; maybe he slept. Peter peered
over. Everything was quiet; and forth he slipped—only
to discover that in the open door was sitting,
amidst the dusk, a watcher. It was the United States
warrior, George Shannon. He saw Peter, poised about
to leap down, and smiled and beckoned. Peter lightly
went to him.</p>

<p>George Shannon looked worn and anxious.</p>

<p>“Are you all right, Peter?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Aw-right.”</p>

<p>“A soldier—very sick,” said George, and pointed
to a bunk.</p>

<p>“What name?” asked Peter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“Charles Floyd. He danced and got hot. Lay
down on the sand all night and got cold. Now very
sick.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” grunted Peter. “Mebbe get well?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said George, soberly.</p>

<p>That was too bad. Why didn’t they call in the black
medicine-man?</p>

<p>Except for George and the sick Charles Floyd, the
boat was deserted; for on the shore another dance and
feast were in progress. Chief Little Thief and his
Indians were staying, and the ’Nited States appeared
to be bent upon giving them a good time.</p>

<p>All that night the sick Charles Floyd moaned at
intervals, in the bunk; and George Shannon and Patrick
Gass and others kept watch over him; while Peter,
on the other side of the partition, listened or slept.
Toward morning, when Peter next woke up, he had
been aroused by tramp of feet over his head, and splash
of water against the boat, and orders shouted, and a
movement of the boat itself.</p>

<p>They were starting, and he was starting with them!
Hoorah! Now he was not hungry or thirsty or tired;
he was excited.</p>

<p>Yes, the boat was moving. He could hear the
plashing of oars, and the creak as the sail was raised.
And in a few minutes more the boat leaned and swerved
and tugged, and the river rippled under its bow.</p>

<p>Peter waited as long as he possibly could stand it
to wait. Patrick Gass had said for him to lie hidden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
until Chief Little Thief had left, and the boat had
started. Very well.</p>

<p>All was silent in the room beyond. He peered, and
could see nobody. Over the partition he once more
squirmed, into the top-most bunk; and feeling with
his toes let himself down. The door was shut, but it
had a window in it that he might look out of; and if
anybody opened, he would dive under the table or under
a bunk, until he saw who it was.</p>

<p>The sick man in the bottom bunk opposite suddenly
exclaimed. He was awake and watching.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he challenged weakly.</p>

<p>With his feet on the floor, Peter paused, to stare.
He saw a pale, clammy countenance gazing at him from
the blanket coverings—and at that instant the door
opened, and before Peter might so much as stir, the
chief with the red hair entered. Peter was fairly
caught. He drew breath sharply, and resolved not to
show fear.</p>

<p>The chief with the red hair was all in buckskin,
and wore moccasins on his feet, and on his head a
round hat with the brim looped up in front. His face
was without hair and was very tanned, so that it was
reddish brown instead of white, and his two eyes were
clear, keen gray. His hair was bound behind in a long
bag of thin skin. He had rather a large nose, and a
round chin; and was heavy.</p>

<p>“Well!” he uttered. He glanced swiftly from
Peter to the sick man’s bunk, and back again to Peter.
“What’s this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>“He stole down from above, Captain,” said the
sick man.</p>

<p>“How are you, Sergeant? Any better?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I’m awful weak, sir.”</p>

<p>“Much pain?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’ve been suffering terribly.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, my man. We’ll do all we can for
you.” Now the chief spoke to Peter. “Who are you?
How’d you come here?” His voice was stern and
quick.</p>

<p>“I hide,” said Peter.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>Peter pointed.</p>

<p>“Who brought you here?”</p>

<p>“I come. Night. Swim down river. Hide.” For
Peter had no notion of telling on Patrick Gass and
George Shannon.</p>

<p>“Humph! You did!” And the chief with the
red hair grunted. “Ran away, eh? Who was your
chief?”</p>

<p>“We-ah-rush-hah. First Osage, then Oto, but me
white.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your mother?”</p>

<p>Peter shook his head.</p>

<p>“Where’s your father?”</p>

<p>Peter shook his head.</p>

<p>“Here’s a pretty pickle,” muttered the chief with
the red hair—and Peter wondered what he meant.
“Well, you come along with me.” And he added, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
the sick man, “I’ll be back directly, Charley; as soon
as I’ve turned this stow-away over. Do you want anything?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I’m sleepy. Maybe I’ll sleep,” and the
sick man’s voice trailed off into a murmur.</p>

<p>“Come here,” bade the red-haired chief to Peter,
beckoning with his finger. And Peter followed Captain
William Clark, of the United States Artillery, and
second in command of this Captains Lewis and Clark
government exploring expedition up the Missouri
River, through the doorway, into the sunshine and the
open of the great barge’s deck.</p>

<p>Captain Clark led straight for the stern, but on the
way Peter, keeping close behind him, with his quick
eyes saw many things. The white warriors, in buckskins
or in cloth, were busy here and there, mending
clothes and tools and weapons and assorting goods, or
viewing the river banks—and all paused to gaze at him.
The big sail was pulling lustily, from its mast. At the
stern two warriors were steering. In the barge’s wake
were sailing the two smaller barges, the red one and
the white one. They followed gallantly, the river
rippled, the banks were flowing past. Nothing was to
be seen moving on the banks, and the site of the
Omaha village, and the sand sprit where the council
with Little Thief had been held, were gone. Good!</p>

<p>Before the cabin in the stern of the barge were
standing the slim, yellow-haired chief and Patrick
Gass, and they were watching Peter coming. The slim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
chief was dressed in his blue clothes and his odd hat,
and wore his long knife by his side. His hair hung in
a tail. Patrick Gass was dressed as always. His eyes
twinkled at Peter, as if to say: “Now, what are you
going to do?”</p>

<p>Peter knew what he was going to do. He was
going to stay with the ’Nited States.</p>

<p>But the slim chief’s face betrayed no sign. He
simply waited. For this Captain Meriwether Lewis, of
the First United States Infantry, the leader of the
exploring expedition sent out by President Jefferson
and Congress, was not much given to smiles, and was
strong on discipline. A thorough young soldier, he,
who felt the heavy responsibility of taking the expedition
safely through, with the help of Captain Clark.</p>

<p>“Here’s what I’ve found, Merne,” announced Captain
Clark, with half a laugh.</p>

<p>“Who is he, Will?” Captain Lewis’s query was
quick, and his brows knitted a trifle.</p>

<p>“He says he’s white. I found him in the forec’sle
when I went in to see about Floyd.”</p>

<p>“How is Floyd?”</p>

<p>“No better.”</p>

<p>“How’d that boy get there?”</p>

<p>“Ran away from the Otoes, he says, and hid himself
in the bows beyond the bulkhead. Like as not he’s
been there a day or two.”</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” demanded the Long Knife
Chief, of Peter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>“Peter.”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“Peter—Kerr.”</p>

<p>“Where did you live?”</p>

<p>“Oto. No like Oto. No like Indian. White boy.”</p>

<p>“Hah! Did the Otoes steal you?”</p>

<p>“Osage. Oto buy me.”</p>

<p>“Where did the Osage get you?”</p>

<p>“Do—not—know,” said Peter, slowly, trying to
speak the right words. “Kill—father. Take mother.
She die. Long time ago. Me—I white.”</p>

<p>“Sure, Captain, didn’t we hear down St. Louis
way of a family by the same name o’ Kerr bein’ wiped
out by the Injuns some years back,” spoke Patrick
Gass, saluting. “’Twas up country a bit, though I
disremember where, sorr.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but there was no boy.”</p>

<p>“There was a bit of a baby, seems to me like, sorr,”
alleged Sergeant Gass. “An’ the woman was carried
off, sorr.”</p>

<p>Captain Lewis shrugged his shoulders impatiently.</p>

<p>“Very well, Pat. You go forward and you and
Shannon see if you can do anything for Floyd. Don’t
let him move much. He’s liable to be restless.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sorr.” Patrick Gass saluted but lingered a
moment. “If I might be so bold, sorr——”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Seein’ as how the boy’s Irish——”</p>

<p>“Irish! He’s as black as an Indian!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sorr. But the eyes an’ hair of him, sorr.
An’ sure he has an Irish name. An’ I was thinkin’,
beggin’ your pardon, sorr, if you decided to kape him
a spell, Shannon an’ me’d look after him for ye, sorr.
We Irish are all cousins, ye know, sorr.”</p>

<p>Young Captain Lewis’s mouth twitched; he shot a
glance at Captain Clark, who smiled back.</p>

<p>“Does that sound to you like an Irish name, Captain?
More like good old English, to me!”</p>

<p>“I was thinkin’ again, sorr,” pursued Pat, “that
more like it’s <em>O</em>’Kerr.”</p>

<p>“That will do, Gass. Go forward and find Shannon,
and the two of you tend to Floyd.” Patrick
saluted and trudged away. Captain Lewis continued,
to Captain Clark: “There’s something back of this,
Will. Gass is too willing. I’ll wager he and Shannon
know more than we do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the Irish in him, Merne. Do you think
they smuggled the lad aboard?”</p>

<p>“If they did——who brought you on this boat?”
demanded the Long Knife Chief of Peter.</p>

<p>Peter shrugged <em>his</em> shoulders.</p>

<p>“I come,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Go with ’Nited States. Up big river.”</p>

<p>“Who taught you to speak English?”</p>

<p>“My—mother,” stammered Peter. “No English;
’Merican; Ken-tuck-y.”</p>

<p>“Kentuckian!” blurted Captain Clark. “He is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
white, sure enough. That comes pretty close to home-folks,
Merne. I know some Kerrs there, myself.”</p>

<p>“But the question is, what are we to do with him?”
reminded Captain Lewis, sharply. “We can’t cumber
ourselves with useless baggage, and we can’t start out
by stealing children from the Indians.”</p>

<p>“No; and yet it sort of goes against the grain to
let the Indians keep any children they’ve stolen,” argued
Captain Clark.</p>

<p>“Yes, I agree with you there, Will,” answered
Captain Lewis. “But the President instructed us to
make friends with all the tribes. We could have shown
the Otoes they were wrong, and could have offered to
buy the boy or have made them promise to send him to
St. Louis if we couldn’t send him ourselves. This looks
like bad faith.”</p>

<p>“Shall we stop and put him ashore, Merne?”</p>

<p>“If we put you ashore will you go back to We-ah-rush-hah?”
queried the Long Knife Chief, of Peter.</p>

<p>Peter had not comprehended all that had been said,
but he had listened anxiously—and now he did understand
that they were talking of putting him off.</p>

<p>“No!” he exclaimed. “No go back to We-ah-rush-hah.
’Maha catch me; Sioux catch me; Oto whip
me. No Indian; white.” And he added: “I follow
boat.”</p>

<p>“If you give the order, Merne, we’ll stop and send
him back with an escort,” teased Captain Clark, who
knew very well that Captain Lewis would do no such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
thing. “And we’ll tell the Otoes to forward him on
down to St. Louis. You think they’d do it, do you?”</p>

<p>Captain Lewis tapped uneasily with his foot.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, Will,” he said. “We can’t stop and
waste this fine breeze, even to send back a boy. When
we land for dinner will be the proper time. We may
meet some traders, bound down, and he can be started
back with them, to St. Louis. Meanwhile Gass and
Shannon must take care of him.”</p>

<p>“He can be sent down river with the first party
that take back the dispatches,” proffered Captain Clark.</p>

<p>Patrick Gass came clumping up the deck and again
saluted.</p>

<p>“Sergeant Floyd wishes might he speak with Cap’n
Clark, sorrs.”</p>

<p>“How is he, Pat?”</p>

<p>“Turrible weak, sorr, but the pain be not so bad.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Will,” bade Captain Lewis. “You
enlisted him. He knows you better. If I can do anything,
call me.”</p>

<p>The Red Hair Chief hastened away. The Long
Knife Chief spoke to Patrick Gass.</p>

<p>“You’ll take charge of Peter until we send him
back, Patrick. Draw on the commissary for such
clothes as he needs. We can’t have him running
around naked, this way, if he’s white.”</p>

<p>“Yis, sorr,” replied Patrick Gass. “Come, Peter,
lad; come with your cousin Pat, an’ we’ll make your
outside as white as your inside.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>Peter gladly obeyed. He was rather afraid of the
handsome young Long Knife Chief, but he was not
afraid of Patrick Gass—no, nor of the Red Hair.</p>

<p>When dressed in the clothes that Patrick found
for him, Peter was a funny sight. There was a red
flannel shirt—to Peter very beautiful, but twice enough
for him, so that the sleeves were rolled to their elbows,
and the neck dropped about his shoulders. And there
was a pair of blue trousers, also twice enough for him,
so that the legs were rolled to their knees, and the waist
was drawn up about his chest, and the front doubled
across where it was belted in.</p>

<p>“Niver you mind,” quoth Patrick, while the ’Nited
States men gazed on Peter and howled with merriment.
“Sure, I’m a bit of a tailor an’ if we can’t fit you with
cloth we’ll fit you with leather. Let ’em laugh.
Laughin’s good for the stomick.”</p>

<p>And Peter did not mind. These were white people’s
clothes, and he was proud to wear them, although they
did seem queer.</p>

<p>The sun had passed the overhead. At some orders
the barge was swung in for shore; the two smaller
boats followed. Now would he be sent back, or left;
or—what? Landing was made on the right-hand side,
which was the country of the Iowas and of the Sioux:
not a good place, Peter reflected, for <em>him</em>. But
scarcely had the barge tied up, and Peter’s heart was
beating with anxiety, when Captain Clark hastily
emerged from the forecastle; another soldier trod close
behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>Captain Clark went to Captain Lewis; the soldier
proceeded slowly, speaking to comrades. He arrived
where Patrick was keeping friendly guard over Peter.</p>

<p>“Charley’s gone,” he said, simply, his face clouded,
his voice broken.</p>

<p>“Rest his soul in pace,” answered Patrick. “Sure,
I’m sorry, Nat. Did he say anything?”</p>

<p>“He knew. He asked the Captain to write a letter
for him, to the folks at home. After that he went to
sleep and did not wake again, here.”</p>

<p>“Faith, he gave his life for his country,” asserted
Patrick.</p>

<p>So the sick man had died. This much Peter easily
guessed. It turned dinner into a very quiet affair.
Nothing more was said of leaving Peter ashore, nor of
sending him back; but as soon as the dinner was finished
the boats all pushed out and headed up river, along a
bank surmounted by rolling bluffs.</p>

<p>After about a mile by sail and oars, everybody
landed; and the body of Sergeant Charles Floyd,
United States Army, the first of the expedition to fall,
was buried on the top of a bluff. Captain Clark read
some words out of a book, over the grave; and upon
the grave was set a cedar post with the name, Sergt.
C. Floyd, and the date, Aug. 20, 1804, carved into it.
Then three volleys from the rifles were fired.</p>

<p>The boats proceeded on for a camping-place, which
was found about a mile up, on the right-hand or north
side, near the mouth of a little river. The bluff of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
grave was referred to as Floyd’s Bluff, and the little
river was called Floyd’s River.</p>

<p>All the men, including Peter, felt sorry for Sergeant
Nathaniel Pryor. Floyd had been his cousin. They
felt sorry for those other relatives and friends, back
at the Floyd home in Kentucky.</p>

<p>Fifty years later, or in 1857, the grave of the
sergeant was moved a few hundred feet, by the Sioux
City, Iowa, people, so that it should not crumble into
the Missouri River; and in 1895 a monument was
placed over it. To-day Floyd’s Bluff is part of a Sioux
City park.</p>

<p>The camp this evening was only thirteen miles
above the Omaha village and the place where Chief
Little Thief had come in to council, so that Peter very
easily might have been sent back. But the death of
Sergeant Charles Floyd seemed to be occupying the
thoughts of the two captains; it made the whole camp
sober. To-night there was no dancing or music, and
Peter slept aboard the barge with nobody paying especial
attention to him. Of this he was glad, because
he feared that, once ashore, he would be left behind—the
’Nited States would try to sail on without him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br />
<small>TO THE LAND OF THE SIOUX</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Fust we have to pass the Sioux Injuns,” explained
Patrick Gass, to Peter. “Ye know the Sioux?”</p>

<p>“They bad,” nodded Peter. “Fight other Injuns.”</p>

<p>“Yis,” said Patrick. “But we aim to make everybody
paceful with everybody else. An’ after the
Sioux, we talk with the ’Rikaras.”</p>

<p>“’Rees bad, too,” nodded Peter. For the Otoes
were afraid of the northern tribes.</p>

<p>“Yis,” said Patrick. “An’ after the ’Rikaras we
come, I’m thinkin’, to the Mandans, an’ by that time
’twill be winter, an’ with the Mandans we’ll stay. I
hear tell they have white skins an’ blue eyes an’ their
hair trails on the ground.”</p>

<p>Sometimes sailing, sometimes rowed, and sometimes
towed by heavy ropes on which the men hauled,
from the banks, the three boats had been steadily advancing
up-river. Peter was feeling quite at home.
Everybody was kind to him—especially Pat, who had
been elected sergeant in place of Charles Floyd, and
young George Shannon, who was only seventeen.</p>

<p>Two horses followed the boats, by land, for the use
of the hunters. George Drouillard, a Frenchman, who
had lived with the Omahas, was chief hunter. At the
evening camps Pierre Cruzatte, a merry Frenchman
with only one eye, and a soldier by the name of George<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Gibson, played lively music on stringed boxes called
violins. Each night the two captains, and Pat and
other soldiers, wrote on paper the story of the trip.
York, the black man, was Captain Clark’s servant.
Early in the morning a horn was blown to arouse the
camp. During the days the captains frequently went
ashore, to explore.</p>

<p>It was well, thought Peter, that Pierre Dorion, a
trader who lived with the Sioux, was aboard the boats,
for the fierce Sioux Indians did not like strangers.
Still, who could whip the United States?</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the eighth day after leaving
Chief Little Thief, old Pierre, from where he was
standing with the two captains on the barge and gazing
right and left and before, cried aloud and pointed.</p>

<p>“Dere she is!”</p>

<p>“What, Dorion?”</p>

<p>“De Jacques, w’at is also call de Yankton River;
my people de Yankton Sioux lif on her. Mebbe soon
now we see some.”</p>

<p>The barge, flying its white peace flag, bordered
with red and blue, ploughed on. All eyes aboard were
directed intently before. The mouth of the river gradually
opened, amidst the trees.</p>

<p>“We’ll halt there for dinner,” ordered Captain
Lewis. “That looks like a good landing-place just
above the mouth, Will.”</p>

<p>Captain Clark nodded, and the barge began to veer
in; the two pirogues or smaller boats imitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>“I see one Injun,” said Peter. “You see him,
Pat?”</p>

<p>“Where, now?” invited Patrick Gass.</p>

<p>“He is standing still; watch us, this side of Yankton
River.”</p>

<p>“Faith, you’ve sharp eyes,” praised Pat, squinting.
“Yis, sure I see him, by the big tree just above the
mouth.”</p>

<p>Others saw him. And as the barge hove to, and
led by Captain Clark the men leaped for the shore, to
cook dinner, the Indian plunged into the water and
swam across.</p>

<p>“’Maha!” quoth Peter, quickly, when, dripping,
the Indian had plashed out and was boldly entering the
camp.</p>

<p>“Oh, is he, now?” murmured Patrick Gass.</p>

<p>Pierre Dorion translated for him, to the captains.
He said that he was an Omaha boy, living with the
Sioux. While he was talking, two other Indians came
in. They indeed were Sioux—straight, dark, and dignified,
as befitted members of a great and powerful
nation.</p>

<p>“Dey say de Yanktons, many of dem, are camp’
to de west, one short travel,” interpreted Dorion. “Dey
haf hear of our comin’, an’ will be please’ to meet de
white chiefs.”</p>

<p>“All right, Dorion. You go to the camp with these
fellows, and tell the chiefs that we’ll hold council at
the river. I’ll send Sergeant Pryor and another man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
along with you,” instructed Captain Lewis. “You’ll
find us again about opposite where their camp is.”</p>

<p>“Good,” approved Pierre Dorion. “Now mebbe
I get my wife an’ fam’ly one time more. My son, he
dere, too, say dese young men.” For Pierre had
married a Sioux woman.</p>

<p>The two Sioux, and Pierre, and Sergeant Nathaniel
Pryor and Private John Potts left on foot for the
camp of the Yanktons; but the Omaha boy stayed.
Peter preferred to keep away from him. The Omahas,
to him, were not to be trusted.</p>

<p>From the mouth of the Yankton River, which is
to-day called the James River of South Dakota, the
boats continued on up the Missouri, to the council
ground. The red pirogue ran upon a snag, so that it
almost sank before it could be beached. Then all the
goods had to be transferred to the white pirogue. This
took time, and it was not until nearly sunset that
Captain Lewis ordered landing to be made and camp
pitched.</p>

<p>The camp of the Sioux was supposed to be somewhere
across the river. In the morning no Sioux had
yet appeared for council, and Captain Lewis anxiously
swept the country to the north with his spy-glass. However,
Indians could not be hurried, as Peter well knew.
But about four o’clock there spread a murmur.</p>

<p>“Here they come!”</p>

<p>“De Sioux! Dey come. Now for beeg talk an’
beeg dance! Hoo-zah!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“Oui!” added George Drouillard, the hunter.
“Mebbe fat dog feast, too!”</p>

<p>“Oh, murther!” gasped Pat. And, to Peter: “Did
ye ever eat dog, Peter?”</p>

<p>Peter shook his head, disgusted. Not he; nor the
Otoes, either. Only the northern Indians ate dog.</p>

<p>“There’s a t’arin’ lot of ’em, anyhow,” mused
Patrick Gass. “I’m after wishin’ George was here.
Sure, he’s like to get into trouble, wanderin’ about the
country where all those fellows are.”</p>

<p>For two days back George Shannon had been sent
out to find the horses that had strayed from camp, and
he had not returned.</p>

<p>The Sioux made a brave sight indeed. They
looked to be almost a hundred—ahorse and afoot, with
gay streamers and blankets flying. Pierre Dorion and
Sergeant Pryor and Private Potts were to be seen,
mounted and riding with the principal chiefs in the
advance. So evidently everything was all right.</p>

<p>They halted on the bank opposite the United States
camp. Sergeant Pryor waved his hat, and the captains
sent the red pirogue across for him. He and Pierre
and Private Potts returned in it. They brought with
them young Pierre, who was old Pierre’s son. He was
half Sioux, and traded among the Tetons; but just
now he was visiting among the Yanktons.</p>

<p>“They are friendly, are they, Sergeant?” inquired
Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. They treated us very handsomely, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
the head chief is yonder, waiting to talk with you,”
informed Sergeant Pryor.</p>

<p>“Very good. You and young Dorion go back to
them—we’d better send along some presents, hadn’t we,
Will?—and tell the chiefs that we’ll speak with them
in the morning. ’Twon’t do to let them think we’re
in any more of a hurry than they are.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Sergeant Pryor.</p>

<p>He took over presents of corn and tobacco
and iron kettles, with young Pierre to do the translating
for him, and returned. Both camps settled
down for the night.</p>

<p>“Did yez have a rale good time with the Sioux,
Nat?” queried Patrick Gass, that night around the
fire, after a hearty supper on cat-fish. During the day a
number of huge cat-fish had been caught, some of them
weighing sixty pounds. Now all the men were curious
to hear more from Nat Pryor and John Potts.</p>

<p>“Tremendous,” declared Nat. “They wanted to
carry us into camp in a blanket, but we told ’em we
were not chiefs. They could wait and carry the captains.
They gave us a fat dog, though, boiled in a
pot—and I swear he was good eating.”</p>

<p>“None for me, thank ye,” retorted Sergeant Pat.
“An’ how far is their camp, an’ what kind is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s about nine miles back, near the Jacques. All
fine buffalo hide lodges—some elk hide, too—painted
different colors. Fact is, they’re about the best Indians
we’ve met yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“Ye didn’t learn anything of Shannon or the
horses, then?”</p>

<p>“Not a word. But I think he’ll be safe if only the
Sioux find him.”</p>

<p>The next day dawned so foggy that nobody could
see across the river. The captains made preparations
for the grand council. A pole was set up, near to a
large oak tree, and a new flag hoisted to the top of it.
The flag was striped red and white; in a corner was a
blue square, like the sky, studded with stars. ’Twas the
great flag of the United States nation—and Peter
thought it beautiful.</p>

<p>The two captains dressed in their best. Captain
Lewis wore a long coat of dark blue trimmed with
light blue, down its front bright brass buttons, and on
its shoulders bright gold-fringed epaulets. Captain
Clark’s coat was dark blue faced with red; it, too, had
the brass buttons and the bright epaulets. Both wore
their cocked hats, and their long knives, or swords.</p>

<p>The men also were ordered to put on their best,
and to clean up even if they had no “best.” Presents
were laid out. By the time the fog lifted, at eight
o’clock, the camp was ready.</p>

<p>Now it could be seen that over in the Sioux camp,
also, the chiefs and warriors were preparing.</p>

<p>“They’re painting and polishing, Merne,” remarked
Captain Clark, who had levelled the spy-glass, to peer.</p>

<p>That was so. Peter needed no spy-glass. He could
make out figures of the chiefs and warriors sitting and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
plaiting their hair and painting their faces and chests
and arms.</p>

<p>The two captains waited until nearly noon. Then
the red pirogue was dispatched, under Sergeant Pryor,
accompanied by old Pierre, to bring the chiefs and
warriors. The white pirogue was loaded with goods,
but the red pirogue had been emptied for repairs. Even
then the Sioux so crowded it that it scarcely could be
rowed. A number of the young Sioux waded into the
river and swam across.</p>

<p>Now there were more Sioux than white men in the
United States camp. But they were armed mainly with
bows and arrows, while the United States were armed
with rifles; and Peter’s sharp eyes observed that the
cannon in the bow of the barge was pointed right at the
camp, ready for business.</p>

<p>Broad-chested and sinewy were these Yankton
Sioux, and evidently great warriors. What struck
Peter and the soldiers, especially, were the necklaces
of claws stitched in bands of buckskin or red flannel,
and hanging low on those broad chests. Many warriors
wore them.</p>

<p>“D’you mean to say those are b’ar claws!” exclaimed
John Shields, one of the Kentuckians.</p>

<p>“Oui, my frien’,” assured Drouillard, the hunter.
“Dey claw of great white bear—so we call heem.
Beeg! More beeg dan one ox. An’ ’fraid? He not
’fraid of notting. To keel one white bear make Injun
beeg warrior.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>“And where do those critters live, then?” queried
John.</p>

<p>“Up river. We meet ’em pret’ queeck, now. Sometime
w’en we land—woof! Dere coom one beast—beeg
as one ox—mouth he open; an’ mebbe eat us, if
brush so t’ick we not see heem soon ’nough.”</p>

<p>The listening Kentuckians and other soldiers
scratched their heads, as if a little doubtful.</p>

<p>“Faith,” said Patrick Gass, “some o’ them claws
are six inches long, boys. ’Tis a country o’ monsters
that we’re goin’ into.”</p>

<p>A group of the Sioux had been staring at black
York, who, larger than any of them, was gaping back.
Suddenly one stepped to him, wet his finger and
swiftly drew it down York’s cheek; then looked to see
if the black had come off.</p>

<p>“Hey, you man!” growled York. “Wha’ foh
you done do dat?”</p>

<p>Another Sioux deftly snatched off York’s hat, and
clutched the black curly wool underneath; but it would
not come off, either. Much impressed, the circle
widened respectfully, and Sioux murmured gutturally
to Sioux.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, York,” warned Captain Clark,
who had noted; for his own red hair had been
attracting much attention. “They say you’re great
medicine.”</p>

<p>“Oui; he black buffalo,” affirmed young Dorion.</p>

<p>After that York strutted importantly, alarmed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
Indians by making fierce faces, and was followed about
by a constant admiring procession.</p>

<p>The council was held at noon, under the great oak
tree beside which floated the United States flag. The
chiefs and the leading warriors sat in a half circle;
the two captains sat facing them, Pierre Dorion stood
before them as interpreter; and the soldiers and French
boatmen sat behind in another half circle.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis made a welcoming speech—and a
fine figure he was, standing straight and slim, in his
tight-fitting, decorated coat, his cocked hat with black
feather, his sword at his side.</p>

<p>“The land has changed white fathers,” he said.
“The great nation of the Sioux, and all the other
Indians, have a new white father, at Washington.
That is his flag, the flag of the United States nation,
which has bought this country. The new father has
sent us, who are his children, to tell his red children
that he wants them to be at peace with one another. I
have given flags and peace gifts to the Otoes and the
Missouris, and have sent word to the Osages and the
Omahas and the Pawnees and the Kickapoos and other
Indians, that there must be no more wars among the
red children. I will give you a flag and gifts, too, so
that you will remember what I say.”</p>

<p>Then the gifts were distributed. To the head chief,
Weucha, or Shake Hand, a flag, and a first-grade
silver medal, and a paper that certified the United
States recognized him as the head chief, and a string<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
of beads and shells, and a “chief’s coat,” which was a
red-trimmed artillery dress-coat like Captain Clark’s,
and a cocked hat with red feather in it. Weucha was
immensely pleased; he put on the coat and hat at once.</p>

<p>The four other chiefs also were given gifts. Chief
Weucha produced a long peace-pipe of red stone, with
reed stem; it was lighted, he puffed, Captain Lewis and
Captain Clark puffed; the four lesser chiefs puffed.
After that the chiefs solemnly shook hands with the
captains, and withdrew into a lean-to of branches, to
consult on what they should reply to-morrow.</p>

<p>The Sioux stayed at the camp during the afternoon.
The captains gave them a dressed deer-hide and
an empty keg, for a dance drum. The deer-hide was
stretched taut over the head of the keg; and that night,
by the light of the fires, the Sioux thumped on the
drum and shook their rattles, and danced. One-eyed
Cruzatte and George Gibson played on their violins,
and the United States warriors danced. But the Sioux
kept it up almost all night, and nobody got much sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning after breakfast Weucha and his
three sub-chiefs sat before the oak tree; each held a
peace pipe in front of him, with the stem pointing at
the spot where the captains were to sit. The names of
the other chiefs were White Crane, Struck-by-the-Pawnee,
and Half Man.</p>

<p>“He ver’ modes’,” explained One-eyed Cruzatte.
“He say ‘I am no warrior, I only half a man.’”</p>

<p>Weucha spoke first, standing clad in his artillery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
coat and cocked hat. He said that the Yanktons were
willing to be at peace, but were very poor.</p>

<p>White Crane, and Struck-by-the-Pawnee and Half
Man likewise spoke. They agreed with what Shake
Hand had said. They wanted powder and ball, and,
their great father’s “milk”—which was whisky.</p>

<p>That evening the Sioux went back, across the river,
well satisfied. Pierre Dorion and young Pierre went
with them. Old Pierre promised that in the spring
he would take some of the chiefs to Washington, that
they might meet their new father.</p>

<p>Just as the Yanktons were leaving, Captain Lewis
beckoned Peter to him.</p>

<p>“You had better go with Pierre. He will take you
down river in the spring, if not before.”</p>

<p>“No, please,” objected Peter. “I rather stay.”</p>

<p>“But we’re going clear to the Pacific Ocean, my
boy,” spoke Captain Clark. “It will be a hard trip.”</p>

<p>“I will go, too,” declared Peter. “Do not want
to stay with Sioux. I am white.”</p>

<p>“What will you do, along with us, Peter?”</p>

<p>“I work. I can talk sign language,” answered
Peter, proudly.</p>

<p>“There’s something in that, Merne,” laughed Captain
Clark. “Now with Dorion gone we’ll need an
interpreter to help Drouillard. I fancy Peter knows
almost as much as he does.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a kind heart, Will,” replied Captain
Lewis, his eyes softening. “But game’s plenty; we’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
have meat enough—and that’s the main question. All
right, Peter. You can come as far as the Mandan
village, anyway. And in the spring we’ll see.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Peter resolved that he would make
himself useful, so that they would take him clear to
the Pacific Ocean, which lay, according to Patrick Gass
and the other men, many, many days’ travel, far beyond
the western mountains.</p>

<small>BAD HEARTS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Work, work, work! Through this the month of
September, 1804, the boats had been toiling on up the
sluggish Missouri River, in the present State of South
Dakota. With the rains, the winds, and the shallows,
everybody, even the captains, was wet all the day,
from hauling on the tow-ropes, in and out of the water.</p>

<p>The weather turned cold and raw. Shelters of
deer hides were stretched over the two pirogues, and
in the camps the men made themselves hide coats and
leggins and moccasins. Patrick and old Cruzatte together
fitted Peter with a buckskin suit that felt much
better to him than his other, clumsy garments.</p>

<p>After having been gone over two weeks, George
Shannon appeared at last, riding through the rain, with
only one horse. He had been lost, and had almost
starved, and the other horse had broken down. All
were glad to see George again.</p>

<p>But where, now, were the Teton Sioux? George
reported that he had seen none.</p>

<p>The last week in September a great smoke was
sighted in the distance; and that night three Indian
boys swam the river, to enter the camp. They were
Tetons, from two villages a few miles above.</p>

<p>“Give them some tobacco,” directed Captain Lewis.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
“Tell them to say to their chiefs that we will hold a
council to-morrow morning, near the villages.”</p>

<p>On the way up, Reuben Fields, who had been
hunting, horseback, returned afoot and signalled to be
taken aboard. He said that some Indians had stolen
his horse while he was dressing an elk.</p>

<p>“Oui,” chirped Drouillard. “Dose Tetons haf bad
hearts. We best look sharp or dey take scalps, too.”</p>

<p>“We mustn’t let them have the idea they can
plunder us,” spoke Captain Lewis, reddening. “This
leaves us without horses.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t those several Indians, on the bank ahead?”
presently queried Captain Clark.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis peered through his spy-glass.</p>

<p>“Five of them. We’ll stop and hail them, and
hear what they have to say.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they’re the fellows who stole your
horse, Fields?” asked Captain Clark.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell, sir,” answered Reuben. “I had only
a glimpse of the thieves, and these Injuns mainly look
alike, sir, till you get to know ’em.”</p>

<p>The five Indians on the bank stolidly waited, while
the barge hove to, opposite.</p>

<p>“Are they Tetons, Drouillard?” inquired Captain
Lewis.</p>

<p>“Oui,” nodded Drouillard. “Dey Tetons. Eh,
Cruzatte?”</p>

<p>“Mais, oui,” confirmed One-eyed Cruzatte. “Beeg
rascals.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“All right. Tell them that some of their young
men have stolen a horse from their great father at
Washington, and we want it returned or we will hold
no council. We’re willing to be friends, but we aren’t
afraid of them.”</p>

<p>“I do not know much of dees Sioux tongue, but I
will try,” engaged Drouillard. And by signs and a
few words he delivered the message.</p>

<p>The Indians consulted a moment together; then
one of them replied.</p>

<p>“I t’ink dey say dey haf not seen a hoss,” translated
Drouillard. “But if it is found it will be return’.”</p>

<p>“I t’ink so, too,” added the funny Cruzatte—although
everybody was aware that he did not understand
a word of Sioux.</p>

<p>However, by the signs that were made, Peter would
have interpreted the same as Drouillard. He and the
Oto boys had practiced for hours, talking sign language.</p>

<p>The boats stopped for the night off the mouth of
a river on the left or the south. This night only a
few men were allowed ashore, to guard the cook fires;
the remainder slept aboard the boats, with their guns
ready. The captains named the river Teton River,
but it was soon renamed Bad River, for very good
reason.</p>

<p>In the morning everybody, except the boat guards,
landed. The captains ordered the United States flag
hoisted, again, on a pole, and the awning was stretched,
as at the camp where the Otoes had been entertained.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
All the soldiers ashore were formed in rank, under
arms, facing the flag-pole and the canopy; and soon
the Tetons came in to council, from their village two
miles up-river.</p>

<p>There were about sixty of them. They were not
nearly so good-looking as the Yanktons, being smaller,
with slim crooked legs and lean arms, and eyes set over
high cheek-bones.</p>

<p>The council did not pass off very satisfactorily,
because Drouillard knew little Teton talk, and scarcely
could make himself understood when he talked for
Captain Lewis. Still, the head chief, Black Buffalo,
was given a medal, and a United States flag, and a red
coat decorated with white lace, and a cocked hat with
red feather. The second chief, Tor-to-hon-ga or Partisan,
and the third chief, Buffalo Medicine, were given
medals and beads and tobacco. Two warriors, Wah-zing-go,
and Mat-o-co-que-pa or Second Bear, also
were rewarded.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose those raven scalps signify?”
asked George Shannon. For the two warriors wore
each two or three raven skins fastened to their waists
behind, with the tails sticking out, and on their heads
was another raven skin, flattened with the beak to the
fore.</p>

<p>“Dey special soldier,” explained old Cruzatte.
“W’at you call—marshal. Oui. Dey boss. Obey
nobody but chief.”</p>

<p>Then the captains took them all aboard the barge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
to show them the cannon and the air-gun that shot
forty times, and other wonders. Captain Clark
brought them ashore again in the red pirogue.</p>

<p>No sooner had the cable been carried on shore, to
be held by Patrick Gass and Reuben Fields and George
Shannon while the load was landed, and Captain Clark
had stepped out, than three of the Indians grabbed it,
and Wah-zing-go, the warrior, put his arms about the
mast, as if to keep the boat there. Tor-to-hon-ga began
to talk in a loud and angry voice. Captain Clark
flushed.</p>

<p>“What does he say, Peter?” he appealed. For
Drouillard was on the barge, and only Peter was near.
When the five men had started to row the pirogue
ashore, with the chiefs and Captain Clark, he had
slipped in, too.</p>

<p>“The chief say you cannot go away till you give
them more presents,” translated Peter, boldly; for he
had picked up some Sioux words and he could read
the gestures, also.</p>

<p>“What!” And Captain Clark was angry indeed.
He had only five men, two in the boat and three ashore,
but he was not afraid. “You tell him we will go on,
and he can’t stop us. We are not squaws, but warriors.
Our great father has medicine on those boats that will
wipe out twenty Sioux nations.”</p>

<p>“The chief says he has plenty warriors, too,” interpreted
Peter.</p>

<p>And at that moment the chief sprang for Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
Clark; the warriors spread right and left, jerked arrows
from quivers and fitted them to strung bows. Out
whipped Captain Clark’s bright sword—the long knife;
and Chief Tor-to-hon-ga dodged. Captain Clark’s face
was redder than his hair. He acted like a great chief.</p>

<p>“Watch out, Sergeant!” he cried, to Patrick Gass.
“Rally on the boat; never mind the rope. Face them
and stand together, men!”</p>

<p>Captain Lewis’s voice rang high and stern, from
the barge. Out of the white pirogue a dozen men
plashed into the shallows and wading and plunging,
hastened to reinforce the red pirogue. Corporal Warfington
and the six St. Louis soldiers who had been
sent along to help as far as the Mandans were with
them.</p>

<p>“Steady!” warned Captain Lewis. “Look sharp,
Will.” And now the black muzzle of the cannon in the
bows of the barge swung full at the shore. Behind
it stood Gunner Alexander Willard, with lighted
match.</p>

<p>This was enough. Head Chief Black Buffalo
shouted an order, and his men left the cable and the
pirogue and fell back. The “medicine” of the great
father at Washington was, they realized, strong
medicine.</p>

<p>To show that he was not afraid, and that he wished
to be friendly, Captain Clark offered to shake hands
with Black Buffalo and Partisan; but they surlily refused.
So the captain laughed, and ordered the red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
pirogue to return to the barge. Then Black Buffalo
and Partisan, and the warriors Wah-zing-go and
Second Bear ran after, through the water, and climbed
aboard, to go on the barge also.</p>

<p>“Rather a close shave, Will,” remarked Captain
Lewis. “An instant more and I’d have helped you out
with a round of grape.”</p>

<p>“They wished to try our metal,” smiled Captain
Clark.</p>

<p>“We were afraid the white chiefs would go on and
not stop at our village to show our squaws and boys the
great father’s boats,” alleged Chief Black Buffalo.</p>

<p>“Tell him we are willing to be friends, and will
stop,” directed Captain Lewis. “The soldiers of the
great father do not fear the Sioux.”</p>

<p>“If head chief he not tell dat raven soldier to let
go mast, he hang on till cut in leetle pieces,” was saying
Cruzatte.</p>

<p>In the morning the boats were moved up to the
village, and Captain Lewis went ashore. Truly, the
Red Head and the slim Captain Lewis were brave men.
Peter was proud to have been by Captain Clark’s side,
in the fracas. It was fine to be a United States.</p>

<p>When Captain Lewis returned on board, he told
Captain Clark that everything was all right, and that
the Tetons were waiting for the Red Head.</p>

<p>“You’re a bigger man than I am, Will, after the
stand you made yesterday,” he laughed.</p>

<p>And it seemed to be that way, for when Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
Clark landed he was met by ten young warriors, with
a gaily decorated buffalo robe. They carried him upon
it, and then bore him, sitting in it, to the council house.
This was great honor.</p>

<p>“You’re nixt, Cap’n,” ventured Patrick Gass.
“There they are, back for ye, sorr.”</p>

<p>“Be alert, Sergeant,” bade the captain, as he vaulted
from the barge into the pirogue. “They may appear
friendly, but we mustn’t take any chances. Don’t let
the men lay aside their arms for a minute, and keep
them together.”</p>

<p>“Yis, sorr. I will, sorr,” promised Patrick Gass.
He was the oldest soldier in the company, and the
captains relied upon him.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis likewise was borne to the council
house; and the men of the expedition, except the boat
guards, marched after.</p>

<p>The council lasted a long time, and was concluded
with a feast of the dog-meat from a pot, and of buffalo
meat and hominy and ground-potato. Buffalo meat
was given to the white chiefs as a present. The Tetons
claimed to be poor, but they weren’t. This was a powerful
and rich village, as anybody might see. Before the
dance that had been planned for the evening, the men
were permitted to roam about a little. Peter and Patrick
Gass and their party discovered a string of scalps hanging
from a pole, and a number of Omaha squaws and
children who appeared very miserable.</p>

<p>Peter talked with them a little. They were prisoners.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
The Tetons had attacked their village down the
river, and had burned forty lodges and killed seventy-five
warriors.</p>

<p>When dusk fell the dance was started, by the
light of a fire, in the middle of the council house. The
Sioux warriors danced, and the Sioux women danced;
but at midnight the captains told the chief that everybody
was tired and it was time to go to bed.</p>

<p>“The chief he say: ‘Ver’ well. Now sleep. To-morrow
more Sioux come, to talk with de great father.’
He want you to stay,” interpreted Drouillard.</p>

<p>“We will stay and see these other Sioux,” answered
Captain Lewis. “What do you think, Will?”</p>

<p>“If you say so, Merne,” replied Captain Clark.
“But there’s some trick in this. We mustn’t be caught
off guard—and of course we mustn’t show that we’re
afraid, either.”</p>

<p>But no visiting Sioux turned up, although the boats
waited all day. At night another dance was given.</p>

<p>“We in bad feex,” asserted One-eyed Cruzatte.
“Dose Teton, dey keep us. I t’ink dey plan mischief.
I wish we go on.”</p>

<p>Everybody was nervous.</p>

<p>“Now I wonder if we’re in for a fight,” spoke
Corporal Warfington.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Patrick Gass, “we can lick ’em.”</p>

<p>Amidst the dusk ashore, while Peter, tired of the
noise and dancing, was wandering a few steps, a low
voice hailed him, in Oto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>“Hist! You Oto?” It was one of the Omaha
squaws. How could she have guessed that he had been
an Oto?</p>

<p>“No. White,” responded Peter.</p>

<p>“Tell your chiefs the Sioux are bad. They will not
let the big boats go. They play you a trick.”</p>

<p>“I will tell,” responded Peter. “You speak Oto
well.”</p>

<p>“I am Omaha, but I was in Oto village once. I
saw you.” And the squaw vanished.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI">VI<br />
<small>THE CAPTAINS SHOW THEIR SPUNK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Peter believed that the Omaha woman spoke the
truth. The captains ought to be told at once. But the
dancing was still in progress in the lodge of Chief Black
Buffalo, where sat the two captains and the chiefs,
watching. A boy would not be admitted. So Peter
sought out Sergeant John Ordway, who was in charge
of the shore guard. John Ordway was not from Kentucky;
he was from a place called New Hampshire, in
the northeast of the United States.</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” replied John Ordway, when
Peter had told him of the warning from the Omaha
woman. “Well, anybody might suspect as much. I’ll
get word to the captains, first chance.”</p>

<p>The dancing continued until late, again. Peter
curled in the bows of the waiting pirogue, and went to
sleep. He had done his duty and could trust to John
Ordway. By the stars it was midnight when he awakened
at the approach of the captains. They and two
Indian guests and the guard clambered in, and the
pirogue was rowed for the barge.</p>

<p>The shore was silent and dark—but how alert were
those Sioux! The pirogue ran against the anchor
cable of the barge, in the darkness, and broke it. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
barge was adrift. The captains cried loudly, ordering
the oars to be manned and the barge held until a cable
could be passed ashore—and instantly the two Indians
in the pirogue shouted excitedly, in the Sioux tongue,
summoning the village.</p>

<p>“Here! Quick!” they called. “To the boats!
Come!”</p>

<p>The whole village burst into an uproar; the warriors
poured forth to the water’s edge. It was very
plain that they feared the white men were leaving. The
captains could pay little attention until a cable had been
carried from the barge and fastened to a tree on the
bank, and the barge pulled in out of the current.
Then——</p>

<p>“Ask Tor-to-hon-ga what’s the meaning of all this
alarm,” bade Captain Lewis, tersely, of Drouillard.
Tor-to-hon-ga was one of the two guests.</p>

<p>“He say de Tetons ’fraid de ’Maha warriors haf
come up an’ attack de boats of de great white father,”
interpreted Drouillard.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” muttered Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>And anybody might see how foolish was this excuse
of the Tetons: that the Omahas would attack boats
defended by guns, when the Sioux were the real
enemies. After the village was quiet again, at least
sixty Teton warriors remained there on the bank, all
night, ready for action.</p>

<p>“I t’ink,” commented Drouillard, “mebbe we have
leetle trouble, in mornin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>“We’re in a bad box,” quoth Sergeant Ordway.
“Now we’re tied up close to the bank, under direct
fire. We may have a hard time casting off.”</p>

<p>Strong guards were kept under arms, on all the
boats. There was little sleep. Both captains were constantly
about, peering through the darkness, and listening.
Early in the morning the Tetons were assembled;
and while Patrick Gass and a detail were dragging from
a pirogue, trying to find the barge’s anchor, several
chiefs and warriors waded out to the barge and climbed
aboard.</p>

<p>The anchor could not be found.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Captain Lewis. “We’ll go
on without it. Send those fellows ashore, Will.
Sergeant Pryor, take a squad with you and cast off
that rope.”</p>

<p>The Indian visitors did not wish to go ashore, but
Captain Clark ordered them pushed into the pirogue
which was to bear Sergeant Pryor and squad. Chief
Black Buffalo still refused to go. Sergeant Pryor
released the rope from the tree on the bank and returned.
The sail on the barge was being hoisted—and
at the instant laughter and shouts mingled, both ashore
and from the boats.</p>

<p>A number of the Sioux had sat upon the rope,
holding it!</p>

<p>Captain Lewis flared into hot rage.</p>

<p>“Take charge of the pirogues, Will,” he ordered.
“Down behind the gunwale, men. Advance your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
rifles. See that the priming’s fresh, Ordway and Gass.
Stand to your swivel, Willard!” And, to Chief Black
Buffalo: “My young men are ready for battle. If
your young men do not release the rope we
will fire.”</p>

<p>“He say de young men want leetle more tobac’,”
translated Drouillard.</p>

<p>“Tell him we have given all the presents that we’re
going to give,” crisply answered Captain Lewis. “No—wait.
Here!” And snatching a roll of tobacco,
Captain Lewis threw it at Black Buffalo’s feet. “Tell
him there is his tobacco, on the prairie. He says he is
a great chief. Among the white men great chiefs are
obeyed. If he is a great chief let him order his young
men to release that rope and they will obey him. But
we do not believe he is a great chief. He is a squaw,
and the young men laugh at him.”</p>

<p>“Wah!” grunted Chief Black Buffalo, when he
heard. He seized the tobacco and leaped from the
boat, to surge for the shore. There he tumbled his
young men right and left, snatched the rope and hurled
it out into the water.</p>

<p>“Go,” he bawled. Thus he proved himself to be
the great chief.</p>

<p>The soldiers cheered. The barge’s sail caught the
breeze, the barge moved. Just in time Captain Clark
leaped from the pirogue, into which he had transferred,
and gained the gunwale, and the deck.</p>

<p>“Well done, Merne,” he panted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>“Golly!” babbled York. “Dat chief mighty brash
when he get started.”</p>

<p>The barge and the pirogues gained the middle of
the river. Rapidly the Teton village was left behind.
Patrick Gass waved his hat derisively.</p>

<p>“Bad luck to yez,” he said. “Sure, an’ if we’d
stayed a minute longer we’d ha’ put your town into
mournin’. We’re not so paceful as we look.” And
he added: “The ’Rikaras nixt. We’ll hope they be
gintlemen. Annyhow, we’ve no horses left for ’em to
stale.”</p>

<p>Just what was to be expected from the Arikaras
nobody might say, but although they were warlike they
were thought to be not so mean as the Teton Sioux.
The boats forged on, and the month changed to that
of October.</p>

<p>“How far to the ’Rikara villages, sir?” asked
Captain Lewis, of a trader named Valle who came
aboard the barge for a talk.</p>

<p>“By river about 100 miles, captain.”</p>

<p>From an excursion ashore with Captain Clark and
squad, York returned tremendously excited.</p>

<p>“We done found one o’ dem white b’ars,” proclaimed
York. “Yessuh, me an’ Marse Will. Oof!”</p>

<p>“Where’bouts, York?”</p>

<p>“Whar’s his scalp?”</p>

<p>“Did you get a shot at him?”</p>

<p>Questions were volleyed thick and fast. York
wagged his woolly head and rolled his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>“Nossuh. Didn’t get no shot at him. We des
seen his track, in dem bushes yonduh near de mout’
ob de ribber. Oof! Marse Will he set his moccasin
cl’ar inside, an’ dat track it stuck out all ’round. ’Spec’
dis chile ain’t got bus’ness wif dem critters. Oof!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed George Shannon. “According to
Drouillard even the Indians won’t tackle one of those
white bears, except in a crowd of six or eight. And if
they don’t shoot him through the head or heart he’s
liable to out-fight them all. Before they go after him
they make big medicine, same as if they were going
to war with a whole nation.”</p>

<p>“He’s ’special fond of black meat, too, I hear
tell,” slyly remarked John Thompson.</p>

<p>York rolled his eyes, and muttered. But the Kentuckians,
some of whom had hunted with Daniel Boone,
fingered their rifles eagerly and surveyed the low country
at the mouth of the river, as if hoping to see York’s
monster stirring.</p>

<p>The next day the first Arikara Indians came aboard,
from their lower village. Captain Lewis went with
some of them to return the visit. He was accompanied
back by Mr. Tabeau and Mr. Gravelines, two French
traders who lived with the Arikaras. Mr. Gravelines
spoke the Arikara language.</p>

<p>There were three Arikara villages, so that the captains
ordered camp made on the north side of the river,
across from the villages.</p>

<p>The Arikaras were tall, handsome people—much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
superior, thought Patrick Gass and the rest of the men,
to the Sioux. Chiefs Ka-ka-wis-sas-sa or Lighting
Crow, Fo-cas-se or Hay, and Pi-a-he-to or Eagle’s
Feather, were introduced by Mr. Gravelines, and the
camp soon filled with the Arikara warriors, and even
squaws who rowed across in little skin boats of a single
buffalo hide stretched over basket-work.</p>

<p>York held a regular reception, for he appeared to
astonish the Arikaras as much as he had astonished the
Sioux.</p>

<p>“Hey, Marse Tabeau,” he called, to the French
trader. “Des tell dese people I’se bohn wil’, an’ my
young marster done ketched me when I was runnin’ in
de timber an’ tamed me. Tell ’em I used to eat peoples
bones an’ all. I’se a sorter g’riller.” And thereupon
York seized a thick stick, and snapped it in his two
hands, and howled and gritted his teeth. He was very
strong, was York.</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted the Arikaras, respectfully falling
back from him.</p>

<p>“That will do, York,” cautioned Captain Clark,
trying not to laugh.</p>

<p>But York, of much importance, thoroughly enjoyed
himself.</p>

<p>The Arikaras were splendid entertainers and exceedingly
hospitable—“’Mos’ like white folks,”
asserted York. They did not beg, as the Sioux had
begged; they gave lavishly out of their store of corn
and beans and dried squashes, and accepted thankfully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
the gifts from the great father; they would not drink
any whisky—“We are surprised that the great father
should send us liquor to make fools of us,” said Chief
Lighting Crow. Their houses were built close together,
of a willow frame plastered with mud, and were entered
through a covered passage-way that kept out the wind.
Around each village was a fence of close upright
pickets, for defense. They were well armed, too, with
guns.</p>

<p>When it came time, after the councils had been
held, to leave the friendly Arikaras, all the men of the
expedition hated to go. John Newman, who had enlisted
at St. Louis, was the most out-spoken.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he uttered, boldly, among his comrades
at the last camp fire. “Why should we go on,
up to those Mandans? Why can’t we spend the winter
where we are? The Mandan village is nigh on 200
miles yet, and I’m tired of working my hands raw in
this cold weather, hauling the boats over sand-bars.”</p>

<p>“Orders be orders,” reminded Patrick Gass. “An’
up to the Mandans we go, I’m thinkin’.”</p>

<p>“Not if we show a little spunk and say we want
to stay,” retorted John.</p>

<p>“Whisht, now!” cautioned Patrick. “Would ye
spoil a good record? Faith,” he added, “if the captain
heard ye he’ll have ye on the carpet for mutiny, b’gorry.”
Captain Clark had strode hastily by, wrapped
in his cloak. “It’s mutiny ye’re talkin’,” scolded
Patrick Gass. “An’ I want no more of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>Captain Clark had heard, for at breaking camp in
the morning, John was placed under arrest and confined
in the forecastle aboard the barge.</p>

<p>That night, at camp, twenty-five miles above the
Arikara villages, a court-martial was held on the case
of John Newman. He was found guilty of mutinous
speech and sentenced to received seventy-five lashes,
and be suspended from the company. The next noon
the boats stopped in the rain, at a sand-bar in the middle
of the river, everybody was ordered out, and John was
roundly whipped on the naked back with ramrods and
switches.</p>

<p>Chief Ah-ke-tah-na-sha of the Arikaras, who was
going with the expedition up to the Mandans, to make
peace between the Mandans and the Arikaras, squatted
on the sand-bar, to watch. Evidently he did not understand,
for he began to weep.</p>

<p>“Why does Ah-ke-tah-na-sha cry?” asked Captain
Clark.</p>

<p>Ah-ke-tah-na-sha, who could speak some Sioux,
explained to Drouillard, and Drouillard explained to
the captains.</p>

<p>“He say de ’Rikara dey punish by death, but dey
never whip even de children. He weep for Newman.”</p>

<p>“Tell him what the matter is, and that this is the
white man’s way of punishing disobedience,” directed
Captain Clark, to Drouillard.</p>

<p>Drouillard did; and reported.</p>

<p>“He say mebbe so, but ’mong Injuns to whip men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
make women of dem. If dees is white man way, all
right. Men ought to obey deir chiefs.”</p>

<p>“Now aren’t ye ’shamed o’ yourself, when even an
Injun cries over ye?” reproved Patrick Gass, of John
Newman, who was painfully donning his shirt and
coat.</p>

<p>“Well, I am,” admitted John. “I guess I deserved
what I got. I don’t harbor any grudge, and I’ll do my
duty.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII<br />
<small>SNUG IN WINTER QUARTERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The weather had grown much colder, with squalls
of snow and sleet and high winds; the wild geese were
flying high, headed into the south; and the river, falling
rapidly, was split with bars and narrow channels,
when, two weeks after the punishment of John Newman,
the barge and the two pirogues anchored off the
first of the Mandan villages, in the centre of present
North Dakota.</p>

<p>“Five long months we’ve been travelin’, an’ for
sixteen hundred crooked miles,” quoth Patrick Gass.
“Sure we desarve a bit o’ rist. Now what will the
Mandans say, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Did you see that young fellow who’d lost the
halves of two fingers?” queried George Shannon.
“Well, he’d cut ’em off, on purpose, because some of
his relatives had died! That’s the Mandan way of
going into mourning.”</p>

<p>“’Twould be better to cut the hair, I’m thinkin’,”
said Pat. “They most of ’em nade it—an’ hair’ll grow
again.”</p>

<p>The Mandans had swarmed aboard, and were examining
every object with much curiosity. They were
an odd people, wrinkled and of low stature—many of
the women with brown hair, but others with gray hair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
which flared almost to the ground. However, their
voices were gentle, and they brought gifts of corn and
vegetables, in earthen jars.</p>

<p>Mr. Jessaume, a French trader among them, also
came aboard; so did a Scotchman named Hugh McCracken,
from a British fur company post far north.</p>

<p>“They’re frindly, be they, Pierre?” asked Pat, of
One-eyed Cruzatte, who was hobbling past after a lively
conversation with Mr. Jessaume.</p>

<p>“Oui,” answered Cruzatte, with a grimace of pain.
“I t’ink we stay an’ spen’ one winter. Dey glad. We
protect’ dem ’gainst de Sioux. My poor leg, he carry
me not furder, anyway.”</p>

<p>For Cruzatte had the rheumatism in both knees.
Reuben Fields was laid up with the rheumatism in his
neck; and Captain Clark had been so bothered with a
stiff neck that he could not move around until Captain
Lewis had applied a hot stone wrapped in red flannel.</p>

<p>“Hi!” cackled big York, strutting as usual. “Dese
heah Mandans done gif me name Great Medicine,
Mistuh McCracken say. Dey wants me foh a chief.”</p>

<p>“There’s coal in the banks, yonder,” spoke George
Shannon. “See it, Peter?”</p>

<p>“What is coal?” ventured Peter.</p>

<p>“Black stuff, like a rock, that will burn.”</p>

<p>“It’ll make fine fuel for my forge,” put in John
Shields, who was clever at fashioning things out of
metal. “Expect I’ll be busy all winter, smithing, while
you other fellows are hunting and dancing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>The Mandan villages were three in number. There
was a village of Minnetarees, also; and a village of
Ar-wa-cah-was and Ah-na-ha-ways—Indians whom
neither Drouillard nor Cruzatte knew.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, now, belike there be plenty Injuns on
ahead, too, that ye never heard of,” declared Pat.
“Yis, an’ lots of other cur’osities before we get to the
Paycific Ocean.”</p>

<p>The head chief of all the Mandans was Pos-cap-sa-he,
or Black Cat. The chief of the lowest village
was Sha-ha-ka, or Big White. The chief of the second
village was Raven Man. The chief of the Ar-wa-cah-was
was White Buffalo Robe. The chief of the
Ah-na-ha-ways was Cherry-on-a-Bush, or Little Cherry,
but he was very old. The chief of the Minnetaree
village was Black Moccasin. And the chief of the
upper Mandan village, across from the Minnetaree
village, was Red Shield.</p>

<p>The two captains met in council with all the villages
together, and smoked the pipe of peace and distributed
gifts. During the speeches old Cherry-on-a-Bush, the
Ah-na-ha-way chief, rose to go, because, he said, his
son was on the war-trail against the Sho-sho-nes, or
Snakes, and his village was liable to be attacked.</p>

<p>“Shame on you, for an impolite old man,” rebuked
Sha-ha-ka, Big White. “Do you not know better than
to show such bad manners before the chiefs from the
great white father?”</p>

<p>And poor Cherry-on-a-Bush sat down mumbling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>The Arikara chief who had come up on the barge
was well received. The Mandans promised to observe
peace between the two nations.</p>

<p>“We did not begin the war,” they said. “We have
been killing those ’Rees like we kill birds, until we are
tired of killing. Now we will send a chief to them,
with this chief of theirs, and they can smoke peace.”</p>

<p>Camp was made at a spot picked out by Captain
Clark, across the river, below the first Mandan village,
and everybody not on guard duty was set at work
erecting winter quarters. Captain Clark had charge of
the camp, but Patrick Gass “bossed” the work. He
was a carpenter. Axes rang, trees were felled and
under Patrick’s direction were trimmed and notched, to
form the walls and roofs of the cabins.</p>

<p>There were to be two rows of cabins, joined so as
to make four rooms, below, on each side, and four
rooms above, entered by ladders. The walls were of
hewn logs tightly chinked with clay; and the ceilings,
seven feet high, were of planks trimmed with adzes—and
covered with grass and clay to make a warm floor
for the lofts. The roofs slanted inward, which made
the outside of the rows eighteen feet high, so that
nobody could climb over. Every down-stairs room had
a fire-place, and a plank floor. The two rows met, at
one end, and were open at the other; and across this
opening was to be stretched a high fence of close, thick
pickets, entered by a stout gate.</p>

<p>The Mandans and their Indian friends marveled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
much at the skill of the white men, and at the strength
of York, the Great Medicine. They admitted that
these white men’s houses were better even than the
Mandan lodges—although the Mandan lodges were
also of heavy timbers, plastered with earth, and banked
with earth at the bottoms; had doors of buffalo hide,
and fireplaces in the middle.</p>

<p>Mr. Jessaume, the French trader, moved to the
camp, with his Mandan wife and child; and so did
another French trader named Toussaint Chaboneau.
He had two wives: one was very old and ugly, but
the other was young and handsome. She was a Sho-sho-ne
girl, from far-off. The Minnetaree Indians
had attacked her people and taken her captive, and
Chaboneau had bought her as his wife. She and the
old wife did not get along together very well.</p>

<p>Mr. Jessaume and Chaboneau could speak the languages,
and were hired by the captains to be interpreters
for the camp.</p>

<p>“My young wife come from ze Rock mountains,”
said Chaboneau—who was a dark little man, his
wrinkled face like smoked leather. “One time I was
dere. I trade with Minnetaree.”</p>

<p>“You never were over the mountains, Toussaint,
were you?” asked Sergeant Pryor.</p>

<p>“Me, Monsieur Sergeant?” And Toussaint shuddered.
“Ma foi (my word), no! It is not ze possible.
Up dere, no meat, no grass, no trail, notting but rock,
ice, cold, an’ ze terrible savages out for ze scalp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>The cabins were erected rapidly, for the cottonwood
logs were soft and easily split. The first trees
were felled on November 3, and on November 20 the
walls were all in place. The men moved in before the
roofs were put on, but buffalo hides were stretched
over.</p>

<p>The two captains occupied one cabin, at the head
of the angle. And six or seven men were assigned to
each of the other cabins. Sergeant Patrick Gass,
Privates George Shannon, Reuben Fields and Joseph
Fields, who were great hunters, George Gibson, who
played the violin, John Newman, who now was no
longer mutinous, but worked with a will, and Peter
formed one mess; Corporal Warfington and his six
soldiers from St. Louis formed another; Drouillard,
the hunter, and five of the French boatmen another;
One-eyed Cruzatte and five other boatmen another;
and so forth. Jessaume and Chaboneau had erected
their own lodges.</p>

<p>It was high time that the cabins were completed.
The weather turned very cold and windy, and ice
floated in the river. The roofs were hastened, and the
picket fence ought to be erected soon, for the Mandans
were not yet satisfied with the presence of the white
men.</p>

<p>Black Cat and Big White were frequent visitors.
One day after Black Cat had spent the whole morning
talking with the captains, Chaboneau reported the bad
news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>“Mebbe now dere is troubles,” he uttered, as he
sat toasting his shins at the fire in the Patrick Gass
cabin. He had entered with a gay “Bon soir (good
evening), messieurs,” and had brought a draft of icy
air with him. “Mebbe now dere is troubles.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Toussaint?”</p>

<p>“I interpret for ze Black Cat an’ ze captains. Ze
Black Cat say ze Sioux dey much enrage’, ’cause ze
’Rees make ze peace with ze Mandan. Dey sen’ ze
word dat someday dey come up an’ take ze scalp of all
ze ’Ree an’ ze Mandan an’ ze white soldier. Dey sorry
dey did not kill ze white soldier down-river, for ze
white soldier carry bad talk. Black Cat fear. He fear
mebbe ze ’Ree get scare’ an’ help ze Sioux, an’ he been
tol’, too, dat ze white soldiers build strong fort, to stay
an’ try to make slaves of ze Mandan, an’ soon ze whole
country he be Sioux.”</p>

<p>“That sounds like the British,” remarked George
Shannon. “They naturally don’t want the United
States in here, taking away their trade. They’d like to
have us driven out.”</p>

<p>“An’ what did the captains say?” inquired Patrick
Gass.</p>

<p>“Dey say Black Cat must not open hees ears to such
talk,” answered Toussaint. “Ze United States speak
only truth, an’ if ze Mandan listen ze white soldiers
will protec’ dem ’gainst all deir enemies. Black Cat
say dere been a council held, on ze matter, an’ ze
Mandan will wait an’ see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>Much was yet to be done before the fort was secure.
The barge ought to be unloaded and its goods stored
in the two store-cabins. The men in the Gass cabin
spent their time evenings braiding a large rope of elk-skin,
by which the barge might be hauled up on the
bank, farther out of the ice. Big White and Little
Raven and other chiefs and warriors brought meat,
on the backs of their squaws. Big White’s village was
across the river, and he and his wife came over in their
buffalo-hide boat. She followed him to the fort, with
100 pounds of meat at a time on her back. She was
delighted with the gift of a hand-ax, with which to cut
wood for the lodge fire. The captains presented the
Mandan nation with an iron mill for grinding corn.
This pleased the women.</p>

<p>The weather turned warm, and Captain Lewis took
a squad of men, to pay a visit to the villages. Only
one chief was unfriendly. He, named Mah-pah-pa-pa-ra-pas-sa-too,
or Horned Weasel, refused to see the
captain at all.</p>

<p>“And we know the reason why,” asserted Sergeant
Pryor, who had been along. “Seven traders of the
British Northwest Company have just come down with
dog-sleds from the north country, and are giving out
British flags and medals and telling the chiefs we
aren’t true men.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Francois Larocque, the captain of the
traders, paid a visit to the fort, Captain Lewis informed
him very strongly that the United States would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
not tolerate any flags and medals except those authorized
by the President. This was now United States
territory.</p>

<p>This day Sergeant Pryor dislocated his shoulder
while helping to take down the mast of the barge.</p>

<p>Now cold weather set in again, and the river was
closed by ice. The snow fell for a day and a night,
and lay thirteen inches deep. But fortunately the roofs
were on the cabins, the stone chimneys drew well, and
there was plenty of meat and dried corn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII<br />
<small>EXCITEMENT AT FORT MANDAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Ho! Hi! Hi-o!”</p>

<p>It was the morning after Sergeant Pryor had hurt
his shoulder, and the Northwest Company traders had
been talked to by Captain Lewis; a bitterly cold morning,
too, with a stinging north wind blowing across the
snow and ice. The shrill call drifted flatly.</p>

<p>“Hi! Hi-o!”</p>

<p>“Sergeant of the guard,” summoned William
Bratton, who in beaver-fur cap, buffalo-fur coat and
overshoes and mittens was walking sentry outside the
opening of the two lines of cabins.</p>

<p>Sergeant John Ordway came running. All the men
stopped their after-breakfast tasks at the barge and in
the street and in the timber, to gaze and listen. On
the opposite bank of the river an Indian stood, wrapped
in his buffalo-robe, with his hands to his mouth, calling.
The river, frozen from shore to shore, was only 400
yards wide, and the voice carried clearly.</p>

<p>“I dunno what he wants, but he wants something,”
informed Sentry Bratton.</p>

<p>“Hi! Hi-o!” And then signs and a jangle of
Indian words.</p>

<p>“He wants to talk with us,” explained Peter, who
read the signs, to George Shannon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>“Where’s Chaboneau?” demanded Sergeant Ordway.
“Here, Toussaint! What’s he saying?”</p>

<p>“Hi!” called back Chaboneau, with lifted hand.
And listened to the answer. “He say he have somet’ing
ver’ important to tell to ze Long Knife an’ ze Red
Head. He want to come over.”</p>

<p>The Indian crossed on the ice. The sergeant and
Chaboneau accompanied him to the headquarters
cabin at the head of the street. The Indian was
not closeted there very long. Out from the cabin
bustled Sergeant Ordway again, and hastened down
to the barge.</p>

<p>“Oh, Gass! Here—you’re to take twenty men, Pat,
and go with Captain Clark. See that they’re well
armed, and in marching order. The captain means
business.”</p>

<p>“That I will,” replied Pat, dropping his armful
of supplies. “B’gorry, I hope it’s a bit of a fight.”</p>

<p>“What’s up, John?” queried half a dozen voices.</p>

<p>“The Sioux have tried to wipe out a party of
Mandans, down to the southwest, and Big White’s
afraid the village is going to be attacked. So now’s
the time for us to help Big White and show these
Mandans our hearts are good.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cheered Pat. “All right.”</p>

<p>Out from the headquarters cabin strode Captain
Clark, in his furs, and buckling his sword about his
waist outside of his buffalo overcoat. Usually he did
not wear his sword. He was known as the Red Head.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Captain Lewis was known as the Long Knife, because
he was rarely without his sword.</p>

<p>Behind Captain Clark came Chaboneau, and York,
agrin, carrying his rifle, and looking indeed like a black
buffalo.</p>

<p>Peter thrilled. He was wild to go, himself. He
ran after Pat, and clutched him by his skirt.</p>

<p>“I go, Pat.”</p>

<p>“By no orders o’ mine, bedad,” rebuked Pat. “Ah,
now,” he added. “Sure, it’s the Irish blood in ye—an’
if ye snake after an’ the cap’n doesn’t see ye, I’ll
not send ye back. But ye can’t go furder’n the village.
Mind that.”</p>

<p>“York can go. I can go,” asserted Peter, for York
was no soldier, either, although sometimes he pretended
to be. So Peter ran to York.</p>

<p>“You get out, boy,” rebuked York, strutting about
while the men were being formed at Sergeant Pat’s
sharp orders. “Dis am wah! Dis am berry seryus
bus’ness when Cap’n Will done buckle on his sword.
Yessuh. ’Tain’t no place foh chillun.”</p>

<p>“Did Captain Clark say you could go?” challenged
Peter.</p>

<p>“’Twa’n’t necessitous, chile,” retorted York.
“Marse Will gwine to take keer ob his soldiers; I go
to take keer ob Marse Will. He cain’t get along wiffout
Yawk. I raise him from a baby.”</p>

<p>But when the little column pressed forward, Captain
Clark and Chaboneau, the interpreter, in the lead,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
Sergeant Pat conducting the double file of men, and
York toiling behind, Peter trotted at the heels of York.</p>

<p>York glanced over his shoulder, and grunted.</p>

<p>“Huh! ’Spec’ you think you gwine to help carry
Marse Will’s scalps.”</p>

<p>The ice was firm and snow-covered. Captain Clark
led straight across. No sounds except the barking of
dogs issued from the site of the Big White village,
above. The Sioux had not yet attacked. Not an
Indian was to be seen; in the distance before, the
smoke from the lodges streamed in the wind. The
captain made a half circuit of the village, and entered
it on a sudden, from the land side. At the approach
of the little company the Mandan dogs barked furiously—women
screamed—the village seemed to be alarmed;
but Chief Big White, and Chief O-hee-naw, a captive
Cheyenne, and Chief Sho-ta-haw-ro-ra or Coal, issued
to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>“We have come to protect our friends the Mandans,”
announced Captain Clark.</p>

<p>“The Red Head chief is welcome,” bade Big
White, breathless—for he was rather fat. His hair,
pure white, bushed out all around his head. “Let
my brothers come to the council lodge.”</p>

<p>Peter had done well to stick by York; for York
was Great Medicine, and of course was gladly admitted
into a council. Peter sidled in beside him. If he had
tried to get in alone, the chiefs would have ordered
him out. Councils were no places for boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>Captain Clark made a speech.</p>

<p>“We have heard that the Sioux have not kept our
peace talk in their hearts,” he said, “but have attacked
our friends, the Mandans, and have stained the prairie
with blood. So we armed at once and are here to
lead the Mandan warriors against the Sioux and punish
them for their treachery.”</p>

<p>“Wah!” grunted the chiefs and warriors, approving.
They spoke together, in their half circle, a few
minutes; and O-hee-naw, or Big Man, the Cheyenne,
arose and dropped his robe, to answer.</p>

<p>“We see now,” said Big Man, “that what you
have told us before is true. When our enemies attack
us, you are ready to protect us. But, father, the snow
is deep, the weather is very cold, and our horses cannot
travel far. The murderers have gone off. In the
spring, when the snow has disappeared, if you will
conduct us we will follow you to the Sioux and the
’Ricaras with all our warriors.”</p>

<p>When the council dispersed, the Mandans were in a
very good humor. Chief Big White accompanied Captain
Clark back to the river, and hugged him, at parting.</p>

<p>“We love our white fathers,” he declared. “My
village has been weeping night and day for the young
man slain by the Sioux; but now my people will wipe
their eyes.”</p>

<p>Across the ice Captain Clark marched his men, to
the fort again.</p>

<p>“Huh!” grumbled York. “Dose Mandans, dey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
ain’t gwine to fight when ’tain’t comf’table to fight.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I’m thinkin’ that was jest a Mandan trick,
to try our mettle,” asserted Patrick Gass.</p>

<p>“De Mandans now our heap frien’s,” assured
Drouillard.</p>

<p>Colder grew the weather, until at the close of the
first week in December the mercury of the thermometer
stood at 10 above zero. The earth was freezing so rapidly
that the men had hard work to set the pickets of the
fence which was to enclose the open end of the fort.</p>

<p>Now on the morning of December 7, Patrick Gass
paused in his work of aligning the fence stringers to
which the pickets were being spiked, and swung his
arms and puffed. His breath floated white in the biting
wind. He had peeled his overcoat, and was working
in his flannel shirt. Sha-ha-ka the Mandan chief
shuffled business-like through the opening left for the
gate. He was muffled from chin to ankles in a buffalo
robe; and above it protruded his bushy white hair
framing his solemn but good-humored wrinkled face.</p>

<p>“Top o’ the mornin’ to ye, Big White,” hailed Pat.
“What’s the good news, this fine day?”</p>

<p>“Ooh!” grunted Big White, scarcely checking his
stride. “Where Red Head? Long Knife? Heap
buffs.” And he passed on.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cheered Patrick Gass. “Buff’lo, does
he say?”</p>

<p>Suddenly, through the thin air drifted a distant
medley of shrill shouts, across the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“Listen!” bade Cruzatte. “Dey hunt boof’lo!
De boof’lo haf come out on de prairie!”</p>

<p>The uproar increased. Sha-ha-ka had disappeared
in headquarters; but out burst York, and Chaboneau,
and Jessaume, armed and running for horses. Out
issued Captain Clark and Sha-ha-ka, followed by Captain
Lewis. Baptiste Lepage, a new interpreter, yelled
in French to Jessaume, and Jessaume excitedly
answered.</p>

<p>“Gran’ boof’lo hunt,” proclaimed Baptiste, running
also. “Ever’body hunt ze boof’lo.”</p>

<p>Tools were dropped, but Captain Clark’s voice rang
clearly.</p>

<p>“Pryor!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Take a dozen men who aren’t otherwise engaged
and join the Indians across the river in that buffalo
hunt. Get all the meat you can. Use what horses you
need, but don’t wait for me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I will, sir.” And rejoiced, Sergeant
Pryor, whose arm had healed, called off the names as
he bustled hither-thither.</p>

<p>“Arrah!” mourned Patrick Gass. “That laves us
out, fellows. ‘Not otherwise engaged,’ said the captain.
An’ here we are with our fince not finished.”</p>

<p>Captain Clark and Chief Big White were hurrying
for the river, and the village beyond.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want your rifle, Will?” called Captain
Lewis, after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“No, Merne. I’ll hunt as the Indians do. We’ll
beat them at their own game.”</p>

<p>Already the Sergeant Pryor detachment were
mounting. There were scarcely horses enough to go
around, for only enough had been hired from the
Mandans to supply the regular hunters.</p>

<p>“There are more at the village, lads,” called Captain
Lewis.</p>

<p>The men without mounts went running, plodding,
laughing, across the snowy ice, for the village. York
was pressing after the captain and the chief. He carried
a rifle and had a large knife belted around his
soldier’s overcoat. Peter delayed not, but scurried,
too.</p>

<p>“I stay by Marse Will,” was declaring York. “We
show dem Injuns.”</p>

<p>In mid-river the sounds from the hunt were plainer.
To thud of hoofs the squad under Sergeant Pryor raced
past with a cheer and flourish of weapons. At the
village the squad afoot were met by squaws, holding
ponies. A young squaw who had frequently smiled on
York tendered him the hide rope of a splendid black.</p>

<p>“Great Medicine heap kill ’um,” she urged.</p>

<p>“Huh! Dey all like Yawk,” chuckled York,
scrambling aboard.</p>

<p>The other men were grabbing ropes and mounting.
A very old and ugly squaw with a spotted pony yelped
at Peter (who knew better than to push forward) and
signed. She thrust the pony’s thong at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>“Boy go,” she cackled, grinning toothless. She
signed “Wait,” and shuffled away, fast.</p>

<p>All the men except Peter and York left, hammering
their ponies with their overshoes, in haste to join the
fray. Yonder, about a mile, a snow dust hung in the
wind, and under it black figures plunged and darted.
Reports of fire-arms boomed dully.</p>

<p>Captain Clark and Chief Sha-ha-ka had disappeared
in the chief’s lodge, before which stood a squaw holding
two horses. Peter’s squaw came trotting back, with
a bow and quiver of arrows. Grinning, she extended
them to Peter, and signed: “Go! Shoot!” Peter
thankfully accepted—slung the quiver at his waist,
strung the bow. He never had killed a buffalo, but he
had shot rabbits; now he would kill a buffalo. The
bow was a strong little bow, but after these weeks of
work he had a strong little arm.</p>

<p>“Golly!” chuckled York. “Cap’n Clark done got
a bow, too.”</p>

<p>For the captain and Sha-ha-ka had emerged from
the chief’s lodge. Sha-ha-ka was muffled in a buffalo
robe; so was the captain. He had shed his overcoat,
and his cap, had bound about his brow a scarlet handkerchief,
Indian fashion, and his red hair flowed loose
to his shoulders. He carried a bow; doubtless underneath
his robe was the quiver.</p>

<p>As quick as the chief he snatched the hide rope from
the squaw’s willing fingers, and vaulted upon the pony’s
back, and he and Big White pounded off together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>“Come on, boy,” bade York; and he and Peter
launched in pursuit.</p>

<p>“Never mind me, York,” yelled the captain, over
his shoulder. “I’ll take care of myself. This gray is
the best buffalo horse in the village.”</p>

<p>“Marse Will done been brung up by Dan’l Boone,”
explained York, to Peter. “Yessuh; done shot wif
bow’n arrer, too, back in ol’ Kaintuck. Reg’lar Injun,
Marse Will is.”</p>

<p>The Indian ponies were saddled only with a buffalo-hide
pad, from which hung thong loops into which the
rider might thrust his feet, if he wished. Peter could
not reach the loops. And the ponies were bridled only
with a single thong which looped around the lower
jaw. But Peter had ridden in this fashion many a
time before.</p>

<p>York clung like a huge ape. To ride bareback was
nothing new to him. Before, the captain sat as if
glued fast. Sha-ha-ka could sit no firmer than the
Red Head.</p>

<p>The breeze was keen, whistling past one’s ears and
stinging one’s cheeks. But see! The buffalo! There
were hundreds, in a writhing, surging, scampering, bewildered
mass. They had come out of the sheltered
bottoms to feed in the open, and the Indians had espied
them. Now around and around them sped the Indians,
yelling, volleying arrows, stabbing with lances, working
at the mass, cutting out animals and pursuing them
to the death. The hunters from the fort were at work,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
also. Guns puffed little clouds, which mingled with
the greater cloud of snow.</p>

<p>Here and there were lying buffalo carcasses, reddening
the snow. The captain and Sha-ha-ka, and
then Peter and York, began to pass some, and the
blood-stains were frequent. Before, other buffalo were
staggering, or whirling and charging. Indians on their
ponies dodged, and plied their arrows. Peter glimpsed
One-eyed Cruzatte, and Chaboneau—they could hardly
be told from the Indians, so cleverly they managed their
ponies. Sergeant Pryor had been thrown, and was
running afoot, a great bull after him. Ah!</p>

<p>Chief Sha-ha-ka whooped shrilly, and dropped his
buffalo-robe about his thighs. Captain Clark dropped
his, and laid arrow on bow. Their ponies quickened,
as if understanding.</p>

<p>“Gwan, you hoss! Gwan!” implored York, hammering
his black mount. The spotted pony also leaped
eagerly.</p>

<p>With a loud shout Captain Clark charged straight
at Sergeant Pryor’s bull. The gray horse bore him
close alongside, on the right—the proper place. When
even with the bull the captain drew bow, clear from
hand to shoulder, loosed string—and the arrow, swifter
than sight, buried to the feathers just back of the bull’s
foreleg. The stung bull jumped and whirled; on raced
the gray horse, and wheeled; the bull, his head down,
lunged for him—and the gray horse sprang aside—the
bull forged past, the captain was ready with another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
arrow—twang! thud!—the gray horse leaped again, to
follow up—but the great bull halted, faltered, drooped
his head, his tail twitched and lashed, still his head
slowly drooped, he straddled, and began to sink.</p>

<p>“Catch your horse, Pryor. Quick!” ordered the
captain. “You can’t hunt afoot.” And before the
bull’s body had touched the snow he was away again,
in the wake of the frantic herd, his red hair flaming
on the wind.</p>

<p>“Fust kill foh Marse Will,” jubilated York. He
and Peter scarcely had had time to check their horses.
“He done beat Big White. Come on, boy!”</p>

<p>In a twinkling all was confusion, of buffalo bellowing,
fleeing, charging; of horsemen shouting, pursuing,
dodging, shooting; of flying snow and blood
and steaming breaths and reek of perspiring bodies.
Peter speedily lost York; he lost Sha-ha-ka and Captain
Clark—but occasionally he sighted them, now separated,
now near together, as if they were rivals. He
lost everything but himself and pony and the buffalo.
He shot, too; he saw his arrows land, he left wounded
buffalo behind and chased others; and ever and again
he saw the red hair of the captain.</p>

<p>The captain was in his buckskin shirt; Sha-ha-ka
was in buckskin; many of the Indians rode half naked—excitement
kept them warm. Peter felt no cold,
through his buckskin and his flannel shirt. He had
been more thinly clad in the Oto village and was used
to weather. But bitter was the wind, nevertheless, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
the wounds of the prone buffalo almost instantly froze.</p>

<p>The chase had proceeded for a mile—and on a sudden
Chief Big White, from a little rise in a clear space,
shouted high and waved his robe. It was the signal
for the hunt to cease. The turmoil died, the frightened
herd rushed on, and the horsemen dropped behind, to
turn back. The squaws from the village already had
been at work with their knives, cutting up the dead
buffalo. They must work fast, on account of the cold.
They carefully pulled out the arrows and laid them
aside, so that it might be told to whom that buffalo
belonged. The arrows of each hunter bore his mark,
in paint on the shaft or the feathers.</p>

<p>Captain Clark rode in, panting and laughing, with
Sha-ha-ka. His quiver was empty, his buffalo-horse
frost-covered from eye-brows to tail. Sha-ha-ka
treated him with great respect; and so did the other
Indians.</p>

<p>“Dey say de Red Head one great chief. He ride
an’ shoot like Injun,” explained Chaboneau, as the company
from the fore assembled.</p>

<p>“Marse Will kill more buff’los dan all the rest ob
dem put togedder,” prated York. “Only he done run
out ob arrers. Den he try to choke ’em wif his hands!”</p>

<p>Five buffalo were credited to the captain—his
arrows were in them. Five more were credited to the
soldiers, who had been hampered by their unsaddled
horses and by the big overcoats. York claimed three
of the five—but nobody could believe York. The interpreters—Chaboneau<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
and Lepage and Jessaume—had
made their own kills, for their families.</p>

<p>“How many do you claim, Peter?” inquired the
captain, with a smile.</p>

<p>“The old squaw who gave me the horse and bow,
she owns what I kill,” answered Peter, carefully.</p>

<p>For there she was, cutting up a fat cow, from which
one of Peter’s arrows protruded. Peter rode over to
her.</p>

<p>“Mine,” he signed, proudly.</p>

<p>But she only grinned and shook her head, and
pointed to his pony and his bow. Then she handed one
of his arrows to him.</p>

<p>“Keep,” she said. “Keep bow. Make big hunter.”</p>

<p>Understanding, Peter rode away. There seemed to
be plenty of meat, but a good bow and quiver was a
prize. So he was willing to trade.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX<br />
<small>PETER WINS HIS SPURS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>To twenty-one, and then to thirty-eight below zero
dropped the thermometer. The captains forbade the
men to venture far from the fort, and the sentinels
were relieved every half hour. The air was so filled
with ice haze that two suns seemed to be shining.</p>

<p>Of course not much work could be done out of
doors, in such weather. However, with the first warm
spell, at twenty above, Pat, the boss carpenter, hustled
his squad to complete the fence. Lustily chopping with
broad-axes they rapidly turned out pickets that
were two feet wide, four inches thick, twelve feet
long and sharpened at both ends. These were set
upright in a shallow ditch and spiked, edge against
edge, to the stringers.</p>

<p>Finally Pat swung the heavy gate to and fro on its
leathern hinges; it closed perfectly, and the bar that
fastened it dropped easily into place. That was the
last touch, and Pat heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“’Tis a good job well done, lads,” he complimented.
“An’ jest in time. To-morrow we cilibrate.”</p>

<p>“Why, Pat?” queried Peter.</p>

<p>“Sure, ain’t to-morrow Christmas?” rebuked Pat.
“That’s a new wan to ye, mebbe?” And Peter needs
must have “Christmas” explained to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>Yes, the captains had decided to celebrate. They
instructed Chaboneau to tell the Mandans that on the
morrow the white men were to have a great medicine
day, and that no Indians should come near. That
night, in the mess cabin, Patrick Gass passed another
word.</p>

<p>“It’s all o’ yez up ’arly in the mornin’, boys,” he
said. “We’ll wake the captains with thray rounds, so
they’ll know we’ve not forgot.” And he winked.</p>

<p>In his bunk Peter was roused with a jump, amidst
the grayness, by a thunderous noise. He sprawled to
the floor—he heard a voice giving sharp orders, and
before he could reach the door there was another
thunder. Had the Sioux come? No! It was Christmas,
and the celebration had begun. He opened the
door—powder smoke wafted into his nostrils, the men
had formed two lines down the middle of the street,
their rifles were leveled, and “Whang!” they all spoke
together.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” now the men cheered.</p>

<p>“Christmas Day in the mornin’!” shouted Pat,
waving his cap. The door of the captains’ cabin opened
and the captains stood gazing out; York’s black face
peering over their shoulders. “Merry Christmas to
yez, sorrs,” welcomed Pat, with a bow and a scrape.
“It’s only welcomin’ the day, we are, an’ christenin’
the flag with a bit o’ powder.” For from the flag-staff
in the street floated the United States flag.</p>

<p>“Very good,” approved Captain Lewis. “Merry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
Christmas to each of you. You may dismiss the men
for the day, Sergeant.”</p>

<p>What a jolly day this day of Christmas proved to
be. Nobody worked, everybody was merry. After
breakfast in the mess hall, which was a cabin with a
table down the centre seating twenty on a side, and a
huge fireplace at one end, and a loft for the cooks and
their supplies, the table was moved, One-eyed Cruzatte
and George Gibson tuned their fiddles, and the men
danced and capered.</p>

<p>There was a big dinner, of juicy meats, stewed
corn, stewed dried pumpkin, with plum pudding at the
close. The captains were present, in uniform. There
was more dancing, and story-telling; not until late at
night was the fort quiet. All the Indians had kept
away.</p>

<p>Thus was passed Christmas Day, 1804, at this first
United States fort west of St. Louis, 1600 miles up the
River Missouri, in the centre of a North Dakota yet
to be named.</p>

<p>“When do we have another Christmas, George?”
asked Peter, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Not for a long time, Peter,” laughed George.
“Christmas comes only once a year.”</p>

<p>For, you see, Peter had a great deal to learn.</p>

<p>Now Fort Mandan settled down to a winter routine.
The United States flag floated. The swivel cannon
from the barge had been planted in the street, its
muzzle commanding the entrance. Just outside the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
gate a sentry constantly paced, by day; another sentry
walked a beat on the top of a mound of earth that
half circled the rear of the fort and banked the store-rooms
against the cold. John Shields, the blacksmith,
established his forge—and that, also, was great medicine.
The Indians crowded about to watch the bellows
fan the charcoal into ruddy heat. Even the interpreters
were astonished, when John set to work.</p>

<p>“Ma foi!” exclaimed Toussaint Chaboneau. “I
go get my squaw’s kettle. She haf one hole in him.”</p>

<p>Away he ran, and returned with Sa-ca-ja-we-a,
bringing her kettle. A gentle little woman was the
girlish Sa-ca-ja-we-a, or Bird-woman, of the far distant
Snake nation; everybody was fond of her. John
Shields willingly took the kettle, and patched the hole
in it; and beaming with smiles the Bird-woman hastened
to put it on her fire again.</p>

<p>But the wife of Jessaume had a kettle which could
<em>not</em> be mended; and very indignant and jealous she
left the fort, with her kettle and her children, and went
across the river to her own people.</p>

<p>“Huh!” said Jessaume, shrugging his shoulders.
“She be so bad, guess I get ’nodder wife.”</p>

<p>John Shields not only mended kettles for the
women, but he mended the battle-axes and tomahawks
of the men. From scraps of sheet-iron and tin he
manufactured a marvelous variety of articles—hide-scrapers,
punches, arrow points, and occasionally a
whole battle-ax. For these, the Indians from the villages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
traded corn and beans and dried pumpkins, so
that John proved to be a valuable workman.</p>

<p>William Bratton and Alexander Willard sometimes
helped him; and as they were gun-smiths too, they
repaired the rifles of the expedition and the few fusils
of the Indians.</p>

<p>The weather blew warm, and cold again. There
were hunting excursions; and on January 1, 1805,
which, Peter learned, was called New Year’s, there
was another celebration, like that of Christmas.</p>

<p>“Ze Mandan, dey reques’ we pay visit to deir
village an’ show ze squaw an’ boys how ze white mans
dance,” informed Chaboneau, in the morning, after a
call from Big White.</p>

<p>So the captains gave permission for Cruzatte and
George Gibson to take their violins, and for York and
Patrick Gass and a dozen others to go, and entertain
the village of Big White.</p>

<p>They trapsed gaily across the river, and in the lodge
of Chief Black Cat, who lived at this village, Francois
Labiche, one of the boat-men from Cahokia, opposite
St. Louis, danced on his head to the music of the two
fiddles, and thereby greatly astonished the Indians.</p>

<p>The village rewarded the dancers with buffalo robes
and corn; and that evening Head Chief Black Cat
brought to the fort another quantity of meat packed
on his wife’s back.</p>

<p>“Let the white medicine dancers visit my other
villages, or there will be jealousy,” he urged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>“I will haf no more hair,” complained Francois
Labiche.</p>

<p>Forty below zero sank the thermometer. John
Newman froze his feet so badly that he was unable
to walk in, and a rescue party with horses were sent
to get him.</p>

<p>Captain Clark, with Chaboneau as guide, led a
hunting party down-river, with the thermometer eighteen
below. Chaboneau returned alone, to say that
Captain Clark had obtained some meat, but that the
horses could not carry it on the slippery ice.</p>

<p>“Your wife is ill, Chaboneau,” informed Captain
Lewis. And Chaboneau rushed for his lodge.</p>

<p>Forth he darted again.</p>

<p>“My wife she ver’ seeck,” he cried, wringing his
hands. “W’at s’all I do? I fear she die, ma pauvre
Sa-ca-ja-we-a (my poor Sa-ca-ja-we-a).”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to tend to her, Toussaint,” said Captain
Lewis; and got out the medicine chest.</p>

<p>But all that night, and part of the next day the
groans of the little Bird-woman could be heard.</p>

<p>“Dere is one remedy I hear of,” spoke Jessaume.
“I sorry my wife lef’. But sometime de Injun gif de
rattle of de rattlesnake.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try that, then,” bade Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>So the captain broke open the specimen bales in the
store-room and found a dried rattlesnake skin. With
Chaboneau jumping about imploringly, he crumbled two
of the rattles into water, and this the suffering Bird-woman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
drank. Everybody at the fort was interested.</p>

<p>Soon from the lodge of Chaboneau issued a new
sound—a feeble, shrill, piping wail. But the groans of
Sa-ca-ja-we-a had ceased. Out again darted Chaboneau,
his leather face beaming.</p>

<p>“One fine boy,” he shouted, capering. “It is all
right. One fine boy. I t’ink he look like me.”</p>

<p>The next day, which was February 12, the hunting
party returned, having left their meat in a pen to protect
it from the wolves.</p>

<p>“I have the honor to announce a new recruit, Captain,”
reported Captain Lewis, saluting Captain Clark,
a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>“What’s his name, Merne? Chaboneau?” demanded
Captain Clark, smiling broadly, with cold-reddened
face.</p>

<p>“He is leetle Toussaint,” proclaimed Chaboneau.
“One fine boy who look so han’some as me.”</p>

<p>“B’gorry,” uttered Sergeant Pat, “an addition to
our number, is it? Faith, he has good lungs, but I
thought it was a weasel chasin’ a rabbit.”</p>

<p>The next morning four men and three horses to
haul sleds were sent down to get the meat; but at evening
they came back empty-handed. A hundred Sioux
had robbed them. Captain Lewis set out at sunrise, to
punish the robbers. Only three or four Mandans went.
Chief Black Cat said that his young men were out hunting,
and the villages had few guns, so his people could
not help the white soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>Captain Lewis was gone six days. He did not
overtake the Sioux, but he brought up the meat—part
of it on a sled drawn by fifteen men.</p>

<p>Mr. Gravelines, the trader, arrived from the Arikara
nation. The Sioux sent word by the Arikaras that
they would hereafter kill the white soldiers whenever
they caught them.</p>

<p>But nobody at the fort minded these threats. February
slipped into March, and all thoughts were turned
upon the onward journey as soon as the river opened.</p>

<p>The thermometer rose to forty above zero. A flock
of ducks were seen, flying up stream.</p>

<p>“The first sign,” quoth Sergeant Gass.</p>

<p>The weather was “open an’ shet,” as said Pat, with
wind, sunshine, and snow flurries. But the ice in the
river began to move, a little; another sign of spring.
The captains decided that the barge was to be sent
back to St. Louis, with the specimens, and the Corporal
Warfington squad and other extra men. Under the
direction of Captain Clark and Patrick Gass, the carpenter,
boat timber was cut, and small pirogues, or
canoes, were built, to take the place of the barge. John
Shields was busy all the days long, making battle-axes
to trade for a fresh supply of corn.</p>

<p>The store-room was ransacked and the clothing and
such damp stuff was hung out to dry. Great strings
of geese and swans and ducks passed, northward bound.
The rising river burst into a channel; down it floated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
ice cakes, carrying buffalo, elk and deer. The Indians,
running out across the firmer ice, killed them with
spears. The canoes were finished and brought out of
the timber, and to the bank at the fort. All hands
were put at work loading.</p>

<p>This was an anxious time for Peter. Was he to be
sent down with the barge, or was he to be taken on,
with the captains and Pat and all?</p>

<p>“I go,” announced Chaboneau. “I engage’ as one
interpreter, for ze journey to ze Rock Mountains an’ ze
salt ocean. I take my young wife, an’ my baby, but I
leave my ol’ wife.”</p>

<p>“Do I go, Pat?” queried Peter.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I dunno,” drawled Pat, pausing to
wink at Toussaint. “An’ what would we do with a
boy, yonder up amongst the white bear an’ the two-headed
Injuns? For I hear there be giants, wearin’
two heads on their shoulders. Sure, they’d ate a boy
with only one o’ their mouths.”</p>

<p>“I hunt,” asserted Peter.</p>

<p>“Would ye kill bear an’ buff’lo with the bow an’
arrer?” teased Pat. “Ain’t we got Drouillard an’
Fields an’ the captains an’ meself, all handy with the
gun?”</p>

<p>“I show you, Pat,” exclaimed Peter.</p>

<p>Two steps he made, and grabbed his bow and quiver,
where they were lying on the gunwale of the barge.
The quiver was full of iron-pointed arrows, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
John Shields had equipped for him. Out he ran, upon
the ice of the river. His quick eye had noted a black
object floating down the channel aboard a floe. No
Indian was after it, yet. He would show that he was
as good a hunter as any Indian.</p>

<p>Buffalo? Elk? Deer? Wah! It was crouching,
and he could not yet tell. But fast he ran, in the slush,
dodging air-holes, and with the ice weaving and bending
beneath him. Suddenly, as he approached, heading
off the floe, the creature stood. It was no buffalo, or
elk, or deer; it was a bear.</p>

<p>Wah, again! Also, hooray! Voices were shouting
at him, to turn back; but, no, he would not turn
back, even for a bear. He was a hunter. He ran
faster, because he was afraid that some of the men
would come with guns.</p>

<p>He reached the edge of the channel. The bear
stiffened, lowered its head, and bristled, showing every
fang. No “white bear” was it, evidently. It was a
brown bear, but an old one, large and cross. Below, a
few yards, the channel narrowed; the floe might lodge
there, or the bear be enabled to spring from it to the
other ice. Peter must act quick. He knelt and bent his
bow—drew the arrow clear to the iron point, so that
his arm holding the bow was straight and the hand
of the other arm was against his shoulder. That was
the way to shoot. The bear was right in front of him,
balancing on the ice cake. Twang-thud! The arrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
struck true—was buried to the feathers where the bear’s
neck met shoulder.</p>

<p>Now another! Up reared the bear, roaring and
clawing, and the floe swerved in toward the channel’s
edge. Peter in his haste to pluck a second arrow,
string it and launch it, slipped and fell sideways—and
on the instant the floe had touched the channel edge,
where the channel narrowed; roaring, the bear had
sprung ashore, and roaring he was coming, the arrow
feathers dripping red and his tongue dripping red, and
crimsoned froth slathering his open jaws. The bristles
on his back were full six inches high.</p>

<p>All this Peter saw in a twinkling. He had time only
to launch his arrow. But he took good aim, there on
his knees; whang-thud!—his second arrow landed near
the first; and away he ran. From the bank at the fort
men, both white and red, were running, too; running
to help him. They waved their arms and weapons,
shouted loudly.</p>

<p>Peter changed his course. They should <em>not</em> help
him. He would show Pat, and the captains, and everybody,
what he could do. He glanced over his shoulder.
The bear was close. A bear could easily outrun a boy,
or a man, and for a short distance, a horse. Aside
leaped Peter, digging in his moccasined heels, for foothold
in the soft spots; another arrow was on the bowstring;
with scratching of claws and furious growl the
bear slid past. But Peter had turned in a flash, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
while turning had drawn his bow. Whang-thud! The
arrow sank almost out of sight in the bear’s ribs,
forward where the heart should be.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cheered the shouting men.</p>

<p>The blow had knocked the bear down. He went
sliding, in a struggling heap. Now he roared indeed,
and twisting his head bit at the arrow. Up he rose,
sighted Peter, and on he came. Peter lost a moccasin,
his foot slipped. He stood his ground, held his breath,
and took very careful, cool aim—bending his bow till
it quivered in his grasp. A moment more, and the bear
would rear, to strike him—and he loosed the taut string.
The arrow struck the bear right in the nape of the
burly neck; his head was low, bear fashion, and Peter
had taken the chance. Down sprawled the bear, as if
smitten by lightning, for the arrow point had cut his
spine. He shivered, and was still. The four feathered
ends jutted from his hide. He was a dead bear.</p>

<p>“Glory be!” panted Sergeant Pat, arriving. “An’
ye did it all by yourself! But, sure, I thought I see ye
’aten up entoirely.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Little Raven, second Mandan
chief, prodding the lax, furry carcass with his spear.
“Heap boy. Make big hunter.”</p>

<p>All together they dragged the bear, at the end of
Pat’s belt, to the barge. Peter, of course, said nothing.
But when Captain Clark clapped him roundly on the
shoulder, and Captain Lewis said, “Well done, Peter,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
he knew that he stood a good chance of being taken
up-river. The Long Knife was not much given to idle
words; but he appreciated deeds. The bear proved to
be very old, very thin, with tusks worn to stubs.
Hunger had driven him out of his winter hole early.
The hair of his hide was loose. Nevertheless he was a
large specimen.</p>

<p>“We’ll send his head to the President,” remarked
Captain Lewis to Captain Clark. “No such bear as
this can be found in Virginia or Kentucky.”</p>

<small>THE KINGDOM OF THE “WHITE BEARS”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>April was ushered in by a great thunder-storm of
rain mingled with hail. That speedily cleared the river.
The rotted ice went swirling down, and soon from bank
to bank the Missouri was free.</p>

<p>“De trail is open,” said old Cruzatte.</p>

<p>“How far to the Rock Mountains, Pat?” asked
Peter.</p>

<p>“Another thousand miles, I hear tell. An’ after
that, another thousand miles to the big ocean.”</p>

<p>“How do we get over the mountains, Pat?”</p>

<p>Pat scratched his carroty thatch, and reflectively
rubbed his stubbled chin.</p>

<p>“Faith, an’ I dunno. Trust to the commandin’
officers, I guiss. That’s the proper way for soldiers.
We’ll find a gate some’ers. There be some tremenjous
falls to get around, fust, say the Injuns.”</p>

<p>“Sa-ca-ja-we-a know,” proudly asserted Chaboneau.
“Her peoples lif dere, in ze mountains, beyond
dose falls. She speak ze Snake tongue.”</p>

<p>“I gwine to kill one ob dem white b’ars,” boasted
York.</p>

<p>All the fort was in a fever of impatience—the down-river
men to be on their way “back to the United
States,” as they expressed it; the up-river men to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
on their way into a new country never explored by
white foot. Long letters were being scrawled, for the
“folks at home,” telling them of the past year’s adventures;
Captain Lewis was busy preparing his report
to the President; Captain Clark was laboring nights,
by fire-light, putting final touches on a map of the
Missouri, based upon a ruder map sketched by Little
Raven, the Mandan, with charcoal on a buffalo hide.
Baptiste Lepage and Chaboneau helped, for they, also,
had been many days’ travel westward, trading with the
Cheyennes and the Minnetarees.</p>

<p>Only John Newman was sad at heart. Captain
Lewis had decreed that he be returned to St. Louis at
the first opportunity. The opportunity was near. John
pleaded to be permitted to go on with his comrades.
He wanted to make good. Already he had showed that
he was repentant of his brief bad conduct. Had he not
worked faithfully, and even frozen his feet?</p>

<p>Captain Clark might have yielded to him, but Captain
Lewis was sterner.</p>

<p>“No, John,” he said, again. “I must make an
example of you. I cannot run the risk of any more
mutinous talk. We have two thousand miles before us,
and the party must all work together. You will return
to St. Louis on the barge. Later, if your good conduct
continues, I will request the President to overlook
your offense and you will be granted an
honorable discharge.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied John Newman, saluting. “But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
it’s pretty tough, sir. I’d rather take another lickin’,
sir.”</p>

<p>However, in time, John did receive honorable discharge,
and was granted the 320 acres of land and the
extra pay allowed to the other men.</p>

<p>April 7 was the day for breaking camp. By five
o’clock in the afternoon the boats, loaded and manned—the
barge for down-river, the six canoes and the two
pirogues for up-river—were being held at the bank,
waiting only for the captains’ orders.</p>

<p>“Ready, barge?” called Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>John Newman gripped the last of the hands extended
to him by his former comrades, and clambered
aboard. He and five of the Corporal Warfington
privates from St. Louis were the guard. The sixth
private, Moses B. Reed, was being returned as a prisoner,
for he had attempted to desert, with his musket
and other government equipment. Corporal Warfington
was in command. Trader Gravelines was the pilot.
Two French boatmen were the crew. Chief Brave
Raven, and two other Arikaras who had accompanied
Mr. Gravelines up from the Arikara village, also were
aboard. They were going on to Washington to see
their great white father.</p>

<p>For President Jefferson were being sent Captain
Clark’s journal and map, and Captain Lewis’s report to
this very date. And many hide and wooden boxes of
specimens and trophies: two stuffed antelope, a white
weasel pelt entire, squirrels that had been brought by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
the Minnetarees clear from the Rocky Mountains, dried
prairie dogs, mountain sheep and elk and deer horns,
a painted buffalo robe picturing a battle of Mandans
and Minnetarees against Sioux and Arikaras, a beautiful
shield made and decorated by Chief Black Cat
especially for the great white father, Peter’s bear head,
a yellow bear hide and other furs, Indian shirts and
leggins and moccasins, a Mandan bow and battle-ax,
and even an ear of the red Mandan corn. And three
cages containing a live ground squirrel, a prairie hen,
and four magpies.</p>

<p>Not until ten months later did these wonders arrive
at Washington.</p>

<p>“All ready, sir,” responded Corporal Warfington,
to the captain.</p>

<p>“Give way.”</p>

<p>Out pushed the barge. Captain Lewis drew his
sword.</p>

<p>“Present! Ready! Fire!” he shouted. And every
rifle, of canoes and pirogues, cracked in a volley.</p>

<p>“For the United States,” murmured Patrick Gass.
“Arrah—but good luck to ’em.”</p>

<p>Then into the white pirogue sprang Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>“Give way,” he cried, standing beside Captain
Clark; and out were shoved the eight boats together.
Captain Lewis nodded at Gunner Willard.</p>

<p>“Boom!” spoke the swivel cannon, in farewell to
the shore.</p>

<p>Sha-ha-ka and other Indians had come over in skin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
canoes to bid the Long Knife and the Red Head goodby.
They stood, and gazed, and made no sign. They would
wait, and take care of the white fathers’ fort.</p>

<p>“We’ll be back,” declared the buoyant George
Shannon, as he bent to an oar. “Stay where you are,
old fort. We’ll be back in the fall and light your winter
fires again.” For the captains thus had figured.</p>

<p>“We locked the gates, but sure the Injuns’ll be
climbin’ over the fince before we’re out o’ sight,”
grunted Sergeant Pat.</p>

<p>The wind was almost dead ahead. With oars and
paddles the men settled to their work. Now the party
numbered thirty-three, and Peter.</p>

<p>There were the two captains—Captain Meriwether
Lewis and Captain William Clark (to each other
“Merne” and “Will”), from Virginia and Kentucky;
and Sergeants John Ordway, of New Hampshire,
Nathaniel Pryor and Patrick Gass; and Privates
William Bratton of Captain Lewis’s state (Virginia);
Alexander Willard from John Ordway’s state, and
John Shields, of Kentucky, the three smiths; Reuben
Fields and Joseph Fields, brothers, John Colter, Joseph
Whitehouse, William Werner, who like Pryor and
Shields, were from Captain Clark’s state, Kentucky;
John Collins, of Maryland; John Thompson, the surveyor,
from Indiana; Robert Frazier, of Vermont; the
handsome, merry George Shannon from Ohio and
Pennsylvania both; George Gibson, the fiddler, Hugh
McNeal, John Potts, Peter Wiser, all from the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
place as Pat and George—Pennsylvania; Silas Goodrich
and Thomas Howard and Hugh Hall, of Massachusetts;
Dick Windsor, said to hail also from Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Peter knew them all; fine men; but he liked Pat
and George Shannon the best.</p>

<p>Then, there were the Frenchmen: gay old Cruzatte,
with his one eye and his lively fiddle; Francois Labiche,
the boatman who danced on his head; Baptiste Lepage,
who joined at the Mandan villages to take the place of
one Liberté who had run away; George Drouillard, the
hunter; Chaboneau and Sa-ca-ja-we-a, the Bird-woman,
who was to help the party into the mountains and make
friends of the Snakes. And little Toussaint, the beady-eyed
baby—a great pet.</p>

<p>And York, black, enormous York, the great medicine,
whom all the Indians so highly respected.</p>

<p>Yes, this was a glorious company, from which a
boy might learn much.</p>

<p>So, in a line, the eight boats proceeded up the Missouri,
through present North Dakota. The wind blew
sometimes fair, sometimes adverse; sometimes so
strong that it lifted the fine sand in dense clouds above
the river and the men’s eyes were made sore. Captain
Lewis’s tightly-cased watch stopped and would not run.</p>

<p>At the end of the first week, when the night’s camp
was breaking up, for the day’s journey, George Shannon
espied a black animal slinking through the grass.</p>

<p>“Wolf!” uttered Pat. “An’ a black wan, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
captains’ collection. Wait till I draw a bead on him.”</p>

<p>“No! That’s a dog, Pat!” And George whistled.
“Don’t shoot.”</p>

<p>The black animal crept toward George, stomach to
earth, tail wagging.</p>

<p>“Assiniboine dog,” pronounced Chaboneau. “He
sled dog. Draw ze sled in winter, an’ ze travois—ze
lodge pole, in summer. He from dat ol’ camp we see
yesterday. Mus’ be los’, poor leetle dog.”</p>

<p>“He’s only a puppy, and nigh starved,” said George,
patting him.</p>

<p>So the black shaggy little dog was taken along.</p>

<p>That night at camp Lepage and Chaboneau consulted
together.</p>

<p>“I never been up-river furder dan dees,” announced
Baptiste. “I t’ink once I stop right at dees spot, an’
turn back. Chaboneau, he stop once ’bout t’ree mile
below.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s our own trail from here on,” spoke John
Shields.</p>

<p>Where North Dakota and Montana meet, George
Drouillard was sent out to explore south up the Yellowstone
River. He returned with report of many sand-bars
and much coal.</p>

<p>Beyond the mouth of the Yellowstone, in the morning
of October 26, while the boats were slowly sailing
on up the Missouri, Captain Lewis suddenly appeared,
at a clear spot on the bank, and signaled with a rifle-shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“Faith, the cap’n’s been in a hurry,” observed
Patrick Gass, as the boats turned in.</p>

<p>And so he evidently had. He was still out of
breath.</p>

<p>“We’ve killed a large white bear,” he panted.
“Some of you men come and help Drouillard bring
him down.”</p>

<p>“Good work, Merne,” called Captain Clark. And
enough men tumbled ashore to carry half a dozen bears.</p>

<p>Cruzatte ran, Peter ran, the Fields brothers ran;
all ran. Back a few hundred yards they found
Drouillard working with his knife on the carcass of
a bear.</p>

<p>“No! Let’s fetch him down entire, for the whole
crowd to see,” cried Reuben Fields. “He’s a sockdologer.
Look at him, Joe!”</p>

<p>“He not so ver’ beeg—but he beeg plenty,”
averred Cruzatte.</p>

<p>“Who shot him, Drouillard?”</p>

<p>“De cap’n an’ me, both,” answered Drouillard.
“Dere was two. De one we woun’, he get away.
Dis odder we woun’, an’ my gracious, he chase de
cap’n. He chase him seventy, eighty yard, but he
bad hurt, could no run quite so fas’ as de cap’n. De
cap’n load hees gun while he run, an’ shoot again—bang!
Bear no fall. I come, aim queeck—bang!
Dis time bear fall. But my gracious, he ver’ tough
to keel.”</p>

<p>They dragged the huge carcass to the shore. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
weighed 300 pounds. “Young bear,” declared
Drouillard. Everybody crowded about, to examine
its fur (which was not white at all, but was yellowish),
its long claws and tusks, its little, deep-set
black eyes.</p>

<p>“Dis chile dunno,” stammered York, his own eyes
popping. “Mebbe he ain’t gwine to look foh dis kind
ob b’ar. If he jes’ a young b’ar, what mought his
daddy be? Hoo!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you or the men take any chances with these
animals, Will,” cautioned Captain Lewis, to Captain
Clark. “There are lots of signs of them now.”</p>

<p>Captain Clark and Reuben Fields did take a chance,
a few days later. In the dusk they met a monster
brown bear (which was a better name for it than white
bear, although grizzly bear is better still) not far from
the evening camp. When they shot together, he roared
so loudly that the very air shook, but fortunately he
tried to escape. They followed him and shot him eight
times more; and even then he swam clear into the
middle of the river, and died on a sand-bar.</p>

<p>It was quite a job to get him into camp. He
weighed about 600 pounds. The captains measured
him. From his hind feet to his nose was eight feet,
seven and a half inches; he was five feet, seven and a
half inches around the chest, three feet, eleven inches
around the neck, and one foot, eleven inches around
the fore-legs! His heart was as large as an ox-heart,
and his claws four and one-half inches in length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>But William Bratton “caught” the worst bear, to
date. About five o’clock the boats were just being
landed, for night camp, when a great crashing and
shouting were heard; out from the brush burst William,
and bolted, staggering and gesturing, for the nearest
boat. He had lost his hat, his buckskin suit was torn,
he could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>“Another man in a hurry,” quoth Patrick Gass, as
everybody reached for a gun. “Injuns, mebbe?”</p>

<p>“He-he-help!” panted William, lunging into the
shallows and fairly falling across the gunwale of the
white pirogue.</p>

<p>“Speak, man! What’s the matter?” demanded
Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>William heaved and gasped.</p>

<p>“Bear! White bear! Chasing me—close behind.”
Puff. Puff. “Shot him—chased me—mile and a half—almost
caught me. Look out!”</p>

<p>“Whereabouts? Which direction?”</p>

<p>“Down river—back in brush, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hah!” exclaimed the captain. “I’ll go after
him. Drouillard, the two Fields, Willard, Potts,
Shields, Pryor, come with me. Bratton’s found another
bear. Want to go, York?”</p>

<p>“Nossuh, nossuh!” asserted York, with decisive
emphasis. “I’d like to go mighty well, Marse Merne,
but I got to stay right hyah an’ take keer ob Marse
Will.”</p>

<p>Away hastened Captain Lewis and the seven men.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
All eyes scanned the shore, and many tongues plied the
exhausted hunter with questions. He said that after
shooting the bear he had run a mile and a half, with
the bear roaring and floundering behind him, but unable
quite to overtake him because of its wound.</p>

<p>In about an hour back came the hunting party, into
camp—Alec Willard and John Shields, who were the
two largest members, weighted down with an enormous
hide and a great quantity of fat.</p>

<p>They all said that after following Bratton’s trail
back, for a mile, they had come upon the bloody trail
of the bear. He had turned aside and had gone another
mile, until he had stopped, to dig a hole or bed two feet
deep and five feet long. There they had killed him.</p>

<p>“An’ he ought to’ve been dead long before,” declared
John Shields. “Bratton had shot him straight
through the chest. He was a tough one.”</p>

<p>“Faith, as the cap’n says, it’s safer to fight two
Injuns together than wan white b’ar by hisself,” proclaimed
Pat.</p>

<p>The fat of this bear yielded eight gallons of oil,
for greasing the guns and keeping the men’s hair slick.</p>

<p>On the third day after, six of the men had a pitched
battle with another bear. He put them all to flight—almost
caught several of them; and did not fall until
he had been shot eight times. And while this was
going on at the shore, Cruzatte’s canoe, out in the
stream, narrowly escaped a fatal upset.</p>

<p>A gust of wind struck the sail, while Chaboneau<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
was steering. Chaboneau lost his head, dropped the
oar, began to cry aloud with fright. The canoe tilted,
tilted, water flowed in—and over on its side turned the
boat. The sail’s rope had been jerked out of Cruzatte’s
hand.</p>

<p>“Seize de rudder, Toussaint! Ketch de rope—queeck!
Pull on de sail! We all drown! Do de right
t’ing or I shoot you!” ordered Cruzatte, scrambling
along the gunwale.</p>

<p>Only young Sa-ca-ja-we-a was calm. Holding her
baby, she reached right and left and gathered the
articles that were floating off. In a moment more the
canoe righted, but was full of water. Baling and rowing,
the men got her beached just in time.</p>

<p>“Dat stupid Chaboneau! Hees wife is better man
dan heem,” scolded Drouillard. “He near los’ all de
fine instruments an’ de papers of the captains. Mebbe
drown ever’body, too.”</p>

<p>As it was, a great deal of medicine had been spoiled
by the soaking.</p>

<p>The six victors over the one bear brought him in
at last. Because of the battle, this place was known as
Brown-bear-defeated Creek.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XI">XI<br />
<small>WHICH WAY TO THE COLUMBIA?</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Wirrah, but tired I am!” groaned Patrick Gass.</p>

<p>It was June 3, and in the nineteen days they had
come more than 300 miles from Brown-bear-defeated
Creek. What with the constant wading and tugging
to conquer the narrow, swift current and the strong
head winds, well might all groan.</p>

<p>Night alarms had disturbed the camps. Once the
men had been aroused only just in time to drag the
captains’ hide lodge away from a spot upon which a
burning tree was about to fall; and, again, a stupid
buffalo bull had charged through, and only the little
black dog had saved the camp from much damage.</p>

<p>But the Rock or Shining Mountains were nearer.
On Sunday a week ago Captain Lewis, climbing a hill,
had seen them, to the west. The Sho-sho-nes or Snake
Indians might be expected any day. Their country
was near, also.</p>

<p>Now the river had split: one branch for the north,
one for the southward; and the captains did not know
which branch to follow. So they ordered camp here
at the forks, below present Fort Benton in north central
Montana.</p>

<p>A travel-worn camp it was, too—of bearded, long-haired
men, their buckskin and elk-hide suits shriveled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
by water, their moccasins in tatters, their hands blistered
and their feet sore from rocks and the prickly-pear
cactus.</p>

<p>“De nort’ branch—she de true Missouri,” asserted
old Cruzatte. “See how swift an’ muddy she is, jus’
like de Missouri. Ain’ dat so, Drouillard?”</p>

<p>Drouillard nodded.</p>

<p>“I sartin she true Missouri. I lif on Missouri most
my life, an’ I know. De odder stream too clear an’
smooth.”</p>

<p>“For that very r’ason it comes out o’ the Rock
Mountains, ’cordin’ to the cap’ns,” put in Pat. “An’
the bed of it be round stones, the same as are fetched
down out o’ the mountains. Not but what I favor the
north branch myself, as the more likely direction. We’ll
find the Columby across to the north, an’ not to the
south, I’m thinkin’.”</p>

<p>“The Minnetarees down at the Mandan town told
us the Missouri was clear, at its head, didn’t they?”
queried George Shannon. “And there are some big
falls to pass.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe de nort’ branch get clear, in leetle time,”
argued Drouillard. “She de true Missouri, for de
Columby.”</p>

<p>“Oui. So t’ink we all,” agreed Cruzatte and
Chaboneau and Lepage and Labiche. “De odder
branch go too far sout’.”</p>

<p>This was the opinion of the majority of the men.
But——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>“We’ve got to be might careful,” argued George.
“The Missouri and the Columbia are supposed to head
right near each other, the one on this side the mountains,
the other on ’tother side. It would be a bad
mess if we crossed and found we were in the wrong
place. We haven’t any time to lose.”</p>

<p>Evidently so thought the captains. For the next
day Captain Lewis took Drouillard, Sergeant Nat
Pryor and several others, to explore by foot up the
north fork. Captain Clark took Chaboneau, Sergeant
Pat and several others, to explore up the south fork.
Peter and the rest of the men remained at camp, together
with Sa-ca-ja-we-a and little Toussaint.</p>

<p>This gave them the opportunity to sit in their bare
feet, mend their moccasins and leggins, and pick green
wild currants and ripe wild gooseberries. Sa-ca-ja-we-a,
who was always busy, dressed a doe-skin for
herself and little Toussaint.</p>

<p>The Captain Clark party returned on the third day,
in the rain. They had gone up along the south branch
about forty miles—had walked about 100 miles, all
told, said Pat, with a wry face and a limp; Reuben had
been chased so shrewdly by a big bear, after his gun
had missed fire, that in climbing a tree he kicked the
bear’s mouth, and as nobody could get to the tree the
bear had kept Reuben there for an hour; rain and snow
both had made the trip uncomfortable—but the river
appeared to lead west of south, and the captain was
convinced that it was the true Missouri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>“He’s the commandin’ officer; still I don’t agree
with him,” said Pat. “An’ I hope he’s wrong, for the
other river’s the ’asier. I’d rather sail in a boat than
on foot, any day.”</p>

<p>“Did you sight any falls, Pat?” asked Joe Fields.</p>

<p>“Niver a fall—but I felt some,” answered Pat.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis was yet out. He and his party did
not return this evening, nor the next day; and on the
following day everybody was worried about them. But
that afternoon at five o’clock they came toiling in,
hungry, soaked with the cold rain, and weary after a
five days’ tramp of 120 miles.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you, Merne,” exclaimed Captain
Clark, his face lighting up amidst his thick red hair and
shaggy red beard. “What’s the news?”</p>

<p>“We’ve been along the north fork sixty miles and
it doesn’t head toward any mountains. I don’t believe
it’s the Missouri, although Drouillard insists it must
be.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so, either, Merne. The south fork
looks the better of the two, to me.” And they paced
together to their lodge.</p>

<p>It was a cheery crowd, in spite of the dangers and
discomforts and the hard work. That evening the sky
had cleared, there was a big supper of venison, the feet
of the men who had stayed in camp were about well,
and Cruzatte tuned up his fiddle for a dance.</p>

<p>Toward noon of the next day, Sunday, June 9, a
parade was ordered, to hear what the captains had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
decided. The men left their tasks of dressing skins
and repairing weapons, and fell in, under their
sergeants.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis stood straight and slim before them,
in his fringed but stained buckskin suit. His bright
hair was tied in a queue behind, and he, like Captain
Clark, had grown a beard—yellow as his hair.</p>

<p>“Captain Clark and I have consulted together,
men,” he said. “We have examined our maps, and
compared our notes; and we believe that the southern
fork is the true Missouri. It has all the signs of a
mountain stream, the Indians never have mentioned
passing any south fork in order to proceed on to the
great falls, and this south fork certainly bears off for
those snowy mountains to the southwest which are undoubtedly
the Rock Mountains that divide the waters
of the Missouri and the Columbia. Accordingly we
will take the south fork. That we have chosen as the
Missouri; the north fork I have had the honor to entitle
Maria’s River, as a tribute to my cousin in Virginia,
Miss Maria Wood, of Charlottesville.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish to hear from any of the men, Captain?”
inquired Captain Clark. “Some of them may
have an opinion to offer.”</p>

<p>“Well, they favor the north fork, I understand,”
answered the captain, with a smile. “I’ll be glad to
hear what they may say.”</p>

<p>Who was to speak? Patrick Gass, of course. Pat
coughed, and saluted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>“What is it, Sergeant? Go ahead. Speak up, man.”</p>

<p>“It’s this way, sorr—Captain, sorr. Yez are the
commandin’ officers—ye an’ Cap’n Clark, an’ if yez
say the south fork be the Missouri, o’ course the Missouri
it is, an’ we’ll all follow yez, sorr. Sure, all we’re
afraid of, sorr, is that we get down yonder at the foot
o’ the snowy mountains, an’ on the other side there
won’t be anny C’lumby at all, sorr. But we’ll go with
yez, sorr, if that’s where yez go. Thank yez, sorr.”
And Patrick saluted again, quite out of breath.</p>

<p>“Captain Clark and I will take the responsibility.
We’ll try the south fork, men,” declared Captain Lewis.
“Parade is dismissed.”</p>

<p>“Thray cheers for the captains, boys,” shouted
Patrick Gass. And as the parade broke, into the air
was flung every cap and hat and every voice rang true.</p>

<p>Immediately preparations were begun. The heavy
baggage and the extra supplies were to be left here,
and so was one of the pirogues. Men were set at work
digging a large hole in which to store the goods. It
was to be kettle shaped—small at the top, then hollowed
out, round, until it was six or seven feet deep.
The soil was dumped upon blankets and robes, and
thrown into the river, so that there should be no trace of
any digging, lest the Indians find and rob. The bottom
and sides were to be lined with dry brush and hides,
to keep the moisture from the goods. The storehouse
was called a <em>cache</em>, from the French word,
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cacher</i>,” to conceal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>The red pirogue was to be hidden on an island at
the mouth of Maria’s River.</p>

<p>John Shields, the blacksmith, and Alec Willard
worked at bellows and forge, repairing tools and spontoons;
and William Bratton repaired broken guns.</p>

<p>However, the captains were still cautious regarding
the right route to strike the Columbia on the other side
of the mountains; and early the next morning, June 11,
Captain Lewis took Drouillard, John Shields, George
Gibson and Si Goodrich, to scout ahead up that south
fork. He promised to send back word to Captain
Clark, who was to follow, with the boats and party,
as soon as the cache was completed.</p>

<p>On the morning of the twelfth the white pirogue
and the six canoes headed up the south fork, before a
fair wind.</p>

<p>“We’re off,” exulted Sergeant Pat.</p>

<p>Everybody was in high spirits—everybody except
Chaboneau and Sa-ca-ja-we-a.</p>

<p>“Sa-ca-ja-we-a she seeck,” announced Chaboneau.
“I do not know what is matter. Mebbe stomick, or
mebbe she ketch col’ in all dat rain.”</p>

<p>Yes, the little sixteen-year-old Bird-woman was
feeling very ill. Now for almost a thousand miles she
had carried baby Toussaint, had tended the lodge fire
and done other Indian woman work; sometimes she
had been wet, frequently cold and foot-sore, but she
never had complained or lagged.</p>

<p>“You must let her rest, Chaboneau,” said Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
Clark, that evening at camp. “Keep her in bed. York,
you look after her. Never mind me. Make her some
broth. Peter, you help her with little Toussaint. Hold
him, if she’ll let you.”</p>

<p>So Peter took charge of baby Toussaint—who
really was a very good baby. He rarely cried, and even
rarely smiled. He lay in his swathings of skins and
stared with his bright black eyes.</p>

<p>The day had been an easy one for nobody. The
river soon had run swiftly; it was broken with many
sand-bars and gravel-bars, and by boulders upon which
several times the canoes almost capsized.</p>

<p>The next day’s voyage was as bad, and worse.
Snow mountains appeared on the south as well as at
the west. There were numerous islands, more shoals
and boulders, and the tow-lines were used. Sa-ca-ja-we-a,
lying on a couch of skins in the white pirogue,
had not improved. She moaned, and tossed, and
babbled strange words. Peter and York watched over
her and the baby, although occasionally York had to
tumble out and haul on the tow-line.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” muttered Captain Clark, that night,
gazing, non-plussed, at Sa-ca-ja-we-a, who did not
recognize him. “We mustn’t lose our little Bird-woman.
She’s to be our guide to her own people, so
that they will show us the way across the mountains. In
fact, the fate of the expedition may depend upon her.”</p>

<p>“I ver’ worried,” confessed Chaboneau. “Never
see her dees way before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>The next day the rapids were more severe. Wading
breast-deep in the cold water and slipping on the rocky
bottom, the men scarcely could haul the boats against
the current. All the morning was consumed in making
six miles. Just at noon, when halt was ordered, for
dinner, a figure was seen, ahead, hurrying down along
the banks.</p>

<p>It was John Shields, from Captain Lewis. As he
approached, he swung his hat.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, boys!” he shouted. “We’re all right.
This is the trail. The captain’s found the falls!” He
came panting and puffing into camp. “It’s the true
Missouri.”</p>

<p>“How far up are the falls, Shields?” asked Captain
Clark, eagerly.</p>

<p>“About twenty miles, sir. But you can’t get to them
with boats.”</p>

<p>And that was so. The next day the rapids of the
river were more furious, and the men were constantly
dodging rattlesnakes on the banks. Shields was sent
ahead to tell Captain Lewis that the party were on their
way. Captain Clark ordered a noon halt near a large
spring of sulphur water, to wait for Captain Lewis.
The roaring of the falls had already been heard above
the noise of the river.</p>

<p>Sa-ca-ja-we-a was carried to the sulphur spring.
She drank quantities of it and soon felt much better.</p>

<p>“Now be very careful what she eats, Chaboneau,”
warned Captain Clark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>At two o’clock Captain Lewis arrived from above.
He was enthusiastic over the falls, but he had had several
narrow escapes from death, according to
Drouillard.</p>

<p>He had been seriously ill, and only choke-cherry tea
had cured him. When he had neglected to reload his
rifle after shooting a buffalo, a huge “white bear”
had charged him, driven him into the river, but had
retreated before the captain’s leveled pike or spontoon.
That same day three buffalo bulls at once had run at
him, heads down, until he fortunately had turned on
them, whereat they also turned. And that night he
slept with a rattlesnake over four feet long coiled on a
log just above his head.</p>

<p>“I t’ink de cap’n haf plenty excitement, in one day,”
declared Drouillard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XII">XII<br />
<small>SEEKING THE BIRD-WOMAN’S PEOPLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There was a series of five falls, said Captain Lewis,
connected by cataracts; and in the top of a tall cottonwood
tree on an island at the foot of the uppermost
fall an eagle had built her nest. The lowest fall was
only five miles above the camp; but the boats would
have to be carried around all the falls.</p>

<p>Captain Clark took some of the men, to explore
across country, from the camp to the head of the falls,
and stake the best route for the portage or carry.</p>

<p>A big cottonwood tree near camp was cut down.
Its trunk was twenty-two inches through, and cross-sections
were sawed off, to supply wheels for wagons on
which the boats should be loaded. The mast of the
white pirogue was brought ashore, for wagon axles.
The white pirogue was hidden in some willows, and
a hole was started, as another cache where more goods
were to be left.</p>

<p>The men were told to double-sole their moccasins,
because the prickly-pear cactus grew thickly all along
the line of march. And hunters were sent out, to get
meat and skins.</p>

<p>The captain had fixed upon a spot above the upper
fall, opposite several islands, for the end of the portage.
It was eighteen miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>“I dunno,” commented black York, shaking his
woolly head dubiously. “A monster white b’ar done
hab dat place already.”</p>

<p>For York had been chased clear into camp by a
bear; and when the captain had taken three men and
gone out to find the bear it had driven another of the
hunters, John Collins, into the river.</p>

<p>“Nice quiet place to camp,” spoke Dick Windsor.</p>

<p>A quantity of the baggage and one canoe were
loaded upon one of the little wagons, and led by the
two captains, the men ranged themselves before and
behind, to haul and push. Away they went, with the
wagon jolting and creaking, and threatening to fall
apart.</p>

<p>Chaboneau and York and Peter had been left here
at Portage Creek to care for Sa-ca-ja-we-a again. The
Bird-woman had improved so much that she was able
to walk about—but thereupon she had eaten a lot of
dried fish and little ground apples (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pomme blanc</i>: white
apple, Chaboneau called it), which had made her ill
once more and also had made the captains very angry
at Chaboneau and at Peter too. The Bird-woman was
hard to control; she thought she ought to eat, to get
well.</p>

<p>In the morning Captain Clark came back down with
all the men except Sergeant Pat, Joe Fields and John
Shields, after another load. The wagon had broken on
the trip up, and they had had to carry the baggage half
a mile on their backs. They were very tired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>“Dat cactus so bad it steeck my moccasin to my
feets,” complained Cruzatte.</p>

<p>There was quite a bit of news, time to time, from
the White-bear Islands camp, where Patrick Gass and
a few other men under Captain Lewis stayed to cover
the frame of an iron canoe with skins. The bears
were bad. Joe Fields had met three at once and had
been chased into the river; had fallen, cut his hand and
knee on the rocks and bent his gun. Drouillard and
Reuben Fields had climbed a tree, and from it Drouillard
had killed a bear with one shot through the head.
The bear’s nose was as large as an ox’s, his front foot
measured nine inches wide, his hind foot measured
nearly twelve inches long, not counting the claws.
That same night another bear entered the camp and
carried away some of the buffalo meat. The little
black dog was kept busy all the nights, growling
and barking.</p>

<p>“Dose islands full of bear,” said old Cruzatte. “I
never know bear so mean. Mebbe if we don’ go in
dere an’ clean dem out, dey eat some of us. I sleep on
my gun de whole night.”</p>

<p>“One good thing: that pesky swivel’s been cached
at the foot of the first falls,” quoth Robert Frazier.
“We don’t have to lug a cannon around any more.”</p>

<p>By the last of June all the stuff had been moved
from Portage Creek. But there had been a rain, making
the trail soft; so part of the final two wagon-loads
was dumped about four miles on the way, and camp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
was made, with the rest, at Willow Run Creek, two
miles further along, inland from the Great Falls.</p>

<p>In the morning everybody except Captain Clark,
York, Peter, and the Chaboneau family went back, with
one of the two carts, to bring on the baggage that had
been left behind on the plain.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t Sa-ca-ja-we-a like to see the Great
Falls?” asked the captain, kindly.</p>

<p>The little Bird-woman grinned at the Red Head’s
notice of her. He was, to her, a big chief. Of course
she would like to see the wonders of this medicine
river that roared.</p>

<p>“I t’ink I like to see, myself,” ventured Chaboneau.
“I been so busy I see notting yet.”</p>

<p>And that was so, not only with Chaboneau, but
with others of the men; for the Portage Creek end of
the trail was below the falls and the White-bear Islands
end was above the falls, and the trail itself cut across
several miles from the river.</p>

<p>“We’ll go over, while the baggage is being brought
up,” said the captain. “York, you come if you want
to.” He surveyed Peter—anxious Peter. “Peter, I’ll
have to detail you to guard the baggage here. You
must be a soldier. I’ll lend you my pistol. You won’t
need to use it. But keep the stuff spread out
to dry. We’ll be back soon. It’s only three or
four miles.”</p>

<p>Away they hastened, the Bird-woman carrying
small Toussaint in a net on her back. Watching them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
go, Peter gulped. Was he never to see the roaring
falls? Still, he felt proud to be left on guard, like any
soldier.</p>

<p>How hot and sultry was the morning! All the
landscape of rock and prickly pear and low stiff brush
lay smothering, and no sound was to be heard save the
dull booming of the river, unseen in the north.
Peter sat down, in the shade of the baggage on
the wagon.</p>

<p>Presently a black cloud welled over the crests of
the shining snow mountains in the west. More rain?
Peter watched it vigilantly. It grew swiftly, and rolled
into mid-sky. Peter rose with haste and covered the
baggage with buffalo hides again. It was a fearful
looking cloud, as it bellied and muttered, and let fall
a dense veil.</p>

<p>On swept the veil, hanging from the cloud; under
the wagon crept Peter. A moment more—and whish!
crackle! r-r-r-r-r-r! Wind! Rain! Hail! The air turned
black! Such wind! Such rain! But such hail!!</p>

<p>Listen to the shouts! See! The party sent for the
baggage were legging to camp! They had left, trudging
gaily, laughing and gamboling and stripped to the
waist, because of the heat and the work ahead. And
here they were, a confused crowd, heads down, naked
shoulders high, beating through the storm for shelter
while the fierce hail lashed their skins.</p>

<p>It was rather funny—and it was serious, too. The
hail pelted like grape-shot; some of the hailstones were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
as large as Peter’s fist. Ah! One-eyed Cruzatte was
down. He could not see very well, anyway, and the
hail had knocked him flat and sprawling. Down
were George Gibson and John Potts, and Nat
Pryor—only, all, to stagger to their feet and lurch
onward again.</p>

<p>In charged the crowd, blinded and bleeding, to dive
frenziedly underneath the wagon, or to grab right and
left for shirts and robes, and crouch, gasping but
covered.</p>

<p>“I t’ought I was knock’ dead,” panted old Cruzatte.</p>

<p>“Feel as though I’d had a lickin’,” panted William
Werner.</p>

<p>The hail was followed by a furious deluge of rain.
The sky cleared—and here came the captain and squad.
What a sight they were, not only drenched, but muddy
from head to feet. They had been caught in a ravine,
near the Great Falls, where they had sought the protection
of shelf-rock. But in a twinkling the ravine
had filled with water—a rushing mass carrying stones
and drift-wood. They tried to climb. The water rose
almost as fast as they climbed. The captain and Chaboneau
helped the Bird-woman. She lost her net, but
saved little Toussaint. The captain lost his compass
and an umbrella that he had carried; Chaboneau lost
his gun and bullet-pouch and tomahawk. York was
up on the plain hunting buffalo, and although badly
bruised, fared the best of anybody, except Peter. So,
after all, Peter was satisfied that he had not been along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>Willow Run had risen six feet, and now was impassable.
Because of that, and the mud, two more
days were required, to take all the baggage into the
White-bear Islands camp.</p>

<p>That evening, July 2, the captains ordered an attack
on the largest island, ruled by a king of the white bears.</p>

<p>“Sure, they’re so sassy we got to tache ’em a lesson,”
quoth Pat.</p>

<p>But although the island was thoroughly searched,
by all hands, including Peter, only one bear fell.
Drouillard shot him through the heart as he was charging,
and he died without doing any damage.</p>

<p>“Have ye seen the falls, boy?” queried Pat, of
Peter, the next morning. Peter shook his head. “Well,
nayther have I,” continued Pat. “I’ve been workin’
too hard—an’ so’ve ye. But with the permission of
the commandin’ officers we’ll jest take a day off, b’gorry,
an’ make a tour of inspection. We’ll lave the
other lads to finish the iron boat.”</p>

<p>And inspect the falls they did, from end to end. It
was a marvelous spectacle—ten miles of rush and roar
and spray and foam. The eagle was on her nest in the
top of the lone cottonwood on the island. The Indians
at the Mandan and Minnetaree villages had said there
would be an eagle.</p>

<p>“An’ ten thousand buff’lo!” exclaimed Sergeant
Pat, surveying from the brink of one of the falls. “Ten
thousand grazin’, an’ another thousand drowned in
the rapids. Sure, they’re bein’ carried down like chips.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>To the south and west and north were the mountains,
those to the northward snowy, those to the southward
more bare.</p>

<p>“An’ those are the wans we have to cross, I reckon,”
sighed Patrick.</p>

<p>But the iron boat did not prove a success. After
days of labor at dressing skins, both elk and buffalo,
and stretching them over the frame, and cementing the
seams with a mixture of beeswax, buffalo tallow and
pounded charcoal, she leaked so that she had to be taken
apart again and buried.</p>

<p>So Captain Clark, with most of the men, went out
in search of trees from which canoes might be hollowed;
and it was the middle of July before the expedition was
fairly on its way again.</p>

<p>“Faith, we’ll be lucky if we reach the Paycific before
winter,” remarked Sergeant Pat.</p>

<p>The river led southwest, toward the mountains. It
grew swifter and shallower, and was frequently broken
by islands. There were days of arduous wading,
hauling, struggling, sometimes in rain and hail, and
again in the hot sun with the thermometer at eighty
and above.</p>

<p>The mosquitoes and flies bothered. The shores grew
rougher, and higher, until at one spot the river boiled
down, 150 paces wide, through a gap in solid
cliffs 1200 feet high, black granite below, creamy yellow
above. The channel was too deep for wading,
or for the poles; and the boats were rowed, a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
inches at a time, with the oars. This gap was named
the Gate of the Mountains.</p>

<p>“I told you we’d find a gate,” reminded Pat, to
Peter. “Now what’s inside, an’ where be the Snakes?”</p>

<p>For this was the Sho-sho-ne country, at last. The
Sho-sho-nes were horse Indians. The captains counted
on getting horses from them, and leaving the canoes.
The firing of guns was limited, lest the Snakes should
hear and be alarmed. Indian trails and abandoned
camps were passed. The snowy range of the Shining
Mountains was nearer, in the west. Captain Clark
took Chaboneau and Joe Fields and York and John
Potts, and set out ahead, by land, to find some Indians,
if possible.</p>

<p>Sa-ca-ja-we-a began to remark familiar places,
where she and other Sho-sho-ne women had been, before
she was captured by the Minnetarees. Now little
flags were hoisted on the canoes, to tell the Sho-sho-nes
that the United States soldiers were coming in peace.</p>

<p>“Soon de river make t’ree forks, Sa-ca-ja-we-a
say,” informed old Cruzatte, at the evening camp after
Captain Clark had been gone almost nine days.</p>

<p>“An’ which is the trail then, I wonder,” mused
Sergeant Pat. “Sure we ought to be crossin’ the
mountains before we get much furder south. It’s
near August, already.”</p>

<p>At breakfast time the next morning, July 27, the
crew hauling the leading boat against the stiff current
suddenly cheered, frightened the big-horn sheep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
that had been following along the tops of the cliffs
and peeping over curiously, watching the strange white
men.</p>

<p>“De Sho-sho-nes!” gasped Lepage, who was on the
line of the second boat, wherein Peter sat, fending
with an oar. This was Peter’s job, when the current
was very swift.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cheered the men all.</p>

<p>Everybody expected to see Captain Clark waiting
with some of the Snakes. But the first crew had not
cheered because of any Indians. They had cheered
because the cliffs ceased, and now there extended a
broadly-rolling green meadow-land rimmed about
with high mountain ranges white and gray. The
mountains closed in behind, on the east and north and
west; and the meadow lay before, on the east and
south and west. All lovely it looked in the sunrise.</p>

<p>First, a river came in on the left, from the southeast.
While breakfast was being cooked Captain
Lewis, climbing a rocky outcrop on the bank of this
river, saw, beyond, two other forks—a middle fork and
a southwest fork, where the Missouri again split.</p>

<p>“The Three Forks, Sa-ca-ja-we-a?” he inquired.</p>

<p>The Bird-woman nodded, smiling.</p>

<p>“We’ll breakfast and go on to those upper forks,
men,” informed the captain. “We may find word
there from Captain Clark, as to which is the better.
Sa-ca-ja-we-a doesn’t know.”</p>

<p>So they proceeded. But deserted lay the meadow-land.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
However, at the juncture of those forks was
found a note, stuck in a cleft pole planted on the bank.
Captain Clark said that the southwest fork was the
better.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis ordered camp made a short distance
up this fork, until Captain Clark should return. Right
glad were all, including Peter, to rest awhile; eat, sleep,
mend the tow-ropes and repair moccasins, and kill
meat.</p>

<p>The Bird-woman was especially delighted.</p>

<p>“She say here on dis spot is where de Snake camp
was surprise’ by de Minnetaree, five year ago, an’
chase’ into de timber. De Minnetaree keel four warrior,
an’ capture four boys an’ all de women,” explained
Drouillard. “Sa-ca-ja-we-a was capture’,
too.”</p>

<p>That noon Captain Clark returned, with Chaboneau,
Joe Fields, John Potts and York. They had not seen
a single Indian; but they had had a hard tramp. Chaboneau’s
feet had given out several times, and the
captain was sick. He thought that he had drunk too
much cold water while he was hot.</p>

<p>The first fork was named Gallatin’s River, in honor
of the secretary of the treasury of the United States.
The middle fork was named Madison River, in honor
of James Madison, the secretary of state, at Washington.
But the southwest fork was named the Jefferson,
in honor of the President himself.</p>

<p>The two captains agreed that the Jefferson River<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
was the main fork of the Missouri; and up the Jefferson
they all went.</p>

<p>“Arrah!” groaned Pat. “An’ how d’ye like it,
Peter? Bad cess to that Bird-woman. Didn’t she say
we’d meet her people, an’ where be they?”</p>

<p>“Those Snakes are a wandering tribe, Pat,” answered
Sergeant Pryor. “And Sa-ca-ja-we-a hasn’t
been here since she was a girl, five years ago,
remember.”</p>

<p>But Sa-ca-ja-we-a was remembering. This was her
home country. She pointed out a high shoulder of
rock not far from the river, to the west, and exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Dat she say is w’at ze Snakes call ze Beaver’s
Head,” explained Chaboneau. “Ze Snakes spen’ deir
summer ’cross ze mountains jes’ ze odder side, an’ she
t’ink some sure to be on dis side, too. She t’ink we
meet some of dem on dees river, furder up a leetle
way.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow I’m going in yonder and not come
back till I find the Snakes and their horses, Will,”
declared Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast Captain Lewis resolutely
slung his knapsack on his back, donned his cocked
hat, and with Drouillard, John Shields and Hugh
McNeal, struck into the west.</p>

<p>“Keep traveling up river, Will,” he directed, as
last word. “I’ll stay out this time till I find Indians
and horses. You won’t see me again, before.”</p>

<p>This was August 9. For a week the canoes were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
hauled and pushed on up the crooked, rapid Jefferson,
with never a word from the search party.</p>

<p>“We’ll all be turnin’ into fishes,” groaned Pat.
“Me toes are webbed like a beaver’s, already. Sure,
it’s an awful empty country; an’ we’re thray thousand
miles from home.”</p>

<p>On August 16 they approached where the river
forked once more. It was always forking, decided
Peter. Before, not many miles, was a gap in the mountain
range. The river seemed to lead for the gap.
Were they going to follow it in? And then where
would they be? The trees were ceasing. There were
only three in sight. What would the camps do for
wood? Ahead were brush and rocks; and this night
the camp fires were made from willow branches.
Whew, but the water was cold—the source of the river
evidently was near, in the melting snow.</p>

<p>The river doubled in a great curve, before it reached
the forks. Captain Clark had sent Reuben Fields and
George Shannon ahead, to the forks, but they reported
no news. In the morning he set out, with Chaboneau
and Sa-ca-ja-we-a, to walk across the bend, while the
boats were hauled around by way of the river.</p>

<p>As all were hauling and puffing, somebody cried
aloud. It was Sergeant Ordway, on the foremost rope.</p>

<p>“Look, lads!” he bade. “The captain’s sighted
something!”</p>

<p>“Look at Sa-ca-ja-we-a! Has she gone crazy?”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cheered Patrick Gass. “Tis the Injuns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
they’re meetin’. I see some on horseback. Hooray!
Heave, lads, on the lines.”</p>

<p>For Sa-ca-ja-we-a had run ahead of the captain—she
was dancing—back she ran to him, and danced
about him, her fingers in her mouth. Little Toussaint
bobbed in his net.</p>

<p>“She suck her finger,” proclaimed old Cruzatte.
“Dat mean she see her own peoples! Now she point.
Dere dey come, on de hoss. Hooray!”</p>

<p>“Chaboneau swings his cap! The captain makes
the peace sign!”</p>

<p>“Frinds, lads!” croaked Pat. “Heave, now; heave
on the lines, or they’ll get away from yez!”</p>

<p>How the men tugged, even Peter laying his weight
sturdily to the rope. Yonder, ahead to the left, inside
the curve (and a long, vexatious curve it was), half a
dozen Indians were galloping for the captain’s squad.
They met Sa-ca-ja-we-a first, then Chaboneau, then the
captain; all mingled together. The Indians were singing
and prancing, and taking the captain up toward
the forks. One jumped to earth and made the captain
sit the horse. Hooray!</p>

<p>“There’s a village beyant,” gasped Patrick.
“Heave, lads, or else we’re dreamin.”</p>

<p>“I see Drouillard dere, with dose Injuns,” asserted
Labiche, whose eyes were keen. “He dress jes’ like
Injun. I guess he trade clothes.”</p>

<p>“Heave, lads!”</p>

<p>The Indian camp grew plainer, as the boats rounded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
the curve. More Indians were flocking out, afoot and
ahorse. Sa-ca-ja-we-a and another woman had rushed
together; they were hugging each other. But before
the canoes could arrive at the bank, the captain and
Chaboneau and Sa-ca-ja-we-a had disappeared into a
large willow lodge and most of the Indians had flowed
in after.</p>

<p>Hugh McNeal met the boats, at the landing, and he
had a long story to tell.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIII">XIII<br />
<small>HORSES AT LAST</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Are they Snakes, Hugh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. But we put in the dag-gonedest
time you ever saw, catchin’ ’em,” responded Hugh.
“First we had ’em, then we didn’t, next they had us!”</p>

<p>“What’s that around your neck? Where’s your
hat?”</p>

<p>“Faith, ye look like a Borneo ape,” added Pat.</p>

<p>Hugh almost blushed through his coat of tan and
whiskers. He was bare-headed, and about his neck was
a curious object like a tippet or boa. In fact, it was very
similar to the fur boas worn by women of to-day. One
end was a nose and eyes, the other end was a tail; and
all along the edge dangled small rolls of white fur
sewed to a white band and hanging eighteen inches
long—forming a kind of tassel cloak. The collar itself
was brown otter, the border and tassels were ermine.
But it was an odd-looking rig.</p>

<p>“Shucks,” apologized Hugh. “We traded clothes
with the Injuns, to show good feelin’. The other fellow’s
wearin’ my hat. Shields traded his shirt, too.
The chief’s got on the captain’s cocked hat. And you
ought to see Drouillard. He’s painted, to boot. With
all that, we had a narrow squeak, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“How far you been?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“Across the mountains, boys, to the Columby side.
We followed up the Missouri, through yonder gap, till
it got so small I stood with one foot on each bank. And
we went on over, up an Injun trail. Where the waters
flowed west we drank of the Columby!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you meet any Injuns on this side?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>And so he did. On the third day out, the captain
had sighted an Indian, through his spy-glass. The
Indian was horseback, and looked as though he might
be a Snake. But when the captain, calling “Tabba
bone,” meaning, in Sho-sho-ne, “white man,” and
stripping back his sleeve to show his white skin, was
just about to talk with the Indian, John Shields foolishly
came in and the Indian galloped away. The captain
gave John a proper “dressing down,” for this.</p>

<p>A number of horse tracks were seen, and the captain
kept on advancing, following a sort of a road, into
the mountains. He ordered a United States flag to be
carried, on a pole. Next, two squaws were frightened,
and ran away—but only a mile on, down the road, an
old woman and a young woman and a little girl were
discovered, on a sudden, digging roots. The young
woman ran, but the old woman and the little girl
squatted and covered their heads, expecting to be killed.</p>

<p>The captain raised them up and gave them presents,
and got Drouillard to talk with them in sign language.
The young woman came back; and after the captain
had painted the cheeks of the three with vermilion, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
token of peace, the two parties started on, for the
village.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, up the road charged sixty other Indians—warriors,
on horses, ready for a fight; but the
women went ahead, to talk peace, and the captain followed,
alone, carrying the flag; and as soon as they
knew what to expect, the Indians jumped from their
horses and hugged the white men and rubbed faces
with them.</p>

<p>“Ah hi e, ah hi e!” said the Indians; meaning:
“Glad to see you.”</p>

<p>The chief was Ca-me-ah-wait. In the village the
men were given salmon trout to eat, so they knew that
they were on the Pacific side of the mountains. The
village was friendly, but when the captain asked the
Indians to return with him to the east side and meet the
other white chief and men, they were afraid again—said
the white men might be spies for the Minnetarees.
Finally Ca-me-ah-wait was persuaded, and started, with
eight warriors.</p>

<p>The women wept and wailed, but after a few hours
the village followed.</p>

<p>“Well, our troubles began again,” continued Hugh.
“To get those Snakes down here was like haulin’ the
barge up-stream in some of those rapids. They turned
so suspicious that we traded clothes with ’em. We
gave ’em our flag to carry. The cap’n had told ’em
that the other white chief was to be found at the forks—but
when we sighted the forks, the boats weren’t to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
seen, and that made matters worse. Where was the
other white chief? Of course, we’d calkilated you
fellows might be slow, ’cause of the rapids, but we’d
hoped.</p>

<p>“Now we gave over our guns, and the cap’n told
the chief to have us shot if there was any ambush. We
were terrible afraid the whole pack of Injuns’d skip
and leave us stranded without hosses, or guns either.
The cap’n sent Drouillard and an Injun down to the
forks, to get a note that had been stuck on a pole there,
for Captain Clark. They brought back the note, and
the cap’n pretended it was a note put there by the other
white chief, sayin’ he was comin’, but had been delayed.
The cap’n wrote another note, by light of a brush fire,
telling Captain Clark to hurry. Drouillard and an
Injun were to take it down river in the morning.</p>

<p>“That night the Snakes hid out, all ’round us, in
the brush, for fear of a trap, while the chief and four
or five warriors bunked close beside us. Our scalps
felt mighty loose on our heads—and the mosquitoes
were powerful bad, too, so we none of us slept much.
The cap’n was pretty near crazy. It was touch-and-go,
how things’d turn out. The Snakes were liable to
skeedaddle, the whole pack of ’em, and carry us off with
’em. The only reason they were stayin’ now, was that
Drouillard had told ’em we had one of their women in
the main party, and a big black medicine man.”</p>

<p>“Hoo! Dat am me,” asserted York, proudly. “Dis
eckspedishun can’t get ’long wiffout Yawk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>“Next mornin’ we were on the anxious seat. The
fate of the expedition hung on whether you fellows
arrived pretty soon at those forks and proved that the
cap’n had spoken truth. The chief sent out a lot of
scouts; and Drouillard and one Injun started early with
the note, to find you. They hadn’t been gone more than
two hours by sun, when in came a scout at a gallop,
makin’ signs. He said he’d seen men like us, with skin
color of ashes, travelin’ up-river in boats, and they
weren’t far away. Hooray!”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cheered the listeners.</p>

<p>“That settled the business. Old Ca-me-ah-wait
hugged us, and the other Injuns danced and sang, and
away raced a gang of ’em—and next thing Drouillard
and a crowd met Captain Clark. And now here
you all are. So I reckon we’re fixed. They’ll trade
us hosses.”</p>

<p>The council was still in progress; but while camp
was being made under direction of Sergeant Ordway,
out from the council lodge came Shields and Drouillard,
to the camp. Drouillard was grinning and capering,
evidently very happy. His swarthy cheeks were
painted with vermilion, he wore a Snake tippet and
decorated shirt; he looked exactly like an Indian.</p>

<p>“What news, Drouillard?”</p>

<p>“Ever’t’ing is all right. We are ’mong frien’s.
Dey all glad to haf Sa-ca-ja-we-a, an’ she speak well
for us. She find one woman who was capture’ same
time as she but escape’. An’ dat chief, he her brudder.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Dey haf recognize’, an’ haf weep togedder under one
blanket. I mos’ weep too.”</p>

<p>“A princess, be she?” exclaimed Sergeant Pat.
“Well, well! Good for the little Bird-woman. An’
what of hosses?”</p>

<p>“Plenty hoss. No more drag canoe.”</p>

<p>The captains came down. They also were dressed
as Indians; in their hair had been tied little shells from
the “stinking lake,” as the Snakes called the far-off
Pacific Ocean. The shells had been bought from other
Indians and were considered very valuable. A canopy
of boughs and sails was ordered erected; under this
another council was held. Chief Ca-me-ah-wait
promised to furnish horses. The Indian women set
about repairing the men’s moccasins. They appeared
to be a kindly tribe—they wondered much at York, and
the battered boats, and the guns, and even at the smartness
of the little black dog. But they shook their heads
when questioned about the country west of the
mountains.</p>

<p>“Dey say it is not ze possible for ze white mans to
make travel down ze Columbee by boats, an’ ze trail for
ze hoss an’ ze foot is ver’ bad,” declared Chaboneau.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Sa-ca-ja-we-a, Toussaint?”
queried George Shannon, for the Bird-woman’s
eyes were red and swollen.</p>

<p>“She much cry. Mos’ all her fam’ly dead while she
been away.”</p>

<p>In the morning Captain Clark took Sergeant Pat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
and ten other men, and started over the mountains to
explore beyond the Snake village, in hopes of finding a
route by water. They were to send back a man to the
Snake village, to meet Captain Lewis there and tell him
what had been discovered.</p>

<p>Chief Ca-me-ah-wait and all his people except two
men and two women started also for the village, with
Sa-ca-ja-we-a and Chaboneau, to bring down horses,
for Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>Everybody in the camp was put at work making
pack-saddles from oar handles and pieces of boxes tied
firmly with raw-hide! Out of sight of the Indians a
hole was dug in which to cache more of the baggage,
especially the specimens that had been collected.</p>

<p>Five horses were purchased, at six dollars each in
trade; the canoes were sunk by rocks in the bottom of
the river—and the Snakes promised not to disturb
them, while the white men were away. On August 24
the march was begun for the village on the other slope
of what are to-day the Bitter Root Mountains. The
five horses were packed with the supplies; Sa-ca-ja-we-a
and little Toussaint rode on a sixth horse that Chaboneau
had bought.</p>

<p>Although this was August, the evenings and nights
were so cold that the ink froze on the pens when the
journals were being written. The village was reached
in the late afternoon of August 26. John Colter was
here, waiting. He brought word from Captain Clark
that canoes would be of no use; the country ahead was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
fit for only horse and foot, as far as the captain had
gone.</p>

<p>“We had an old Injun for guide who’d been living
in another village further west,” related John. “He
says we can’t go to the south’ard, for the land’s bare
rocks and high mountains without game, and the horses’
hoofs’d be cut to pieces, and the Broken Moccasin
Indians would kill us. ’Tisn’t the direction we want
to go, anyhow. The Injuns we met said winter was
due, with big snows, and soon the salmon would be
leaving for lower country. So the captain decided to
turn back and advise Captain Lewis that we’d better
tackle another road he’d heard of from the guide,
farther to the north, into the Tushepaw country on the
big river. After we’d struck the big river, which like
as not is the Columby, we could follow it down to the
Pacific. Anyhow, the Tushepaws might know.”</p>

<p>Captain Lewis immediately began to bargain for
twenty horses. The prices were being raised, so that
soon a young horse cost a pistol, 100 balls, some powder
and a knife.</p>

<p>Sergeant Pat arrived from Captain Clark’s camp
below, to ask how matters were shaping.</p>

<p>“’Tis a hard road ahead, lads,” he confirmed.
“Cruzatte will tell you that. Sure, wance he was
almost lost, himself. I was sint up here to inquire
about the prospect of hosses; but what I want to learn,
myself, is: are we have the pleasure of the comp’ny of
the little Bird-woman?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, she’s going.”</p>

<p>For Sa-ca-ja-we-a was. She preferred the white
men to her own people.</p>

<p>“Sa-ca-ja-we-a will go. She wants to see the big
water,” she had said.</p>

<p>All were pleased that Sa-ca-ja-we-a, the Bird-woman,
would take little Toussaint and continue on
with them to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>On the last day of August there was a general
breaking up at the village. The Sho-sho-nes under
Chief Ca-me-ah-wait rode east over the pass which is
to-day Lemhi Pass of the east fringe of the Bitter
Root Mountains, to hunt the buffalo on the plains of
the Missouri. With twenty-seven horses and one mule
the white chiefs’ company, guided by the old Sho-sho-ne
and his four sons, set out in quest of the
Columbia and the Pacific.</p>

<p>The men named the old guide “Toby.”</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIV">XIV<br />
<small>ACROSS STARVATION MOUNTAINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Sure,” said Patrick Gass, “if I wasn’t so sore in
me feet an’ empty in me stomick I could close my
eyes an’ think myself back in a Pennsylvany barnyard,
with the chickens all a-cluckin’.”</p>

<p>“But instead, we’re four thousand miles from old
‘Pennsylvany,’ Pat, and in a country where even the
dogs are so hungry they eat your moccasins while you
sleep,” retorted George Shannon. “The pesky brutes
stole my best pair last night.”</p>

<p>This was the day of September 5. Ca-me-ah-wait
and Toby and John Colter and Pat had spoken truly
when they had predicted a tough trip. The region west
from the Sho-sho-ne village proved impassable. Old
Toby had led northward, by hard trail up and down.
The two captains rode in the advance; the hunters
scouted for game but found little; York’s big feet had
failed him and he needs must ride until well; Sa-ca-ja-we-a,
of course, rode, carrying on her back baby
Toussaint; everybody else trudged afoot, each man
leading two pack-horses.</p>

<p>The horses soon were worn out by scrambling
amidst rain and snow, and falling on the sharp rocks.</p>

<p>What with hauling and shoving and chasing them,
the men had decided that boats were easier, after all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>The route had crossed the crooked range, to the
east side again, and here had struck a Tushepaw Indian
camp of thirty-three lodges. Now the company were
lying around, waiting and resting, while the captains
traded for more horses.</p>

<p>“I can not onderstan’ one word,” complained
Chaboneau. “Neider can Sa-ca-ja-we-a.”</p>

<p>Old Toby himself scarcely was able to interpret
for the captains. The language was a curious mixture
of grunts and cries. Nevertheless, a kind and hospitable
people were these light-skinned Oo-tla-shoots,
of the great Tushepaw or Flat-head nation. They were
rich in horses, and generous with their roots and
berries; and fearing that these strange white men, who
rode without blankets, had been robbed, they threw
about their guests’ shoulders handsome bleached buffalo
robes.</p>

<p>These Oo-tla-shoots, who were on their way eastward
to hunt the buffalo, signed that the best trail for
the big water beyond the mountains was the Pierced
Nose trail, northward still. If the white men crossed
the mountains by that trail, they would come to a swift
river that joined the Big River, down which were falls
and a big water where lived other white men.</p>

<p>Old Toby, winking his eyes violently, said that he
knew. He once had been upon that trail of the Pierced
Noses, by which they hunted the buffalo. His four
sons had left him, several days back; but another son
had appeared, and he asserted that they two would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
guide the white chiefs, by the Pierced Nose trail onward
from the No-Salmon River, and so to the stinking lake
under the setting sun.</p>

<p>“What white men do we find, at the Pacific Ocean,
George?” asked Peter; for both the Snakes and the
Flat-heads spoke of “white men” down the Columbia,
which was known only as the Big River.</p>

<p>“Traders, Peter. White men from the United
States, and from other white nations—England and
Russia—who sail there in large boats and trade for
furs. Perhaps we’ll all return to the United States by
one of those boats.”</p>

<p>“At No-Salmon River is where we enter the Pierced
Nose trail, is it?” mused Sergeant Nat Pryor. “I
reckon that’s a correct name. ’Cordin’ to Chaboneau
and Drouillard the salmon aren’t to be found in any
waters east of the Rock Mountains. They all stay
west.”</p>

<p>“Oh, murther, an’ aren’t we west o’ the mountains,
yet?” exclaimed Pat.</p>

<p>Still north pushed the company, down through the
Bitter Root Valley of western Montana, with the line
of mountains on the left rising ever colder and higher.
In four days’ journey was reached a broad Indian
trail, along a river running east. It was the Pierced
Nose trail, said old Toby, and the river was the No-Salmon
River. The Indian road was to be followed
westward, over the mountains, but on the way there
would be no game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>So the captains called the No-Salmon (to-day the
Lou Lou) River, “Traveler’s Rest Creek,” because
here camp was made while the men hunted and mended
clothes before again climbing the mountains.</p>

<p>The Pierced Nose trail was plain at first, but on
the Idaho side of these the Bitter Root Mountains it
soon was lost amidst many other trails, and the snows
and the thick timber and the bare rocks. Old Toby
himself was well-nigh confused; he had not been along
the main trail for many years.</p>

<p>The mountains were very broad, very wild. The
jumble of high ridges was steep, and constantly drear
with rain and snow. The horses strayed, and went
lame, and fell down and broke things. The hunters
sometimes brought in a lean deer, sometimes a few
grouse, and frequently nothing, so then for all hands
there were only a sip of canned soup, and berries.</p>

<p>It was on September 14 that the first of the colts
was killed, to be eaten. The soup and the berries were
making the men ill. He was a nice little black colt, and
Peter hated to have him killed; but what else could be
done? On this day, also, they arrived at a clear, rocky
river down which extended the Indian road.</p>

<p>“Is this the Big River?” asked Captain Lewis,
hopefully, of old Toby. “Is this the Big River, with
the falls and the white men?”</p>

<p>“Koos koos kee,” grunted old Toby. And that
was all he would say.</p>

<p>So “Koos-koos-kee” was the river named.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>“Dat one funny name,” chuckled Chaboneau. “Ze
‘Some-odder-river.’” And he laughed. Not for considerable
time did he explain to his comrades that “koos
koos kee” was only Indian for “This is not the river;
it is some other river.”</p>

<p>But the Kooskooskee or Clearwater River does the
stream remain unto this day.</p>

<p>“More mountains! Wirrah, more mountains!”
lamented Patrick Gass, when the Indian road left the
banks of the stony Kooskooskee and through the
roughest kind of a country started upward again.
“Will we niver be out into some place where it’s open
enough to see ’round a corner?”</p>

<p>“Nebber so col’ in mah life befoh,” chattered
York, plodding on in frozen moccasins, with snow to
his ragged knees. “We got to follow Marse Will an’
Marse Merne—but how do dis hyar Tobe know whar
he gwine?”</p>

<p>Sa-ca-ja-we-a pointed ahead from her pony’s back.
She had learned to understand even York’s speech. She
was very smart and quick.</p>

<p>“Pony rub bark,” she said. For, as anybody ought
to be able to perceive, the snow-covered trail was
marked above by places where Indian pony packs had
scuffed low-hanging branches. This to Peter was very
plain.</p>

<p>This night the brown colt was killed, for supper.</p>

<p>“I slept with me heels higher’n me head,” in the
morning announced Pat. “’Tis a fine country where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
a man can’t find a level spot to stretch his bones over.”</p>

<p>The next day the spotted colt was killed. Some of
the men were growing discouraged. After supper
Captain Clark, lean but ruddy, his eyes tired but steady,
made a speech, with Captain Lewis seconding him.</p>

<p>“We’re doing the best we can, men,” he said.
“We’re bound to break our way out into the lower
country where there’ll be warmth and game and friendly
Indians. Why, it may be only a few miles ahead! We
can’t turn back. Behind us would be only disgrace.
Before is glory, and the honor of the flag. To-morrow
I’m to scout for a better game country than we are
finding. The level grassy plains are the places for
game; and I’ll send you back word, and as like as not
some fat meat, too.”</p>

<p>“Hooray,” agreed the men, feebly.</p>

<p>“Our hearts be strong but our stomicks be weak,”
sighed Pat.</p>

<p>“We’re nearly at the end of the colts,” added Alec
Willard. “I’d as soon eat my moccasins as chaw old
hoss.”</p>

<p>The next morning early Captain Clark, with Drouillard,
Joe Fields, Alec, John Colter, Hugh McNeal and
George Shannon, the strongest of the men, and good
hunters all, rode ahead on picked horses to find, as they
expressed, “a level spot and game.”</p>

<p>Old Toby and his son continued to guide. They
were doing the best they could, too. But surely this
Pierced Nose trail was long and difficult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>Now the only food left was some soup and bear-oil.
Everybody was feeling weak and miserable. But once
the men started a cheer, for they glimpsed, distant before,
through a gap, a large broad valley or plain—perhaps
the end of the mountains and perhaps the
country of the Nez Percés or Pierced Noses. Then
the mountains closed again and the valley was swallowed
up.</p>

<p>On the third day, about ten o’clock, another shout
was given. To a tree beside the trail (the trees were
getting larger, showing that the trail was leading downward),
in a little draw was hanging the carcass of a
horse; and to it was pinned by a splinter a note from
Captain Clark:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">I am going on to some plains to the southwest.<br />
Will find Indians and collect provisions for you.
</p>

<p class="right">W. C.</p>
</div>

<p>Sturdy Captain Clark, the Red Head chief! He
could always be depended upon. Captain Lewis’s thin
face brightened under his tattered hat.</p>

<p>“Load the meat, lads,” he ordered. “We’ll have
a rousing dinner, this day.”</p>

<p>Ah, but at noon that horse tasted good, after soup
and bear-oil! The head was cut off and tossed aside;
then with their knives everyone slashed off thick steaks
and roasted them on ramrods, over the fires. Peter
got his share.</p>

<p>However, just as the march was about to proceed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
the captain, who, as usual, had paused to cast his eyes
keenly along the line, exclaimed sharply:</p>

<p>“Where’s my pack animal, Cruzatte?”</p>

<p>For Cruzatte was supposed to look after this horse
and another.</p>

<p>“I t’ought he follow,” stammered Cruzatte, who
was quite sick. “I no see heem. My gracious! Mebbe
he in brush.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” muttered the captain. Then he spoke
energetically. “I must have those saddle-bags. They’re
of the utmost importance. Fields (and he addressed
Reuben), you’re pretty fit. Take a horse and another
man and go clear back to where we loaded the meat
this morning. That’s likely where the animal strayed,
while we halted. Look for his tracks and find him. Be
sure and get the saddle-bags, in all events. Their contents
are valuable.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” responded Reuben. He looked about
him doubtfully. And Peter did an unexpected thing.
Peter felt equal to any man. He was young and wiry;
his life among the Otoes had accustomed him to all
kinds of outdoor hardships. He had not had so much
flesh and bones to carry as had the men; he had walked
lightly and straight-footed, as Indians walked.</p>

<p>“Take me, Reuben,” he said. “I’m all right. I
find the horse.”</p>

<p>“Faith,” supported Patrick Gass, “ye might do
worse, Reub. Sure, the lad’s as good as the best.”</p>

<p>“If the captain has no objections——?” proffered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
Reuben, with a grin, “I think we’d make out first-rate.”</p>

<p>“An excellent plan,” agreed the captain. “Take
Peter, by all means. He wants to do his part, and
when it’s his turn to ride he’ll be easy on the horse.
He’s a regular woodsman, too. Look to your laurels,
Reuben.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” grinned Reuben.</p>

<p>So they set off; Reuben, with his rifle, at first on the
horse; Peter, with his bow and quiver, trotting alongside,
holding to the saddle thongs. After a time, they
changed off; Peter rode and Reuben walked.</p>

<p>They had left about three o’clock. It was dusk
when they arrived at the noon camp spot, on the other
side of the high ridge. Not even a bird had they seen,
to kill for food. They had started in such a hurry that
they had brought nothing. But the horse’s head was
still lying here, untouched.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to make shift with the head, Peter,”
quoth Reuben.</p>

<p>So they built a fire, and roasted the horse’s head,
and ate it even to the ears. Then they rolled in Reuben’s
blanket and slept together.</p>

<p>“We’ll find that hoss or bust,” declared Reuben,
as in the morning early, having finished the horse-head
scraps, they again took the back trail. Soon they arrived
at the place where the horse carcass had been packed—and
sure enough, in the brush at one side were the tracks
of a horse that had wandered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>They followed the tracks carefully, and soon they
came to the saddle bags, which had been scraped off
from the horse’s back. Reuben put them aboard the
other horse.</p>

<p>“Now for the critter himself,” he said.</p>

<p>The tracks led on and on; and not until almost
noon did they sight the loose horse, grazing in a small
open spot. He was too weak to be wild, and they
caught him easily by his dragging neck rope. Reuben
transferred the saddle bags, and clambered stiffly on.</p>

<p>“We’ve a hoss apiece, anyhow, Peter,” he proclaimed.
“But I’m so empty I don’t cast a shadow.
Come on, let’s take the cap’n his saddle bags.”</p>

<p>Empty! Anyway—hooray! And now for “home.”</p>

<p>Reuben, who was leading, suddenly pulled his horse
short. He slipped off, and resting his rifle on the
horse’s back, took long aim. Two grouse were sitting
on a limb, craning their necks foolishly. Peter could
see the rifle muzzle waver; he himself felt as though
he could not draw his bow. The rifle cracked—the
grouse went hurling. Good! Reuben swiftly reloaded,
and aimed—and down spun the other grouse. But
when they were picked up, both were in a pulp, from
which dangled the heads and legs. Reuben shook his
own head dolefully.</p>

<p>“And once I could clip off a bird’s head at fifty
paces. Well, I was lucky to hit ’em at all, for I can’t
hold steady.”</p>

<p>The two grouse made scarcely a couple of mouthfuls,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
so much of the meat had been shot away. The
next morning the horses had disappeared, leaving only
the saddle bags. Reuben finally shouldered them.</p>

<p>“If we stay looking longer,” he said, “we’ll starve.
I’ll tote these as far as I can, Peter; and you can tote
’em as far as <em>you</em> can. Between us we’ll manage, for
the cap’n’s got to have his saddle bags.”</p>

<p>“You bet,” agreed Peter.</p>

<p>That <em>was</em> a journey! They struggled all day. The
saddle bags, vowed Reuben, gasping, weighed a ton—and
what a ton might be, Peter did not know, but at
any rate it must be very heavy. Only toward late
afternoon did they sight, below and ahead, the captain’s
party, on the edge of a plain—<em>the</em> plain.</p>

<p>The party were moving briskly, as if encouraged.
The captain was in advance. Reuben and Peter quickened
at their best. Would they never overtake the
other men?</p>

<p>“Smoke, ain’t it, yonder?” panted Reuben.</p>

<p>“Pierced Nose village, maybe, Reuben,” answered
Peter.</p>

<p>“Don’t I see Joe, with that crowd? Yes, and a
strange Injun, too!” panted Reuben.</p>

<p>They hastened, dragging their numb legs, and lugging
those saddle bags. The party saw them, and
halted; gave them a cheer.</p>

<p>“Bully for yez!” greeted Pat. “We’ve arriv, in a
land o’ plenty, ’mongst the Pierced Noses. Yez are in
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>Reuben saluted the captain, who had turned back.</p>

<p>“The saddle bags, Cap’n, but we lost the hosses
again.”</p>

<p>“You’ve done well, both of you, lads,” praised the
captain. “Joe’s brought us some fish and roots, from
Captain Clark. He’s waiting close ahead, with the
Pierced Noses. Get on a horse, each of you, and eat
as you ride. I think our troubles are over.”</p>

<p>Within an hour they all were at the village of the
Pierced Noses, here on the open, fertile prairie of the
kamass roots that tasted like pumpkin; and Captain
Clark and Chief Twisted-hair made them all welcome.</p>

</div>


<p>How beautiful was this broad prairie beyond the
mountains, here where lived the Cho-pun-nish or
Pierced Nose Indians while they caught salmon in the
rivers and the women dug the kamass roots! But the
fish and the roots were given so generously that all
the party were made ill.</p>

<p>The village was near the banks of the Koos-koos-kee.
Twisted-hair, who was the head chief, drew a
map with charcoal on a white robe. He showed that
not far below, the Koos-koos-kee joined another river,
and that this river joined another river from the north,
and the two combined flowed west to the big water.</p>

<p>“Tim-tim-m-m-m!” crooned all the Indians, imitating
the noise of some great falls that would be met.
From the region of these falls and below, came the
beads and the brass ornaments traded to Indians by
white men.</p>

<p>’Twas time to change from horses to canoes again.
Five canoes were hollowed by fire from tree trunks—for
only a few of the men were strong enough to
swing an adze. All the horses were branded with the
army brand which bore the name “Capt. M. Lewis,
U. S.,” and left in charge of the Pierced Noses. Chief
Twisted-hair promised that the horses should be well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
taken care of, and would be waiting when the white
men asked for them again.</p>

<p>“Well, I for one am glad to be away,” said George
Shannon, when in the morning of October 7 the canoes,
laden and manned, their oar-blades flashing, headed
into mid-stream. “These Nez Percés are a good
people—’bout the best looking Injuns we’ve seen—but
they’re mighty independent. They don’t give anything
for nothing.”</p>

<p>“No. And they even hold us to small account because
we eat dogs,” quoth Joe Fields. “But if a man
wants meat, in their village, it’s eat fish, hoss or dog—an’
dog’s the only stuff with any strength.”</p>

<p>That was true. Lacking better meat, the captains
finally were buying the Pierced Noses’ work-dogs—for
dog-meat had been found good, back at the Sioux
camps on the Missouri. Drouillard and Cruzatte and
the other Frenchmen preferred it even to deer. But
the Pierced Noses sneered at the white “dog-eaters.”</p>

<p>Why they were called “Pierced Noses” nobody
could tell. However, old Toby claimed that below
there were other, real Pierced Noses, and also real
Flat-heads.</p>

<p>Chief Twisted-hair and a second chief, Tetoh, were
aboard the captains’ canoe, to help the white men pass
through the other villages, into the “Tim-tim-m-m”
river.</p>

<p>As for old Toby and his son, on the third day out,
during a halt they suddenly were espied running away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
at top speed, and did not so much as turn their heads.</p>

<p>“They’re leaving without their pay! Send and get
them, so we can pay them,” cried Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>Chaboneau grinned.</p>

<p>“Dey ’fraid of ze tim-tim rapids. Ze chief say no
use to pay dem, anyhow. His people take ever’t’ing
from dem when dey go t’rough village.”</p>

<p>Down, down, down with the swift current. The
Koos-koos-kee joined the other river, which, the captains
figured, was the same river on whose head-waters,
far, far eastward, the camp of Chief Ca-me-ah-wait
and his Snakes had been located. The Lewis River did
they name it, but on modern maps it is the Snake.</p>

<p>Now on down, down, down the rushing Snake.
There were rapids, where once or twice a canoe or two
was wrecked; but this sort of travel was easier than
travel over the mountains, and easier than travel <em>up</em>
stream. Many Indians were seen, fishing for the salmon.
They were friendly, and much astonished. They
sent runners to other villages, below, telling of the
coming of white men; sometimes Chiefs Twisted-hair
and Tetoh also ran ahead, along the bank, that the
Indians might be ready. And on shore the Indian
women made much of Sa-ca-ja-we-a and little
Toussaint.</p>

<p>“If these white strangers travel with a woman
and a baby, they cannot be a war party,” reasoned the
Indians.</p>

<p>Down, down; until soon after dinner, on October<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
16, this 1805, the course of another large river, coming
in from the north, was sighted before. The Columbia!
It must be the Columbia, at last! Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray! Old Cruzatte, in the leading canoe, struck up
a gay French boat-song; Drouillard and Lepage and
Labiche and Chaboneau chimed in. Faster flashed the
paddles.</p>

<p>“We’ll land yonder,” shouted Captain Lewis, pointing
to the right. “At the junction. A lot of Indians
seem to be waiting for us.”</p>

<p>“Thanks to Twisted-hair,” jubilated Pat. “Sure,
I see him—an’ the other wan, too. When they left
they said they’d meet us at the Tim-tim, didn’t they?
An’ it’s a big river, by the looks.”</p>

<p>A great throng of Indians collected by Chiefs
Twisted-hair and Tetoh had collected on the shore just
above where the two rivers joined. A council, opened
by a procession with drums, was held. These were
Sokulk Indians. They claimed to be kins-folk of the
Twisted-hair Pierced Noses, but their foreheads were
flattened back so that their heads ended in a peak, and
therefore they were more like Flat-heads. They were
kind—and not very attractive, because their eyes were
sore from water glare and sun glare, and their teeth
were bad from eating fish and roots.</p>

<p>Yes, this was the Columbia. The two captains
measured it, and the Snake. The width of the Snake
was 575 yards, but the width of the Columbia was
960 yards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>“A noble stream,” remarked Captain Lewis. “I
wonder how far to the north it penetrates.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see so many fish, dead and alive, in
all your life, Merne?” exclaimed Captain Clark.
“Why, the water swarms with them, and I understand
that the Indians use dried ones for fuel.”</p>

<p>“We’ll buy more dogs, nevertheless, Will,” smiled
Captain Lewis. “The men can’t row and make
portages on fish flesh alone.”</p>

<p>A day and a half was spent with the curious
Sokulks, here where in southeastern Washington the
Snake River unites with the mighty Columbia, in the
midst of a flat and pleasant plain. On October 18 the
five canoes swept out and down the Columbia itself.</p>

<p>“How far now, Pat?” asked Peter. “To the big
ocean?”</p>

<p>“Thirty-siven hunderd miles have we come, by the
captains’ reckonin’,” answered Pat. “An’ belike ’tis
four hunderd more to the Paycific.”</p>

<p>“What do we do then, Pat?”</p>

<p>“If there aren’t anny ships we’ll have to stay the
winter. An’ in the spring, barrin’ better luck, ’tis back
we track over the four thousan’ moils ag’in.”</p>

<p>From the Sokulks had been procured another map,
of the Columbia. It showed many bad places—rapids
and falls. Around some of these the canoes had to be
carried; through others they had to be hauled by hand,
or carefully lowered with ropes. The Indians ashore
seemed very timid, and hid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>Captain Clark returned in high humor, from a
walk ahead with Chaboneau and Sa-ca-ja-we-a, and
Chiefs Twisted-hair and Tetoh. He had shot a white
crane, and a teal duck, and then had entered an Indian
house that had been closed against him. The Indians
had bowed before him, and covered their heads. When
he had lighted his peace-pipe with his sun-glass, they
had cried aloud in terror.</p>

<p>“They thought me a god, Merne,” he laughed.
“They had heard the gun, had seen the two birds drop,
and believed that I had dropped, too. When I brought
fire out of the sky, that finished the business. But I
quieted them with presents.”</p>

<p>However, near the mouth of a river, Chief Yellept
of the Walla Walla Indians welcomed the white men,
and wished them to stay. Captain Lewis said that
they would visit him on their way back.</p>

<p>Chiefs Twisted-hair and Tetoh were sent ahead
again, to assure the Indians that the white men intended
no harm.</p>

<p>The first big falls, reached on October 23, were not
the Tim-tim. The Tim-tim was still below. But Chief
Twisted-hair said that the Indians down there were
strangers to him, and unfriendly. He had heard that
they were planning to attack the white men. And as
he could not speak their language he wished to return
to his own people.</p>

<p>He was persuaded to stay—and Tetoh also—until
the passage of the Tim-tim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>These first falls or rapids were very difficult; but
the captains and old Cruzatte consulted together, and
decided to run them with the boats.</p>

<p>“If ever’body follow me an’ do as I do, we get
t’rough,” promised Cruzatte, head boat-man.</p>

<p>So, with Cruzatte leading, down through the wild
channel of the first rapids in the Dalles of the Columbia
raced the canoes. And from the rocky shores the
Eneeshur Indians opened their mouths wide in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“The Irish an’ Frinch together can lick the world,”
boasted Pat.</p>

<p>But the place of Tim-tim, or “Timm,” for short,
was close ahead. It was reached the next evening,
and they camped above it, at a village of the Echeloots,
or Chinook Indians, who also flattened their hats, and
spoke more cluckingly than did even the Oo-tla-shoots.</p>

<p>They were the enemies of the Pierced Noses, but
they agreed upon peace, in a council with Chief Twisted-hair.
Now, after a final “smoke,” Chiefs Twisted-hair
and Tetoh left, on horses, for their home. They
had been good and faithful guides.</p>

<p>The place of Timm, at the foot of the Dalles of the
Columbia, is to-day called the Long Narrows. It was
three miles long and in some stretches only fifty yards
wide. But the canoes, guided by Cruzatte, went
through without one being wrecked. They had been
badly battered, however, by the many rocks; and the
next day was spent in caulking them. That night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
Cruzatte brought out his fiddle, a dance was held, about
the fire, and the Echeloots appeared much entertained.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, soon after the camp had
gone to bed, Peter was awakened by Pat’s suddenly
squirming out of the blanket.</p>

<p>“The fleas are ’atin’ me entoirely,” declared Pat.
“Into the river goes ivery stitch o’ me clothes.”</p>

<p>Peter was glad to follow the example. By morning
nearly all the men were stripped, and needs must stalk
about in blankets while their clothing was being cleaned.</p>

<p>“’Twas the mosquitoes east of the mountains,”
laughed George Shannon. “Now ’tis the fleas west
of the mountains.”</p>

<p>But the fleas were a slight matter, when amidst
grand scenery the Columbia River ever bore the canoes
onward, toward the ocean and the end of the long, long
journey.</p>

<p>After the Echeloots (whom the violin and the
dancing had so entertained), more Indians were met.
The banks of this Columbia were thickly populated.
These Indians lived in wooden houses, too—houses
walled and raftered with planks faced and trimmed by
fire or by knives and little axes. The houses were
furnished with bedsteads.</p>

<p>“As good houses as some settlers’ houses back in
the Illinois country,” declared Captain Clark, who was
constantly exploring among them.</p>

<p>The canoes that the Indians cleverly managed were
large, hollowed from a single log, with high bows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
curving upward; farther on down, bows and sterns
both were high, and had figures of men and beasts.
Some of the Indians owned articles of white men’s
manufacture, which they said came from below.</p>

<p>“What you say dese hyar Injuns call demselves,
Marse Will?” York was heard to ask.</p>

<p>“Skilloots, York.”</p>

<p>“An’ what were dose we met ’foh we met dese
Galoots?”</p>

<p>“The Chilluckittequaws, York.”</p>

<p>“Jes’ so,” gasped York. “But <em>I</em> ain’t gwine to
say it.”</p>

<p>On November 2 the canoes were partly carried
around, partly slid through, the rapids which formed
the foot of other rapids termed by the captains the
Great Shute. Presently the river opened two miles
wide, and smooth and placid. That night the water
rose nine inches on a stake set at the river’s edge in
front of the camp.</p>

<p>“We’re in tidewater, lads!” announced Captain
Lewis. “The ocean tides ascend this far. That means
there are no more rapids; the ocean itself can’t be very
distant.”</p>

<p>Each night after this a stake was set out and
the rise measured. Each day the men sniffed for the
smell of salt water and listened for the sound of the
surf. Sa-ca-ja-we-a was very much excited; she had
come especially to see the big water.</p>

<p>During the night of November 4 the rise from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
tide was two feet; the next night’s rise was four feet.
Ducks and geese were many. But it rained almost
every day, and every morning a fog hung low.</p>

<p>On the morning of November 7 the camp rose and
breakfasted in a wet mist so dense that it hung on all
sides like a gray curtain.</p>

<p>“At this rate,” quoth Pat, as the canoes headed out
into the silence, “we’re liable to get half way to Chiny
afore we know we’re on the Paycific at all.”</p>

<p>“I do believe I smell salt, though,” asserted George
Shannon, sniffing. “Sa-ca-ja-we-a’s been insisting,
too, that she could hear a ‘boom-boom.’”</p>

<p>“Listen!” bade Pat—and they paused on their
oars. Peter thought that he also could hear a “boom-boom,”
low and dull, but he wasn’t certain. They
went on.</p>

<p>The captains’ boat was being piloted by a Wah-kia-cum
Indian, now: a squat ugly man who wore a
queer round jacket that, according to the men, had
come from a ship. The river was growing wider, the
fog was thinning and lifting—on a sudden the crew of
the captains’ boat waved their hats, pointed before,
cheered wildly. The cheer passed from boat to boat.
For the fog ahead had swirled into fragments, and
below it was an expanse of tumbling gray water on
which the sun was trying to shine. Occasionally
sounded a muffled “boom,” like the faint growl of
summer thunder.</p>

<p>The Pacific Ocean! But they did not reach it this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
day; the fog closed in again, and the rain. They did
not reach it the next day, although the waves were so
high in this, the mouth of the Columbia, that half the
party were seasick; and the water was salty. They did
not reach it the next day, nor the next. Wind and rain
kept beating them back. Sa-ca-ja-we-a was frightened.</p>

<p>“The spirits are angry. They do not want us here,”
she whimpered, crouching over little Toussaint, under
a grass mat raised on a pole.</p>

<p>“The only way we’ll reach the sea is to be washed
into it,” groaned Pat. “Sure, don’t the very stones an’
logs come a-rollin’ down the hills? Now for the first
time I wish I hadn’t started, an’ here I am at the ind!”</p>

<p>Yes, miserable were they all. There was no chance
to dry clothing and food, and scarcely an opportunity
to stir. The mouth of the river formed a wind-swept
bay miles wide. The captains thought that if camp
might only be moved around a point ahead, and to a
high sand beach, it would be more comfortable. A
deserted Indian village stood there, with no inhabitants
“except fleas”; and, as Pat said: “We’ll be all the
warmer for the exercise they give us.”</p>

<p>Not until the afternoon of November 15 did the
opportunity to move come. The sky cleared, the wind
suddenly dropped; the canoes were reloaded in a hurry,
and the point was rounded.</p>

<p>Now the ocean was in full sight, outside the bay;
from the boards of the Indian houses rude cabins were
erected; hunters and explorers were sent out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVI">XVI<br />
<small>THE WINTER AT FORT CLATSOP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>But no ships from the United States or any other
nation were to be found. Only the long gray swells
appeared, as far as eye could see, rolling in to burst
thunderously upon the white sands and the naked
rocks; and the only people ashore were the Indians.
Ships and white men had been here, said the Indians,
during the summer; and many of the Indians spoke a
curious mixture of English and native words. Captain
Lewis discovered a place, in the bay, where white men
had camped.</p>

<p>A high point overlooking the lonely ocean was given
the name Cape Disappointment.</p>

<p>“Now, wouldn’t it have been a fine end to our trip
from the Mississippi clane to the Paycific if a nice big
ship all stocked with flour an’ p’taties an’ boots an’
socks had been waitin’ for us,” quoth Pat. “Sure,
mebbe the United States has forgotten us.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to build winter quarters at once, Will,”
said Captain Lewis. “The rain is rotting all our goods
and clothes, and spoiling our provisions. We must get
under cover. There’ll be no ships before next summer,
according to the Indians.”</p>

<p>“Timber for cabins, wood for fires, game and
fresh water for the messes, and shelter from the ocean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
tides—let’s look about, then,” answered Captain Clark.
“The Indians say that skins and meat are abundant a
little way south.”</p>

<p>Captain Lewis found it—a good site, on the south
side of the bay formed by the mouth of the Columbia,
and three miles up a little river called to-day the Lewis
and Clark River. It was back ten miles from the ocean,
and in the midst of tall pines, with great shaking bogs
near, on which elk fed.</p>

<p>The first fair morning, which was December 7,
camp was moved to the new grounds.</p>

<p>The walls of the seven cabins rose fast; and when it
came time to put on the roofs, Pat, the boss carpenter,
was delighted to find a species of pine that split into
boards ten feet long, and two feet wide, with never a
knot or crack.</p>

<p>“The finest puncheons I iver have seen,” he asserted,
“for floors an’ roofs both. We’ll be snug an’ dry in a
jiffy, an’ all ready for Christmas.”</p>

<p>“It’s a far cry back to last Christmas, Pat,” spoke
George. “We’ve come through a lot of country.”</p>

<p>“An’ here we are,” reminded Pat.</p>

<p>Yes; Christmas—Peter’s first Christmas—was indeed
a long way behind. That Christmas of 1804 had
been celebrated in new Fort Mandan among the Mandans
and Minnetarees beside the snowy Missouri River.
What were Chiefs Big White and Black Cat doing now?
Was Fort Mandan being kept ready for the return of
the Long Knife and the Red Head?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>This Christmas of 1805 was celebrated in new Fort
Clatsop, among the flat-headed Clatsops and Chinooks
and Cathlamets at the mouth of the rainy Columbia
River. The men fired a volley, before breakfast, and
in front of the captains’ door old Cruzatte, accompanied
by Drouillard and the other Frenchmen, sang a lively
Christmas song. But there was no feast, because the
only food in stock was some roots, pounded fish, and
lean elk meat. The captains distributed a little tobacco
to the men who smoked, and Peter and the men who
did not use tobacco received each a handkerchief.</p>

<p>The rain poured all day, but the cabins were tight
above and below, so that everybody stayed dry and
warm.</p>

<p>Now the expedition might settle down to the
winter’s routine. Chimneys were yet to be put up for
the men’s cabins—fires were tried, in open hearths in
the middle of the rooms, Indian fashion, and proved
too smoky. A fence of high, close pickets, as at
Fort Mandan, needs must be erected to guard
against attack.</p>

<p>The captains’ cabin had been built around a large
stump, smoothly sawed; this was their writing table,
on which they spread their maps and journals. Captain
Clark had traded with the Indians for a panther
skin seven feet long; this made a good rug. York
occupied the same cabin. Chaboneau was the captains’
cook; he and Sa-ca-ja-we-a and little Toussaint lived in
another room, built on. The men were divided into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
four messes, each with a cook, and the supplies were
doled out from the storehouse every morning.</p>

<p>Drouillard, the chief hunter, and George Shannon,
John Collins, Francois Labiche and Reuben Fields
were sent out to hunt for elk and deer; but the meat
spoiled so quickly, even although smoked, in this damp
climate, that Joe Fields, William Bratton, Alec Willard,
George Gibson and Peter Wiser were ordered to the
seashore with kettles, to make salt.</p>

<p>They built a furnace or fireplace, of stones, and
boiled down kettlesful of salt water. They brought
back a gallon of good salt, for table use and for preserving
the meat. All winter the salt-makers were kept
at work. Peter served his turn.</p>

<p>The hunters were constantly out, chasing elk over
the bogs. The meat not eaten was salted and smoke-dried;
from the tallow, candles were run, in reed
moulds; and from the hides the men made shirts and
trousers and moccasins, in preparation for the next
journey. The captains determined that the whole party
should return by land, as soon as the travel season
opened. No ship was to be expected.</p>

<p>The captains led out exploring parties. Captain
Clark gained a great reputation as a shot; with a single
ball no larger than a pea he clipped off the heads of
geese and ducks.</p>

<p>“Kloshe musquet! Kum-tux musquet!” exclaimed
the Indians. “Very good musket! Do not understand
this kind of musket!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>Their own guns were rusty flint-locks, loaded with
poor powder and gravel. Their bows were beautiful
and true, but were not strong enough for killing elk.
They were not nearly so strong as the bows of the
Otoes and the Sioux, decided Peter; not nearly so
strong as his own Mandan bow.</p>

<p>The Indians from all around visited the fort. The
Chinooks, under Chief Com-com-ly, who had only one
eye (“Same as me,” chuckled Cruzatte), lived on the
north side of the bay; on this south side lived the Clatsops,
under Chief Co-bo-way. Nearer the sea lived
the Tilla-mooks. Up the Columbia River lived Cath-lam-ets.
These all looked much alike, being small,
ugly, and flat-footed and crooked-legged from squatting
so much in their canoes and by their fires.</p>

<p>They were well acquainted with white men. One
squaw had the name “J. Bowman” tattooed on her
arm. The captain spent much time talking with them,
and learned of the ships and the white traders who had
been in here.</p>

<p>“Tyee (chief) Haley; so many mast (and Chief
Com-com-ly held up three fingers); stay long.”</p>

<p>And——</p>

<p>“Callalamet; wood leg; trader.”</p>

<p>And——</p>

<p>“Tyee Davidson; three mast; hunt elk.”</p>

<p>And so forth, all of which the captains, particularly
Captain Lewis, carefully wrote down.</p>

<p>The visitors brought provisions and goods to trade:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
fish, a little elk and deer, high-crowned hats woven of
grass and bark, grass bowls that held water, so tight
they were; grass mats, furs. Some of the chiefs wore
splendid robes of sea-otter skin. These were priced
very dear, for the Indians were shrewd traders. They
wanted fish-hooks, knives, and files, in exchange for
ordinary articles; but only blue beads would buy the
otter-skin robes.</p>

<p>For one otter-skin robe Captain Clark offered a
watch, a handkerchief, a dollar, and a bunch of red
beads.</p>

<p>“No, no! Tyee ka-mo-suck!” refused the Indian.
“Chief beads.”</p>

<p>But Sa-ca-ja-we-a gave to the captain her own
girdle of blue “chief beads,” and for it he bought a
robe.</p>

<p>There were several new roots that the men grew to
like. One root, sha-na-taw-hee, was a thistle root,
purple after it had been roasted.</p>

<p>“Tastes like a parsnip, only swater,” declared Pat.</p>

<p>Another root was cul-whay-ma; two feet long and
slender. It also was sweet and wholesome. But the
best root was the wappatoo—“a rale Irish p’tatie,”
said Pat.</p>

<p>This was brought down by Skilloots and the Wah-ki-a-cums,
from up-river. It was a species of lily, and
grew in the lakes. The Indian women waded in, breast-deep,
and poking with their toes loosened the bulbs,
which rose then to the surface. That was cold work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>The wappatoo roots were held at a rather stiff
figure, because they could be traded to the other
Indians, if not to the white men.</p>

<p>The Clatsops were the best Indians. The Cath-lam-ets
were treacherous; one would have killed Hugh
McNeal had not a Chinook woman warned Hugh.
The Chinooks were thievish.</p>

<p>“No Chinook shall be admitted into the fort without
special invitation,” finally ordered Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>So after that when Indians appeared outside they
always shouted: “No Chinook. Clatsop.” Or “Skilloot,”
or whatever they chanced to be or pretended to
be. Another order was issued that no Indians should
remain in the fort over night.</p>

<p>The Indians brought many fleas, too—“the wan
thing for which we’ve nothin’ to trade,” as said Pat.</p>

<p>The greatest excitement of the winter was the
arrival of a whale. Chief Co-bo-way of the Clatsops
came with the news, and also with three dogs and some
blubber. He said that the whale had been stranded
ashore near the Tillamooks’ village down the coast.
He was given a pair of old satin breeches, and went
away much pleased.</p>

<p>Joe Fields and George Gibson appeared at the fort
with the gallon of salt from the salt camp, and with
some more of the whale blubber. They said that the
Indians all were flocking to the whale and cutting it up.
The blubber, when cooked, looked and tasted like beaver
tail—it was very good; and Captain Clark immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
organized a party to go to the spot and get what blubber
they might.</p>

<p>Naturally, everybody was anxious to see the whale.</p>

<p>“You’d better take Peter, hadn’t you, Captain?”
suggested Captain Lewis. “He’s a boy—he ought to
see what there is to be seen.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” agreed Captain Clark. “Do you
know what a whale is, Peter?”</p>

<p>“A big fish,” answered Peter, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes; a big warm-blooded fish; a fish bigger than
a buffalo.”</p>

<p>Now, Sa-ca-ja-we-a had heard; she had helped
Chaboneau cook the blubber for the captains. But she
had not been invited to go. In fact, all this time the
Bird-woman had not been even so far as the big water.
She had worked in the fort.</p>

<p>Suddenly she did a very surprising thing, for an
Indian woman. When she believed that she was to be
left out of the sightseeing party, she wept.</p>

<p>“Why you want to go?” scolded Chaboneau. “Ze
capitaines no haf time to wait for woman with baby.
You stay by ze lodge fire; dat is place for womans.”</p>

<p>Sa-ca-ja-we-a tilted her chin at him and went
straight to Captain Clark.</p>

<p>“Capitin! I speak a leetle.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Sa-ca-ja-we-a?”</p>

<p>“I come long way, capitin. I carry baby, I cold,
hungry, wet, seeck, I keep up an’ I no complain. I
show you trail; when you no know which way, I say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
‘Snake people here,’ an’ you find Snakes. When
Indians see me, dey say: ‘Dis no war party,’ an’ dey
kind to you. When you get hungry for bread, I gif
you one leetle bit I carry all way from Mandan town,
so you can taste. When you want otter robe, I gif you
my belt, an’ you get otter robe. I been here all dis
time, an’ I not yet go near de big water dat I travel
many days to see. Now dere is a big fish; odders go,
Chaboneau say I mus’ stay an’ care for Toussaint
an’ help cook. I feel bad, capitin—I—I——” and poor
little Bird-woman hid her face in her shawl and
sobbed.</p>

<p>The captain placed his hand kindly upon her
shoulder.</p>

<p>“You shall go, Sa-ca-ja-we-a. You shall go with
us and see the ocean and the big fish; and Chaboneau
can stay by the fire and tend to the baby.”</p>

<p>Sa-ca-ja-we-a smiled and dried her eyes. Very
proud, she made ready. But Chaboneau went, too—because
he, likewise, wished to inspect the great wonder
which had been cast ashore.</p>

<p>The whale was 105 feet long. The busy Indians
had stripped it to the bones, and with difficulty Captain
Clark managed to buy 300 pounds of blubber and
some oil.</p>

<p>Thus, with hunting, trading, and making garments
of leather, the winter passed. An astonishingly mild
winter it was, too, of little frost and wet snow, but of
much rain and fog which gave the men rheumatism,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
and which, by spoiling the food and cutting down exercise,
gave them boils and stomach complaint, also.</p>

<p>The captains were constantly hoping for a ship and
fresh supplies. None was sighted.</p>

<p>So February merged with March. The elk were
retiring from the low country to the high, following
the grass. On some days the fort had only one day’s
provisions in store.</p>

<p>“I can find no elk, notting,” complained Drouillard,
the chief hunter.</p>

<p>The Indians hoarded their own food very close, to
make it last until the salmon began to run again, in the
spring.</p>

<p>“Six blue blankets, wan red wan, five striped wans
that used to be our big United States flag, some old
breeches an’ waistcuts, an’ Cap’n Clark’s artillery dress-coat
an’ hat—faith, that’s all we’ve got an’ at prisent
prices they wouldn’t buy a square meal,” reported
Patrick Gass. “We’ll be atin’ ourselves naked.”</p>

<p>“Dose t’ings be need’ for boats an’ hosses,” said
Cruzatte. “Of de leetle t’ings we haf scarce one hat
full. How we go back four t’ousand miles I do not
know.”</p>

<small>FRIENDLY YELLEPT, THE WALLA WALLA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Drouillard,” spoke Captain Lewis, “we must
have another canoe. These Indians down here won’t
sell us any. Try what you can do up the river.”</p>

<p>It was the middle of March. The captains had intended
to wait until at least the first of April, before
starting on the back trail, so as not to arrive at the
mountains until June. Then the snows would have
melted, and there would be game. But meat already
was extremely scarce around Fort Clatsop; the expedition
would better start at once, and hunt along
the way.</p>

<p>“I try de Cath-lam-et—dey haf canoes,” answered
Drouillard. “But dey will hol’ dem dear. I t’ink I
must take de best t’ings we haf. Mebbe you let me
take your lace coat, capitaine?”</p>

<p>“What! My only dress uniform?” exclaimed Captain
Lewis. “Why not that artillery coat?”</p>

<p>“But that’s mine!” laughed Captain Clark.</p>

<p>“One day a Cath-lam-et see your lace coat an’ like
it. I sure I get canoe for it,” persisted Drouillard.</p>

<p>“All right,” sighed Captain Lewis. “Another canoe
we must have. I’ll hold councils in my leather
clothes.”</p>

<p>So the canny Drouillard, who was half Indian himself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
went up the Cath-lam-ets and traded the laced
dress-coat for a canoe.</p>

<p>Sergeant Pat was ordered to count the moccasins
in stock. He reported 338 pairs, manufactured during
the winter from the hides of the 131 elk and twenty
deer that had been killed.</p>

<p>To Chief Co-bo-way (or Com-mo-wool), of the
Clatsops, was given the fort and all its furniture. He
had been exceedingly friendly; and now he appeared
to appreciate the gift very much.</p>

<p>“I will make my home in the house where the
white chiefs lived,” he declared.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis and Captain Clark and several of
the men had long before carved their names into trees,
as a record for other white men to see. And there, on
a rock, also was “<span class="allsmcap">PETER</span>.” During the winter Peter
had made great progress in reading and writing. However,
something more official and explanatory than only
inscriptions on trees was needed, that the trading ships
which came in might know and might carry the news
to the world. Therefore the captains wrote out statements
containing the names of the party and maps of
the country explored. The notices said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The object of this list is, that through the medium
of some civilized person, who may see the same, it may
be made known to the world that the party consisting of
the persons whose names are hereunto affixed, and who
were sent out by the government of the United States to
explore the interior of the continent of North America,
did penetrate the same by the way of the Missouri and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
Columbia Rivers, to the discharge of the latter into the
Pacific Ocean, where they arrived on the 14th day of
November, 1805, and departed the 23rd day of March,
1806, on their return to the United States, by the same
route by which they had come out.</p></div>

<p>One copy was pasted up on a smooth post in the
headquarters cabin. Other copies were given to the
Clatsops and the Chinooks, who promised to hand them
to white traders.</p>

<p>“Sure, we’ll beat the news home,” asserted Sergeant
Pat. “For the ships’ll be a long time makin’ it, by
Chiny an’ the inds o’ the world, while it’s straight
across we go.”</p>

<p>And this proved truth. Had the captains only
known, at the very time the notices were being written,
the American trading brig Lydia, of Boston, Captain
Hill, was cruising along the coast, and in the first week
of April anchored in the mouth of the Columbia. But
the other Americans had been gone two weeks, and
Chief Coboway was ruler of Fort Clatsop. So Captain
Hill took one of the statements, carried it to China
with him, and delivered it at Boston not until May,
1807.</p>

<p>At 1 o’clock of March 23, this 1806, Fort Clatsop
was abandoned; out into the little river that flowed past
it the five canoes glided, and headed down for the
Columbia—thence eastward which was <em>homeward</em>!</p>

<p>The men swung their hats, of tattered felt, of furs,
and of Chinook weave from grass and bark; and
cheered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>“De nex’ winter we spen’ in de United States,”
rejoiced Cruzatte. “I play my feedle at Cahokia an’
make de pleasure dere.”</p>

<p>“We’ve come away with plenty powder and lead,
and plenty salt; that’s one good job,” remarked Pat.</p>

<p>The powder, sealed in lead canisters, had kept splendidly.
Now there were 140 pounds of it. And as to
salt—twelve gallons had been packed.</p>

<p>“It’s been not such a bad winter, after all, even if
we did have only six clear days in six months,” laughed
George Shannon. “Now we’ll soon be rid of our
rheumatism.”</p>

<p>Spring had arrived; for although the weather continued
wet and raw, wild fowl were feeding in the
ponds, the gooseberry and honeysuckle were leaving
forth in the parks, and the frogs were croaking in the
marshes. Many Indians were met; they were gathering
along the river, to wait for the salmon to run up from
the sea.</p>

<p>“Next full moon,” said the Indians. “No salmon
till next full moon.”</p>

<p>“The second of May, that is,” figured Captain
Lewis. “Well, we can’t wait. We’ll have to depend
on our guns; for if we wait, winter will overtake us
on the Missouri. Where there’s nothing to shoot, we
can live for a time on dogs and horses.”</p>

<p>The Indians seemed poor and starving. Captain
Clark was told of a large river emptying from the
south: the Multnomah, which is the Willamette. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
ascended it a short distance, and there found some of
the Neer-cho-ki-oo tribe. They refused to sell him any
wappatoo roots. But he tossed a match into a fire; it
blazed and frightened them. He placed a magnet on
his compass, and whirled the compass needle ’round
and ’round. The women and children crawled under
the bed-covers, and the men piled wappatoo roots at
his feet. The captain liked to do this sort of thing.</p>

<p>He returned from among the Multnomahs with
roots and five dogs.</p>

<p>The Indians were not all friendly, especially those
new tribes who had traveled to await the salmon. The
Clah-clel-lahs threw stones at the canoes, and stole
things; John Shields had to defend himself with his
hunting-knife. The Wah-clel-lahs stole the little black
Assiniboine dog. Captain Lewis, who was very fond
of the little dog, immediately sent Sergeant Pryor,
Drouillard and Hugh McNeal to get it even if they had
to shoot the thieves. The thieves ran off and left the
dog. And in the village of the Skilloots Captain Lewis
knocked down an Indian who was carrying off a valuable
piece of iron.</p>

<p>Among the Skilloots, here, quite a number of
articles were lost; so that Captain Lewis made a speech,
to say that he and his men were not afraid and were
able to burn the village if necessary to stop the thieving.</p>

<p>“Yessuh! Dese hyah Galloots’d better watch out,”
agreed York. “Marse Merne an’ Marse Will are offishurs
of the ’Nited States ahmy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>However, from the Skilloots ten horses were purchased
with blankets and Captain Clark’s artillery coat
and two kettles, and two more were borrowed. William
Bratton was too ill to walk, and rode one of the horses.
Nine others were loaded with the baggage, to take it
around the rapids. One horse was stolen, and Captain
Clark rode the twelfth up to the village of the
E-nee-shurs.</p>

<p>Three of the canoes were broken up for fuel.
The captains hoped soon to travel altogether by
horses; canoe work, against the current, was slow,
hard work.</p>

<p>“An amazin’ disagrayable people,” commented
Sergeant Pat, on the Skilloots. “But Twisted-hair and
his Pierced Noses’ll be gintlemen.”</p>

<p>The E-nee-shurs were no better in manners and
honesty. The horse Chaboneau was leading ran away,
and spilled his pack; an E-nee-shur made off with a
fine robe, and before it was returned Captain Lewis
had to utter more threats.</p>

<p>All in all, the trip up-river was very vexing, until,
finally having collected enough horses for the baggage,
so as to do without any canoes, the party arrived on
April 27 at the Walla Walla village where lived Chief
Yellept who last October had wanted them to stay
longer with him.</p>

<p>“We will visit you on our way back,” had promised
Captain Clark. Now here they were—and Chief Yellept
was glad indeed to see them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>He met them a few miles below the village.</p>

<p>“Come and stay with me three or four days,” he
said to the captains. “You shall have more horses,
and plenty food. I am wearing the little medal given
me from my white father; I hope that you will give
me a bigger one.”</p>

<p>The village was six miles above, opposite the mouth
of the Walla Walla River. Chief Yellept made good
his word. He called his people together, to tell them
that they must be hospitable to the white strangers;
and he set an example by bringing the captains an
armful of wood and a platter of three baked fish. Then
all the Walla Walla squaws busied themselves with
gathering wood for their guests. Dogs were offered
at reasonable prices.</p>

<p>“Dese Wallow-wallows ’mos’ like home folks,”
declared York.</p>

<p>Forsooth, it was difficult to get away from the
village, so friendly were Chief Yellept’s people. The
chief appeared to have taken a great fancy to the Red
Head, and presented him with a noble white horse.</p>

<p>“If the Red Head will give me a kettle, for my
lodge, I will be happy,” said Yellept.</p>

<p>Among the Walla Wallas there was a Snake Indian
prisoner, with whom Sa-ca-ja-we-a, much to her delight,
could talk in Sho-sho-ne; and the Snake could
translate for her the Walla Walla speech.</p>

<p>“Tell the Sho-sho-ne to tell Chief Yellept that we
have no kettles to give,” directed Captain Clark, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
little Bird-woman. “But we will be pleased to give
him something else.”</p>

<p>“Yellept say he take what you gif,” interpreted
Sa-ca-ja-we-a.</p>

<p>“He’s a fine fellow. You’ll have to give him your
sword, Will,” suggested Captain Lewis. “He’s been
wanting it, you know.”</p>

<p>“All right. Believe I’ll do it. I couldn’t transfer it
to better hands,” quoth Captain Clark. “That’s the
last of my official garb, Merne—and you haven’t much
left yourself!”</p>

<p>Chief Yellept’s eyes shone as he accepted the prized
“long knife”; and shone again when to it were added
powder and a hundred bullets for his gun. Now he
was a big chief, indeed.</p>

<p>The Bird-woman had spread the word that the
white chiefs were great workers in medicine: with
their magic box and their wonderful knowledge they
healed all sicknesses. Now to Captain Clark and Captain
Lewis the Walla Wallas brought broken arms,
stiff knees, and sore eyes, for treatment. The captains
did their best.</p>

<p>Not until the second morning, following a grand
dance by the Indians, at the camp, might the expedition
start onward. Chief Yellept had informed them of a
short cut, across country, from the mouth of the Walla
Walla River to the Pierced Nose country at the Kooskooskee;
a Skilloot, who had been guiding the expedition
by land, said that he knew the trail, and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
Pierced Nose who, with his family, was returning home
from a visit below, volunteered to help also; Chief
Yellept lent the captains two canoes, for crossing the
Columbia to the south side at the mouth of the Walla
Walla, where the new trail began.</p>

<p>“The most hospitable, honest and sincere Indians
we have met since leaving the United States, Merne,”
asserted Captain Clark, when they had been overtaken,
a day’s journey out, by three Walla Walla young men
who had hastened after to restore to them a beaver-trap
that had been forgotten.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVIII">XVIII<br />
<small>THE PIERCED NOSES AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“The white men are coming back! The white men
are coming!” sped the glad word among the Cho-pun-nish
or Pierced Noses, in their villages 100 miles
up, on the Kooskooskee. “They will make us well.”</p>

<p>And the white men were indeed coming, by the
trail from the Walla Walla, with the Snake Indian
prisoner and Sa-ca-ja-we-a as interpreters; with the
Skilloot and the three Walla Walla young men as
guides (for the Pierced Nose and family had taken
another trail); with some twenty horses, for the baggage,
and for William Bratton, and for the men who
had sore feet; and with the healing medicine box containing,
especially, the celebrated eye-water.</p>

<p>“Let us wance get the horses we left with Twisted-hair
an’ we’ll all ride, b’gorry,” quoth Sergeant Pat,
limping along.</p>

<p>“On ze Kamass Prairie dere will be plenty root,
plenty game,” rejoiced Chaboneau. “An’ mebbe dere
we rest, while leetle Toussaint get well.” For little
Toussaint seemed to be ailing.</p>

<p>First they were met, before reaching any village,
by an old friend, Chief We-ah-koo-nut, and ten warriors.
We-ah-koo-nut was called the Bighorn, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
he always wore, hanging from his left arm, the horn
of a mountain ram.</p>

<p>“We have heard that you were coming, and have
ridden to greet you,” said Bighorn. “The sight of
you makes our sore eyes well. We have no food for
you here, but to-morrow you will reach a lodge where
everything will be supplied.”</p>

<p>Before breakfast, in the morning, the lodge was
found, on the bank of the Lewis or Snake River; but
the families living there could supply only two dogs
and some root bread.</p>

<p>Next was met Chief Tetoh, or Sky—the honest
fellow who, with Twisted-hair, had helped the expedition
get through from the Kamass Prairie to the Timm
falls of the Columbia.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you. You are welcome,” exclaimed
Tetoh.</p>

<p>“Where is Chief Twisted-hair? We have come
to visit our friends, the Pierced Noses, again, and to
get our horses,” explained Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>“You must cross the Kin-oo-e-nim (Snake River),
here, and go to the Kooskooskee,” replied Chief Tetoh.
“There you will find the Twisted-hair, who has your
horses.”</p>

<p>So they crossed, in canoes lent to them by Tetoh,
and arrived at the Kooskooskee or Clearwater.</p>

<p>“Eye-water, eye-water,” begged the Indians. Captain
Clark traded a small bottle of the eye-water for a
gray mare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>“You’re the doctor, Will,” laughed Captain Lewis.
“From now on we’d better charge a fee. We’ll get
more meat that way than with our guns or goods.”</p>

<p>Accordingly Captain Clark, who handled the medicines,
exchanged his services for provisions. But the
Indians appeared to be very poor, and the “doctor’s”
fees in dogs and horses and roots did not amount to
much.</p>

<p>“Marse Will won’t nebber make a libbin’ at doctorin’,
dat’s suah,” finally admitted York, with a shake
of his head. “Anyhow, he ain’t killed anybody yet.”</p>

<p>Chief Twisted-hair’s village was up the Kooskooskee
some miles. Chief Sky, and another chief
named Cut-nose, rode along with the captains. When
questioned about the horses and the saddles, they would
give no straight answer; but——</p>

<p>“S’pose no get ’um horse, no get ’um saddle,” said
Sa-ca-ja-we-a.</p>

<p>“Why is that?”</p>

<p>“Sho-sho-ne say he hear saddles gone, horses
gone.”</p>

<p>That was alarming news.</p>

<p>“An’ Twisted-hair seemed like a fine gintleman,”
bemoaned Sergeant Pat.</p>

<p>“We can get more horses, can’t we, Pat?” queried
Peter. “We see lots of horses.”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ how’ll we buy ’em, when each man of
us is down to a couple o’ needles, a bit of thread an’ a
yard or so of ribbon, with a pinch o’ paint for an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
extry?” retorted Pat. “We’ll have to cut the buttons
off our clothes, I guess. Cross the mountains on foot
ag’in we won’t an’ can’t. They’re waist-deep in snow.”</p>

<p>For the mountains were looming ahead, white and
wintry, although this was May.</p>

<p>“The Twisted-hair,” announced Chief Sky, pointing
before. And Chief Twisted-hair, with six men,
met the procession.</p>

<p>Twisted-hair was not at all in a good humor. He
refused to shake hands, he scarcely noticed the captains,
and suddenly he and Cut-nose (a very ugly man
whose nose had been laid open by a Snake lance, in
battle) were quarreling in a loud voice.</p>

<p>“What’s this all about, Chaboneau?” demanded
Captain Lewis. “Ask Sa-ca-ja-we-a to have the Sho-sho-ne
interpret.”</p>

<p>“Ze Sho-sho-ne will not,” reported Chaboneau.
“He say dees is quarrel between two chiefs an’ he haf
no right to interfere.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go on a bit and camp and hold a council,
Will,” directed Captain Lewis to Captain Clark.
“Then we’ll get at the bottom of this business. There’s
evidently something wrong with the horses and saddles
we left.”</p>

<p>At camp the captains first smoked and talked with
Twisted-hair. He said it was true that the horses were
scattered, but Cut-nose and another chief, the Broken-arm,
were to blame. They had been jealous of him
because he had the white men’s horses; and being an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
old man, he had given up the horses. Some were near,
and some were at the village of the Broken-arm, a half-day’s
march east. As for the saddles, the cache had
fallen in and they might have been stolen, but he had
hidden them again.</p>

<p>Then the Cut-nose talked. He said that the Twisted-hair
was a bad old man, of two faces; that he had not
taken care of the horses but had let his young men
ride them, to hunt, until the Broken-arm, who was a
higher chief, and he, Cut-nose, had forbidden.</p>

<p>“It is not well that the chiefs quarrel,” reproved
Captain Lewis. “Only children quarrel. We will
take what horses there are here and we will go on to
the village of the Broken-arm, for the other horses.”</p>

<p>This seemed to satisfy everybody. Twisted-hair’s
young men brought in twenty-one of the forty-three
horses and half the saddles, besides some of the powder
and lead that had been buried, also. That night Cut-nose
and Twisted-hair slept together.</p>

<p>The Broken-arm and his Nez Percés lived in one
large straw-and-mud house 150 feet long. Over it was
flying the United States flag that had been given to
the nation on the way down last fall. Broken-arm
ordered a hide tent erected for the white chiefs; his
women hastened there with roots and fish; and when
the captains offered to trade a lean horse for a fat one
which might be killed, Broken-arm declined.</p>

<p>“When our guests come hungry, we do not sell
them food,” he declared. “We have many young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
horses. All those you see on these plains belong to me
and my people. Take what you need for food.”</p>

<p>“Niver before did we have the Injuns offer us
somethin’ for nothin’,” gasped Patrick Gass. “At laste,
niver before were we told to go help ourselves!”</p>

<p>“The Walla Wallas were as obliging. Don’t forget
the Walla Wallas, and Yellept,” reminded George
Shannon.</p>

<p>Two weeks were spent near the big house of the
Broken-arm, for whom another name was Black Eagle.
Captain Clark was appointed official doctor; he had
fifty patients at a time. Captain Lewis held a council,
and told the warriors about the United States. They
promised to make peace with the Sho-sho-nes. Labiche
killed a bear.</p>

<p>“These are great hunters. They kill the bear,
alone,” exclaimed the Pierced Noses.</p>

<p>Hunters were sent out every day, to get bear, and
deer, and elk—whatever they could. The other men
were sent out to trade for roots and fish.</p>

<p>Little Toussaint grew better. William Bratton
could not walk, but he was put into a hut of boughs and
blankets built over a hole in which there had been a
fire. Water was sprinkled into the hole. The hot
steam soaked William through and through. He was
then plunged into cold water, and sweated again in the
hut. This was Indian treatment, not white man’s.
And it cured Bratton, after even Doctor Red Head
had failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>Most of the saddles and all the horses except two
were delivered. These two, said Broken-arm, had been
stolen last fall by old Toby and his son on their way
back to Chief Ca-me-ah-wait. There now were sixty-five
horses on hand—enough for the baggage and for
the men. Everybody might ride. So much food had
been purchased, that buttons (as Pat had predicted)
were being traded in, and John Shields, blacksmith,
was making awls out of the links of a beaver-trap
chain.</p>

<p>“We must start on, or we won’t reach Fort Mandan
before winter,” announced Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>“No, no,” objected Twisted-hair and Sky, and all.
“Too much snow. Much water come down. The trail
over the mountains is not open. Wait till the next full
moon, and the snows will have melted.”</p>

<p>“The salmon will soon be running up the river.
Wait, and you shall have food,” said Cut-nose.</p>

<p>“If the white chiefs are hungry, let them kill and
eat my horses,” said Chief Ho-has-til-pilp, the Red
Wolf, with a wave of his arm.</p>

<p>“We thank the Red Wolf. But we shall need
guides. Will the chiefs send some young men with
us, to show us the way over the mountains?” asked
Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>“When there is grass for the horses, on the Road-to-the-Buffalo,
we will send young men,” promised
Chief Broken-arm. “But not until after the grand
council of all the Pierced Nose nation, on the Kamass<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
Prairie. In the summer we will all go to the buffalo
plains of the Missouri, if the white chiefs will protect
us from the Snakes and Pahkees.”</p>

<p>“Hold high the peace flag we have given you, and
it will turn your enemies into friends,” instructed
Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>The Grand Council was not to be held for two or
three weeks yet. By the close of the first week of June
the river had fallen six feet, showing that the snows
were partially melted. The captains decided to push
along without guides.</p>

<p>“We cannot wait till July and the full moon, boys,”
declared Captain Lewis, in an address to the company.
“It’s only 160 miles from the Kamass Prairie to our
old camp on the other side at Traveler’s Rest Creek,
and there we’ll be done with the snow. If no guides
overtake us, Drouillard and Labiche and some of the
rest of you are as good trailers as the Indians, and
can lead us through.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cheered all. They were as anxious
as the captains to go. They were in fine fettle. They
had been playing prisoner’s base, among themselves,
and had been running foot-races with the Nez Percés,
to harden their muscles. In the races only one Indian
had proved as fast as Peter and John Colter, the American
champions.</p>

<p>Now on June 10 camp was broken, and the march
to the mountains begun.</p>

<p>“Ten days’ll see us through,” confidently declared

<small>BACK ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Traveler’s Rest Creek, at last! But Pat’s “ten
days” had lengthened into twenty, for this was June 29.</p>

<p>There had been good reason. To be sure, the
Kamass Prairie had been found all abloom with the
kamass, so that the host of pale petals had made it look
like a lake. The wild roses were in flower; the ground
squirrels were busy, and supplied tender tidbits. But
when the company tried to climb they encountered
snow fifteen feet deep, covering the grass and the
trail, and the air was that of winter. Game was very
scarce.</p>

<p>The captains shook their heads, and called a council
of the company.</p>

<p>“We can’t go on in this fashion, men,” said Captain
Lewis. “Already we’re short of food, and so are
the horses. Even if we knew the trail, and could travel
at our best, we’ve four days yet until we reach grass
on the other side. If we lost the trail, in the snow,
we’d be lost, too. So Captain Clark and I have decided
that we all must return to the Kamass Prairie, kill more
meat, and see if the Nez Percés won’t furnish us with
guides. The snow holds the horses up, and with experienced
guides we can make good time. Failing of
guides, we’ll try again, anyway—sending our best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
woodsmen ahead to note the marks on the trees and to
blaze the trail. But first, Drouillard and Shannon will
start back immediately, to the Nez Percé grand council,
which is now in session, and offer two guns for some
guides. They’ll join us on the prairie.”</p>

<p>This sounded sensible, although everybody did hate
to retrace steps. The going down, amidst snow-hidden
rocks and timber, was cruel work.</p>

<p>Drouillard and George Shannon were gone for
almost a week. When they reappeared they brought
three young Nez Percés warriors as guides. Then a
quick trip was made. The first day out the guides set
fire to the timber, in order, they said, to “make fair
weather.” They led rapidly. They never missed the
trail. Whenever the snow thinned, in spots, there,
underfoot, was the trail, plain to be seen—the great
Nez Percé Road-to-the-Buffalo, from the west of the
mountains to the east. Even Drouillard and Sa-ca-ja-we-a
exclaimed with approval of such accurate
guiding.</p>

<p>All the old camps of the fall before were passed.
The Hungry Creek camp, where Captain Clark had
left the horse hung up, and where Peter and Reuben
Fields had supped on the horse’s head; the camp of
September 17, from which Captain Clark had set out
ahead to find the Nez Percés; the camp of September
16, where the spotted colt was killed; the camp of
September 14, where the black colt was killed.</p>

<p>“Sure, I’m glad we’re goin’ the other way,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
Pat. “I’ve no pleasant recollections of the
first trip, when we were afoot an’ starvin’.”</p>

<p>And the other men agreed with him.</p>

<p>On the fifth day the mountains had been crossed.
On the sixth day the snow had ceased, and the head
of Traveler’s Rest Creek was reached. On the next
day, June 30, they hastened down the creek, and soon
were camped again at its mouth—the camping spot of
September 11, before!</p>

<p>“Here we are, back in the Missouri country, boys,”
cheered Captain Clark. “We’ve been clear through to
the Pacific and not lost a man!”</p>

<p>“An’ nebber killed an Injun,” added York. “But
we mighty nigh had to.”</p>

<p>“May have a fight yet,” quoth George Gibson.
“We ought to have met some of the Oo-tla-shoots
hereabouts. The guides are afraid to go on. They
claim their friends have been wiped out by the Pahkees
or Blackfeet.”</p>

<p>“Dey much ’fraid,” spoke Drouillard. “Dey see
de tracks of two Injuns barefoot.”</p>

<p>As Peter himself knew, Indians who were barefoot
were likely to be Indians in distress.</p>

<p>However, the captains did not appear to be alarmed.
The news was spread that the company were to be
divided. Captain Clark and party were to travel southward,
along this, the east side of the mountains, get
the canoes and other stuff where they had been hidden
at the first meeting place with Chief Ca-me-ah-wait’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
Sho-sho-nes. Then half the party, under Sergeant
Ordway, were to descend the Jefferson, from there,
with the canoes and other stuff, into the main Missouri
and on to the White-bear Islands camp at the Great
Falls.</p>

<p>The other half of the party, under Captain Clark,
were to cross eastward, by land, to the Yellowstone
River, and descend that to its mouth in the Missouri.</p>

<p>The Captain Lewis party were to continue eastward
from this present camp on Traveler’s Rest Creek,
and try to follow the Pierced Nose Road-to-the-Buffalo
to the Great Falls of the Missouri; there they were to
meet Sergeant Ordway, and at the mouth of the Yellowstone
they all were to meet Captain Clark.</p>

<p>Now, with which party did Peter wish to go? The
Captain Clark trip sounded very interesting—down
that Yellowstone River, where no white men had been.
Sa-ca-ja-we-a was to guide him, too, across country.
But the Captain Lewis trip also sounded interesting—all
by land, through another unknown country, to the
wonderful falls again. On this trip there would be
good hunting—and possibly the Blackfeet Indians.</p>

<p>The Sergeant Ordway trip sounded the least interesting,
for it meant merely floating down the same
rivers that they had toiled up.</p>

<p>However, Peter was a soldier and had no choice.
So he waited anxiously while the captains made their
selections. It was like choosing sides in the game of
prisoner’s base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>For Captain Clark: Sergeant Ordway, Sergeant
Nat Pryor, John Shields, George Shannon, William
Bratton, Dick Windsor, George Gibson, Hugh Hall,
Francois Labiche, John Colter, the fast runner, John
Collins, Tom Howard, John Potts, Baptiste Lepage,
Alex Willard, Joe Whitehouse, Peter Wiser, Old
Cruzatte, York, Chaboneau, and the Bird-woman.</p>

<p>For Captain Lewis: Sergeant Pat, Joe Fields and
Reuben Fields, Drouillard, the hunter, William Werner,
Rob Frazier, Hugh McNeal, John Thompson and Si
Goodrich.</p>

<p>Then where was Peter? Nobody seemed to want
him. But Sergeant Pat made a scrape and a salute.</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, sorr,” to Captain Lewis; “but
are we to lave Peter here till we come ag’in?”</p>

<p>“’Pon my word!” exclaimed the captain. “No!
He’s to come along with us, of course. He’s in your
charge, Pat, remember.”</p>

<p>“Yis, sorr. Thank ye, sorr,” answered Pat.</p>

<p>And Peter was glad.</p>

<p>So the parties separated, Captain Clark to the
south, and the place where the canoes and goods had
been left last August; Captain Lewis to the east and
the Great Falls.</p>

<p>“Good luck, boys,” was the final word. “We’ll
all meet at the Missouri. Then down we’ll go, for
home.”</p>

<p>The Pierced Noses who had guided across the
mountains went with Captain Lewis a short distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
still, to show him the shortest route along the Road-to-the-Buffalo.
Before they quit, in order to look for
their friends the Oo-tla-shoots or Flat-heads, the captain
gave them presents of meat, and exchanged names
with the leader, who was a young chief.</p>

<p>The young chief was henceforth to be known as
the Long Knife, and Captain Lewis was to be known
as Yo-me-kol-lick, or White Bear-skin Unfolded.</p>

<p>It proved to be only nine days’ travel to the White-bear
Islands camp at the head of the Falls of the
Missouri, and during all the way not an Indian was
sighted, although fresh sign was discovered—“Blackfeet!”
asserted Drouillard. “De Gros-ventres of de
Prairie.”</p>

<p>“Those Big-bellies must be bad Injuns, I’m thinkin’,
by the way everywan’s afraid of ’em,” said Pat.</p>

<p>“Very bad,” asserted Peter. For even the Otoes
of the south feared the northern “Gros-ventres” as
much as they did the Sioux.</p>

<p>There had been plenty of buffalo, bellowing all the
nights; but there had been a tremendous amount of
mosquitoes, too, which bit so that even the little black
dog howled with pain.</p>

<p>Now, here at the old camp were the “white bears,”
as pugnacious as before. One treed Hugh McNeal and
kept him treed near half a day, after Hugh had broken
his gun over the bear’s head.</p>

<p>Nobody had disturbed the articles that had been
left here last summer. Some things had spoiled from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
dampness; but the frame of the iron canoe was all
right, and so were the cottonwood wagon-wheels.</p>

<p>“Gass, I’m going to leave you in charge, here,”
said the captain. “You will wait till the Ordway party
come with the canoes; then you will move the canoes
and baggage, by the portage trail, to the foot of the
falls, and proceed on down the river. I shall take
Drouillard and the two Fields, scout northward and
strike the Maria’s River, which I wish to follow down
to the Missouri. I will meet you at the mouth of the
Maria’s River on the fifth day of August—if all goes
well.”</p>

<p>“Sure, Cap’n, do ye think three men’ll be enough
for ye?” blurted Pat. “Ye’re goin’ up where the
bloody Big Bellies live. Give me Peter alone, an’ take
the rist. Peter an’ I are plenty for this camp, till
Ordway comes.”</p>

<p>“With Drouillard and the two Fields I’ll stand
off the Blackfeet,” laughed Captain Lewis. “Eh,
lads?” And he sobered. “If my life is spared, Pat,
I’ll meet you on August 5. But if you don’t hear from
us, you wait till the first day of September. Then
if there’s no word, you will proceed on to Captain
Clark at the mouth of the Yellowstone. Tell him that
my directions as commanding officer are for him to
carry out our program and return to the United States,
for I and my party have been destroyed. He already
knows that I have planned this side trip to the Maria’s.”</p>

<p>Pat saluted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>“Yis, sorr. An’, sorr (his voice was husky), I
hope to meet ye safe an’ sound at the mouth o’ the
Maria’s.”</p>

<p>The next morning, which was July 16, the captain
took Drouillard, and the two Fields, and six horses,
and rode away, for the upper Maria’s River in the
country of the Gros-ventres of the Prairie.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” spoke Pat; “we’re now siven men
an’ four hosses, an’ we’d better be busy fixin’ the carts
an’ trainin’ the hosses to drag ’em, ferninst the day
when Ordway arrives with the canoes. I’ve no fancy
for playin’ hoss myself, when we’ve got the rale
animals.”</p>

<p>Nothing especial happened, except the mosquitoes,
until the arrival of Sergeant Ordway and party. One
trip was made to the lower end of the portage, to examine
the white pirogue, and the caches; they all were
safe. Harness was manufactured, out of elk hide, for
attaching the horses to the wagons.</p>

<p>Sergeant Ordway appeared at three o’clock in the
afternoon of July 19. He had with him Colter,
Cruzatte, Collins, Potts, Lepage, Howard, Willard,
Whitehouse, and Peter Wiser; the six canoes that had
been sunk in the Jefferson River, and most of the goods
that had been buried in the cache, when last August
the company under Captain Lewis had set out to follow
Chief Ca-me-ah-wait to the Sho-sho-ne camp on
the other side of the pass. Nothing had been stolen
or injured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>The Sergeant Ordway party had separated from
Captain Clark and party at the Three Forks, and had
come on down without adventure. The captain probably
was now on his way down the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>“An’ how were Sa-ca-ja-we-a an’ the little spalpeen?”
asked Pat.</p>

<p>“Fine and hearty. The Bird-woman said she knew
the way to the Yellowstone. She’d been all through
that country, when the Sho-sho-nes hunted the buffalo.”</p>

<p>When the canoes were loaded upon the carts, the
horses pulled very well, for buffalo-horses; but, just
as a year ago, the rain and the mud interfered, the
carts broke; besides, Pat was taken ill; so that five
days were required for carrying canoes and baggage
around the series of falls, to the old Portage Creek
camp at the lower end.</p>

<p>One canoe was worthless, but the others were placed
in the water; so was the white pirogue; the blunderbuss
or swivel cannon was unearthed and mounted in
its bows, as before.</p>

<p>“Faith, we’re gettin’ all our plunder together,
wance ag’in,” congratulated Pat. “An’ there’s more
of it, an’ the red pirogue, remember, at the mouth o’
the Maria’s, where we’re to meet Cap’n Lewis. Do
you be takin’ the canoes down, Ordway, an’ Peter an’
I’ll ride by land with the hosses.”</p>

<p>The mouth of the Maria’s was not far—fifty miles
by river, according to Pat’s journal, written on the way
up, but less by land. The Maria’s, as Peter recalled,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
was the fork of the Missouri where camp had been
made while the captains debated which route led to
the Columbia. Captain Lewis had explored up the
Maria’s and he and Captain Clark had decided that
the other fork was the right channel—the “true”
Missouri.</p>

<p>Peter and Pat covered thirty miles this first day.
They saw thousands of buffalo, and a pack of wolves
chasing an antelope. Pat shot an antelope, with his
rifle, and Peter killed a buffalo with his arrows; the
next morning they killed, together, six antelope and
seven buffalo—which was all the meat that they could
pack, although, as declared Pat, they might have killed
a hundred.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon they came in sight of the mouth
of the Maria’s. Sergeant Ordway’s party with the
canoes already were there, and ashore.</p>

<p>“An’ ain’t that Drouillard, too?” exclaimed Pat.
“Yis! An’ the cap’n, b’gorry! An’ the two Fieldses!
Somethin’ must have fetched ’em back in a hurry.
’Tis only July 28; they’re a week ahead o’ time.”</p>

<p>He quickened his horse into a trot, and leading
each a horse packed high with meat and hides, he and
Peter hastened forward to learn the news.</p>

<small>CAPTAIN LEWIS MEETS THE ENEMY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The party seemed to be overhauling the cache here
as if in a great hurry to go on; but the captain waved
greeting, and Joe Fields straightened up, to grin.</p>

<p>“Yez got back mighty quick,” accused Pat. “Didn’t
yez go? An’ where are the hosses?”</p>

<p>“Sure we went,” retorted Joe. “Hosses? We’ve
turned ’em loose, of course; and you’ll be turnin’ yours
loose, too, in a minute. So tumble off and I’ll help you
unpack. There’s no time to waste. You ought to’ve
been along, Pat. We had a beautiful brush with the
Injuns.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell yez?” reminded Pat. “Annywan
hurt?”</p>

<p>“None of us. We wiped two of them out, though—and
a ball cut the captain’s ha’r. ’Twas this way,”
continued Joe, as he tugged at a rope end, to release
the pack of meat: “On the fust day, ’fore we’d gone
more’n twenty mile from the falls, we struck Injun
sign in shape of a wounded-buffler trail; and after that
we kept guard all night, for fear of our hosses. When
we got to the Maria’s we turned down, after scoutin’
’round a bit. Found a lot of old Injun lodges, but
didn’t see any Injuns till the 26th. Then the cap’n
sighted a bunch o’ hosses, thirty of ’em, through his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
spy-glass—and next several Injuns, on a hill, lookin’
at Drouillard, who was across the river.</p>

<p>“’Bout half the hosses were saddled, which meant
more Injuns somewhere near. Our hosses were too
tuckered to run far, and of course we couldn’t leave
Drouillard; so the cap’n said: ‘We’ll go right on to those
Injuns, boys; put on a bold front, and we’ll have it out
with ’em. Don’t let ’em think we’re afraid. They
may not be the Gros-vent’s.’ When the Injuns fust
saw us comin’, they acted like they were more afraid
of us than we were of them. But we finally got together,
the cap’n made the peace sign, and told ’em our
other man had the pipe and after he’d come in we’d
smoke. So Reub and one of the Injuns went after
Drouillard.</p>

<p>“There were only eight of ’em. They were the
Big-bellies, all right, but they had nothin’ except two
guns, and clubs and bows and arrers. We thought we
could take care of ourselves; and that night we all
camped together. The cap’n told us in case of trouble
to stick up and keep together and save the baggage.</p>

<p>“We slept in the same lodge with ’em. The cap’n
had given three of ’em a flag and a medal and a handkerchief;
but he put Reub on guard for the night, and
told him to watch sharp and wake us quick, so’s to
look after the hosses, if the Injuns tried to sneak out.
He and Drouillard lay down with the Injuns, and Reub
and I stayed at the fire in the lodge entrance.</p>

<p>“I went to sleep. Just at sunrise I woke up with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
jump. Reub had yelled—and there was an Injun runnin’
off with my gun and his, and Reub in chase.
Drouillard was up and yellin’, too—‘Let go my gun!
Let go my gun!’ he bawled, and I see him wrestlin’
with another Injun, and the cap’n aimin’ at another
with his pistol. But I had to have my gun, so I ran
after Reub and the fust Injun. Before I got there,
Reub had caught him and knifed him, and had both
guns. Drouillard had his gun by this time, and all the
Injuns came pourin’ out of the lodge, makin’ for the
hosses, with the cap’n and his pistol followin’ the third
Injun.</p>

<p>“We drew a bead on the fellow, but he dropped the
cap’n’s gun, and the cap’n wouldn’t let us shoot. ‘Look
out for those other rascals!’ he ordered. ‘They’re trying
to drive off the hosses!’ So Reub and Drouillard
and I ran after six who were roundin’ up the most of
the hosses; and the cap’n set out after his Injun and
another who were drivin’ away a bunch. He made
’em leave twelve, but they kept on, with his hoss, and
that he was bound to get. He didn’t have his bullet
pouch or his hat; and when they were just ’bout to
disappear in a little gully he told ’em to surrender the
hoss or he’d fire. With that they turned on him, and
fire he did, downin’ one of ’em slick as a whistle, but
the fellow had life enough to fire back an’ sent a ball
through the cap’n’s ha’r.</p>

<p>“The cap’n had only his pistol, now, so he quit,
and the other Injun made off with the hoss. Drouillard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
had turned back to help the cap’n, but Reub and I
follered our Injuns till we got four of our own critters,
and then we let the rest go. Didn’t matter, ’cause there
were the twelve left by the Injuns, so we’d come out
ahead in the little game. Besides, we had the lodge,
four shields, two bows and quivers, and a gun. Likewise
the flag we’d given, and the medal—but we left
the medal on the neck of the Injun Reub had killed, so
as to show what kind of people we were.</p>

<p>“Well, we didn’t hang ’round there long, you bet.
The Injuns had said the main band was only a day
and a half away, and when the cap’n had invited ’em
to bring their chiefs to council he of course told ’em
where our camp was—at the mouth of the Maria’s.
Now we were desperate afraid the Injuns’d out-foot
us and attack you-all at the river. We took four best
horses, and only what meat we could carry, rode a
hundred miles, with an hour and a half of rest, camped
at two in the mornin’, then rode another twenty miles
and struck Ordway comin’ down with the canoes. We
got aboard and here we are—and the cap’n is in a
powerful hurry to join Cap’n Clark below.”</p>

<p>That was true; for, as said Drouillard: “Dose
Blackfeet now will hold all white men as enemies.”</p>

<p>This cache had caved in, and much of the supplies
had spoiled. The red pirogue also was found to be
worthless, except for its spikes. Captain Lewis hustled
the work of loading, the rest of the horses were turned
loose, and down the river again voyaged all. Sergeant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
Ordway was in charge of the five canoes, Sergeant Pat
and squad had charge of the white pirogue, which was
the flagship.</p>

<p>A sharp lookout was kept for the Big Bellies on
the banks. However, nothing happened. The mouth
of the Yellowstone was several days ahead; and when
it was reached, no Captain Clark or others of that party
appeared in sight. When halt was made, to look for
sign, traces of the captain’s camp were found, and in
the sand Lepage discovered the scrawl:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>W. C. a few miles further down on right hand side.</p>
</div>

<p>“When was that written, Lepage, do you think?”
queried Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>“Mebbe two, mebbe t’ree day ago,” said Baptiste.
“De rain haf washed it.”</p>

<p>“At any rate, he’s safe,” uttered the captain, with
much satisfaction. “I expect the mosquitoes drove him
out of here. Whew!” For the mosquitoes were worse
than ever. “We’ll overtake him to-morrow.”</p>

<p>But they did not overtake the captain’s party on the
morrow, nor on the next day. On the third day, which
was August 11, the canoes stopped to take aboard some
meat; the white pirogue continued on, until Captain
Lewis espied a herd of elk in some willow brush, near
the shore.</p>

<p>“Turn in, boys,” he bade. “Wait here. Come on,
Cruzatte. We’ll get a few of those fellows.”</p>

<p>Out he leaped, gun in hand; and he and One-eyed
Cruzatte disappeared in the brush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>“Faith, let’s hope there aren’t Injuns there, too,”
quoth Sergeant Pat. “It’s a likely place for an
ambush.”</p>

<p>“Hardly stands to reason there’d be elk whar there
are Injuns,” remarked Alec Willard.</p>

<p>Everybody waited anxiously; gazed and listened.
Two rifle-shots were heard, distant.</p>

<p>“There’s meat, I reckon,” said Alec.</p>

<p>Presently another shot; and in about ten minutes
out from the willow brush and to the sandy shore
burst Captain Lewis. He was running, limping, staggering—he’d
been wounded—the left thigh of his
leather breeches was stained red!</p>

<p>“To your arms, boys!” cried Sergeant Pat.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis staggered on, to the white pirogue.</p>

<p>“I’ve been shot, men,” he panted. “Not mortally,
I think. Indians are in that thicket. Cruzatte is somewhere
there, too.”</p>

<p>“Did you see any Injuns, cap’n?”</p>

<p>“No; the ball came from ambush, just as I was
aiming at an elk. Gass, take the men and follow me.
We must rescue Cruzatte. I’d lost sight of him.”</p>

<p>“Willard, you and the two Fields,” roared Pat,
springing into the shallows. “The bloody Big-bellies
ag’in!”</p>

<p>But Peter went also, with his bow and arrows.
Nobody objected. The captain led on for about one
hundred steps, when his leg gave out and he almost fell.</p>

<p>“I can’t travel,” he gasped. “I’ll return to the boat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
If you’re overpowered, Sergeant, keep your men together
and retreat in good order, and we’ll fight from
the river.”</p>

<p>“Yis, sorr.” And Pat gallantly plunged ahead,
into the brush. “Kentucky an the Irish ag’in the redskins,
lads,” he cheered. “But mind your eyes.”</p>

<p>This was exciting. The willows were thick—good
hiding-place. Where was Cruzatte—poor old Cruzatte
with the one eye? Peter stuck close behind Pat. His
nostrils were wide, his eyes roved, his every sense was
on the alert. He was Oto once more. Now was heard
a crashing, before. Elk? Indian? Hah!</p>

<p>“That’s a mighty quare sort o’ Injun, to be makin’
all that noise,” muttered Pat, peering, his rifle advanced
at a ready.</p>

<p>And through a little open space here came Cruzatte!
He was striding along, with stained hands, his rifle on
his shoulder, making for the boats and plainly much
satisfied with himself.</p>

<p>“Hist!” said Pat. “Cruzatte! ’Asy now.”</p>

<p>Cruzatte started, and crouched.</p>

<p>“Have ye seen Injuns?”</p>

<p>“Non,” answered Cruzatte. “I shoot one elk,
follow ’nodder.”</p>

<p>“Come back to the boats with us, an’ step lively,”
ordered Pat. “There be Injuns ’round. They shot the
cap’n in the leg.”</p>

<p>“My gracious!” stammered Cruzatte. “But I see
no sign.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>“Nayther do we. Sure, it’s powerful suspicious,”
muttered Pat.</p>

<p>They found the captain all prepared to defend himself
in the pirogue. He had laid out his rifle, pistol
and pike, and was propped behind the air-gun that
could shoot forty times.</p>

<p>“What did you discover?” he challenged.</p>

<p>“Not a thing, sorr,” reported Pat. “An’ Cruzatte,
here, knows no more about the Injuns than the rist
of us.”</p>

<p>“Where have you been, Cruzatte?”</p>

<p>“I shoot wan elk, same time you shoot. Den I see
nodder in brush, I shoot at heem, he vaneesh an’ I try
to find heem, but he get away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you did! How much of him did you see when
you shot?”</p>

<p>“B’gorry, you shot the cap’n!” bellowed Sergeant
Pat. “That’s what you did. Ye’re blind as a mole!
B’gorry, you shot the cap’n—ye shot your commandin’
officer, an’ by that ye’re to be coortmartialed an’ shot
yourself!”</p>

<p>“Non, non!” wailed old Cruzatte, wringing his
hands. “I no mean to shoot heem. I see wan leetle
brown spot in brush—look jus’ like wan elk-fur, long
way off; I take aim, bang!—I t’ink I see elk run, an’ I
run to ketch heem. I no mean to shoot my capitaine.
It wan grand mistake.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear me call?” demanded the captain.
“I suspected maybe that ball came from your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
rifle and I hallooed as loud as I could. Why, by the
shock you couldn’t have been more than forty paces!”</p>

<p>“I hear notting. I hear not one word,” protested
Cruzatte.</p>

<p>“The ball coming from so close, and you not
answering, I of course thought of Indians,” continued
the captain.</p>

<p>“B’gorry, give me wan chance at him an’ I’ll close
his other eye,” besought Pat; and all the men murmured
angrily, while poor Cruzatte shivered with
fright.</p>

<p>“I no mean to shoot my capitaine,” he babbled.</p>

<p>“Never mind, men,” said the captain. “It was an
error. My leather breeches are just the shade of an
elk hide, remember. Let’s dress the wound. I doubt
if it’s serious.”</p>

<p>The ball had passed clear through his left thigh,
and had furrowed the right; but it seemed not to have
touched the bone or any artery. After the wounds had
been dressed and lint stuffed into the holes, the canoes
with the other elk hunters arrived; and not waiting to
explain much the captain insisted upon them all pushing
along, to catch up with Captain Clark.</p>

<p>Now that he himself was laid up, this was more
necessary than before. All he could do was to rest,
half sitting, in the stern of the white pirogue. His leg
had so stiffened that he could scarcely move it.</p>

<small>THE HOME STRETCH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Captain Clark was safe and well, with all his
men, and only a short distance down river! This was
learned the next day from two white trappers—the first
Americans met in over a year. Their names were
Hancock and Dickson. They had left Illinois, of
the United States, in the summer of 1804, and had
been trapping in the upper Missouri country ever
since.</p>

<p>They said that Captain Clark’s party had passed
them yesterday, but had lost all the horses, by Indians,
and were traveling in two wooden canoes and two hide
canoes. The captain had the idea that Captain Lewis
and party were ahead of him.</p>

<p>Trappers Hancock and Dickson had other news,
also. They had seen the barge, under Corporal Warfington,
on its way from Fort Mandan, last summer,
to St. Louis. All aboard were well. Brave Raven,
the Arikara chief, was there, bound for Washington;
and so were several Yankton Sioux chiefs, with old
Pierre Dorion. But the Mandans and Minnetarees
were at war with the Arikaras; and the Mandans and
the Assiniboines were at war, too; and the Sioux were
“bad.” So that the peace talks by the captains had
not buried the hatchet very deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<p>Anyway, soon after noon, this day, Captain Clark’s
camp was sighted, before.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter here?” demanded Captain
Clark, the instant that the pirogue grounded. He saw
Captain Lewis lying in the stern.</p>

<p>“Nothing serious, Will. Merely a gun wound, in
the thigh. Cruzatte shot me by accident.”</p>

<p>“De capitin shot!” cried Sa-ca-ja-we-a, running to
him.</p>

<p>“I not mean to,” repeated Cruzatte, still in much
distress. “I t’ink I see one elk in brush.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Cruzatte,” consoled Captain
Lewis.</p>

<p>Yes, Captain Clark’s party all were here, so that
the whole company were united again. The captain
had had a successful trip down the Yellowstone. The
Bird-woman (who now was applying some Indian salve
to Captain Lewis’s wound) had proved a valuable guide
across country. Captain Clark was emphatic in his
praise of her. George Gibson had fallen on a sharp
piece of timber and driven it two inches into his thigh.
Indians had early stolen twenty-four horses, and had
left only a worn-out moccasin in exchange. Labiche
had trailed them, but had been obliged to give up.</p>

<p>The Yellowstone was a fine stream, with many
beaver, and many bear. At the Missouri the mosquitoes
had been so pestiferous that only brief camps
could be made. Little Toussaint was bitten so severely
that his eyes were puffed shut, and the mosquitoes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
settled so thickly on the captain’s gun-barrel as to prevent
his taking aim!</p>

<p>“We achieved one important thing,” laughed the
captain. “We named a river for York!”</p>

<p>“Yessuh!” gabbled York. “Yessuh! Dar’s a
ribber up yahnduh ’long de Yallerstone named foh me:
Yawk’s Dry Ribber.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Pryor, George Shannon, Hugh Hall and
Dick Windsor had been detailed to drive the remaining
fifty horses overland to the Mandan town; but the first
night, Indians had stolen every one of these, also, and
the squad were obliged to turn back. On the way,
while the sergeant was asleep in camp a wolf had bitten
him through the hand, and had tried to seize Dick, but
George Shannon had shot just in time. Back again at
the Yellowstone they had manufactured two round
canoes, like Mandan canoes, from buffalo hides
stretched over basketry, with hoops as top and bottom.
In these they had finally caught up with Captain Clark.</p>

<p>“You’re in command now, Will,” said Captain
Lewis. “I can’t do much—I can’t even write the
records. But we’re in the home stretch. Let’s push on
as fast as we can.”</p>

<p>The two free-trappers, Hancock and Dickson, came
down in their canoe to go with the company as far as
the Mandan town.</p>

<p>“Sure, we’ll be there in a jiffy,” proclaimed Sergeant
Pat. “’Tis wonderful good fortune we’ve had—clane
across to the Paycific an’ nigh home ag’in, an’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
only wan man lost an’ nobody bad hurt but the cap’n.”</p>

<p>Now Sa-ca-ja-we-a, the Bird-woman, was much
excited; for she was near home, too. The first day
eighty-six miles were covered. The next day, in the
morning, they arrived once more at the Minnetaree
village, and the village of the Mandans opposite.</p>

<p>“Boom!” signaled the blunderbuss. And then
again, and again. The Minnetarees, the Ah-na-ha-ways
or Wassoons, and the Mandans flocked to the
river banks.</p>

<p>“Our white fathers are back!” they cried, one to
another.</p>

<p>The Indians seemed delighted. It was a great
triumph—it really was like getting home. Sa-ca-ja-we-a
hardly could wait for the boats to land. Landing
was made among the Ah-na-ha-ways, but headquarters
were immediately established among Chief Black Cat’s
Mandans. The Bird-woman, carrying little Toussaint,
proudly accompanied Chaboneau to the Minnetarees—which
was <em>her</em> village—to invite them to council with
the white chiefs. Drouillard was sent down to get
Jessaume and Big White.</p>

<p>Captain Clark held a council in the Black Cat’s
village. He invited the chiefs to go with him to Washington,
and call on the great white father. Black Cat
and Le Borgne, the one-eyed Minnetaree head chief,
and old Cherry-on-a-Bush and others answered. They
said that the Sioux would kill any of them who ventured
down the river. The captain answered that all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
would be protected against the bad Sioux, and would
return safe, escorted by United States warriors and
loaded with presents.</p>

<p>At last Big White agreed to take his wife and child
and accompany the Red Head and the Long Knife.</p>

<p>So much corn was brought to the boats that it all
could not be loaded. Captain Clark presented the
swivel cannon to the Minnetarees.</p>

<p>“With this big gun we have announced the great
white father’s peace words to his red children, all the
way up the Missouri,” he said, to Le Borgne. “Whenever
it is fired, it will remind you of these good words,
and you will think upon them, and live at peace with
your neighbors.”</p>

<p>“My ears will always be open to the words of the
great white father,” promised One-eyed.</p>

<p>Then the cannon was discharged, and the Minnetarees,
much pleased, bore it into their village.</p>

<p>The start was to be made the next day. But John
Colter was not going. He had asked permission to
turn back, up the Missouri again, with the two trappers,
Hancock and Dickson, to hunt the beaver. And Sa-ca-ja-we-a
and Chaboneau were not going. The Bird-woman
wished to go—she wished to go on with the
Red Head, to the country of the white people, and
learn more of their ways. Captain Clark offered to
take her and little Toussaint and Chaboneau, and put
little Toussaint at school when he grew up. However,
Chaboneau shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>“I t’ank you, capitaine,” he replied. “But in San
Loui’ I haf no ’quaintance, I would haf no means of
makin’ my support. I mus’ stay here, where I am
known.”</p>

<p>So everybody bid goodby to John Colter, to Chaboneau,
Sa-ca-ja-we-a, and little Toussaint, now nineteen
months old.</p>

<p>“Good luck!” to John.</p>

<p>Five hundred dollars in wages, and the blacksmith
tools, to Chaboneau.</p>

<p>To Sa-ca-ja-we-a the captains said:</p>

<p>“The nation of the United States will not forget
Sa-ca-ja-we-a, the Bird-woman, who never complained,
who carried her baby clear to the Pacific Ocean, who
made friends for us wherever she went, and who helped
us across the Rock Mountains.”</p>

<p>Sa-ca-ja-we-a wept.</p>

<p>At the village of Sha-ha-ka, the Big White, the chief
was found sitting surrounded by weeping women, and
taking a final smoke with his relatives and friends. They
all feared that they never should see him again. To them,
it was a long, dangerous journey for him to take.
Chief Le Borgne of the Minnetarees requested that the
white chiefs take good care of Big White. And they
solemnly promised.</p>

<p>The canoes were lashed together two and two, in
order to be steadier and to travel faster. Big White
and his wife and child stepped aboard the pirogue.
Jessaume and his wife and two children were to accompany<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
Big White and speak for him to the great white
father at Washington.</p>

<p>With a farewell volley and a cheer the boats entered
the current. The Indians had crowded to watch them
leave.</p>

<p>“A month more, lads, an’ we’ll be in St. Louis,”
jubilated Pat. “Barrin’ accident, we’re good for sixty
miles a day.”</p>

<p>Fort Mandan, opposite, was passed; but only a few
pickets, and one cabin, were standing. All the rest had
been burned in a timber fire. Three traders were met,
coming up-river. Two of them were the same who
had been at the Mandan town in the winter of 1804.
They said that the Sioux were on the war-path against
the Mandans and Minnetarees—had already set out,
700 warriors.</p>

<p>“Do not tell Sha-ha-ka,” ordered Captain Lewis,
to Jessaume. “He would wish to turn back.”</p>

<p>This same day the Arikara villages were reached.
Some Cheyennes were here, too. Captain Clark held
a council with both tribes. They all were very friendly.
Big White addressed them, and they listened. They
were willing to be at peace with the Mandans and
Minnetarees. The Arikaras said that they had refused
to join the Sioux, on the war-path. They wished
to send more chiefs to the great white father at Washington,
but were waiting until Brave Raven, who had
gone down on the barge last year, came back with the
white father’s words. The Cheyennes said that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
were afraid of the white people’s medicine, but they
hoped that the new father would send traders and
trappers into their country, to show them how to live
and how to catch the beaver.</p>

<p>On the last day of the council, or July 22, Captain
Lewis was able to walk about a little, for the first time
since he had taken to the boat.</p>

<p>Rapidly traveled the boats. Wild turkeys were
seen; ripe wild plums were found; the grasses were
high and luxurious.</p>

<p>“We gettin’ down into lower country,” chattered
Drouillard, happily.</p>

<p>There were signs of many buffalo. On July 29,
20,000 in one herd darkened the plain. The day following,
halt was made in a wild plum orchard. Everybody
ate. But this was Sioux country, and below the
wild plum orchard sudden exclamations arose from the
boats.</p>

<p>“De Sioux!”</p>

<p>“Look at the bloody rascals!”</p>

<p>“Tetons, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Mebbe Yankton. They act like they want to
talk.”</p>

<p>Some twenty Indians had appeared on a high bank
opposite. One man with them wore a blanket-coat and
a ’kerchief around his head. He might be a French
trader. A short distance farther down almost a hundred
other Indians emerged, to the shore; from their
guns they fired a salute. They all were well armed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p>“Answer the salute, Captain,” directed Captain
Lewis. “It may be a peace signal. And you might
go near them and talk.”</p>

<p>Captain Clark took Drouillard, Jessaume and
Cruzatte and crossed to a sand-bar. The Indians who
met him there said that they were Tetons, under Chief
Black Buffalo. Black Buffalo had been the chief who
had made trouble two years ago, so Captain Clark
declined to have anything more to do with him. He
came back and ordered the boats to prepare for an
attack and proceed.</p>

<p>“I’d like wan shot at them,” muttered Sergeant Pat.</p>

<p>“Do not fire unless you are fired upon,” enjoined
the captains.</p>

<p>As they passed the Sioux collected on the hill,
Second Chief Partisan invited them to land. But they
knew better; and as they continued, the Partisan struck
the earth three times with the butt of his gun, and all
the Indians yelled abuse.</p>

<p>“Dey make vow to kill ev’ry white man,” declared
Drouillard.</p>

<p>That night camp was pitched on a bare sand-bar in
the middle of the river, so as to be safe from attack;
but a terrific thunderstorm blew two of the canoes clear
across the river. However, no Tetons turned up, which
was fortunate.</p>

<p>“The Yanktons next, I suppose,” remarked George
Shannon. “They were a pretty good set, two years
ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>A number of lodges of the Yanktons were indeed
waiting. They proved very friendly, and Captain
Clark held a council with them. They even took Chief
Sha-ha-ka by the hand and asserted that they were
obeying the words of the great white father and were
at peace with the Mandans. They said that as a token
they had kept the flag-pole standing, by the big tree
of the council ground below, where they had first talked
with the white men. And sure enough, when the boats
passed the spot opposite the mouth of the James River,
the flag-pole showed plainly.</p>

<p>Soon another white man was met. He was James
Airs, a trader on his way up from St. Louis, to the
Sioux. Being so lately from the United States he gave
the captains much news, and they sat up nearly all
night with him.</p>

<p>Now the region was very familiar ground, to Peter.
The Omaha village was close before. Soon after leaving
Mr. Airs they sighted the bluff where Sergeant
Charles Floyd had been buried. They landed, to pay
the grave a visit, and found that the Indians had opened
it. The captains ordered the earth filled in again.
That night camp was made on the sand-sprit, at the
old Omaha village—the very spot where the council
had been held with Chief Little Thief and his Otoes
and Missouris, and where Peter had “come aboard.”
How long ago that seemed!</p>

<p>The Omaha village was still deserted. In the morning
Captain Clark called Peter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Peter, would you like to go to the Otoes
again? Are you tired of being white?”</p>

<p>“No, please,” begged Peter. He had been afraid
of this—afraid that he would be sent to the Otoes.
“I want to go to St. Louis, please.”</p>

<p>“Go you shall,” assured the captain. “Go you
shall, Peter, and I’ll attend to you myself.”</p>

<p>Hooray! But, reflected Peter, supposing that Chief
Little Thief should appear before they started on.
However, no Chief Little Thief, or other of the Otoes
and Missouris did appear.</p>

<p>More white traders were encountered. On August
12 there hove in sight two pirogues; aboard them were
none other than Trader Gravelines himself, and old
Pierre Dorion! Mr. Gravelines said that he had taken
Chief Brave Raven, of the Arikaras, clear to Washington,
and that the chief had seen the President, but
had died just when about to return home. Now Mr.
Gravelines was going up to the Arikaras with the President’s
words, and with presents. Old Pierre Dorion
was on his way to the Yankton Sioux again, hoping to
get six more of them and take them to Washington.</p>

<p>“The United States has given all you people up
for lost,” declared Trader Gravelines. “Nothing has
been heard from you since you left Fort Mandan.
The President and everybody are very anxious. We
were asked to inquire about you, among the Indians.”</p>

<p>“Faith, an’ our welcome’ll be the more hearty,”
asserted Sergeant Pat, to his fellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>Boats containing trading parties were met constantly.
Surely, thought Peter, St. Louis cannot be
very far ahead. At a fifty-miles-a-day clip the boats
proceeded. Soon the captains did not stop even to
hunt; and camp was broken before daylight!</p>

<p>August 20 another glad shout arose.</p>

<p>“Cows, boys! Look at the cows! We’re near the
settlements.”</p>

<p>“’Tis the best sight I’ve seen in better’n two
years,” proclaimed Sergeant Pat. “Faith, I’m in that
state o’ mind when I could kiss a cow on the nose!”</p>

<p>“What is cow, Pat?” invited Peter, staring.</p>

<p>“Oh, murther, an’ ye don’t know!” bewailed Pat.
“The cow be the buff’lo civilized, Peter. She be the
white man’s buff’lo. She gives us milk to drink an’
butter to ate, an’ the breath of her is swater’n the
prairie breeze an’ the voice of her is beautiful.”</p>

<p>“La Charette! I see La Charette!” cried old
Cruzatte.</p>

<p>La Charette was the first white man’s village! The
captains ordered guns to be fired, and told the men to
cheer. Down to the shore hastened the inhabitants.
They, too, cheered. They talked part in French, part
in United States. What a chatter sounded! They
almost carried the men to the houses.</p>

<p>“We nefer expec’ to see you again!” they exclaimed.
“We t’ink you all scalped. Haf you been
far?”</p>

<p>“To the Pacific Ocean,” was the answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p>“My gracious! Come an’ tell us.”</p>

<p>Drouillard and Cruzatte and Lepage and Labiche
were well-nigh beside themselves with joy. They
greeted numerous old friends.</p>

<p>“Dees is the best part of all de trip,” they laughed,
again and again.</p>

<p>Assuredly, the villages of the white men of the
United States must be pleasant places, thought Peter.</p>

<p>Sixty-eight miles had been rowed, this day. With
difficulty could the men get away from hospitable La
Charette, but on the next day forty-eight miles were
covered, to another village, St. Charles. Here occurred
more excitement, of greetings, and dinners, and good
beds. The captains, and all the men, in their elk-hide
clothes, and their beards, and their tan, were treated as
heroes; and Peter was not overlooked—not by any
means. Nor was Sha-ha-ka, the Big White. He, like
Peter, for the first time was seeing how the white people
lived.</p>

<p>“Sha-ha-ka say de white people evidently a ver’
good people,” announced Jessaume. “But he anxious
to get on to de beeg village of San Loui’.”</p>

<p>“How far to St. Louis, Pat?” asked Peter, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Only twenty miles. With an ’arly start we’ll ate
our dinner there.”</p>

<p>Twenty miles! The last twenty of more than 8000!
No wonder that all the men were impatient. They
made great plans. At St. Louis they were to be paid
off and discharged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<p>“Extry pay an’ 320 acres of land do we each get,”
repeated Patrick Gass. “An’ we’ve earned it. It’s glad
I am not to be with John Colter this minute, trapsin’
for the Yellowstone ag’in.”</p>

<p>“What’ll you do, Pat, after we get to St. Louis?”</p>

<p>“Faith, have my whiskers trimmed an’ get my
journal published.”</p>

<p>“I’ve sold my journal to the captains for ten dollars!”
boasted Sergeant Ordway. “It’s more’n you’ll
make with yours, Pat.”</p>

<p>“I mean to try for an officer’s commission, in the
army,” said Sergeant Nat Pryor.</p>

<p>“As soon as I get cleaned up, I’ll strike straight for
old New Hampshire, and spin my yarns to the home
folks,” said Ordway.</p>

<p>“I intend to study law. Think I’ll go to college,”
said George Shannon.</p>

<p>“I stay at San’ Loui’ for wan time. Den mebbe I
haf money to enter de fur trade,” said Drouillard.</p>

<p>“Captain Clark will send me to school,” piped Peter.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Peter,” encouraged George. “You
and I’ll go to school.”</p>

<p>Those were long twenty miles. First, the captains
did not leave St. Charles until mid-morning, because
of the rain and the entertainments. Then, three miles
below, was found a big camp of other United States
soldiers, and here the captains stopped for the day, at
the log house which was the principal quarters.</p>

<p>They took Sha-ha-ka ashore; and when he was next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
seen by the company, he had been dressed in new clothes—white
man’s clothes! Of these he was very proud.
He strutted more than York had strutted among the
Sioux and the Arikaras and Mandans.</p>

<p>“An’ why shouldn’t he?” demanded Pat. “He’s
better dressed for polite sassiety than the rist of us!”</p>

<p>Seventeen miles to go! The start was made soon
after an early breakfast. All eyes strained ahead; the
men pulled lustily on the oars. Houses and small
settlements were passed. People ashore cheered.
Toward noon another large river was sighted, ahead;
its course was marked by lines of trees. The Missouri
emptied into it.</p>

<p>“The Mississippi!” cried the men. And then——</p>

<p>The captains stood up in the white pirogue. Captain
Clark looked back, at the canoes, and waved his
hat, and smiled. Before, on the right, was a great
collection of houses set amidst trees—and at the river
bank, near where the two rivers joined, loomed a huge
(at least, to Peter it seemed huge) whitish stone fort,
flying the United States flag. Many boats plied the
current. St. Louis!</p>

<p>Captain Clark lifted his hand and called an order.
But already every rifle in pirogue and canoes had been
leveled, on every trigger was a tense finger—and
“Bang!” spoke all together.</p>

<p>“Hooray!”</p>

<p>Before the boats had touched the landing, the people
of St. Louis had gathered there like magic; they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
running, shouting, jostling. Exclamations sounded
again and again. The air trembled with the excitement.
In the boats, the men were agrin—waving,
calling, and old Cruzatte capering. Only the captains
and Big White stood motionless, as proper for chiefs,
waiting until the pirogue made landing.</p>

<p>“Eet ees Lewis an’ Clark!”</p>

<p>“Dey haf return’ from de dead!”</p>

<p>“Huzza! Huzza! Welcome home!”</p>

<p>“Where you been, these two years and a half?”</p>

<p>Important personages pressed forward, to grasp the
captains and shake their hands vigorously.</p>

<p>“What news, Captains? What news from beyond
the Mandan town? Did you succeed in crossing the
mountains?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And how much farther?”</p>

<p>“To the Columbia and the Pacific!”</p>

<p>“Marvelous! Any fatalities?”</p>

<p>“Only the death of Sergeant Floyd, by disease.”</p>

<p>“And what distance traveled?”</p>

<p>“About eight thousand miles.”</p>

<p>“Remarkable! The world shall ring with your
story.”</p>

<p>“Yis, we’ve borne the greatest flag in the world
to the other side the greatest country in the world;
an’, b’gorry, we’re all here to tell the tale,” pronounced
Pat, as following the captains the men (and Peter!)
sprang to the waiting arms.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
