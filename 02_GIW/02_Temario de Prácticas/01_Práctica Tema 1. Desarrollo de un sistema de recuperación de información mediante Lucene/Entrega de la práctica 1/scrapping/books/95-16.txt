WHEN WENDY GREW UP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\nPETER BREAKS THROUGH\r\n\r\n\r\nAll children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow\r\nup, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old\r\nshe was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran\r\nwith it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather\r\ndelightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nwhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you remain like this for ever!\xe2\x80\x9d This was all that passed\r\nbetween them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must\r\ngrow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nOf course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the\r\nchief one. She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet\r\nmocking mouth. Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within\r\nthe other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover\r\nthere is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on\r\nit that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly\r\nconspicuous in the right-hand corner.\r\n\r\nThe way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been\r\nboys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her,\r\nand they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who\r\ntook a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her,\r\nexcept the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and\r\nin time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could\r\nhave got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a\r\npassion, slamming the door.\r\n\r\nMr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him\r\nbut respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks\r\nand shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know,\r\nand he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that\r\nwould have made any woman respect him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books\r\nperfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a\r\nBrussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped\r\nout, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.\r\nShe drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs.\r\nDarling\xe2\x80\x99s guesses.\r\n\r\nWendy came first, then John, then Michael.\r\n\r\nFor a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would\r\nbe able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was\r\nfrightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the\r\nedge of Mrs. Darling\xe2\x80\x99s bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses,\r\nwhile she looked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what\r\nmight, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece\r\nof paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at\r\nthe beginning again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt,\xe2\x80\x9d he would beg of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can\r\ncut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and\r\nsix, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five\r\nnaught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven\xe2\x80\x94who is that\r\nmoving?\xe2\x80\x94eight nine seven, dot and carry seven\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t speak, my own\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe pound you lent to that man who came to the door\xe2\x80\x94quiet, child\xe2\x80\x94dot\r\nand carry child\xe2\x80\x94there, you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it!\xe2\x80\x94did I say nine nine seven? yes,\r\nI said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on\r\nnine nine seven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we can, George,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. But she was prejudiced in\r\nWendy\xe2\x80\x99s favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember mumps,\xe2\x80\x9d he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cMumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay it\r\nwill be more like thirty shillings\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t speak\xe2\x80\x94measles one five, German\r\nmeasles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t waggle your\r\nfinger\xe2\x80\x94whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and so on it went, and it\r\nadded up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through,\r\nwith mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated\r\nas one.\r\n\r\nThere was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a\r\nnarrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the\r\nthree of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom\xe2\x80\x99s Kindergarten school,\r\naccompanied by their nurse.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a\r\npassion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had\r\na nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children\r\ndrank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had\r\nbelonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She\r\nhad always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had\r\nbecome acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most\r\nof her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by\r\ncareless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of\r\nto their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How\r\nthorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one\r\nof her charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the\r\nnursery. She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have\r\nno patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She\r\nbelieved to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf,\r\nand made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs,\r\nand so on. It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the\r\nchildren to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well\r\nbehaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed. On John\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfooter days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried\r\nan umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the\r\nbasement of Miss Fulsom\xe2\x80\x99s school where the nurses wait. They sat on\r\nforms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference.\r\nThey affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to\r\nthemselves, and she despised their light talk. She resented visits to\r\nthe nursery from Mrs. Darling\xe2\x80\x99s friends, but if they did come she first\r\nwhipped off Michael\xe2\x80\x99s pinafore and put him into the one with blue\r\nbraiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John\xe2\x80\x99s hair.\r\n\r\nNo nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr.\r\nDarling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the\r\nneighbours talked.\r\n\r\nHe had his position in the city to consider.\r\n\r\nNana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that\r\nshe did not admire him. \xe2\x80\x9cI know she admires you tremendously, George,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children\r\nto be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the\r\nonly other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget\r\nshe looked in her long skirt and maid\xe2\x80\x99s cap, though she had sworn, when\r\nengaged, that she would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps!\r\nAnd gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that\r\nall you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at\r\nher you might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family\r\nuntil the coming of Peter Pan.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after\r\nher children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things\r\nstraight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many\r\narticles that have wandered during the day. If you could keep awake\r\n(but of course you can\xe2\x80\x99t) you would see your own mother doing this, and\r\nyou would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like\r\ntidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering\r\nhumorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had\r\npicked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet,\r\npressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and\r\nhurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the\r\nnaughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been\r\nfolded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top,\r\nbeautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you\r\nto put on.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\nDoctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can\r\nbecome intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the\r\ntime. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a\r\ncard, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is\r\nalways more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here\r\nand there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and\r\nsavages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves\r\nthrough which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a\r\nhut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked\r\nnose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first\r\nday at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,\r\nhangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting\r\ninto braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth\r\nyourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they\r\nare another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing,\r\nespecially as nothing will stand still.\r\n\r\nOf course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John\xe2\x80\x99s, for instance, had a\r\nlagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while\r\nMichael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over\r\nit. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a\r\nwigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no\r\nfriends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by\r\nits parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance,\r\nand if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play\r\nare for ever beaching their coracles. We too have been there; we can\r\nstill hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.\r\n\r\nOf all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most\r\ncompact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances\r\nbetween one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at\r\nit by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least\r\nalarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very\r\nreal. That is why there are night-lights.\r\n\r\nOccasionally in her travels through her children\xe2\x80\x99s minds Mrs. Darling\r\nfound things she could not understand, and of these quite the most\r\nperplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was\r\nhere and there in John and Michael\xe2\x80\x99s minds, while Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s began to be\r\nscrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than\r\nany of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had\r\nan oddly cocky appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is rather cocky,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy admitted with regret. Her mother had\r\nbeen questioning her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who is he, my pet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is Peter Pan, you know, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her\r\nchildhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the\r\nfairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died\r\nhe went part of the way with them, so that they should not be\r\nfrightened. She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was\r\nmarried and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Wendy, \xe2\x80\x9che would be grown up by this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t grown up,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy assured her confidently, \xe2\x80\x9cand he is\r\njust my size.\xe2\x80\x9d She meant that he was her size in both mind and body;\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how she knew, she just knew it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. \xe2\x80\x9cMark my\r\nwords,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their\r\nheads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it\r\nwill blow over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs.\r\nDarling quite a shock.\r\n\r\nChildren have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them.\r\nFor instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event\r\nhappened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead\r\nfather and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy\r\none morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had\r\nbeen found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when\r\nthe children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when\r\nWendy said with a tolerant smile:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do believe it is that Peter again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever do you mean, Wendy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said, sighing.\r\nShe was a tidy child.\r\n\r\nShe explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter\r\nsometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her\r\nbed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how she knew, she just knew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house\r\nwithout knocking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he comes in by the window,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy love, it is three floors up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural\r\nto Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child,\xe2\x80\x9d the mother cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy did you not tell me of this before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nOh, surely she must have been dreaming.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined\r\nthem very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they\r\ndid not come from any tree that grew in England. She crawled about the\r\nfloor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot. She\r\nrattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. She let down a\r\ntape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty\r\nfeet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.\r\n\r\nCertainly Wendy had been dreaming.\r\n\r\nBut Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the\r\nnight on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be\r\nsaid to have begun.\r\n\r\nOn the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It\r\nhappened to be Nana\xe2\x80\x99s evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and\r\nsung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away\r\ninto the land of sleep.\r\n\r\nAll were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and\r\nsat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.\r\n\r\nIt was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into\r\nshirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three\r\nnight-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling\xe2\x80\x99s lap. Then\r\nher head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of\r\nthem, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the\r\nfire. There should have been a fourth night-light.\r\n\r\nWhile she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come\r\ntoo near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not\r\nalarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many\r\nwomen who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of\r\nsome mothers also. But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures\r\nthe Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through\r\nthe gap.\r\n\r\nThe dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was\r\ndreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the\r\nfloor. He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist,\r\nwhich darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must\r\nhave been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.\r\n\r\nShe started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at\r\nonce that he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we\r\nshould have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling\xe2\x80\x99s kiss. He was a\r\nlovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of\r\ntrees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his\r\nfirst teeth. When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little\r\npearls at her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\nTHE SHADOW\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened,\r\nand Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang\r\nat the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling\r\nscreamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed,\r\nand she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it\r\nwas not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see\r\nnothing but what she thought was a shooting star.\r\n\r\nShe returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her\r\nmouth, which proved to be the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shadow. As he leapt at the window\r\nNana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had\r\nnot had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.\r\n\r\nYou may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was\r\nquite the ordinary kind.\r\n\r\nNana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow.\r\nShe hung it out at the window, meaning \xe2\x80\x9cHe is sure to come back for it;\r\nlet us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the\r\nchildren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the\r\nwindow, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the\r\nhouse. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up\r\nwinter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his\r\nhead to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him;\r\nbesides, she knew exactly what he would say: \xe2\x80\x9cIt all comes of having a\r\ndog for a nurse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a\r\ndrawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah\r\nme!\r\n\r\nThe opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten\r\nFriday. Of course it was a Friday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,\xe2\x80\x9d she used to say\r\nafterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of\r\nher, holding her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darling always said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am responsible for it all. I,\r\nGeorge Darling, did it. _Mea culpa, mea culpa_.\xe2\x80\x9d He had had a classical\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nThey sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every\r\ndetail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other\r\nside like the faces on a bad coinage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nDarling said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only I had not poured my medicine into Nana\xe2\x80\x99s bowl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nDarling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only I had pretended to like the medicine,\xe2\x80\x9d was what Nana\xe2\x80\x99s wet\r\neyes said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy liking for parties, George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy fatal gift of humour, dearest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true, it\xe2\x80\x99s true, they ought not to have had a dog for a\r\nnurse.\xe2\x80\x9d Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to\r\nNana\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat fiend!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana\xe2\x80\x99s bark was the echo of\r\nit, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the\r\nright-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.\r\n\r\nThey would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every\r\nsmallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully,\r\nso precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the\r\nwater for Michael\xe2\x80\x99s bath and carrying him to it on her back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t go to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d he had shouted, like one who still believed that\r\nhe had the last word on the subject, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t, I won\xe2\x80\x99t. Nana, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsix o\xe2\x80\x99clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t love you any more, Nana. I\r\ntell you I won\xe2\x80\x99t be bathed, I won\xe2\x80\x99t, I won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had\r\ndressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown,\r\nwith the necklace George had given her. She was wearing Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbracelet on her arm; she had asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to\r\nlend her bracelet to her mother.\r\n\r\nShe had found her two older children playing at being herself and\r\nfather on the occasion of Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s birth, and John was saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\njust such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nWendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThen John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the\r\nbirth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also,\r\nbut John said brutally that they did not want any more.\r\n\r\nMichael had nearly cried. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody wants me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and of course the\r\nlady in the evening-dress could not stand that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI so want a third child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy or girl?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Michael, not too hopefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs.\r\nDarling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be\r\nMichael\xe2\x80\x99s last night in the nursery.\r\n\r\nThey go on with their recollections.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darling\r\nwould say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for\r\nthe party, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It\r\nis an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew\r\nabout stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the\r\nthing yielded to him without a contest, but there were occasions when\r\nit would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride\r\nand used a made-up tie.\r\n\r\nThis was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the\r\ncrumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what is the matter, father dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatter!\xe2\x80\x9d he yelled; he really yelled. \xe2\x80\x9cThis tie, it will not tie.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nbecame dangerously sarcastic. \xe2\x80\x9cNot round my neck! Round the bed-post!\r\nOh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my\r\nneck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on\r\nsternly, \xe2\x80\x9cI warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my\r\nneck we don\xe2\x80\x99t go out to dinner to-night, and if I don\xe2\x80\x99t go out to\r\ndinner to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don\xe2\x80\x99t go to\r\nthe office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into\r\nthe streets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven then Mrs. Darling was placid. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me try, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and\r\nindeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice\r\ncool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to\r\nsee their fate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to\r\ndo it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he\r\nthanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment\r\nwas dancing round the room with Michael on his back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow wildly we romped!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur last romp!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darling groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, \xe2\x80\x98How did you\r\nget to know me, mother?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were rather sweet, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think, George?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr.\r\nDarling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They\r\nwere not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had\r\nwith braid on them, and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears\r\ncoming. Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him, but he began to talk again\r\nabout its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, Nana is a treasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon\r\nthe children as puppies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder.\xe2\x80\x9d It was an\r\nopportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first he\r\npooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nobody I know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, examining it carefully, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it does\r\nlook a scoundrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were still discussing it, you remember,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Darling, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nNana came in with Michael\xe2\x80\x99s medicine. You will never carry the bottle\r\nin your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather\r\nfoolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking\r\nthat all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when\r\nMichael dodged the spoon in Nana\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, he had said reprovingly, \xe2\x80\x9cBe\r\na man, Michael.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t; won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling left the room to\r\nget a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of\r\nfirmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, don\xe2\x80\x99t pamper him,\xe2\x80\x9d he called after her. \xe2\x80\x9cMichael, when I was\r\nyour age I took medicine without a murmur. I said, \xe2\x80\x98Thank you, kind\r\nparents, for giving me bottles to make me well.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her\r\nnight-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nmedicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver so much nastier,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darling said bravely, \xe2\x80\x9cand I would take it\r\nnow as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t lost the bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the\r\ntop of the wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that\r\nthe faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know where it is, father,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy cried, always glad to be of\r\nservice. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it,\xe2\x80\x9d and she was off before he could stop her.\r\nImmediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, shuddering, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s most beastly stuff. It\xe2\x80\x99s that nasty,\r\nsticky, sweet kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will soon be over, father,\xe2\x80\x9d John said cheerily, and then in rushed\r\nWendy with the medicine in a glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been as quick as I could,\xe2\x80\x9d she panted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been wonderfully quick,\xe2\x80\x9d her father retorted, with a\r\nvindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. \xe2\x80\x9cMichael\r\nfirst,\xe2\x80\x9d he said doggedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be sick, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darling said threateningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, John,\xe2\x80\x9d his father rapped out.\r\n\r\nWendy was quite puzzled. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you took it quite easily, father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not the point,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe point is, that there is more\r\nin my glass than in Michael\xe2\x80\x99s spoon.\xe2\x80\x9d His proud heart was nearly\r\nbursting. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair: I would say it though it were with my\r\nlast breath; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, I am waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather\xe2\x80\x99s a cowardly custard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo are you a cowardly custard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not frightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither am I frightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWendy had a splendid idea. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not both take it at the same time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Darling. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready, Michael?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine,\r\nbut Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back.\r\n\r\nThere was a yell of rage from Michael, and \xe2\x80\x9cO father!\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by \xe2\x80\x98O father\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darling demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cStop that row,\r\nMichael. I meant to take mine, but I\xe2\x80\x94I missed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if\r\nthey did not admire him. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, all of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said entreatingly,\r\nas soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. \xe2\x80\x9cI have just thought of a\r\nsplendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana\xe2\x80\x99s bowl, and she will\r\ndrink it, thinking it is milk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the\r\nmedicine into Nana\xe2\x80\x99s bowl. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat fun!\xe2\x80\x9d he said doubtfully, and they did\r\nnot dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNana, good dog,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, patting her, \xe2\x80\x9cI have put a little milk into\r\nyour bowl, Nana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then\r\nshe gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the\r\ngreat red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into\r\nher kennel.\r\n\r\nMr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give\r\nin. In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. \xe2\x80\x9cO George,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s your medicine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only a joke,\xe2\x80\x9d he roared, while she comforted her boys, and\r\nWendy hugged Nana. \xe2\x80\x9cMuch good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9cmy wearing myself to\r\nthe bone trying to be funny in this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd still Wendy hugged Nana. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cCoddle her!\r\nNobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner, why should I\r\nbe coddled\xe2\x80\x94why, why, why!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darling entreated him, \xe2\x80\x9cnot so loud; the servants will\r\nhear you.\xe2\x80\x9d Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered recklessly. \xe2\x80\x9cBring in the whole world. But I\r\nrefuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her\r\nback. He felt he was a strong man again. \xe2\x80\x9cIn vain, in vain,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up\r\nthis instant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, George,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darling whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cremember what I told you\r\nabout that boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in\r\nthat house, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he\r\nlured her out of it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly,\r\ndragged her from the nursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did\r\nit. It was all owing to his too affectionate nature, which craved for\r\nadmiration. When he had tied her up in the back-yard, the wretched\r\nfather went and sat in the passage, with his knuckles to his eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted\r\nsilence and lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and\r\nJohn whimpered, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is because he is chaining her up in the yard,\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nWendy was wiser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not Nana\xe2\x80\x99s unhappy bark,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, little guessing what was\r\nabout to happen; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is her bark when she smells danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDanger!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure, Wendy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened.\r\nShe looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were\r\ncrowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place\r\nthere, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller\r\nones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made\r\nher cry, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how I wish that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to a party to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cCan anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, precious,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are the eyes a mother leaves\r\nbehind her to guard her children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little\r\nMichael flung his arms round her. \xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad of\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNo. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall\r\nof snow, and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly\r\nnot to soil their shoes. They were already the only persons in the\r\nstreet, and all the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but\r\nthey may not take an active part in anything, they must just look on\r\nfor ever. It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long\r\nago that no star now knows what it was. So the older ones have become\r\nglassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the\r\nlittle ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who\r\nhad a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow\r\nthem out; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side\r\nto-night, and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon\r\nas the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion\r\nin the firmament, and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way\r\nscreamed out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Peter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\nCOME AWAY, COME AWAY!\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights\r\nby the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were\r\nawfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they\r\ncould have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s light blinked and gave\r\nsuch a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close\r\ntheir mouths all the three went out.\r\n\r\nThere was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than\r\nthe night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had\r\nbeen in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter\xe2\x80\x99s shadow,\r\nrummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not\r\nreally a light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but\r\nwhen it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer\r\nthan your hand, but still growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell\r\nexquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through\r\nwhich her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly\r\ninclined to _embonpoint_.\r\n\r\nA moment after the fairy\xe2\x80\x99s entrance the window was blown open by the\r\nbreathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had carried\r\nTinker Bell part of the way, and his hand was still messy with the\r\nfairy dust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTinker Bell,\xe2\x80\x9d he called softly, after making sure that the children\r\nwere asleep, \xe2\x80\x9cTink, where are you?\xe2\x80\x9d She was in a jug for the moment,\r\nand liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put\r\nmy shadow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy\r\nlanguage. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to\r\nhear it you would know that you had heard it once before.\r\n\r\nTink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of\r\ndrawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to\r\nthe floor with both hands, as kings toss ha\xe2\x80\x99pence to the crowd. In a\r\nmoment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that\r\nhe had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.\r\n\r\nIf he thought at all, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he ever thought, it was that\r\nhe and his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops\r\nof water, and when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it\r\non with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed\r\nthrough Peter, and he sat on the floor and cried.\r\n\r\nHis sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed to see\r\na stranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said courteously, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy are you crying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner\r\nat fairy ceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully. She was\r\nmuch pleased, and bowed beautifully to him from the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWendy Moira Angela Darling,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with some satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nis your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Pan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a\r\ncomparatively short name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that it was a\r\nshortish name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wendy Moira Angela.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter gulped.\r\n\r\nShe asked where he lived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecond to the right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, \xe2\x80\x9cand then straight on till morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a funny address!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a\r\nfunny address.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess, \xe2\x80\x9cis that\r\nwhat they put on the letters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wished she had not mentioned letters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t get any letters,\xe2\x80\x9d he said contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your mother gets letters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t have a mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Not only had he no mother, but he had\r\nnot the slightest desire to have one. He thought them very over-rated\r\npersons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence of a\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Peter, no wonder you were crying,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and got out of bed and\r\nran to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t crying about mothers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said rather indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\ncrying because I can\xe2\x80\x99t get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncrying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has come off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she\r\nwas frightfully sorry for Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cHow awful!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, but she could\r\nnot help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on\r\nwith soap. How exactly like a boy!\r\n\r\nFortunately she knew at once what to do. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be sewn on,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, just a little patronisingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s sewn?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re dreadfully ignorant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she was exulting in his ignorance. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall sew it on for you, my\r\nlittle man,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out\r\nher housewife, and sewed the shadow on to Peter\xe2\x80\x99s foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay it will hurt a little,\xe2\x80\x9d she warned him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t cry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he\r\nhad never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and did not cry,\r\nand soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little\r\ncreased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I should have ironed it,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter,\r\nboylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about\r\nin the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his\r\nbliss to Wendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nclever I am!\xe2\x80\x9d he crowed rapturously, \xe2\x80\x9coh, the cleverness of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one\r\nof his most fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness,\r\nthere never was a cockier boy.\r\n\r\nBut for the moment Wendy was shocked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou conceit,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed,\r\nwith frightful sarcasm; \xe2\x80\x9cof course I did nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did a little,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with hauteur; \xe2\x80\x9cif I am no use I can at least\r\nwithdraw,\xe2\x80\x9d and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and\r\ncovered her face with the blankets.\r\n\r\nTo induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this\r\nfailed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his\r\nfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cWendy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t withdraw. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help crowing, Wendy,\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased with myself.\xe2\x80\x9d Still she would not look up, though she\r\nwas listening eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cWendy,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, in a voice that no woman\r\nhas ever yet been able to resist, \xe2\x80\x9cWendy, one girl is more use than\r\ntwenty boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many\r\ninches, and she peeped out of the bed-clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think so, Peter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly sweet of you,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll get up\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x9d and she sat with him on the side of the bed. She also said she\r\nwould give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not know what she\r\nmeant, and he held out his hand expectantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you know what a kiss is?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, aghast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall know when you give it to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied stiffly, and not to\r\nhurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cshall I give you a kiss?\xe2\x80\x9d and she replied with a\r\nslight primness, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you please.\xe2\x80\x9d She made herself rather cheap by\r\ninclining her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn button\r\ninto her hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had been\r\nbefore, and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain\r\naround her neck. It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it\r\nwas afterwards to save her life.\r\n\r\nWhen people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct\r\nthing, asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question\r\nto ask him; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when\r\nwhat you want to be asked is Kings of England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied uneasily, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am quite young.\xe2\x80\x9d He really\r\nknew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he said at a\r\nventure, \xe2\x80\x9cWendy, I ran away the day I was born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the\r\ncharming drawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he\r\ncould sit nearer her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was because I heard father and mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained in a low\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9ctalking about what I was to be when I became a man.\xe2\x80\x9d He was\r\nextraordinarily agitated now. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want ever to be a man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nwith passion. \xe2\x80\x9cI want always to be a little boy and to have fun. So I\r\nran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the\r\nfairies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it\r\nwas because he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies.\r\nWendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as\r\nquite delightful. She poured out questions about them, to his surprise,\r\nfor they were rather a nuisance to him, getting in his way and so on,\r\nand indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding. Still, he liked them\r\non the whole, and he told her about the beginning of fairies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, its\r\nlaugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about,\r\nand that was the beginning of fairies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on good-naturedly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere ought to be one fairy for\r\nevery boy and girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOught to be? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in\r\nfairies, and every time a child says, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in fairies,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthere is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReally, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it\r\nstruck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nwhere she has gone to,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rising, and he called Tink by name.\r\nWendy\xe2\x80\x99s heart went flutter with a sudden thrill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, clutching him, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to tell me that\r\nthere is a fairy in this room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was here just now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said a little impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t hear\r\nher, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d and they both listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only sound I hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wendy, \xe2\x80\x9cis like a tinkle of bells.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s Tink, that\xe2\x80\x99s the fairy language. I think I hear her too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face.\r\nNo one could ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of\r\ngurgles was his laugh. He had his first laugh still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWendy,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered gleefully, \xe2\x80\x9cI do believe I shut her up in the\r\ndrawer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the nursery\r\nscreaming with fury. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say such things,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter retorted.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry, but how could I know you were in the\r\ndrawer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWendy was not listening to him. \xe2\x80\x9cO Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cif she would\r\nonly stand still and let me see her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey hardly ever stand still,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, but for one moment Wendy saw\r\nthe romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. \xe2\x80\x9cO the lovely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe cried, though Tink\xe2\x80\x99s face was still distorted with passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTink,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter amiably, \xe2\x80\x9cthis lady says she wishes you were her\r\nfairy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTinker Bell answered insolently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she say, Peter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had to translate. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is not very polite. She says you are a great\r\nugly girl, and that she is my fairy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried to argue with Tink. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know you can\xe2\x80\x99t be my fairy, Tink,\r\nbecause I am an gentleman and you are a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Tink replied in these words, \xe2\x80\x9cYou silly ass,\xe2\x80\x9d and disappeared\r\ninto the bathroom. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is quite a common fairy,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter explained\r\napologetically, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots\r\nand kettles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him\r\nwith more questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t live in Kensington Gardens now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I do still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where do you live mostly now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the lost boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the\r\nnurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days\r\nthey are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ncaptain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fun it must be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said cunning Peter, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we are rather lonely. You see we have\r\nno female companionship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre none of the others girls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their\r\nprams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis flattered Wendy immensely. \xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is perfectly\r\nlovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one\r\nkick. This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she\r\ntold him with spirit that he was not captain in her house. However,\r\nJohn continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him\r\nto remain there. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I know you meant to be kind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nrelenting, \xe2\x80\x9cso you may give me a kiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought\r\nyou would want it back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said a little bitterly, and offered to\r\nreturn her the thimble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nice Wendy, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean a kiss, I mean a\r\nthimble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like this.\xe2\x80\x9d She kissed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFunny!\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cNow shall I give you a thimble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wendy, keeping her head erect this time.\r\n\r\nPeter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it,\r\nWendy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive language.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you a\r\nthimble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Tink replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYou silly ass.\xe2\x80\x9d Peter could not understand why,\r\nbut Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when he\r\nadmitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to\r\nlisten to stories.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any\r\nstories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow perfectly awful,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter asked \xe2\x80\x9cwhy swallows build in the eaves of houses?\r\nIt is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling you\r\nsuch a lovely story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich story was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the prince who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the lady who wore the glass\r\nslipper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wendy excitedly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was Cinderella, and he found her,\r\nand they lived happily ever after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been\r\nsitting, and hurried to the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried with misgiving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell the other boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d she entreated, \xe2\x80\x9cI know such lots of stories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was\r\nshe who first tempted him.\r\n\r\nHe came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought\r\nto have alarmed her, but did not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the stories I could tell to the boys!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and then Peter\r\ngripped her and began to draw her toward the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go!\xe2\x80\x9d she ordered him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWendy, do come with me and tell the other boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t. Think of mummy! Besides, I can\xe2\x80\x99t fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how lovely to fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you how to jump on the wind\xe2\x80\x99s back, and then away we go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed rapturously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be\r\nflying about with me saying funny things to the stars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, Wendy, there are mermaids.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMermaids! With tails?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch long tails.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wendy, \xe2\x80\x9cto see a mermaid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had become frightfully cunning. \xe2\x80\x9cWendy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chow we should all\r\nrespect you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were\r\ntrying to remain on the nursery floor.\r\n\r\nBut he had no pity for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWendy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, the sly one, \xe2\x80\x9cyou could tuck us in at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of us has ever been tucked in at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo,\xe2\x80\x9d and her arms went out to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us\r\nhas any pockets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow could she resist. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it\xe2\x80\x99s awfully fascinating!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like,\xe2\x80\x9d he said indifferently, and she ran to John and Michael\r\nand shook them. \xe2\x80\x9cWake up,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cPeter Pan has come and he is to\r\nteach us to fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn rubbed his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall get up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Of course he was\r\non the floor already. \xe2\x80\x9cHallo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMichael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six\r\nblades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces\r\nassumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the\r\ngrown-up world. All was as still as salt. Then everything was right.\r\nNo, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana, who had been barking\r\ndistressfully all the evening, was quiet now. It was her silence they\r\nhad heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut with the light! Hide! Quick!\xe2\x80\x9d cried John, taking command for the\r\nonly time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered,\r\nholding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you\r\nwould have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing\r\nangelically as they slept. They were really doing it artfully from\r\nbehind the window curtains.\r\n\r\nLiza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in\r\nthe kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her\r\ncheek, by Nana\xe2\x80\x99s absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting\r\na little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in\r\ncustody of course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you suspicious brute,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, not sorry that Nana was in\r\ndisgrace. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are perfectly safe, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they? Every one of the\r\nlittle angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they\r\nwere nearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried\r\nto drag herself out of Liza\xe2\x80\x99s clutches.\r\n\r\nBut Liza was dense. \xe2\x80\x9cNo more of it, Nana,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sternly, pulling\r\nher out of the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI warn you if you bark again I shall go straight\r\nfor master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then, oh,\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t master whip you, just.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to\r\nbark? Bring master and missus home from the party! Why, that was just\r\nwhat she wanted. Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long\r\nas her charges were safe? Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings,\r\nand Nana, seeing that no help would come from her, strained and\r\nstrained at the chain until at last she broke it. In another moment she\r\nhad burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven,\r\nher most expressive way of making a communication. Mr. and Mrs. Darling\r\nknew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery,\r\nand without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.\r\n\r\nBut it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing\r\nbehind the curtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.\r\n\r\nWe now return to the nursery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d John announced, emerging from his hiding-place. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsay, Peter, can you really fly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking\r\nthe mantelpiece on the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow topping!\xe2\x80\x9d said John and Michael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow sweet!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wendy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sweet, oh, I am sweet!\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, forgetting his manners\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIt looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and\r\nthen from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, how do you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked John, rubbing his knee. He was quite a\r\npractical boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou just think lovely wonderful thoughts,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter explained, \xe2\x80\x9cand they\r\nlift you up in the air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe showed them again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so nippy at it,\xe2\x80\x9d John said, \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you do it very slowly\r\nonce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter did it both slowly and quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got it now, Wendy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nJohn, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly an inch,\r\nthough even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not\r\nknow A from Z.\r\n\r\nOf course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless\r\nthe fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have\r\nmentioned, one of his hands was messy with it, and he blew some on each\r\nof them, with the most superb results.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow just wiggle your shoulders this way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand let go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did\r\nnot quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne\r\nacross the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI flewed!\xe2\x80\x9d he screamed while still in mid-air.\r\n\r\nJohn let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, lovely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ripping!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a\r\nlittle, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is\r\nalmost nothing so delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first,\r\nbut had to desist, Tink was so indignant.\r\n\r\nUp and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d cried John, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we all go out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.\r\n\r\nMichael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a\r\nbillion miles. But Wendy hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMermaids!\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there are pirates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPirates,\xe2\x80\x9d cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, \xe2\x80\x9clet us go at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana\r\nout of 27. They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the\r\nnursery window; and, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze\r\nwith light, and most heart-gripping sight of all, they could see in\r\nshadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling\r\nround and round, not on the floor but in the air.\r\n\r\nNot three figures, four!\r\n\r\nIn a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have rushed\r\nupstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even tried to\r\nmake her heart go softly.\r\n\r\nWill they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them,\r\nand we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story.\r\nOn the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it\r\nwill all come right in the end.\r\n\r\nThey would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the\r\nlittle stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window\r\nopen, and that smallest star of all called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCave, Peter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried\r\nimperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John\r\nand Michael and Wendy.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The\r\nbirds were flown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\nTHE FLIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecond to the right, and straight on till morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even\r\nbirds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not\r\nhave sighted it with these instructions. Peter, you see, just said\r\nanything that came into his head.\r\n\r\nAt first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the\r\ndelights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires\r\nor any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy.\r\n\r\nJohn and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.\r\n\r\nThey recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought\r\nthemselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.\r\n\r\nNot long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before\r\nthis thought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was\r\ntheir second sea and their third night.\r\n\r\nSometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold\r\nand again too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they\r\nmerely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding\r\nthem? His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable\r\nfor humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and\r\nsnatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for\r\nmiles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But Wendy\r\nnoticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this\r\nwas rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that\r\nthere are other ways.\r\n\r\nCertainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that\r\nwas a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful\r\nthing was that Peter thought this funny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he goes again!\xe2\x80\x9d he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly\r\ndropped like a stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSave him, save him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel sea\r\nfar below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch\r\nMichael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way\r\nhe did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it\r\nwas his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human\r\nlife. Also he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one\r\nmoment would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the\r\npossibility that the next time you fell he would let you go.\r\n\r\nHe could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back\r\nand floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light\r\nthat if you got behind him and blew he went faster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo be more polite to him,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy whispered to John, when they were\r\nplaying \xe2\x80\x9cFollow my Leader.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen tell him to stop showing off,\xe2\x80\x9d said John.\r\n\r\nWhen playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and\r\ntouch each shark\xe2\x80\x99s tail in passing, just as in the street you may run\r\nyour finger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this\r\nwith much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off,\r\nespecially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be nice to him,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy impressed on her brothers. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could\r\nwe do if he were to leave us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe could go back,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could we ever find our way back without him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, we could go on,\xe2\x80\x9d said John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how to stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.\r\n\r\nJohn said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was\r\nto go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must\r\ncome back to their own window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is to get food for us, John?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI nipped a bit out of that eagle\xe2\x80\x99s mouth pretty neatly, Wendy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the twentieth try,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy reminded him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd even though we\r\nbecame good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and\r\nthings if he is not near to give us a hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly,\r\nthough they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front\r\nof them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they\r\nbump into it. If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage\r\nround Michael\xe2\x80\x99s forehead by this time.\r\n\r\nPeter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up\r\nthere by themselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would\r\nsuddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had\r\nno share. He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he\r\nhad been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or\r\nhe would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not\r\nbe able to say for certain what had been happening. It was really\r\nrather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he forgets them so quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy argued, \xe2\x80\x9chow can we expect\r\nthat he will go on remembering us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least\r\nnot well. Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes\r\nas he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she\r\nhad to call him by name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Wendy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said agitatedly.\r\n\r\nHe was very sorry. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Wendy,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to her, \xe2\x80\x9calways if you\r\nsee me forgetting you, just keep on saying \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m Wendy,\xe2\x80\x99 and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nremember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he\r\nshowed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their\r\nway, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several\r\ntimes and found that they could sleep thus with security. Indeed they\r\nwould have slept longer, but Peter tired quickly of sleeping, and soon\r\nhe would cry in his captain voice, \xe2\x80\x9cWe get off here.\xe2\x80\x9d So with\r\noccasional tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, they drew near the\r\nNeverland; for after many moons they did reach it, and, what is more,\r\nthey had been going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much\r\nowing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was\r\nlooking for them. It is only thus that any one may sight those magic\r\nshores.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere all the arrows are pointing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children,\r\nall directed by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of\r\ntheir way before leaving them for the night.\r\n\r\nWendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their\r\nfirst sight of the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at\r\nonce, and until fear fell upon them they hailed it, not as something\r\nlong dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to whom they\r\nwere returning home for the holidays.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn, there\xe2\x80\x99s the lagoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Michael, there\xe2\x80\x99s your cave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn, what\xe2\x80\x99s that in the brushwood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a wolf with her whelps. Wendy, I do believe that\xe2\x80\x99s your little\r\nwhelp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s my boat, John, with her sides stove in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. Why, we burned your boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the redskin\r\ncamp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Show me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you by the way smoke curls whether they\r\nare on the war-path.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, just across the Mysterious River.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he\r\nwanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not\r\ntold you that anon fear fell upon them?\r\n\r\nIt came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.\r\n\r\nIn the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little\r\ndark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it\r\nand spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts\r\nof prey was quite different now, and above all, you lost the certainty\r\nthat you would win. You were quite glad that the night-lights were on.\r\nYou even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over\r\nhere, and that the Neverland was all make-believe.\r\n\r\nOf course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was\r\nreal now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker\r\nevery moment, and where was Nana?\r\n\r\nThey had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. His\r\ncareless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle\r\nwent through them every time they touched his body. They were now over\r\nthe fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their\r\nfeet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had\r\nbecome slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way\r\nthrough hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had\r\nbeaten on it with his fists.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t want us to land,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are they?\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy whispered, shuddering.\r\n\r\nBut he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his\r\nshoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front.\r\n\r\nSometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his\r\nhand to his ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that\r\nthey seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he\r\nwent on again.\r\n\r\nHis courage was almost appalling. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you like an adventure now,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid casually to John, \xe2\x80\x9cor would you like to have your tea first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWendy said \xe2\x80\x9ctea first\xe2\x80\x9d quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in\r\ngratitude, but the braver John hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of adventure?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked cautiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter told\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you like, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go down and kill him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see him,\xe2\x80\x9d John said after a long pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose,\xe2\x80\x9d John said, a little huskily, \xe2\x80\x9che were to wake up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter spoke indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would kill him while he was\r\nsleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way I\r\nalways do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say! Do you kill many?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn said \xe2\x80\x9cHow ripping,\xe2\x80\x9d but decided to have tea first. He asked if\r\nthere were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had\r\nnever known so many.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is captain now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHook,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he said that\r\nhated word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJas. Hook?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps\r\nonly, for they knew Hook\xe2\x80\x99s reputation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was Blackbeard\xe2\x80\x99s bo\xe2\x80\x99sun,\xe2\x80\x9d John whispered huskily. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is the worst\r\nof them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he like? Is he big?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not so big as he was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cut off a bit of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t meaning to be disrespectful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, I say, what bit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis right hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he can\xe2\x80\x99t fight now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, can\xe2\x80\x99t he just!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeft-hander?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and he claws with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClaws!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, John,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, \xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat every boy who serves under\r\nme has to promise, and so must you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn paled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave him to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise,\xe2\x80\x9d John said loyally.\r\n\r\nFor the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying\r\nwith them, and in her light they could distinguish each other.\r\nUnfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they, and so she had to go\r\nround and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo.\r\nWendy quite liked it, until Peter pointed out the drawbacks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe tells me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the pirates sighted us before the\r\ndarkness came, and got Long Tom out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe big gun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess we are\r\nnear it they are sure to let fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWendy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her to go away at once, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d the three cried simultaneously,\r\nbut he refused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe thinks we have lost the way,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied stiffly, \xe2\x80\x9cand she is\r\nrather frightened. You don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would send her away all by herself\r\nwhen she is frightened!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a\r\nloving little pinch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen tell her,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy begged, \xe2\x80\x9cto put out her light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t put it out. That is about the only thing fairies can\xe2\x80\x99t do.\r\nIt just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as the stars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen tell her to sleep at once,\xe2\x80\x9d John almost ordered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep except when she\xe2\x80\x99s sleepy. It is the only other thing\r\nfairies can\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d growled John, \xe2\x80\x9cthese are the only two things worth\r\ndoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere he got a pinch, but not a loving one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only one of us had a pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe could carry her in\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a\r\npocket between the four of them.\r\n\r\nHe had a happy idea. John\xe2\x80\x99s hat!\r\n\r\nTink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John\r\ncarried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently\r\nWendy took the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as he\r\nflew; and this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated\r\nto be under an obligation to Wendy.\r\n\r\nIn the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on\r\nin silence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken\r\nonce by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts\r\ndrinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been\r\nthe branches of trees rubbing together, but he said it was the redskins\r\nsharpening their knives.\r\n\r\nEven these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nonly something would make a sound!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\nAs if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most tremendous\r\ncrash he had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them.\r\n\r\nThe roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to\r\ncry savagely, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they, where are they, where are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an\r\nisland of make-believe and the same island come true.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found\r\nthemselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air\r\nmechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was floating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you shot?\xe2\x80\x9d John whispered tremulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t tried yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael whispered back.\r\n\r\nWe know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried\r\nby the wind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was blown upwards\r\nwith no companion but Tinker Bell.\r\n\r\nIt would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the\r\nhat.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she had\r\nplanned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began\r\nto lure Wendy to her destruction.\r\n\r\nTink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the\r\nother hand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or\r\nthe other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one\r\nfeeling only at a time. They are, however, allowed to change, only it\r\nmust be a complete change. At present she was full of jealousy of\r\nWendy. What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course\r\nunderstand, and I believe some of it was bad words, but it sounded\r\nkind, and she flew back and forward, plainly meaning \xe2\x80\x9cFollow me, and\r\nall will be well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and\r\nMichael, and got only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know\r\nthat Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman. And so,\r\nbewildered, and now staggering in her flight, she followed Tink to her\r\ndoom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\nTHE ISLAND COME TRUE\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke\r\ninto life. We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is\r\nbetter and was always used by Peter.\r\n\r\nIn his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take\r\nan hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the\r\nredskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and\r\nlost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other. But with\r\nthe coming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they are under way again: if\r\nyou put your ear to the ground now, you would hear the whole island\r\nseething with life.\r\n\r\nOn this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as\r\nfollows. The lost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out\r\nlooking for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the\r\npirates, and the beasts were out looking for the redskins. They were\r\ngoing round and round the island, but they did not meet because all\r\nwere going at the same rate.\r\n\r\nAll wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night\r\nwere out to greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of\r\ncourse, in numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when\r\nthey seem to be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins\r\nthem out; but at this time there were six of them, counting the twins\r\nas two. Let us pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch them\r\nas they steal by in single file, each with his hand on his dagger.\r\n\r\nThey are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they\r\nwear the skins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so\r\nround and furry that when they fall they roll. They have therefore\r\nbecome very sure-footed.\r\n\r\nThe first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most\r\nunfortunate of all that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures\r\nthan any of them, because the big things constantly happened just when\r\nhe had stepped round the corner; all would be quiet, he would take the\r\nopportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood, and then\r\nwhen he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood. This\r\nill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance, but instead\r\nof souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he was quite the\r\nhumblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air for\r\nyou to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if\r\naccepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who\r\nis bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool, and she thinks\r\nyou are the most easily tricked of the boys. \xe2\x80\x99Ware Tinker Bell.\r\n\r\nWould that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and\r\nhe passes by, biting his knuckles.\r\n\r\nNext comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts\r\nwhistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes.\r\nSlightly is the most conceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the\r\ndays before he was lost, with their manners and customs, and this has\r\ngiven his nose an offensive tilt. Curly is fourth; he is a pickle, and\r\nso often has he had to deliver up his person when Peter said sternly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand forth the one who did this thing,\xe2\x80\x9d that now at the command he\r\nstands forth automatically whether he has done it or not. Last come the\r\nTwins, who cannot be described because we should be sure to be\r\ndescribing the wrong one. Peter never quite knew what twins were, and\r\nhis band were not allowed to know anything he did not know, so these\r\ntwo were always vague about themselves, and did their best to give\r\nsatisfaction by keeping close together in an apologetic sort of way.\r\n\r\nThe boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause,\r\nfor things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track.\r\nWe hear them before they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful\r\nsong:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAvast belay, yo ho, heave to,\r\n    A-pirating we go,\r\nAnd if we\xe2\x80\x99re parted by a shot\r\n    We\xe2\x80\x99re sure to meet below!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock.\r\nHere, a little in advance, ever and again with his head to the ground\r\nlistening, his great arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as\r\nornaments, is the handsome Italian Cecco, who cut his name in letters\r\nof blood on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao. That\r\ngigantic black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one\r\nwith which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of\r\nthe Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the same\r\nBill Jukes who got six dozen on the _Walrus_ from Flint before he would\r\ndrop the bag of moidores; and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman Starkey, once an\r\nusher in a public school and still dainty in his ways of killing; and\r\nSkylights (Morgan\xe2\x80\x99s Skylights); and the Irish bo\xe2\x80\x99sun Smee, an oddly\r\ngenial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only\r\nNon-conformist in Hook\xe2\x80\x99s crew; and Noodler, whose hands were fixed on\r\nbackwards; and Robt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian\r\nlong known and feared on the Spanish Main.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting,\r\nreclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is\r\nsaid he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease\r\nin a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men, and instead of a\r\nright hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged\r\nthem to increase their pace. As dogs this terrible man treated and\r\naddressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In person he was\r\ncadaverous and blackavized, and his hair was dressed in long curls,\r\nwhich at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a\r\nsingularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes\r\nwere of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy,\r\nsave when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red\r\nspots appeared in them and lit them up horribly. In manner, something\r\nof the grand seigneur still clung to him, so that he even ripped you up\r\nwith an air, and I have been told that he was a _raconteur_ of repute.\r\nHe was never more sinister than when he was most polite, which is\r\nprobably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his diction,\r\neven when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his\r\ndemeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man of\r\nindomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was\r\nthe sight of his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour.\r\nIn dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of\r\nCharles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career\r\nthat he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his\r\nmouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke\r\ntwo cigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his\r\niron claw.\r\n\r\nLet us now kill a pirate, to show Hook\xe2\x80\x99s method. Skylights will do. As\r\nthey pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace\r\ncollar; the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one\r\nscreech, then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has\r\nnot even taken the cigars from his mouth.\r\n\r\nSuch is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will\r\nwin?\r\n\r\nOn the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path,\r\nwhich is not visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every\r\none of them with his eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and\r\ntheir naked bodies gleam with paint and oil. Strung around them are\r\nscalps, of boys as well as of pirates, for these are the Piccaninny\r\ntribe, and not to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the\r\nHurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great Big Little Panther, a brave\r\nof so many scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his\r\nprogress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest danger, comes\r\nTiger Lily, proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She is the most\r\nbeautiful of dusky Dianas and the belle of the Piccaninnies,\r\ncoquettish, cold and amorous by turns; there is not a brave who would\r\nnot have the wayward thing to wife, but she staves off the altar with a\r\nhatchet. Observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the\r\nslightest noise. The only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy\r\nbreathing. The fact is that they are all a little fat just now after\r\nthe heavy gorging, but in time they will work this off. For the moment,\r\nhowever, it constitutes their chief danger.\r\n\r\nThe redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their\r\nplace is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions,\r\ntigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee from\r\nthem, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the\r\nman-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island. Their tongues\r\nare hanging out, they are hungry to-night.\r\n\r\nWhen they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic\r\ncrocodile. We shall see for whom she is looking presently.\r\n\r\nThe crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the\r\nprocession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or\r\nchanges its pace. Then quickly they will be on top of each other.\r\n\r\nAll are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the\r\ndanger may be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nThe first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung\r\nthemselves down on the sward, close to their underground home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do wish Peter would come back,\xe2\x80\x9d every one of them said nervously,\r\nthough in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than\r\ntheir captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,\xe2\x80\x9d Slightly said, in\r\nthe tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps some\r\ndistant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wish he would\r\ncome back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about\r\nCinderella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother\r\nmust have been very like her.\r\n\r\nIt was only in Peter\xe2\x80\x99s absence that they could speak of mothers, the\r\nsubject being forbidden by him as silly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I remember about my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d Nibs told them, \xe2\x80\x9cis that she often\r\nsaid to my father, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own!\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my\r\nmother one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild\r\nthings of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and\r\nit was the grim song:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,\r\n    The flag o\xe2\x80\x99 skull and bones,\r\nA merry hour, a hempen rope,\r\n    And hey for Davy Jones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt once the lost boys\xe2\x80\x94but where are they? They are no longer there.\r\nRabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.\r\n\r\nI will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has\r\ndarted away to reconnoitre, they are already in their home under the\r\nground, a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal\r\npresently. But how have they reached it? for there is no entrance to be\r\nseen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away, would\r\ndisclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely, however, and you may note\r\nthat there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in its hollow\r\ntrunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to the home\r\nunder the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these many\r\nmoons. Will he find it tonight?\r\n\r\nAs the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs\r\ndisappearing through the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But\r\nan iron claw gripped his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, let go!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, writhing.\r\n\r\nNow for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut back that pistol first,\xe2\x80\x9d it said threateningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily\xe2\x80\x99s redskins upon us. Do\r\nyou want to lose your scalp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I after him, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d asked pathetic Smee, \xe2\x80\x9cand tickle him with\r\nJohnny Corkscrew?\xe2\x80\x9d Smee had pleasant names for everything, and his\r\ncutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the wound. One\r\ncould mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, after killing,\r\nit was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohnny\xe2\x80\x99s a silent fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he reminded Hook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now, Smee,\xe2\x80\x9d Hook said darkly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is only one, and I want to\r\nmischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain\r\nand Smee were alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it\r\nwas, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but\r\nthere came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo\xe2\x80\x99sun the\r\nstory of his life. He spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all\r\nabout Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.\r\n\r\nAnon he caught the word Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost of all,\xe2\x80\x9d Hook was saying passionately, \xe2\x80\x9cI want their captain,\r\nPeter Pan. \xe2\x80\x99Twas he cut off my arm.\xe2\x80\x9d He brandished the hook\r\nthreateningly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve waited long to shake his hand with this. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntear him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Smee, \xe2\x80\x9cI have often heard you say that hook was worth a\r\nscore of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d the captain answered, \xe2\x80\x9cif I was a mother I would pray to have my\r\nchildren born with this instead of that,\xe2\x80\x9d and he cast a look of pride\r\nupon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again he\r\nfrowned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter flung my arm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, wincing, \xe2\x80\x9cto a crocodile that happened\r\nto be passing by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have often,\xe2\x80\x9d said Smee, \xe2\x80\x9cnoticed your strange dread of crocodiles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot of crocodiles,\xe2\x80\x9d Hook corrected him, \xe2\x80\x9cbut of that one crocodile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe lowered his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt liked my arm so much, Smee, that it has\r\nfollowed me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land, licking\r\nits lips for the rest of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Smee, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a compliment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want no such compliments,\xe2\x80\x9d Hook barked petulantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI want Peter\r\nPan, who first gave the brute its taste for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cSmee,\xe2\x80\x9d he said huskily, \xe2\x80\x9cthat crocodile would have had me\r\nbefore this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick\r\ntick inside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and\r\nbolt.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed, but in a hollow way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Smee, \xe2\x80\x9cthe clock will run down, and then he\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHook wetted his dry lips. \xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the fear that haunts\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSince sitting down he had felt curiously warm. \xe2\x80\x9cSmee,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis\r\nseat is hot.\xe2\x80\x9d He jumped up. \xe2\x80\x9cOdds bobs, hammer and tongs I\xe2\x80\x99m burning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on\r\nthe mainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in\r\ntheir hands, for it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once to\r\nascend. The pirates looked at each other. \xe2\x80\x9cA chimney!\xe2\x80\x9d they both\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nThey had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It\r\nwas the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were\r\nin the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nNot only smoke came out of it. There came also children\xe2\x80\x99s voices, for\r\nso safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily\r\nchattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the\r\nmushroom. They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear them say Peter Pan\xe2\x80\x99s from home?\xe2\x80\x9d Smee whispered,\r\nfidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew.\r\n\r\nHook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a\r\ncurdling smile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnrip your plan, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo return to the ship,\xe2\x80\x9d Hook replied slowly through his teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ncook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.\r\nThere can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The\r\nsilly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door\r\napiece. That shows they have no mother. We will leave the cake on the\r\nshore of the Mermaids\xe2\x80\x99 Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about\r\nthere, playing with the mermaids. They will find the cake and they will\r\ngobble it up, because, having no mother, they don\xe2\x80\x99t know how dangerous\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis to eat rich damp cake.\xe2\x80\x9d He burst into laughter, not hollow\r\nlaughter now, but honest laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cAha, they will die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSmee had listened with growing admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and\r\nin their exultation they danced and sang:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAvast, belay, when I appear,\r\n    By fear they\xe2\x80\x99re overtook;\r\nNought\xe2\x80\x99s left upon your bones when you\r\n    Have shaken claws with Hook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound\r\nbroke in and stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a\r\nleaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it\r\nwas more distinct.\r\n\r\nTick tick tick tick!\r\n\r\nHook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe crocodile!\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his bo\xe2\x80\x99sun.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now\r\non the trail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook.\r\n\r\nOnce more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night\r\nwere not yet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their\r\nmidst, pursued by a pack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were\r\nhanging out; the baying of them was horrible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSave me, save me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nibs, falling on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what can we do, what can we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their\r\nthoughts turned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would Peter do?\xe2\x80\x9d they cried simultaneously.\r\n\r\nAlmost in the same breath they cried, \xe2\x80\x9cPeter would look at them through\r\nhis legs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us do what Peter would do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy\r\nthey bent and looked through their legs. The next moment is the long\r\none, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in\r\nthe terrible attitude, the wolves dropped their tails and fled.\r\n\r\nNow Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his staring\r\neyes still saw the wolves. But it was not wolves he saw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen a wonderfuller thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, as they gathered round\r\nhim eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cA great white bird. It is flying this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of a bird, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Nibs said, awestruck, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it looks so weary, and as it\r\nflies it moans, \xe2\x80\x98Poor Wendy.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Wendy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Slightly instantly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are birds called\r\nWendies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, it comes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens.\r\n\r\nWendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry.\r\nBut more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell. The jealous\r\nfairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship, and was darting at\r\nher victim from every direction, pinching savagely each time she\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Tink,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the wondering boys.\r\n\r\nTink\xe2\x80\x99s reply rang out: \xe2\x80\x9cPeter wants you to shoot the Wendy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us do\r\nwhat Peter wishes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the simple boys. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick, bows and arrows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow with\r\nhim, and Tink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, Tootles, quick,\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed. \xe2\x80\x9cPeter will be so pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. \xe2\x80\x9cOut of the way, Tink,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the ground with\r\nan arrow in her breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\nTHE LITTLE HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nFoolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s body when\r\nthe other boys sprang, armed, from their trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too late,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried proudly, \xe2\x80\x9cI have shot the Wendy. Peter\r\nwill be so pleased with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOverhead Tinker Bell shouted \xe2\x80\x9cSilly ass!\xe2\x80\x9d and darted into hiding. The\r\nothers did not hear her. They had crowded round Wendy, and as they\r\nlooked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. If Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s heart had been\r\nbeating they would all have heard it.\r\n\r\nSlightly was the first to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is no bird,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a scared\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this must be a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tootles, and fell a-trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we have killed her,\xe2\x80\x9d Nibs said hoarsely.\r\n\r\nThey all whipped off their caps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I see,\xe2\x80\x9d Curly said: \xe2\x80\x9cPeter was bringing her to us.\xe2\x80\x9d He threw\r\nhimself sorrowfully on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady to take care of us at last,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the twins, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\r\nhave killed her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he took a\r\nstep nearer them they turned from him.\r\n\r\nTootles\xe2\x80\x99 face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now\r\nthat had never been there before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, reflecting. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen ladies used to come to me in\r\ndreams, I said, \xe2\x80\x98Pretty mother, pretty mother.\xe2\x80\x99 But when at last she\r\nreally came, I shot her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved slowly away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d they called in pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, shaking; \xe2\x80\x9cI am so afraid of Peter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the\r\nheart of every one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter crow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled his\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHide her,\xe2\x80\x9d they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy. But\r\nTootles stood aloof.\r\n\r\nAgain came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreetings, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and mechanically they saluted, and then\r\nagain was silence.\r\n\r\nHe frowned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hotly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do you not cheer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He overlooked\r\nit in his haste to tell the glorious tidings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat news, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI have brought at last a mother for you\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you not seen her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Peter, becoming troubled. \xe2\x80\x9cShe flew this\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh me!\xe2\x80\x9d one voice said, and another said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, mournful day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTootles rose. \xe2\x80\x9cPeter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cI will show her to you,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nwhen the others would still have hidden her he said, \xe2\x80\x9cBack, twins, let\r\nPeter see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked for a\r\nlittle time he did not know what to do next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said uncomfortably. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she is frightened at\r\nbeing dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of\r\nsight of her, and then never going near the spot any more. They would\r\nall have been glad to follow if he had done this.\r\n\r\nBut there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his band.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose arrow?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tootles on his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dastard hand,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use it as a\r\ndagger.\r\n\r\nTootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. \xe2\x80\x9cStrike, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nfirmly, \xe2\x80\x9cstrike true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot\r\nstrike,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with awe, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is something stays my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll looked at him in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked at\r\nWendy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is she,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Wendy lady, see, her arm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWonderful to relate, Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent over her and\r\nlistened reverently. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she said, \xe2\x80\x98Poor Tootles,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lives,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter said briefly.\r\n\r\nSlightly cried instantly, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wendy lady lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember she had\r\nput it on a chain that she wore round her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe arrow struck against this. It is the kiss I gave\r\nher. It has saved her life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember kisses,\xe2\x80\x9d Slightly interposed quickly, \xe2\x80\x9clet me see it. Ay,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a kiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better quickly, so\r\nthat he could show her the mermaids. Of course she could not answer\r\nyet, being still in a frightful faint; but from overhead came a wailing\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to Tink,\xe2\x80\x9d said Curly, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is crying because the Wendy lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they had to tell Peter of Tink\xe2\x80\x99s crime, and almost never had they\r\nseen him look so stern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Tinker Bell,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI am your friend no more. Begone from\r\nme for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off. Not\r\nuntil Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not for ever, but for a whole week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDo you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm? Oh\r\ndear no, never wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed are strange,\r\nand Peter, who understood them best, often cuffed them.\r\n\r\nBut what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us carry her down into the house,\xe2\x80\x9d Curly suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Slightly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is what one does with ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not touch her. It would not be\r\nsufficiently respectful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Slightly, \xe2\x80\x9cis what I was thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if she lies there,\xe2\x80\x9d Tootles said, \xe2\x80\x9cshe will die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, she will die,\xe2\x80\x9d Slightly admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there is no way out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us build a little house round her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were all delighted. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick,\xe2\x80\x9d he ordered them, \xe2\x80\x9cbring me each of\r\nyou the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding.\r\nThey skurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and\r\nwhile they were at it, who should appear but John and Michael. As they\r\ndragged along the ground they fell asleep standing, stopped, woke up,\r\nmoved another step and slept again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn, John,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael would cry, \xe2\x80\x9cwake up! Where is Nana, John, and\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then John would rub his eyes and mutter, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true, we did fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten them. He\r\nwas very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how\r\nlarge a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for\r\nchairs and a table. John and Michael watched him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Wendy asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d they asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael proposed, \xe2\x80\x9clet us wake her and get her to make supper\r\nfor us,\xe2\x80\x9d but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying\r\nbranches for the building of the house. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at them!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter in his most captainy voice, \xe2\x80\x9csee that these boys\r\nhelp in the building of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuild a house?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the Wendy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Curly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Wendy?\xe2\x80\x9d John said, aghast. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she is only a girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Curly, \xe2\x80\x9cis why we are her servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s servants!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, \xe2\x80\x9cand you also. Away with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChairs and a fender first,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter ordered. \xe2\x80\x9cThen we shall build a\r\nhouse round them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Slightly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is how a house is built; it all comes back\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter thought of everything. \xe2\x80\x9cSlightly,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cfetch a doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching his head.\r\nBut he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a moment, wearing\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s hat and looking solemn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, going to him, \xe2\x80\x9care you a doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that\r\nthey knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were\r\nexactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had\r\nto make-believe that they had had their dinners.\r\n\r\nIf they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the\r\nknuckles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my little man,\xe2\x80\x9d Slightly anxiously replied, who had chapped\r\nknuckles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter explained, \xe2\x80\x9ca lady lies very ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to see her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut, tut, tut,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere does she lie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn yonder glade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will put a glass thing in her mouth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Slightly, and he\r\nmade-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment\r\nwhen the glass thing was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is she?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut, tut, tut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Slightly, \xe2\x80\x9cthis has cured her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad!\xe2\x80\x9d Peter cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will call again in the evening,\xe2\x80\x9d Slightly said; \xe2\x80\x9cgive her beef tea\r\nout of a cup with a spout to it;\xe2\x80\x9d but after he had returned the hat to\r\nJohn he blew big breaths, which was his habit on escaping from a\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almost\r\neverything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only we knew,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind of house she likes best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted another, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is moving in her sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer mouth opens,\xe2\x80\x9d cried a third, looking respectfully into it. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nlovely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she is going to sing in her sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cWendy, sing\r\nthe kind of house you would like to have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImmediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had a pretty house,\r\n    The littlest ever seen,\r\nWith funny little red walls\r\n    And roof of mossy green.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the\r\nbranches they had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground\r\nwas carpeted with moss. As they rattled up the little house they broke\r\ninto song themselves:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve built the little walls and roof\r\n    And made a lovely door,\r\nSo tell us, mother Wendy,\r\n    What are you wanting more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this she answered greedily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, really next I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\n    Gay windows all about,\r\nWith roses peeping in, you know,\r\n    And babies peeping out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves\r\nwere the blinds. But roses\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoses,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Peter sternly.\r\n\r\nQuickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls.\r\n\r\nBabies?\r\n\r\nTo prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve made the roses peeping out,\r\n    The babes are at the door,\r\nWe cannot make ourselves, you know,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x99Cos we\xe2\x80\x99ve been made before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his\r\nown. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy\r\nwithin, though, of course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode\r\nup and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle\r\neyes. Just when it seemed absolutely finished:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no knocker on the door,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThey were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it\r\nmade an excellent knocker.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely finished now, they thought.\r\n\r\nNot of bit of it. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no chimney,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must have a\r\nchimney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly does need a chimney,\xe2\x80\x9d said John importantly. This gave\r\nPeter an idea. He snatched the hat off John\xe2\x80\x99s head, knocked out the\r\nbottom, and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so pleased to\r\nhave such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke\r\nimmediately began to come out of the hat.\r\n\r\nNow really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but to\r\nknock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll look your best,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter warned them; \xe2\x80\x9cfirst impressions are awfully\r\nimportant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they were all\r\ntoo busy looking their best.\r\n\r\nHe knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not\r\na sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a\r\nbranch and openly sneering.\r\n\r\nWhat the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a\r\nlady, what would she be like?\r\n\r\nThe door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off\r\ntheir hats.\r\n\r\nShe looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she\r\nwould look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nOf course Slightly was the first to get his word in. \xe2\x80\x9cWendy lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid rapidly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor you we built this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, say you\xe2\x80\x99re pleased,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nibs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLovely, darling house,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said, and they were the very words they\r\nhad hoped she would say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we are your children,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the twins.\r\n\r\nThen all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, \xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nWendy lady, be our mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOught I?\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said, all shining. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it\xe2\x80\x99s frightfully\r\nfascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no real\r\nexperience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, as if he were the only person\r\npresent who knew all about it, though he was really the one who knew\r\nleast. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we need is just a nice motherly person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see, I feel that is exactly what I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, it is,\xe2\x80\x9d they all cried; \xe2\x80\x9cwe saw it at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will do my best. Come inside at once, you\r\nnaughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you to\r\nbed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn they went; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how there was room for them, but you can\r\nsqueeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many\r\njoyous evenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in\r\nthe great bed in the home under the trees, but she herself slept that\r\nnight in the little house, and Peter kept watch outside with drawn\r\nsword, for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves\r\nwere on the prowl. The little house looked so cosy and safe in the\r\ndarkness, with a bright light showing through its blinds, and the\r\nchimney smoking beautifully, and Peter standing on guard. After a time\r\nhe fell asleep, and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on\r\ntheir way home from an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the\r\nfairy path at night they would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked\r\nPeter\xe2\x80\x99s nose and passed on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\nTHE HOME UNDER THE GROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and\r\nJohn and Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at\r\nthe boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was\r\nignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up\r\nand down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size. Once you\r\nfitted, you drew in your breath at the top, and down you went at\r\nexactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out\r\nalternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the\r\naction you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and\r\nnothing can be more graceful.\r\n\r\nBut you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as\r\ncarefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the\r\nclothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree.\r\nUsually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments\r\nor too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only\r\navailable tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and\r\nafter that you fit. Once you fit, great care must be taken to go on\r\nfitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a\r\nwhole family in perfect condition.\r\n\r\nWendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to\r\nbe altered a little.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days\xe2\x80\x99 practice they could go up and down as gaily as\r\nbuckets in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under\r\nthe ground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all\r\nhouses should do, with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to\r\ngo fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming\r\ncolour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in\r\nthe centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through,\r\nlevel with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two feet high,\r\nand then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table;\r\nas soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus\r\nthere was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was\r\nin almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across\r\nthis Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended\r\nher washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down\r\nat 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in\r\nit, except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict\r\nrule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned\r\nat once. Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have a baby,\r\nand he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the short and\r\nlong of it is that he was hung up in a basket.\r\n\r\nIt was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made\r\nof an underground house in the same circumstances. But there was one\r\nrecess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private\r\napartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut off from the rest of the\r\nhouse by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious, always\r\nkept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman, however large, could\r\nhave had a more exquisite boudoir and bed-chamber combined. The couch,\r\nas she always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and\r\nshe varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in\r\nseason. Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only\r\nthree, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust\r\nand reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth,\r\nand the carpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and\r\nRobin. There was a chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the\r\nthing, but of course she lit the residence herself. Tink was very\r\ncontemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps\r\ninevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited,\r\nhaving the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.\r\n\r\nI suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those\r\nrampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole\r\nweeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was\r\nnever above ground. The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the\r\npot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she\r\nhad to keep watching that it came aboil just the same. You never\r\nexactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe,\r\nit all depended upon Peter\xe2\x80\x99s whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was\r\npart of a game, but he could not stodge just to feel stodgy, which is\r\nwhat most children like better than anything else; the next best thing\r\nbeing to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that during a\r\nmeal of it you could see him getting rounder. Of course it was trying,\r\nbut you simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him\r\nthat you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge.\r\n\r\nWendy\xe2\x80\x99s favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all\r\ngone to bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for\r\nherself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting\r\ndouble pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on\r\ntheir knees.\r\n\r\nWhen she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a\r\nhole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, I am\r\nsure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face beamed when she exclaimed this.\r\n\r\nYou remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she\r\nhad come to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.\r\n\r\nAs time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had\r\nleft behind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite\r\nimpossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is\r\ncalculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them\r\nthan on the mainland. But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry\r\nabout her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they\r\nwould always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave\r\nher complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times was that John\r\nremembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while\r\nMichael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.\r\nThese things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she\r\ntried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination\r\npapers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school.\r\nThe other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on\r\njoining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table,\r\nwriting and thinking hard about the questions she had written on\r\nanother slate and passed round. They were the most ordinary\r\nquestions\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the colour of Mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes? Which was taller,\r\nFather or Mother? Was Mother blonde or brunette? Answer all three\r\nquestions if possible.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words\r\non How I spent my last Holidays, or The Characters of Father and Mother\r\ncompared. Only one of these to be attempted.\xe2\x80\x9d Or \xe2\x80\x9c(1) Describe Mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlaugh; (2) Describe Father\xe2\x80\x99s laugh; (3) Describe Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Party Dress;\r\n(4) Describe the Kennel and its Inmate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not\r\nanswer them you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful\r\nwhat a number of crosses even John made. Of course the only boy who\r\nreplied to every question was Slightly, and no one could have been more\r\nhopeful of coming out first, but his answers were perfectly ridiculous,\r\nand he really came out last: a melancholy thing.\r\n\r\nPeter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except\r\nWendy, and for another he was the only boy on the island who could\r\nneither write nor spell; not the smallest word. He was above all that\r\nsort of thing.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What was\r\nthe colour of Mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and so on. Wendy, you see, had been\r\nforgetting, too.\r\n\r\nAdventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but\r\nabout this time Peter invented, with Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s help, a new game that\r\nfascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in\r\nit, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his\r\ngames. It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the\r\nsort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting\r\non stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for\r\nwalks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly. To\r\nsee Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help\r\nlooking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic\r\nthing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his\r\nhealth. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to\r\nhim; and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also;\r\notherwise he would have treated them severely.\r\n\r\nHe often went out alone, and when he came back you were never\r\nabsolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might\r\nhave forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then\r\nwhen you went out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might\r\nsay a great deal about it, and yet you could not find the body.\r\nSometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed\r\nover him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling\r\ntale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were, however, many\r\nadventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself,\r\nand there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other\r\nboys were in them and said they were wholly true. To describe them all\r\nwould require a book as large as an English-Latin, Latin-English\r\nDictionary, and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an\r\naverage hour on the island. The difficulty is which one to choose.\r\nShould we take the brush with the redskins at Slightly Gulch? It was a\r\nsanguinary affair, and especially interesting as showing one of Peter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npeculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight he would\r\nsuddenly change sides. At the Gulch, when victory was still in the\r\nbalance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?\xe2\x80\x9d And Tootles answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRedskin; what are you, Nibs?\xe2\x80\x9d and Nibs said, \xe2\x80\x9cRedskin; what are you\r\nTwin?\xe2\x80\x9d and so on; and they were all redskins; and of course this would\r\nhave ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by Peter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmethods, agreed to be lost boys for that once, and so at it they all\r\nwent again, more fiercely than ever.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary upshot of this adventure was\xe2\x80\x94but we have not decided\r\nyet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one\r\nwould be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the\r\nground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be\r\npulled out like corks. Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife in the Mermaids\xe2\x80\x99 Lagoon, and so made her his ally.\r\n\r\nOr we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might\r\neat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after\r\nanother; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children,\r\nso that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone,\r\nand was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.\r\n\r\nOr suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter\xe2\x80\x99s friends, particularly\r\nof the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how\r\nthe nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and\r\nPeter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty\r\nstory, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell it\r\nwe must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of\r\ncourse be telling two adventures rather than just one. A shorter\r\nadventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell\xe2\x80\x99s attempt, with the\r\nhelp of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a\r\ngreat floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and\r\nWendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we\r\nmight choose Peter\xe2\x80\x99s defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round\r\nhim on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though\r\nhe waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on\r\nbreathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.\r\n\r\nWhich of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be to toss\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nI have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that\r\nthe gulch or the cake or Tink\xe2\x80\x99s leaf had won. Of course I could do it\r\nagain, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick\r\nto the lagoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\nTHE MERMAIDS\xe2\x80\x99 LAGOON\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a\r\nshapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then\r\nif you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and\r\nthe colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on\r\nfire. But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. This is the\r\nnearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment;\r\nif there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the\r\nmermaids singing.\r\n\r\nThe children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or\r\nfloating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and\r\nso forth. You must not think from this that the mermaids were on\r\nfriendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s lasting\r\nregrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil\r\nword from one of them. When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon\r\nshe might see them by the score, especially on Marooners\xe2\x80\x99 Rock, where\r\nthey loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite\r\nirritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within\r\na yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her\r\nwith their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.\r\n\r\nThey treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who\r\nchatted with them on Marooners\xe2\x80\x99 Rock by the hour, and sat on their\r\ntails when they got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs.\r\n\r\nThe most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon,\r\nwhen they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for\r\nmortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy\r\nhad never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course\r\nPeter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules\r\nabout every one being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon,\r\nhowever, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in\r\nextraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many\r\ncolours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily\r\nfrom one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the\r\nrainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and\r\nthe keepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of\r\nthese games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a\r\npretty sight.\r\n\r\nBut the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by\r\nthemselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we\r\nhave proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not\r\nabove taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of\r\nhitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids\r\nadopted it. This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland.\r\n\r\nIt must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a\r\nrock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on their\r\ndoing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was\r\nmake-believe. So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened\r\nin it, while she sat beside them and looked important.\r\n\r\nIt was one such day, and they were all on Marooners\xe2\x80\x99 Rock. The rock was\r\nnot much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how\r\nnot to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with\r\ntheir eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was\r\nnot looking. She was very busy, stitching.\r\n\r\nWhile she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over\r\nit, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning\r\nit cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she\r\nlooked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing\r\nplace seemed formidable and unfriendly.\r\n\r\nIt was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as\r\nnight had come. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent\r\nthat shiver through the sea to say that it was coming. What was it?\r\n\r\nThere crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners\xe2\x80\x99\r\nRock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them\r\nthere to drown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is\r\nsubmerged.\r\n\r\nOf course she should have roused the children at once; not merely\r\nbecause of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it\r\nwas no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she\r\nwas a young mother and she did not know this; she thought you simply\r\nmust stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. So,\r\nthough fear was upon her, and she longed to hear male voices, she would\r\nnot waken them. Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though\r\nher heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. She stood over them\r\nto let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy?\r\n\r\nIt was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could\r\nsniff danger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at\r\nonce as a dog, and with one warning cry he roused the others.\r\n\r\nHe stood motionless, one hand to his ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPirates!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smile was\r\nplaying about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. While that\r\nsmile was on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was\r\nto stand ready to obey. The order came sharp and incisive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted.\r\nMarooners\xe2\x80\x99 Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were\r\nitself marooned.\r\n\r\nThe boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in\r\nher, Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger\r\nLily. Her hands and ankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her\r\nfate. She was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of her\r\nrace more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is it not written\r\nin the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the\r\nhappy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; she was the daughter\r\nof a chief, she must die as a chief\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, it is enough.\r\n\r\nThey had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth.\r\nNo watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook\xe2\x80\x99s boast that the wind of\r\nhis name guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her fate would help to\r\nguard it also. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.\r\n\r\nIn the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see\r\nthe rock till they crashed into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuff, you lubber,\xe2\x80\x9d cried an Irish voice that was Smee\xe2\x80\x99s; \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nrock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it\r\nand leave her here to drown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the\r\nrock; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.\r\n\r\nQuite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and\r\ndown, Peter\xe2\x80\x99s and Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s. Wendy was crying, for it was the first\r\ntragedy she had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had\r\nforgotten them all. He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was\r\ntwo against one that angered him, and he meant to save her. An easy way\r\nwould have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but he was never\r\none to choose the easy way.\r\n\r\nThere was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated the voice\r\nof Hook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAhoy there, you lubbers!\xe2\x80\x9d he called. It was a marvellous imitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe captain!\xe2\x80\x9d said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be swimming out to us,\xe2\x80\x9d Starkey said, when they had looked for\r\nhim in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are putting the redskin on the rock,\xe2\x80\x9d Smee called out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet her free,\xe2\x80\x9d came the astonishing answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFree!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, cut her bonds and let her go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, captain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt once, d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Peter, \xe2\x80\x9cor I\xe2\x80\x99ll plunge my hook in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is queer!\xe2\x80\x9d Smee gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter do what the captain orders,\xe2\x80\x9d said Starkey nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily\xe2\x80\x99s cords. At once like an eel\r\nshe slid between Starkey\xe2\x80\x99s legs into the water.\r\n\r\nOf course Wendy was very elated over Peter\xe2\x80\x99s cleverness; but she knew\r\nthat he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray\r\nhimself, so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth. But it was\r\nstayed even in the act, for \xe2\x80\x9cBoat ahoy!\xe2\x80\x9d rang over the lagoon in Hook\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice, and this time it was not Peter who had spoken.\r\n\r\nPeter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a whistle\r\nof surprise instead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoat ahoy!\xe2\x80\x9d again came the voice.\r\n\r\nNow Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water.\r\n\r\nHe was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him\r\nhe had soon reached them. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his\r\nhook grip the boat\xe2\x80\x99s side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose\r\ndripping from the water, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim\r\naway, but Peter would not budge. He was tingling with life and also\r\ntop-heavy with conceit. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I not a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered to her, and though she thought so also, she was really glad\r\nfor the sake of his reputation that no one heard him except herself.\r\n\r\nHe signed to her to listen.\r\n\r\nThe two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their\r\ncaptain to them, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of\r\nprofound melancholy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, is all well?\xe2\x80\x9d they asked timidly, but he answered with a\r\nhollow moan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sighs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Smee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sighs again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Starkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet a third time he sighs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Smee.\r\n\r\nThen at last he spoke passionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe game\xe2\x80\x99s up,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthose boys have found a mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAffrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO evil day!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Starkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a mother?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the ignorant Smee.\r\n\r\nWendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d and always\r\nafter this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee would be\r\nher one.\r\n\r\nPeter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Starkey, raising the lantern over the waters,\r\nand as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest I\r\nhave told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was\r\nsitting on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hook in answer to Smee\xe2\x80\x99s question, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is a mother. What\r\na lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the\r\nmother desert her eggs? No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent\r\ndays when\xe2\x80\x94but he brushed away this weakness with his hook.\r\n\r\nSmee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but\r\nthe more suspicious Starkey said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf she is a mother, perhaps she is\r\nhanging about here to help Peter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHook winced. \xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the fear that haunts me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was roused from this dejection by Smee\xe2\x80\x99s eager voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Smee, \xe2\x80\x9ccould we not kidnap these boys\xe2\x80\x99 mother and make\r\nher our mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a princely scheme,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hook, and at once it took practical\r\nshape in his great brain. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will seize the children and carry them to\r\nthe boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our\r\nmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Wendy forgot herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and bobbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a leaf in\r\nthe wind. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you agree, my bullies?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is my hand on it,\xe2\x80\x9d they both said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there is my hook. Swear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hook\r\nremembered Tiger Lily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the redskin?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded abruptly.\r\n\r\nHe had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was one of\r\nthe moments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all right, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d Smee answered complacently; \xe2\x80\x9cwe let her\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her go!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas your own orders,\xe2\x80\x9d the bo\xe2\x80\x99sun faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou called over the water to us to let her go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Starkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrimstone and gall,\xe2\x80\x9d thundered Hook, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat cozening is going on here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHis face had gone black with rage, but he saw that they believed their\r\nwords, and he was startled. \xe2\x80\x9cLads,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, shaking a little, \xe2\x80\x9cI gave\r\nno such order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is passing queer,\xe2\x80\x9d Smee said, and they all fidgeted uncomfortably.\r\nHook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cdost hear\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did not. He\r\nimmediately answered in Hook\xe2\x80\x99s voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn that supreme moment Hook did not blanch, even at the gills, but Smee\r\nand Starkey clung to each other in terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you, stranger? Speak!\xe2\x80\x9d Hook demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am James Hook,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the voice, \xe2\x80\x9ccaptain of the _Jolly Roger_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not; you are not,\xe2\x80\x9d Hook cried hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrimstone and gall,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice retorted, \xe2\x80\x9csay that again, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncast anchor in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHook tried a more ingratiating manner. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are Hook,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nalmost humbly, \xe2\x80\x9ccome tell me, who am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA codfish,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the voice, \xe2\x80\x9conly a codfish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA codfish!\xe2\x80\x9d Hook echoed blankly, and it was then, but not till then,\r\nthat his proud spirit broke. He saw his men draw back from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave we been captained all this time by a codfish!\xe2\x80\x9d they muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis lowering to our pride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were his dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though he had\r\nbecome, he scarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence it was\r\nnot their belief in him that he needed, it was his own. He felt his ego\r\nslipping from him. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t desert me, bully,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered hoarsely to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the\r\ngreat pirates, and it sometimes gave him intuitions. Suddenly he tried\r\nthe guessing game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHook,\xe2\x80\x9d he called, \xe2\x80\x9chave you another voice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow Peter could never resist a game, and he answered blithely in his\r\nown voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd another name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVegetable?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMineral?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnimal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d This answer rang out scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrdinary boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderful boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s pain the answer that rang out this time was \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHook was completely puzzled. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ask him some questions,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nthe others, wiping his damp brow.\r\n\r\nSmee reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think of a thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said regretfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t guess, can\xe2\x80\x99t guess!\xe2\x80\x9d crowed Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you give it up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course in his pride he was carrying the game too far, and the\r\nmiscreants saw their chance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d they answered eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI am Peter Pan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPan!\r\n\r\nIn a moment Hook was himself again, and Smee and Starkey were his\r\nfaithful henchmen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we have him,\xe2\x80\x9d Hook shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cInto the water, Smee. Starkey, mind\r\nthe boat. Take him dead or alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaped as he spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready, boys?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d from various parts of the lagoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen lam into the pirates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who\r\ngallantly climbed into the boat and held Starkey. There was fierce\r\nstruggle, in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate\xe2\x80\x99s grasp. He\r\nwriggled overboard and John leapt after him. The dinghy drifted away.\r\n\r\nHere and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of\r\nsteel followed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at\r\ntheir own side. The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib,\r\nbut he was himself pinked in turn by Curly. Farther from the rock\r\nStarkey was pressing Slightly and the twins hard.\r\n\r\nWhere all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game.\r\n\r\nThe others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing\r\nfrom the pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of dead water\r\nround him, from which they fled like affrighted fishes.\r\n\r\nBut there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter\r\nthat circle.\r\n\r\nStrangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to the rock\r\nto breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite\r\nside. The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather\r\nthan climb. Neither knew that the other was coming. Each feeling for a\r\ngrip met the other\xe2\x80\x99s arm: in surprise they raised their heads; their\r\nfaces were almost touching; so they met.\r\n\r\nSome of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell\r\nto they had a sinking. Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would\r\nadmit it. After all, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared.\r\nBut Peter had no sinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he\r\ngnashed his pretty teeth with joy. Quick as thought he snatched a knife\r\nfrom Hook\xe2\x80\x99s belt and was about to drive it home, when he saw that he\r\nwas higher up the rock than his foe. It would not have been fighting\r\nfair. He gave the pirate a hand to help him up.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Hook bit him.\r\n\r\nNot the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It made\r\nhim quite helpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every child is\r\naffected thus the first time he is treated unfairly. All he thinks he\r\nhas a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness. After you\r\nhave been unfair to him he will love you again, but will never\r\nafterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever gets over the first\r\nunfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it, but he always forgot\r\nit. I suppose that was the real difference between him and all the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nSo when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could just\r\nstare, helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.\r\n\r\nA few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking\r\nwildly for the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white\r\nfear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary\r\noccasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but now they\r\nwere uneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and were scouring\r\nthe lagoon for them, calling them by name. They found the dinghy and\r\nwent home in it, shouting \xe2\x80\x9cPeter, Wendy\xe2\x80\x9d as they went, but no answer\r\ncame save mocking laughter from the mermaids. \xe2\x80\x9cThey must be swimming\r\nback or flying,\xe2\x80\x9d the boys concluded. They were not very anxious,\r\nbecause they had such faith in Peter. They chuckled, boylike, because\r\nthey would be late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s fault!\r\n\r\nWhen their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon,\r\nand then a feeble cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp, help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted\r\nand lay on the boy\xe2\x80\x99s arm. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the\r\nrock and then lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that\r\nthe water was rising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he\r\ncould do no more.\r\n\r\nAs they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began\r\npulling her softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him,\r\nwoke with a start, and was just in time to draw her back. But he had to\r\ntell her the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are on the rock, Wendy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is growing smaller. Soon\r\nthe water will be over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not understand even now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must go,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, almost brightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we swim or fly, Peter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had to tell her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy,\r\nwithout my help?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had to admit that she was too tired.\r\n\r\nHe moaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, anxious about him at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly nor swim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean we shall both be drowned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook how the water is rising.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They\r\nthought they would soon be no more. As they sat thus something brushed\r\nagainst Peter as light as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying\r\ntimidly, \xe2\x80\x9cCan I be of any use?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before. It\r\nhad torn itself out of his hand and floated away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael\xe2\x80\x99s kite,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter said without interest, but next moment he had\r\nseized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt lifted Michael off the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy should it not carry\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth of us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t lift two; Michael and Curly tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us draw lots,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said bravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you a lady; never.\xe2\x80\x9d Already he had tied the tail round her. She\r\nclung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\r\nWendy,\xe2\x80\x9d he pushed her from the rock; and in a few minutes she was borne\r\nout of his sight. Peter was alone on the lagoon.\r\n\r\nThe rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. Pale rays of\r\nlight tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a\r\nsound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world:\r\nthe mermaids calling to the moon.\r\n\r\nPeter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A\r\ntremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on\r\nthe sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them,\r\nand Peter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing erect on the\r\nrock again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him.\r\nIt was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cTo die will be an awfully big adventure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\nTHE NEVER BIRD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids\r\nretiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He was too far\r\naway to hear their doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where\r\nthey live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the\r\nnicest houses on the mainland), and he heard the bells.\r\n\r\nSteadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to\r\npass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only\r\nthing on the lagoon. He thought it was a piece of floating paper,\r\nperhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to\r\ndrift ashore.\r\n\r\nPresently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon\r\nthe lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide,\r\nand sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to\r\nthe weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece\r\nof paper.\r\n\r\nIt was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making\r\ndesperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her wings, in\r\na way she had learned since the nest fell into the water, she was able\r\nto some extent to guide her strange craft, but by the time Peter\r\nrecognised her she was very exhausted. She had come to save him, to\r\ngive him her nest, though there were eggs in it. I rather wonder at the\r\nbird, for though he had been nice to her, he had also sometimes\r\ntormented her. I can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling and the rest\r\nof them, she was melted because he had all his first teeth.\r\n\r\nShe called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her\r\nwhat she was doing there; but of course neither of them understood the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s language. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds\r\nfreely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a\r\nstory, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but\r\ntruth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened. Well,\r\nnot only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94want\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94get\xe2\x80\x94into\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94nest,\xe2\x80\x9d the bird called, speaking as slowly\r\nand distinctly as possible, \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x94then\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x94drift\xe2\x80\x94ashore,\r\nbut\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94am\xe2\x80\x94too\xe2\x80\x94tired\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94bring\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x94any\xe2\x80\x94nearer\xe2\x80\x94so\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94must\xe2\x80\x94try\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94swim\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you quacking about?\xe2\x80\x9d Peter answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you let the\r\nnest drift as usual?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94want\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the bird said, and repeated it all over.\r\n\r\nThen Peter tried slow and distinct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94are\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94quacking\xe2\x80\x94about?\xe2\x80\x9d and so on.\r\n\r\nThe Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou dunderheaded little jay!\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you do as I\r\ntell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted\r\nhotly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo are you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by\r\none last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. Then up\r\nshe flew; deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.\r\n\r\nThen at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks\r\nto the bird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his\r\nthanks, however, that she hung there in the sky; it was not even to\r\nwatch him get into the nest; it was to see what he did with her eggs.\r\n\r\nThere were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and\r\nreflected. The bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see\r\nthe last of them; but she could not help peeping between the feathers.\r\n\r\nI forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock,\r\ndriven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of\r\nburied treasure. The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and\r\nwhen in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds,\r\npearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for\r\nfood, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been\r\nplayed upon them. The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung\r\nhis hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim. Peter put the\r\neggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon. It floated beautifully.\r\n\r\nThe Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her\r\nadmiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. Then\r\nhe got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his\r\nshirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the\r\nhat and once more sat snugly on her eggs. She drifted in one direction,\r\nand he was borne off in another, both cheering.\r\n\r\nOf course when Peter landed he beached his barque in a place where the\r\nbird would easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that\r\nshe abandoned the nest. It drifted about till it went to pieces, and\r\noften Starkey came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter\r\nfeelings watched the bird sitting on his hat. As we shall not see her\r\nagain, it may be worth mentioning here that all Never birds now build\r\nin that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take\r\nan airing.\r\n\r\nGreat were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground\r\nalmost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the\r\nkite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest\r\nadventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. This so\r\ninflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up\r\nstill longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in\r\nhaving them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the\r\nlateness of the hour, and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cTo bed, to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d in a voice that had\r\nto be obeyed. Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out\r\nbandages to every one, and they played till bed-time at limping about\r\nand carrying their arms in slings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X.\r\nTHE HAPPY HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nOne important result of the brush on the lagoon was that it made the\r\nredskins their friends. Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful\r\nfate, and now there was nothing she and her braves would not do for\r\nhim. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under the\r\nground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could\r\nnot be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung about, smoking the\r\npipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bits to eat.\r\n\r\nThey called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves before\r\nhim; and he liked this tremendously, so that it was not really good for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great white father,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say to them in a very lordly manner,\r\nas they grovelled at his feet, \xe2\x80\x9cis glad to see the Piccaninny warriors\r\nprotecting his wigwam from the pirates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe Tiger Lily,\xe2\x80\x9d that lovely creature would reply. \xe2\x80\x9cPeter Pan save me,\r\nme his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his\r\ndue, and he would answer condescendingly, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is good. Peter Pan has\r\nspoken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlways when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cPeter Pan has spoken,\xe2\x80\x9d it meant that they must\r\nnow shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were\r\nby no means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as\r\njust ordinary braves. They said \xe2\x80\x9cHow-do?\xe2\x80\x9d to them, and things like\r\nthat; and what annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all\r\nright.\r\n\r\nSecretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far too\r\nloyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father. \xe2\x80\x9cFather\r\nknows best,\xe2\x80\x9d she always said, whatever her private opinion must be. Her\r\nprivate opinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the\r\nNight of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day,\r\nas if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now\r\nthe redskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below,\r\nthe children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had\r\ngone out to get the time. The way you got the time on the island was to\r\nfind the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.\r\n\r\nThe meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the\r\nboard, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and\r\nrecriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening. To\r\nbe sure, she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them\r\ngrabbing things, and then excusing themselves by saying that Tootles\r\nhad pushed their elbow. There was a fixed rule that they must never hit\r\nback at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by\r\nraising the right arm politely and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI complain of so-and-so;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut what usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had told them\r\nthat they were not all to speak at once. \xe2\x80\x9cIs your mug empty, Slightly\r\ndarling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite empty, mummy,\xe2\x80\x9d Slightly said, after looking into an\r\nimaginary mug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even begun to drink his milk,\xe2\x80\x9d Nibs interposed.\r\n\r\nThis was telling, and Slightly seized his chance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI complain of Nibs,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried promptly.\r\n\r\nJohn, however, had held up his hand first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, John?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I sit in Peter\xe2\x80\x99s chair, as he is not here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit in father\xe2\x80\x99s chair, John!\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy was scandalised. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not really our father,\xe2\x80\x9d John answered. \xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know how\r\na father does till I showed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was grumbling. \xe2\x80\x9cWe complain of John,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the twins.\r\n\r\nTootles held up his hand. He was so much the humblest of them, indeed\r\nhe was the only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d Tootles said diffidently, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I could be father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Tootles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce Tootles began, which was not very often, he had a silly way of\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I can\xe2\x80\x99t be father,\xe2\x80\x9d he said heavily, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose, Michael, you\r\nwould let me be baby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael rapped out. He was already in his basket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I can\xe2\x80\x99t be baby,\xe2\x80\x9d Tootles said, getting heavier and heavier and\r\nheavier, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think I could be a twin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the twins; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s awfully difficult to be a twin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I can\xe2\x80\x99t be anything important,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tootles, \xe2\x80\x9cwould any of you\r\nlike to see me do a trick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d they all replied.\r\n\r\nThen at last he stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really any hope,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe hateful telling broke out again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlightly is coughing on the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe twins began with cheese-cakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurly is taking both butter and honey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNibs is speaking with his mouth full.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI complain of the twins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI complain of Curly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI complain of Nibs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, oh dear,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wendy, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I sometimes think that\r\nspinsters are to be envied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe told them to clear away, and sat down to her work-basket, a heavy\r\nload of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWendy,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Michael, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m too big for a cradle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have somebody in a cradle,\xe2\x80\x9d she said almost tartly, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\r\nare the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile she sewed they played around her; such a group of happy faces and\r\ndancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very\r\nfamiliar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but we are looking\r\non it for the last time.\r\n\r\nThere was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to\r\nrecognize it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChildren, I hear your father\xe2\x80\x99s step. He likes you to meet him at the\r\ndoor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbove, the redskins crouched before Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch well, braves. I have spoken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him from his\r\ntree. As so often before, but never again.\r\n\r\nHe had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for Wendy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter, you just spoil them, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy simpered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, old lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, hanging up his gun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was me told him mothers are called old lady,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael whispered to\r\nCurly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI complain of Michael,\xe2\x80\x9d said Curly instantly.\r\n\r\nThe first twin came to Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cFather, we want to dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDance away, my little man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, who was in high good humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we want you to dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter was really the best dancer among them, but he pretended to be\r\nscandalised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe! My old bones would rattle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mummy too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wendy, \xe2\x80\x9cthe mother of such an armful, dance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut on a Saturday night,\xe2\x80\x9d Slightly insinuated.\r\n\r\nIt was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for they\r\nhad long lost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do\r\nanything special they said this was Saturday night, and then they did\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is Saturday night, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said, relenting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople of our figure, Wendy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is only among our own progeny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, old lady,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by the fire\r\nand looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing\r\nmore pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day\xe2\x80\x99s toil is over\r\nthan to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is sweet, Peter, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said, frightfully gratified.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter, I think Curly has your nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael takes after you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went to him and put her hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith such a large family, of course, I have\r\nnow passed my best, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to change me, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Wendy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCertainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably,\r\nblinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, a little scared. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only\r\nmake-believe, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, that I am their father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said primly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued apologetically, \xe2\x80\x9cit would make me seem so old\r\nto be their real father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not really, Wendy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if you don\xe2\x80\x99t wish it,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; and she distinctly heard his\r\nsigh of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cPeter,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, trying to speak firmly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are\r\nyour exact feelings to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose of a devoted son, Wendy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and went and sat by herself at the extreme\r\nend of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so queer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, frankly puzzled, \xe2\x80\x9cand Tiger Lily is just\r\nthe same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she says it is\r\nnot my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, it is not,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy replied with frightful emphasis. Now we\r\nknow why she was prejudiced against the redskins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t for a lady to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter said, a little nettled. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Tinker Bell\r\nwill tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy retorted scornfully. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is\r\nan abandoned little creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out\r\nsomething impudent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says she glories in being abandoned,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter interpreted.\r\n\r\nHe had a sudden idea. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Tink wants to be my mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou silly ass!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tinker Bell in a passion.\r\n\r\nShe had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost agree with her,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! But she\r\nhad been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before the\r\nnight was out. If she had known she would not have snapped.\r\n\r\nNone of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their ignorance\r\ngave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on\r\nthe island, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it.\r\nThey sang and danced in their night-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy\r\nsong it was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own\r\nshadows, little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them,\r\nfrom whom they would shrink in real fear. So uproariously gay was the\r\ndance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it! It\r\nwas a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the\r\npillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may\r\nnever meet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but\r\nthe beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the\r\nothers but himself, and he said gloomily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is the\r\nend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then at last they all got into bed for Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s story, the story\r\nthey loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell\r\nthis story he left the room or put his hands over his ears; and\r\npossibly if he had done either of those things this time they might all\r\nstill be on the island. But to-night he remained on his stool; and we\r\nshall see what happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI.\r\nWENDY\xe2\x80\x99S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wendy, settling down to her story, with Michael at\r\nher feet and seven boys in the bed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was once a gentleman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had rather he had been a lady,\xe2\x80\x9d Curly said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish he had been a white rat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nibs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuiet,\xe2\x80\x9d their mother admonished them. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a lady also, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mummy,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the first twin, \xe2\x80\x9cyou mean that there is a lady also,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you?

They had three descendants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is descendants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are one, Twin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear that, John? I am a descendant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDescendants are only children,\xe2\x80\x9d said John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, oh dear,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Wendy. \xe2\x80\x9cNow these three children had a\r\nfaithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and\r\nchained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an awfully good story,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nibs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey flew away,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy continued, \xe2\x80\x9cto the Neverland, where the lost\r\nchildren are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just thought they did,\xe2\x80\x9d Curly broke in excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nit is, but I just thought they did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Wendy,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tootles, \xe2\x80\x9cwas one of the lost children called\r\nTootles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in a story.

Can they be John and Michael? They are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98See, dear brothers,\xe2\x80\x99 says Wendy pointing upwards, \xe2\x80\x98there is the\r\nwindow still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our sublime\r\nfaith in a mother\xe2\x80\x99s love.\xe2\x80\x99 So up they flew to their mummy and daddy,\r\nand pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which we draw a veil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair\r\nnarrator herself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we skip\r\nlike the most heartless things in the world, which is what children\r\nare, but so attractive; and we have an entirely selfish time, and then\r\nwhen we have need of special attention we nobly return for it,\r\nconfident that we shall be rewarded instead of smacked.\r\n\r\nSo great indeed was their faith in a mother\xe2\x80\x99s love that they felt they\r\ncould afford to be callous for a bit longer.\r\n\r\nBut there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he\r\nuttered a hollow groan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Peter?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, running to him, thinking he was ill.\r\nShe felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it,\r\nPeter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t that kind of pain,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter replied darkly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what kind is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWendy, you are wrong about mothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation;\r\nand with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought like you that my mother would always\r\nkeep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and\r\nmoons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had\r\nforgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my\r\nbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it\r\nscared them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure mothers are like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo this was the truth about mothers. The toads!\r\n\r\nStill it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child\r\nwhen he should give in. \xe2\x80\x9cWendy, let us go home,\xe2\x80\x9d cried John and Michael\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, clutching them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lost boys bewildered. They knew in what they\r\ncalled their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother,\r\nand that it is only the mothers who think you can\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt once,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had come\r\nto her: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps mother is in half mourning by this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, and she\r\nsaid to him rather sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cPeter, will you make the necessary\r\narrangements?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish it,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, as coolly as if she had asked him to pass\r\nthe nuts.\r\n\r\nNot so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If she did not mind\r\nthe parting, he was going to show her, was Peter, that neither did he.\r\n\r\nBut of course he cared very much; and he was so full of wrath against\r\ngrown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he\r\ngot inside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at\r\nthe rate of about five to a second. He did this because there is a\r\nsaying in the Neverland that, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies;\r\nand Peter was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nThen having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he\r\nreturned to the home, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his\r\nabsence. Panic-stricken at the thought of losing Wendy the lost boys\r\nhad advanced upon her threateningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be worse than before she came,\xe2\x80\x9d they cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shan\xe2\x80\x99t let her go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s keep her prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, chain her up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTootles,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI appeal to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas it not strange? She appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest one.\r\n\r\nGrandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he dropped\r\nhis silliness and spoke with dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am just Tootles,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand nobody minds me. But the first who\r\ndoes not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood him\r\nseverely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew back his hanger; and for that instant his sun was at noon. The\r\nothers held back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once\r\nthat they would get no support from him. He would keep no girl in the\r\nNeverland against her will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWendy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, striding up and down, \xe2\x80\x9cI have asked the redskins to\r\nguide you through the wood, as flying tires you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Peter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be\r\nobeyed, \xe2\x80\x9cTinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her, Nibs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really\r\nbeen sitting up in bed listening for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you? How dare you? Go away,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to get up, Tink,\xe2\x80\x9d Nibs called, \xe2\x80\x9cand take Wendy on a journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she\r\nwas jolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in\r\nstill more offensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says she won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination,\r\nwhereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s chamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTink,\xe2\x80\x9d he rapped out, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t get up and dress at once I will\r\nopen the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your _neglig\xc3\xa9e_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis made her leap to the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cWho said I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t getting up?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncried.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now\r\nequipped with John and Michael for the journey. By this time they were\r\ndejected, not merely because they were about to lose her, but also\r\nbecause they felt that she was going off to something nice to which\r\nthey had not been invited. Novelty was beckoning to them as usual.\r\n\r\nCrediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear ones,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif you will all come with me I feel almost sure\r\nI can get my father and mother to adopt you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was\r\nthinking exclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut won\xe2\x80\x99t they think us rather a handful?\xe2\x80\x9d Nibs asked in the middle of\r\nhis jump.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, \xe2\x80\x9cit will only mean having\r\na few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind the screens\r\non first Thursdays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter, can we go?\xe2\x80\x9d they all cried imploringly. They took it for\r\ngranted that if they went he would go also, but really they scarcely\r\ncared. Thus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert\r\ntheir dearest ones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediately they\r\nrushed to get their things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said, thinking she had put everything right, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam going to give you your medicine before you go.\xe2\x80\x9d She loved to give\r\nthem medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it was\r\nonly water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle\r\nand counted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On\r\nthis occasion, however, she did not give Peter his draught, for just as\r\nshe had prepared it, she saw a look on his face that made her heart\r\nsink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet your things, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, shaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, pretending indifference, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going with you,\r\nWendy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Peter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo show that her departure would leave him unmoved, he skipped up and\r\ndown the room, playing gaily on his heartless pipes. She had to run\r\nabout after him, though it was rather undignified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo find your mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she coaxed.\r\n\r\nNow, if Peter had ever quite had a mother, he no longer missed her. He\r\ncould do very well without one. He had thought them out, and remembered\r\nonly their bad points.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Wendy decisively; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps she would say I was old,\r\nand I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Peter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so the others had to be told.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter not coming! They gazed blankly at him, their sticks over their\r\nbacks, and on each stick a bundle. Their first thought was that if\r\nPeter was not going he had probably changed his mind about letting them\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nBut he was far too proud for that. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you find your mothers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\ndarkly, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will like them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most\r\nof them began to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces said,\r\nwere they not noodles to want to go?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Peter, \xe2\x80\x9cno fuss, no blubbering; good-bye, Wendy;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nhe held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must really go now, for\r\nhe had something important to do.\r\n\r\nShe had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he would\r\nprefer a thimble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will remember about changing your flannels, Peter?\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nlingering over him. She was always so particular about their flannels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will take your medicine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. Peter,\r\nhowever, was not the kind that breaks down before other people. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nyou ready, Tinker Bell?\xe2\x80\x9d he called out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen lead the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it was at\r\nthis moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the\r\nredskins. Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent with\r\nshrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths\r\nopened and remained open. Wendy fell on her knees, but her arms were\r\nextended toward Peter. All arms were extended to him, as if suddenly\r\nblown in his direction; they were beseeching him mutely not to desert\r\nthem. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he thought he had\r\nslain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII.\r\nTHE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the\r\nunscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins\r\nfairly is beyond the wit of the white man.\r\n\r\nBy all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin\r\nwho attacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before\r\nthe dawn, at which time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its\r\nlowest ebb. The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on\r\nthe summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream\r\nruns, for it is destruction to be too far from water. There they await\r\nthe onslaught, the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and\r\ntreading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just\r\nbefore the dawn. Through the long black night the savage scouts\r\nwriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. The\r\nbrushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has\r\ndived. Not a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a\r\nwonderful imitation of the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is\r\nanswered by other braves; and some of them do it even better than the\r\ncoyotes, who are not very good at it. So the chill hours wear on, and\r\nthe long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface who has to live\r\nthrough it for the first time; but to the trained hand those ghastly\r\ncalls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the\r\nnight is marching.\r\n\r\nThat this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that in\r\ndisregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and\r\ntheir whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his.\r\nThey left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of\r\ntheir tribe. With that alertness of the senses which is at once the\r\nmarvel and despair of civilised peoples, they knew that the pirates\r\nwere on the island from the moment one of them trod on a dry stick; and\r\nin an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began. Every foot\r\nof ground between the spot where Hook had landed his forces and the\r\nhome under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing their\r\nmocassins with the heels in front. They found only one hillock with a\r\nstream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he must establish\r\nhimself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus mapped\r\nout with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins\r\nfolded their blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is\r\nto them, the pearl of manhood squatted above the children\xe2\x80\x99s home,\r\nawaiting the cold moment when they should deal pale death.\r\n\r\nHere dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which\r\nthey were to put him at break of day, those confiding savages were\r\nfound by the treacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by\r\nsuch of the scouts as escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to\r\nhave paused at the rising ground, though it is certain that in that\r\ngrey light he must have seen it: no thought of waiting to be attacked\r\nappears from first to last to have visited his subtle mind; he would\r\nnot even hold off till the night was nearly spent; on he pounded with\r\nno policy but to fall to. What could the bewildered scouts do, masters\r\nas they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot\r\nhelplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they\r\ngave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry.\r\n\r\nAround the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and\r\nthey suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell\r\nfrom their eyes then the film through which they had looked at victory.\r\nNo more would they torture at the stake. For them the happy\r\nhunting-grounds was now. They knew it; but as their father\xe2\x80\x99s sons they\r\nacquitted themselves. Even then they had time to gather in a phalanx\r\nthat would have been hard to break had they risen quickly, but this\r\nthey were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race. It is\r\nwritten that the noble savage must never express surprise in the\r\npresence of the white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the\r\npirates must have been to them, they remained stationary for a moment,\r\nnot a muscle moving; as if the foe had come by invitation. Then,\r\nindeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, they seized their weapons, and\r\nthe air was torn with the war-cry; but it was now too late.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a\r\nfight. Thus perished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not\r\nall unavenged did they die, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to\r\ndisturb the Spanish Main no more, and among others who bit the dust\r\nwere Geo. Scourie, Chas. Turley, and the Alsatian Foggerty. Turley fell\r\nto the tomahawk of the terrible Panther, who ultimately cut a way\r\nthrough the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of the tribe.\r\n\r\nTo what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for\r\nthe historian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the\r\nproper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered; and in\r\njudging him it is only fair to take this into account. What he should\r\nperhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to\r\nfollow a new method. On the other hand, this, as destroying the element\r\nof surprise, would have made his strategy of no avail, so that the\r\nwhole question is beset with difficulties. One cannot at least withhold\r\na reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme,\r\nand the fell genius with which it was carried out.\r\n\r\nWhat were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment?\r\nFain would his dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping their\r\ncutlasses, they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and\r\nsquinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation\r\nmust have been in his heart, but his face did not reflect it: ever a\r\ndark and solitary enigma, he stood aloof from his followers in spirit\r\nas in substance.\r\n\r\nThe night\xe2\x80\x99s work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he had\r\ncome out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he\r\nshould get at the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their\r\nband, but chiefly Pan.\r\n\r\nPeter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man\xe2\x80\x99s hatred\r\nof him. True he had flung Hook\xe2\x80\x99s arm to the crocodile, but even this\r\nand the increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to the\r\ncrocodile\xe2\x80\x99s pertinacity, hardly account for a vindictiveness so\r\nrelentless and malignant. The truth is that there was a something about\r\nPeter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It was not his\r\ncourage, it was not his engaging appearance, it was not\xe2\x80\x94. There is no\r\nbeating about the bush, for we know quite well what it was, and have\r\ngot to tell. It was Peter\xe2\x80\x99s cockiness.\r\n\r\nThis had got on Hook\xe2\x80\x99s nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at\r\nnight it disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured\r\nman felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.\r\n\r\nThe question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs\r\ndown? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest\r\nones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple\r\nto ram them down with poles.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang\r\nof the weapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all\r\nappealing with outstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as\r\ntheir mouths close, and their arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium\r\nabove has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce\r\ngust of wind; but they know that in the passing it has determined their\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nWhich side had won?\r\n\r\nThe pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the\r\nquestion put by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the redskins have won,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will beat the tom-tom; it is\r\nalways their sign of victory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never hear the tom-tom again,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, but inaudibly of\r\ncourse, for strict silence had been enjoined. To his amazement Hook\r\nsigned him to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an\r\nunderstanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably,\r\nhad this simple man admired Hook so much.\r\n\r\nTwice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen\r\ngleefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tom-tom,\xe2\x80\x9d the miscreants heard Peter cry; \xe2\x80\x9can Indian victory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black\r\nhearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to\r\nPeter. This puzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were\r\nswallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the\r\ntrees. They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and\r\nsilently Hook gave his orders: one man to each tree, and the others to\r\narrange themselves in a line two yards apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\nDO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to\r\nemerge from his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of\r\nCecco, who flung him to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him\r\nto Bill Jukes, who flung him to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one\r\nto another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate. All the boys\r\nwere plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner; and several of\r\nthem were in the air at a time, like bales of goods flung from hand to\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nA different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With\r\nironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his\r\narm, escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged. He\r\ndid it with such an air, he was so frightfully _distingu\xc3\xa9_, that she\r\nwas too fascinated to cry out. She was only a little girl.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced\r\nher, and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results.\r\nHad she haughtily unhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of\r\nher), she would have been hurled through the air like the others, and\r\nthen Hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the\r\nchildren; and had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered\r\nSlightly\xe2\x80\x99s secret, and without the secret he could not presently have\r\nmade his foul attempt on Peter\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nThey were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their\r\nknees close to their ears; and for the trussing of them the black\r\npirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces. All went well until\r\nSlightly\xe2\x80\x99s turn came, when he was found to be like those irritating\r\nparcels that use up all the string in going round and leave no tags\r\nwith which to tie a knot. The pirates kicked him in their rage, just as\r\nyou kick the parcel (though in fairness you should kick the string);\r\nand strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence.\r\nHis lip was curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely\r\nsweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in\r\none part he bulged out in another, Hook\xe2\x80\x99s master mind had gone far\r\nbeneath Slightly\xe2\x80\x99s surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and\r\nhis exultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the\r\ngills, knew that Hook had surprised his secret, which was this, that no\r\nboy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick.\r\nPoor Slightly, most wretched of all the children now, for he was in a\r\npanic about Peter, bitterly regretted what he had done. Madly addicted\r\nto the drinking of water when he was hot, he had swelled in consequence\r\nto his present girth, and instead of reducing himself to fit his tree\r\nhe had, unknown to the others, whittled his tree to make it fit him.\r\n\r\nSufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay\r\nat his mercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the\r\nsubterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed\r\nthat the captives were to be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nHow to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be\r\nrolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a\r\nmorass. Again Hook\xe2\x80\x99s genius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that\r\nthe little house must be used as a conveyance. The children were flung\r\ninto it, four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders, the others\r\nfell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange\r\nprocession set off through the wood. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether any of the\r\nchildren were crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound; but as the\r\nlittle house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of\r\nsmoke issued from its chimney as if defying Hook.\r\n\r\nHook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of\r\npity for him that may have remained in the pirate\xe2\x80\x99s infuriated breast.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling\r\nnight was to tiptoe to Slightly\xe2\x80\x99s tree, and make sure that it provided\r\nhim with a passage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill\r\nomen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might\r\nplay refreshingly through his hair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue\r\neyes were as soft as the periwinkle. Intently he listened for any sound\r\nfrom the nether world, but all was as silent below as above; the house\r\nunder the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void.\r\nWas that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot of Slightly\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntree, with his dagger in his hand?\r\n\r\nThere was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak\r\nslip softly to the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood\r\nstood on them, he stepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a\r\nmoment he had to stop there and wipe his brow, which was dripping like\r\na candle. Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown.\r\n\r\nHe arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again,\r\nbiting at his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became\r\naccustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees\r\ntook shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long\r\nsought for and found at last, was the great bed. On the bed lay Peter\r\nfast asleep.\r\n\r\nUnaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a\r\nlittle time after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no\r\ndoubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not\r\ncare. Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy.\r\nThen he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still\r\nmore; for she had always tucked them inside it, because you never know\r\nthat you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night. Then he nearly\r\ncried; but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed\r\ninstead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful\r\nthan the dreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from\r\nthese dreams, though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I\r\nthink, with the riddle of his existence. At such times it had been\r\nWendy\xe2\x80\x99s custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap,\r\nsoothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer\r\nto put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should not\r\nknow of the indignity to which she had subjected him. But on this\r\noccasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped\r\nover the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part\r\nof his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the\r\nlittle pearls.\r\n\r\nThus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the\r\ntree looking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of\r\ncompassion disturb his sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he\r\nloved flowers (I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no\r\nmean performer on the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted,\r\nthe idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly. Mastered by his\r\nbetter self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nWhat stayed him was Peter\xe2\x80\x99s impertinent appearance as he slept. The\r\nopen mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a\r\npersonification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one\r\nmay hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness.\r\nThey steeled Hook\xe2\x80\x99s heart. If his rage had broken him into a hundred\r\npieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt\r\nat the sleeper.\r\n\r\nThough a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in\r\ndarkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered\r\nan obstacle, the door of Slightly\xe2\x80\x99s tree. It did not entirely fill the\r\naperture, and he had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, he\r\nfound to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach. To his\r\ndisordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung\r\nhimself against it. Was his enemy to escape him after all?\r\n\r\nBut what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmedicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was\r\nstraightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.\r\n\r\nLest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a\r\ndreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that\r\nhad come into his possession. These he had boiled down into a yellow\r\nliquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent\r\npoison in existence.\r\n\r\nFive drops of this he now added to Peter\xe2\x80\x99s cup. His hand shook, but it\r\nwas in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided\r\nglancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely\r\nto avoid spilling. Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim,\r\nand turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree. As he emerged\r\nat the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole.\r\nDonning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around\r\nhim, holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the\r\nnight, of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to\r\nhimself, stole away through the trees.\r\n\r\nPeter slept on. The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement\r\nin darkness; but still he slept. It must have been not less than ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened\r\nby he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nSoft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt\r\nfor his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor long there was no answer: then again the knock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nHe was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached\r\nthe door. Unlike Slightly\xe2\x80\x99s door, it filled the aperture, so that he\r\ncould not see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t open unless you speak,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter cried.\r\n\r\nThen at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me in, Peter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her\r\nface flushed and her dress stained with mud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you could never guess!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and offered him three guesses.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut with it!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long\r\nas the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, she told of the\r\ncapture of Wendy and the boys.\r\n\r\nPeter\xe2\x80\x99s heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on\r\nthe pirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll rescue her!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt he\r\nthought of something he could do to please her. He could take his\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nHis hand closed on the fatal draught.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as\r\nhe sped through the forest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is poisoned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoisoned? Who could have poisoned it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be silly. How could Hook have got down here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the\r\ndark secret of Slightly\xe2\x80\x99s tree. Nevertheless Hook\xe2\x80\x99s words had left no\r\nroom for doubt. The cup was poisoned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, quite believing himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI never fell asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one\r\nof her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught,\r\nand drained it to the dregs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Peter, suddenly afraid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was poisoned, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d she told him softly; \xe2\x80\x9cand now I am going to\r\nbe dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Tink, did you drink it to save me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why, Tink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on\r\nhis shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou silly ass,\xe2\x80\x9d and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nHis head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt\r\nnear her in distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and\r\nhe knew that if it went out she would be no more. She liked his tears\r\nso much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it.\r\n\r\nHer voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said.\r\nThen he made it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well\r\nagain if children believed in fairies.\r\n\r\nPeter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was\r\nnight time; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the\r\nNeverland, and who were therefore nearer to him than you think: boys\r\nand girls in their nighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung\r\nfrom trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\nTink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.\r\n\r\nShe fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you believe,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to them, \xe2\x80\x9cclap your hands; don\xe2\x80\x99t let Tink\r\ndie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMany clapped.\r\n\r\nSome didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nA few beasts hissed.\r\n\r\nThe clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to\r\ntheir nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink\r\nwas saved. First her voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed,\r\nthen she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than\r\never. She never thought of thanking those who believed, but she would\r\nhave liked to get at the ones who had hissed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now to rescue Wendy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree,\r\nbegirt with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his\r\nperilous quest. It was not such a night as he would have chosen. He had\r\nhoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted\r\nshould escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low\r\nwould have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus disturbing\r\nbirds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.\r\n\r\nHe regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange\r\nnames that they are very wild and difficult of approach.\r\n\r\nThere was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at\r\nwhich happily he was an adept. But in what direction, for he could not\r\nbe sure that the children had been taken to the ship? A light fall of\r\nsnow had obliterated all footmarks; and a deathly silence pervaded the\r\nisland, as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of the recent\r\ncarnage. He had taught the children something of the forest lore that\r\nhe had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell, and knew that\r\nin their dire hour they were not likely to forget it. Slightly, if he\r\nhad an opportunity, would blaze the trees, for instance, Curly would\r\ndrop seeds, and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important\r\nplace. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and he could\r\nnot wait. The upper world had called him, but would give no help.\r\n\r\nThe crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound,\r\nnot a movement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the\r\nnext tree, or stalking him from behind.\r\n\r\nHe swore this terrible oath: \xe2\x80\x9cHook or me this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across\r\na space on which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his\r\ndagger at the ready. He was frightfully happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV.\r\nTHE PIRATE SHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nOne green light squinting over Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s Creek, which is near the mouth of\r\nthe pirate river, marked where the brig, the _Jolly Roger_, lay, low in\r\nthe water; a rakish-looking craft foul to the hull, every beam in her\r\ndetestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers. She was the\r\ncannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for she\r\nfloated immune in the horror of her name.\r\n\r\nShe was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from\r\nher could have reached the shore. There was little sound, and none\r\nagreeable save the whir of the ship\xe2\x80\x99s sewing machine at which Smee sat,\r\never industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic\r\nSmee. I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic, unless it were\r\nbecause he was so pathetically unaware of it; but even strong men had\r\nto turn hastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer\r\nevenings he had touched the fount of Hook\xe2\x80\x99s tears and made it flow. Of\r\nthis, as of almost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious.\r\n\r\nA few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma of\r\nthe night; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards; and\r\nthe exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the\r\ndeck, where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or\r\nthat out of Hook\xe2\x80\x99s reach, lest he should claw them mechanically in\r\npassing.\r\n\r\nHook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of\r\ntriumph. Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the\r\nother boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. It was his\r\ngrimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel; and\r\nknowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could we be surprised\r\nhad he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his\r\nsuccess?\r\n\r\nBut there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action\r\nof his sombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.\r\n\r\nHe was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the\r\nquietude of the night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This\r\ninscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs.\r\nThey were socially inferior to him.\r\n\r\nHook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at\r\nthis date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the\r\nlines must already have guessed, he had been at a famous public school;\r\nand its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed\r\nthey are largely concerned. Thus it was offensive to him even now to\r\nboard a ship in the same dress in which he grappled her, and he still\r\nadhered in his walk to the school\xe2\x80\x99s distinguished slouch. But above all\r\nhe retained the passion for good form.\r\n\r\nGood form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew that\r\nthis is all that really matters.\r\n\r\nFrom far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and\r\nthrough them came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when\r\none cannot sleep. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you been good form to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d was their eternal\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?\xe2\x80\x9d the tap-tap\r\nfrom his school replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the only man whom Barbecue feared,\xe2\x80\x9d he urged, \xe2\x80\x9cand Flint feared\r\nBarbecue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBarbecue, Flint\xe2\x80\x94what house?\xe2\x80\x9d came the cutting retort.\r\n\r\nMost disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about\r\ngood form?\r\n\r\nHis vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within him\r\nsharper than the iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped\r\ndown his tallow countenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he drew\r\nhis sleeve across his face, but there was no damming that trickle.\r\n\r\nAh, envy not Hook.\r\n\r\nThere came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution. It was as if\r\nPeter\xe2\x80\x99s terrible oath had boarded the ship. Hook felt a gloomy desire\r\nto make his dying speech, lest presently there should be no time for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter for Hook,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cif he had had less ambition!\xe2\x80\x9d It was in\r\nhis darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo little children to love me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him\r\nbefore; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he\r\nmuttered to himself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under\r\nthe conviction that all children feared him.\r\n\r\nFeared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that\r\nnight who did not already love him. He had said horrid things to them\r\nand hit them with the palm of his hand, because he could not hit with\r\nhis fist, but they had only clung to him the more. Michael had tried on\r\nhis spectacles.\r\n\r\nTo tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it,\r\nbut it seemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his\r\nmind: why do they find Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the\r\nsleuth-hound that he was. If Smee was lovable, what was it that made\r\nhim so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGood form?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHad the bo\xe2\x80\x99sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of\r\nall?\r\n\r\nHe remembered that you have to prove you don\xe2\x80\x99t know you have it before\r\nyou are eligible for Pop.\r\n\r\nWith a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee\xe2\x80\x99s head; but he did\r\nnot tear. What arrested him was this reflection:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad form!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Hook was as impotent as he was damp, and he fell forward\r\nlike a cut flower.\r\n\r\nHis dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly\r\nrelaxed; and they broke into a bacchanalian dance, which brought him to\r\nhis feet at once, all traces of human weakness gone, as if a bucket of\r\nwater had passed over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuiet, you scugs,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cor I\xe2\x80\x99ll cast anchor in you;\xe2\x80\x9d and at once\r\nthe din was hushed. \xe2\x80\x9cAre all the children chained, so that they cannot\r\nfly away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen hoist them up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy,\r\nand ranged in line in front of him. For a time he seemed unconscious of\r\ntheir presence. He lolled at his ease, humming, not unmelodiously,\r\nsnatches of a rude song, and fingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon\r\nthe light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, bullies,\xe2\x80\x9d he said briskly, \xe2\x80\x9csix of you walk the plank\r\nto-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it to\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t irritate him unnecessarily,\xe2\x80\x9d had been Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s instructions in\r\nthe hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hated the idea\r\nof signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would be\r\nprudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a\r\nsomewhat silly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be\r\nthe buffer. All children know this about mothers, and despise them for\r\nit, but make constant use of it.\r\n\r\nSo Tootles explained prudently, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, sir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think my mother\r\nwould like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a\r\npirate, Slightly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x9d as if\r\nhe wished things had been otherwise. \xe2\x80\x9cWould your mother like you to be\r\na pirate, Twin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first twin, as clever as the others.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNibs, would\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStow this gab,\xe2\x80\x9d roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing John, \xe2\x80\x9cyou look as if you had a little\r\npluck in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and\r\nhe was struck by Hook\xe2\x80\x99s picking him out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\ndiffidently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a good name too. We\xe2\x80\x99ll call you that here, bully, if you join.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, Michael?\xe2\x80\x9d asked John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you call me if I join?\xe2\x80\x9d Michael demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlackbeard Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMichael was naturally impressed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, John?\xe2\x80\x9d He wanted\r\nJohn to decide, and John wanted him to decide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we still be respectful subjects of the King?\xe2\x80\x9d John inquired.\r\n\r\nThrough Hook\xe2\x80\x99s teeth came the answer: \xe2\x80\x9cYou would have to swear, \xe2\x80\x98Down\r\nwith the King.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I refuse,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I refuse,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Michael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRule Britannia!\xe2\x80\x9d squeaked Curly.\r\n\r\nThe infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco\r\npreparing the fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when Wendy was\r\nbrought up.\r\n\r\nNo words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the\r\nboys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all\r\nthat she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years. There was\r\nnot a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written\r\nwith your finger \xe2\x80\x9cDirty pig\xe2\x80\x9d; and she had already written it on\r\nseveral. But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought, of\r\ncourse, save for them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, my beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are to see\r\nyour children walk the plank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had\r\nsoiled his ruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a\r\nhasty gesture he tried to hide it, but he was too late.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they to die?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful contempt\r\nthat he nearly fainted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are,\xe2\x80\x9d he snarled. \xe2\x80\x9cSilence all,\xe2\x80\x9d he called gloatingly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s last words to her children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Wendy was grand. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are my last words, dear boys,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel that I have a message to you from your real\r\nmothers, and it is this: \xe2\x80\x98We hope our sons will die like English\r\ngentlemen.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ngoing to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat my mother hopes. John, what are\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Hook had found his voice again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTie her up!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\r\n\r\nIt was Smee who tied her to the mast. \xe2\x80\x9cSee here, honey,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll save you if you promise to be my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut not even for Smee would she make such a promise. \xe2\x80\x9cI would almost\r\nrather have no children at all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said disdainfully.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to\r\nthe mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they\r\nwere about to take. They were no longer able to hope that they would\r\nwalk it manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from them; they\r\ncould stare and shiver only.\r\n\r\nHook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward\r\nWendy. His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the\r\nboys walking the plank one by one. But he never reached her, he never\r\nheard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her. He heard something\r\nelse instead.\r\n\r\nIt was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.\r\n\r\nThey all heard it\xe2\x80\x94pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was\r\nblown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded,\r\nbut toward Hook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him\r\nalone, and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators.\r\n\r\nVery frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as\r\nif he had been clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.\r\n\r\nThe sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cThe crocodile is about to board the ship!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no\r\nintrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully\r\nalone, any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell:\r\nbut the gigantic brain of Hook was still working, and under its\r\nguidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound\r\nas he could go. The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and\r\nit was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHide me!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried hoarsely.\r\n\r\nThey gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was\r\ncoming aboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate.\r\n\r\nOnly when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of\r\nthe boys so that they could rush to the ship\xe2\x80\x99s side to see the\r\ncrocodile climbing it. Then they got the strangest surprise of the\r\nNight of Nights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid.\r\nIt was Peter.\r\n\r\nHe signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might\r\nrouse suspicion. Then he went on ticking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHOOK OR ME THIS TIME\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nOdd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our\r\nnoticing for a time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance,\r\nwe suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an experience had come\r\nthat night to Peter. When last we saw him he was stealing across the\r\nisland with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready. He had\r\nseen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it,\r\nbut by and by he remembered that it had not been ticking. At first he\r\nthought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nWithout giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a\r\nfellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter\r\nbegan to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use; and\r\nhe decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the\r\ncrocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked superbly, but with one\r\nunforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound,\r\nand it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what\r\nit had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again\r\nticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a\r\nfixed idea, it was a stupid beast.\r\n\r\nPeter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs\r\nencountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new\r\nelement. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human\r\nof whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: \xe2\x80\x9cHook or me this\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without\r\nknowing that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for\r\nto board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had\r\nnot occurred to him.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a\r\nmouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with\r\nHook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.\r\n\r\nThe crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the\r\nticking. At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and\r\nhe looked behind him swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it\r\nhimself, and in a flash he understood the situation. \xe2\x80\x9cHow clever of\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the\r\nforecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by\r\nyour watch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the\r\nill-fated pirate\xe2\x80\x99s mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward.\r\nFour boys caught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and\r\nthe carrion was cast overboard. There was a splash, and then silence.\r\nHow long has it taken?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne!\xe2\x80\x9d (Slightly had begun to count.)\r\n\r\nNone too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the\r\ncabin; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look\r\nround. They could hear each other\xe2\x80\x99s distressed breathing now, which\r\nshowed them that the more terrible sound had passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gone, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d Smee said, wiping off his spectacles. \xe2\x80\x9cAll\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstill again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently\r\nthat he could have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound,\r\nand he drew himself up firmly to his full height.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen here\xe2\x80\x99s to Johnny Plank!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried brazenly, hating the boys more\r\nthan ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into the\r\nvillainous ditty:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,\r\n    You walks along it so,\r\nTill it goes down and you goes down\r\n    To Davy Jones below!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo terrorise the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of\r\ndignity, he danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he\r\nsang; and when he finished he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want a touch of the cat\r\nbefore you walk the plank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that they fell on their knees. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried so piteously\r\nthat every pirate smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFetch the cat, Jukes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hook; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s in the cabin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. They\r\nfollowed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed\r\nhis song, his dogs joining in with him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat,\r\n    Its tails are nine, you know,\r\nAnd when they\xe2\x80\x99re writ upon your back\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song\r\nwas stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the\r\nship, and died away. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well\r\nunderstood by the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than\r\nthe screech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Slightly solemnly.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin.\r\nHe tottered out, haggard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog?\xe2\x80\x9d hissed Hook, towering\r\nover him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matter wi\xe2\x80\x99 him is he\xe2\x80\x99s dead, stabbed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cecco in a hollow\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill Jukes dead!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the startled pirates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cabin\xe2\x80\x99s as black as a pit,\xe2\x80\x9d Cecco said, almost gibbering, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nthere is something terrible in there: the thing you heard crowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both\r\nwere seen by Hook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCecco,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in his most steely voice, \xe2\x80\x9cgo back and fetch me out\r\nthat doodle-doo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nno\xe2\x80\x9d; but Hook was purring to his claw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you say you would go, Cecco?\xe2\x80\x9d he said musingly.\r\n\r\nCecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no more\r\nsinging, all listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a\r\ncrow.\r\n\r\nNo one spoke except Slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cThree,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHook rallied his dogs with a gesture. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99S\xe2\x80\x99death and odds fish,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthundered, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is to bring me that doodle-doo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till Cecco comes out,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Starkey, and the others took up\r\nthe cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I heard you volunteer, Starkey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hook, purring again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, by thunder!\xe2\x80\x9d Starkey cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy hook thinks you did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hook, crossing to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if it\r\nwould not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll swing before I go in there,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Starkey doggedly, and again\r\nhe had the support of the crew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this mutiny?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hook more pleasantly than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cStarkey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nringleader!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShake hands, Starkey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hook, proffering his claw.\r\n\r\nStarkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he backed up\r\nHook advanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With a despairing\r\nscream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d Hook said courteously, \xe2\x80\x9cdid any other gentlemen say mutiny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSeizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbring out that doodle-doo myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and sped into the cabin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive.\xe2\x80\x9d How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to be ready,\r\nbut Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething blew out the light,\xe2\x80\x9d he said a little unsteadily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Mullins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of Cecco?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Noodler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s as dead as Jukes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hook shortly.\r\n\r\nHis reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably,\r\nand the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are\r\nsuperstitious, and Cookson cried, \xe2\x80\x9cThey do say the surest sign a ship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccurst is when there\xe2\x80\x99s one on board more than can be accounted for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Mullins, \xe2\x80\x9che always boards the pirate craft\r\nlast. Had he a tail, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, looking viciously at Hook, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when he\r\ncomes it\xe2\x80\x99s in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad he a hook, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cookson insolently; and one after\r\nanother took up the cry, \xe2\x80\x9cThe ship\xe2\x80\x99s doomed!\xe2\x80\x9d At this the children\r\ncould not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten his\r\nprisoners, but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLads,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried to his crew, \xe2\x80\x9cnow here\xe2\x80\x99s a notion. Open the cabin door\r\nand drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives. If\r\nthey kill him, we\xe2\x80\x99re so much the better; if he kills them, we\xe2\x80\x99re none\r\nthe worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his\r\nbidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin\r\nand the door was closed on them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, listen!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared to face\r\nthe door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the\r\nmast. It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it\r\nwas for the reappearance of Peter.\r\n\r\nShe had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which\r\nhe had gone in search: the key that would free the children of their\r\nmanacles, and now they all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they\r\ncould find. First signing them to hide, Peter cut Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s bonds, and\r\nthen nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off\r\ntogether; but one thing barred the way, an oath, \xe2\x80\x9cHook or me this\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d So when he had freed Wendy, he whispered for her to conceal\r\nherself with the others, and himself took her place by the mast, her\r\ncloak around him so that he should pass for her. Then he took a great\r\nbreath and crowed.\r\n\r\nTo the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the\r\ncabin; and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but\r\nlike the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew\r\nthat if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLads,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never\r\nquailing for an instant, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve thought it out. There\xe2\x80\x99s a Jonah aboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d they snarled, \xe2\x80\x9ca man wi\xe2\x80\x99 a hook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, lads, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship wi\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nwoman on board. We\xe2\x80\x99ll right the ship when she\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworth trying,\xe2\x80\x9d they said doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFling the girl overboard,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hook; and they made a rush at the\r\nfigure in the cloak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s none can save you now, missy,\xe2\x80\x9d Mullins hissed jeeringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the figure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Pan the avenger!\xe2\x80\x9d came the terrible answer; and as he spoke\r\nPeter flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who \xe2\x80\x99twas that had been\r\nundoing them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he\r\nfailed. In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke.\r\n\r\nAt last he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cCleave him to the brisket!\xe2\x80\x9d but without conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown, boys, and at them!\xe2\x80\x9d Peter\xe2\x80\x99s voice rang out; and in another\r\nmoment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the\r\npirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the\r\nonset came when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and\r\nthither, striking wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of\r\nthe crew. Man to man they were the stronger; but they fought on the\r\ndefensive only, which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose\r\ntheir quarry. Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in\r\ndark recesses, where they were found by Slightly, who did not fight,\r\nbut ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces, so that\r\nthey were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords\r\nof the other boys. There was little sound to be heard but the clang of\r\nweapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously\r\ncounting\xe2\x80\x94five\xe2\x80\x94six\xe2\x80\x94seven\xe2\x80\x94eight\xe2\x80\x94nine\xe2\x80\x94ten\xe2\x80\x94eleven.\r\n\r\nI think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who\r\nseemed to have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle of\r\nfire. They had done for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a\r\nmatch for them all. Again and again they closed upon him, and again and\r\nagain he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up one boy with his hook,\r\nand was using him as a buckler, when another, who had just passed his\r\nsword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut up your swords, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the newcomer, \xe2\x80\x9cthis man is mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others\r\ndrew back and formed a ring around them.\r\n\r\nFor long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering\r\nslightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, Pan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hook at last, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is all your doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, James Hook,\xe2\x80\x9d came the stern answer, \xe2\x80\x9cit is all my doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProud and insolent youth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hook, \xe2\x80\x9cprepare to meet thy doom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDark and sinister man,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter answered, \xe2\x80\x9chave at thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage\r\nto either blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with\r\ndazzling rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge\r\nthat got past his foe\xe2\x80\x99s defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill\r\nstead, and he could not drive the steel home. Hook, scarcely his\r\ninferior in brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced\r\nhim back by the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a\r\nfavourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his\r\nastonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then he\r\nsought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this\r\ntime had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging\r\nfiercely, pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose\r\npeculiar colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell\r\nfrom Hook\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and he was at Peter\xe2\x80\x99s mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited\r\nhis opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a\r\ntragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.\r\n\r\nHitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker\r\nsuspicions assailed him now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPan, who and what art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried huskily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m youth, I\xe2\x80\x99m joy,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter answered at a venture, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a little bird\r\nthat has broken out of the egg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook\r\nthat Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the\r\nvery pinnacle of good form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo\xe2\x80\x99t again,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried despairingly.\r\n\r\nHe fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible\r\nsword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but\r\nPeter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of\r\nthe danger zone. And again and again he darted in and pricked.\r\n\r\nHook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer\r\nasked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form\r\nbefore it was cold forever.\r\n\r\nAbandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn two minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ship will be blown to pieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, now, he thought, true form will show.\r\n\r\nBut Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands,\r\nand calmly flung it overboard.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he\r\nwas, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he\r\nwas true to the traditions of his race. The other boys were flying\r\naround him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about the deck\r\nstriking up at them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it\r\nwas slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up for\r\ngood, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall. And his shoes were\r\nright, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his\r\nsocks were right.\r\n\r\nJames Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.\r\n\r\nFor we have come to his last moment.\r\n\r\nSeeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger\r\npoised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He\r\ndid not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely\r\nstopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little\r\nmark of respect from us at the end.\r\n\r\nHe had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he\r\nstood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through\r\nthe air, he invited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter\r\nkick instead of stab.\r\n\r\nAt last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad form,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.\r\n\r\nThus perished James Hook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventeen,\xe2\x80\x9d Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in his\r\nfigures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two\r\nreached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him\r\nnurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and\r\nSmee, who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles, making\r\na precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had\r\nfeared.\r\n\r\nWendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though\r\nwatching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she\r\nbecame prominent again. She praised them equally, and shuddered\r\ndelightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one;\r\nand then she took them into Hook\xe2\x80\x99s cabin and pointed to his watch which\r\nwas hanging on a nail. It said \xe2\x80\x9chalf-past one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got\r\nthem to bed in the pirates\xe2\x80\x99 bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all\r\nbut Peter, who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell\r\nasleep by the side of Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night,\r\nand cried in his sleep for a long time, and Wendy held him tightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI.\r\nTHE RETURN HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nBy three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps; for\r\nthere was a big sea running; and Tootles, the bo\xe2\x80\x99sun, was among them,\r\nwith a rope\xe2\x80\x99s end in his hand and chewing tobacco. They all donned\r\npirate clothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up,\r\nwith the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers.\r\n\r\nIt need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and\r\nsecond mate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars before the\r\nmast, and lived in the fo\xe2\x80\x99c\xe2\x80\x99sle. Peter had already lashed himself to\r\nthe wheel; but he piped all hands and delivered a short address to\r\nthem; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant hearties, but\r\nthat he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast, and if they\r\nsnapped at him he would tear them. The bluff strident words struck the\r\nnote sailors understood, and they cheered him lustily. Then a few sharp\r\norders were given, and they turned the ship round, and nosed her for\r\nthe mainland.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship\xe2\x80\x99s chart, that if this\r\nweather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June,\r\nafter which it would save time to fly.\r\n\r\nSome of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour\r\nof keeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they\r\ndared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin. Instant\r\nobedience was the only safe thing. Slightly got a dozen for looking\r\nperplexed when told to take soundings. The general feeling was that\r\nPeter was honest just now to lull Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions, but that there\r\nmight be a change when the new suit was ready, which, against her will,\r\nshe was making for him out of some of Hook\xe2\x80\x99s wickedest garments. It was\r\nafterwards whispered among them that on the first night he wore this\r\nsuit he sat long in the cabin with Hook\xe2\x80\x99s cigar-holder in his mouth and\r\none hand clenched, all but for the forefinger, which he bent and held\r\nthreateningly aloft like a hook.\r\n\r\nInstead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that\r\ndesolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless\r\nflight so long ago. It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this\r\ntime; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us. If we\r\nhad returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her, she would\r\nprobably have cried, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be silly; what do I matter? Do go back and\r\nkeep an eye on the children.\xe2\x80\x9d So long as mothers are like this their\r\nchildren will take advantage of them; and they may lay to that.\r\n\r\nEven now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful\r\noccupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance\r\nof them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs.\r\nDarling do not go out for the evening. We are no more than servants.\r\nWhy on earth should their beds be properly aired, seeing that they left\r\nthem in such a thankless hurry? Would it not serve them jolly well\r\nright if they came back and found that their parents were spending the\r\nweek-end in the country? It would be the moral lesson they have been in\r\nneed of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things in this way\r\nMrs. Darling would never forgive us.\r\n\r\nOne thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in\r\nthe way authors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed\r\nthey will be here on Thursday week. This would spoil so completely the\r\nsurprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward. They\r\nhave been planning it out on the ship: mother\xe2\x80\x99s rapture, father\xe2\x80\x99s shout\r\nof joy, Nana\xe2\x80\x99s leap through the air to embrace them first, when what\r\nthey ought to be prepared for is a good hiding. How delicious to spoil\r\nit all by breaking the news in advance; so that when they enter grandly\r\nMrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth, and Mr. Darling may\r\nexclaim pettishly, \xe2\x80\x9cDash it all, here are those boys again.\xe2\x80\x9d However,\r\nwe should get no thanks even for this. We are beginning to know Mrs.\r\nDarling by this time, and may be sure that she would upbraid us for\r\ndepriving the children of their little pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that by\r\ntelling you what\xe2\x80\x99s what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of\r\ndelight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you look at it in that way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat other way is there in which to look at it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say\r\nextraordinarily nice things about her; but I despise her, and not one\r\nof them will I say now. She does not really need to be told to have\r\nthings ready, for they are ready. All the beds are aired, and she never\r\nleaves the house, and observe, the window is open. For all the use we\r\nare to her, we might well go back to the ship. However, as we are here\r\nwe may as well stay and look on. That is all we are, lookers-on. Nobody\r\nreally wants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, in the hope that\r\nsome of them will hurt.\r\n\r\nThe only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine\r\nand six the kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, Mr.\r\nDarling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained\r\nNana up, and that from first to last she had been wiser than he. Of\r\ncourse, as we have seen, he was quite a simple man; indeed he might\r\nhave passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness\r\noff; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion\xe2\x80\x99s courage to\r\ndo what seemed right to him; and having thought the matter out with\r\nanxious care after the flight of the children, he went down on all\r\nfours and crawled into the kennel. To all Mrs. Darling\xe2\x80\x99s dear\r\ninvitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my own one, this is the place for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the\r\nkennel until his children came back. Of course this was a pity; but\r\nwhatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess, otherwise he soon gave\r\nup doing it. And there never was a more humble man than the once proud\r\nGeorge Darling, as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his\r\nwife of their children and all their pretty ways.\r\n\r\nVery touching was his deference to Nana. He would not let her come into\r\nthe kennel, but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly.\r\n\r\nEvery morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab,\r\nwhich conveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the same way\r\nat six. Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen\r\nif we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours: this\r\nman whose every movement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly he\r\nmust have suffered torture; but he preserved a calm exterior even when\r\nthe young criticised his little home, and he always lifted his hat\r\ncourteously to any lady who looked inside.\r\n\r\nIt may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the inward\r\nmeaning of it leaked out, and the great heart of the public was\r\ntouched. Crowds followed the cab, cheering it lustily; charming girls\r\nscaled it to get his autograph; interviews appeared in the better class\r\nof papers, and society invited him to dinner and added, \xe2\x80\x9cDo come in the\r\nkennel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery\r\nawaiting George\xe2\x80\x99s return home; a very sad-eyed woman. Now that we look\r\nat her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone\r\nnow just because she has lost her babes, I find I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to say\r\nnasty things about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy\r\nchildren, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has\r\nfallen asleep. The corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is\r\nalmost withered up. Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she\r\nhad a pain there. Some like Peter best, and some like Wendy best, but I\r\nlike her best. Suppose, to make her happy, we whisper to her in her\r\nsleep that the brats are coming back. They are really within two miles\r\nof the window now, and flying strong, but all we need whisper is that\r\nthey are on the way. Let\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity we did it, for she has started up, calling their names;\r\nand there is no one in the room but Nana.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNana had filmy eyes, but all she could do was put her paw gently on her\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s lap; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was\r\nbrought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see\r\nthat his face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.\r\n\r\nHe gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no\r\nimagination, and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of\r\nsuch a man. Outside, the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were\r\nstill cheering, and he was naturally not unmoved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cit is very gratifying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLots of little boys,\xe2\x80\x9d sneered Liza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were several adults to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he assured her with a faint flush;\r\nbut when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her.\r\nSocial success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter. For some\r\ntime he sat with his head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling\r\nof this success, and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she\r\nhoped his head would not be turned by it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I had been a weak man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, if I had been a\r\nweak man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, George,\xe2\x80\x9d she said timidly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are as full of remorse as ever,\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFull of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in a\r\nkennel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is punishment, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, George? You are sure you are not\r\nenjoying it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he\r\ncurled round in the kennel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you play me to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9con the nursery piano?\xe2\x80\x9d and as\r\nshe was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd shut\r\nthat window. I feel a draught.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left open\r\nfor them, always, always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the\r\nday-nursery and played, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept,\r\nWendy and John and Michael flew into the room.\r\n\r\nOh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement\r\nplanned by them before we left the ship; but something must have\r\nhappened since then, for it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter\r\nand Tinker Bell.\r\n\r\nPeter\xe2\x80\x99s first words tell all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick Tink,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cclose the window; bar it! That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\r\nNow you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will\r\nthink her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had\r\nexterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink\r\nto escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in his head\r\nall the time.\r\n\r\nInstead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then\r\nhe peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to\r\nTink, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as\r\nmy mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he sometimes\r\nbragged about her.\r\n\r\nHe did not know the tune, which was \xe2\x80\x9cHome, Sweet Home,\xe2\x80\x9d but he knew it\r\nwas saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCome back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy\xe2\x80\x9d; and he cried exultantly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is barred!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he saw\r\nthat Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box, and that two tears were\r\nsitting on her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wants me to unbar the window,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Peter, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I won\xe2\x80\x99t, not\r\nI!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had\r\ntaken their place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s awfully fond of Wendy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. He was angry with\r\nher now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.\r\n\r\nThe reason was so simple: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fond of her too. We can\xe2\x80\x99t both have her,\r\nlady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy. He\r\nceased to look at her, but even then she would not let go of him. He\r\nskipped about and made funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as\r\nif she were inside him, knocking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred the\r\nwindow. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Tink,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, with a frightful sneer at the laws\r\nof nature; \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t want any silly mothers;\xe2\x80\x9d and he flew away.\r\n\r\nThus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after\r\nall, which of course was more than they deserved. They alighted on the\r\nfloor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already\r\nforgotten his home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking around him doubtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I have been\r\nhere before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you have, you silly. There is your old bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael said, but not with much conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d cried John, \xe2\x80\x9cthe kennel!\xe2\x80\x9d and he dashed across to look into\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Nana is inside it,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said.\r\n\r\nBut John whistled. \xe2\x80\x9cHullo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a man inside it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s father!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wendy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see father,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael begged eagerly, and he took a good look.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not so big as the pirate I killed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with such frank\r\ndisappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have\r\nbeen sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nWendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in\r\nthe kennel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, like one who had lost faith in his memory, \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nused not to sleep in the kennel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said falteringly, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps we don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the old life\r\nas well as we thought we did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA chill fell upon them; and serve them right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very careless of mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said that young scoundrel John, \xe2\x80\x9cnot\r\nto be here when we come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s mother!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wendy, peeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is!\xe2\x80\x9d said John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen are you not really our mother, Wendy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Michael, who was\r\nsurely sleepy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wendy, with her first real twinge of remorse, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nwas quite time we came back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us creep in,\xe2\x80\x9d John suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cand put our hands over her eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently,\r\nhad a better plan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just as\r\nif we had never been away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her\r\nhusband was asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children waited for\r\nher cry of joy, but it did not come. She saw them, but she did not\r\nbelieve they were there. You see, she saw them in their beds so often\r\nin her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around\r\nher still.\r\n\r\nShe sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she had\r\nnursed them.\r\n\r\nThey could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother!\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Wendy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, but still she was sure it was the dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s John,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Michael. He knew her now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Michael,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and she stretched out her arms for the\r\nthree little selfish children they would never envelop again. Yes, they\r\ndid, they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of\r\nbed and run to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, George!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darling woke\r\nto share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in. There could not have been\r\na lovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who\r\nwas staring in at the window. He had had ecstasies innumerable that\r\nother children can never know; but he was looking through the window at\r\nthe one joy from which he must be for ever barred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII.\r\nWHEN WENDY GREW UP\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were\r\nwaiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they\r\nhad counted five hundred they went up. They went up by the stair,\r\nbecause they thought this would make a better impression. They stood in\r\na row in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off, and wishing they\r\nwere not wearing their pirate clothes. They said nothing, but their\r\neyes asked her to have them. They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling\r\nalso, but they forgot about him.\r\n\r\nOf course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr.\r\nDarling was curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a\r\nrather large number.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must say,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Wendy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you don\xe2\x80\x99t do things by halves,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\ngrudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them.\r\n\r\nThe first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think\r\nwe should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather!\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him. He knew\r\nhe was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe could lie doubled up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nibs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always cut their hair myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wendy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one showing\r\nhimself in such an unfavourable light.\r\n\r\nThen he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad to\r\nhave them as she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked\r\nhis consent as well as hers, instead of treating him as a cypher in his\r\nown house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he is a cypher,\xe2\x80\x9d Tootles cried instantly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think\r\nhe is a cypher, Curly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather not. Twin, what do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was\r\nabsurdly gratified, and said he would find space for them all in the\r\ndrawing-room if they fitted in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll fit in, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d they assured him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen follow the leader,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried gaily. \xe2\x80\x9cMind you, I am not sure that\r\nwe have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same.\r\nHoop la!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went off dancing through the house, and they all cried \xe2\x80\x9cHoop la!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forget\r\nwhether they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all\r\nfitted in.\r\n\r\nAs for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He did not\r\nexactly come to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so\r\nthat she could open it if she liked and call to him. That is what she\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Wendy, good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, are you going away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t feel, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said falteringly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you would like to\r\nsay anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout me, Peter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp\r\neye on Wendy. She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys,\r\nand would like to adopt him also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you send me to school?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired craftily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then to an office?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon I would be a man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to school and learn solemn things,\xe2\x80\x9d he told her\r\npassionately. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a man. O Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s mother, if I was to\r\nwake up and feel there was a beard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wendy the comforter, \xe2\x80\x9cI should love you in a beard;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nMrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where are you going to live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it\r\nhigh up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow lovely,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her\r\ngrip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought all the fairies were dead,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darling said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are always a lot of young ones,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Wendy, who was now\r\nquite an authority, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you see when a new baby laughs for the\r\nfirst time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies\r\nthere are always new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees;\r\nand the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue\r\nones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have such fun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, with eye on Wendy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be rather lonely in the evening,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9csitting by the\r\nfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have Tink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTink can\xe2\x80\x99t go a twentieth part of the way round,\xe2\x80\x9d she reminded him a\r\nlittle tartly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSneaky tell-tale!\xe2\x80\x9d Tink called out from somewhere round the corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Peter, you know it matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, come with me to the little house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I, mummy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he does so need a mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do you, my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness\r\nmerely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this\r\nhandsome offer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his\r\nspring cleaning. Wendy would have preferred a more permanent\r\narrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming;\r\nbut this promise sent Peter away quite gay again. He had no sense of\r\ntime, and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him\r\nis only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was because Wendy knew\r\nthis that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time\r\ncomes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs. Darling\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite\r\neasily. Funny. But she seemed satisfied.\r\n\r\nOf course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class\r\nIII, but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V.\r\nClass I is the top class. Before they had attended school a week they\r\nsaw what goats they had been not to remain on the island; but it was\r\ntoo late now, and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or\r\nme or Jenkins minor. It is sad to have to say that the power to fly\r\ngradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so\r\nthat they should not fly away in the night; and one of their diversions\r\nby day was to pretend to fall off buses; but by and by they ceased to\r\ntug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when\r\nthey let go of the bus. In time they could not even fly after their\r\nhats. Want of practice, they called it; but what it really meant was\r\nthat they no longer believed.\r\n\r\nMichael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him;\r\nso he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first\r\nyear. She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves\r\nand berries in the Neverland, and her one fear was that he might notice\r\nhow short it had become; but he never noticed, he had so much to say\r\nabout himself.\r\n\r\nShe had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but\r\nnew adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Captain Hook?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with interest when she spoke of the\r\narch enemy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, amazed, \xe2\x80\x9chow you killed him and saved\r\nall our lives?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forget them after I kill them,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied carelessly.\r\n\r\nWhen she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to\r\nsee her he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is Tinker Bell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could not\r\nremember.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are such a lot of them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect she is no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI expect he was right, for fairies don\xe2\x80\x99t live long, but they are so\r\nlittle that a short time seems a good while to them.\r\n\r\nWendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to\r\nPeter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was\r\nexactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning\r\nin the little house on the tree tops.\r\n\r\nNext year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because\r\nthe old one simply would not meet; but he never came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he is ill,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know he is never ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMichael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps there\r\nis no such person, Wendy!\xe2\x80\x9d and then Wendy would have cried if Michael\r\nhad not been crying.\r\n\r\nPeter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he\r\nnever knew he had missed a year.\r\n\r\nThat was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer\r\nshe tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was\r\nuntrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years\r\ncame and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met\r\nagain Wendy was a married woman, and Peter was no more to her than a\r\nlittle dust in the box in which she had kept her toys. Wendy was grown\r\nup. You need not be sorry for her. She was one of the kind that likes\r\nto grow up. In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker\r\nthan other girls.\r\n\r\nAll the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely\r\nworth while saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and\r\nNibs and Curly any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag\r\nand an umbrella. Michael is an engine-driver. Slightly married a lady\r\nof title, and so he became a lord. You see that judge in a wig coming\r\nout at the iron door? That used to be Tootles. The bearded man who\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know any story to tell his children was once John.\r\n\r\nWendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think\r\nthat Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns.\r\n\r\nYears rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be\r\nwritten in ink but in a golden splash.\r\n\r\nShe was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from\r\nthe moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions.\r\nWhen she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan.\r\nShe loved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her all she could remember\r\nin the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. It\r\nwas Jane\xe2\x80\x99s nursery now, for her father had bought it at the three per\r\ncents from Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s father, who was no longer fond of stairs. Mrs.\r\nDarling was now dead and forgotten.\r\n\r\nThere were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane\xe2\x80\x99s and her nurse\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nand there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died of old\r\nage, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being\r\nvery firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children\r\nexcept herself.\r\n\r\nOnce a week Jane\xe2\x80\x99s nurse had her evening off; and then it was Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was Jane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninvention to raise the sheet over her mother\xe2\x80\x99s head and her own, thus\r\nmaking a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we see now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I see anything to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d says Wendy, with a feeling\r\nthat if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you do,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jane, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see when you were a little girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a long time ago, sweetheart,\xe2\x80\x9d says Wendy. \xe2\x80\x9cAh me, how time\r\nflies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it fly,\xe2\x80\x9d asks the artful child, \xe2\x80\x9cthe way you flew when you were a\r\nlittle girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever\r\ndid really fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dear old days when I could fly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you fly now, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget the\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do they forget the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is only\r\nthe gay and innocent and heartless who can fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and\r\ninnocent and heartless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOr perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do believe,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it is this nursery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do believe it is,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter\r\nflew in looking for his shadow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe foolish fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d says Wendy, \xe2\x80\x9ctried to stick it on with soap, and\r\nwhen he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have missed a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupts Jane, who now knows the story\r\nbetter than her mother. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you saw him sitting on the floor crying,\r\nwhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sat up in bed and I said, \xe2\x80\x98Boy, why are you crying?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that was it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jane, with a big breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the\r\npirates and the redskins and the mermaids\xe2\x80\x99 lagoon, and the home under\r\nthe ground, and the little house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! which did you like best of all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I liked the home under the ground best of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last thing he ever said to me was, \xe2\x80\x98Just always be waiting for me,\r\nand then some night you will hear me crowing.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, alas, he forgot all about me,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said it with a smile. She\r\nwas as grown up as that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did his crow sound like?\xe2\x80\x9d Jane asked one evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was like this,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter\xe2\x80\x99s crow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Jane said gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cit was like this;\xe2\x80\x9d and she did it\r\never so much better than her mother.\r\n\r\nWendy was a little startled. \xe2\x80\x9cMy darling, how can you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often hear it when I am sleeping,\xe2\x80\x9d Jane said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only\r\none who heard it awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucky you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane.\r\n\r\nAnd then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and\r\nthe story had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her\r\nbed. Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to\r\nsee to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she\r\nsat darning she heard a crow. Then the window blew open as of old, and\r\nPeter dropped in on the floor.\r\n\r\nHe was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still\r\nhad all his first teeth.\r\n\r\nHe was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not\r\ndaring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Wendy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, not noticing any difference, for he was\r\nthinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might\r\nhave been the nightgown in which he had seen her first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as\r\npossible. Something inside her was crying \xe2\x80\x9cWoman, Woman, let go of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, where is John?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn is not here now,\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Michael asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as\r\nwell as to Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not Michael,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on\r\nher.\r\n\r\nPeter looked. \xe2\x80\x9cHullo, is it a new one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy or girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGirl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faltering, \xe2\x80\x9care you expecting me to fly away with\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course; that is why I have come.\xe2\x80\x9d He added a little sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning\r\ntimes pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t come,\xe2\x80\x9d she said apologetically, \xe2\x80\x9cI have forgotten how to fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll soon teach you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Peter, don\xe2\x80\x99t waste the fairy dust on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried, shrinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will turn up the light,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand then you can see for\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t turn up the light,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\nShe let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a\r\nlittle girl heart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it\r\nall, but they were wet-eyed smiles.\r\n\r\nThen she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and\r\nwhen the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he\r\ndrew back sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried again.\r\n\r\nShe had to tell him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promised not to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I am a married woman, Peter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child\r\nwith his dagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat down on\r\nthe floor instead and sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort\r\nhim, though she could have done it so easily once. She was only a woman\r\nnow, and she ran out of the room to try to think.\r\n\r\nPeter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed,\r\nand was interested at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy are you crying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Peter Pan,\xe2\x80\x9d he told her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came back for my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cto take her to the\r\nNeverland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d Jane said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been waiting for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post\r\ncrowing gloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room\r\nin solemn ecstasy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood by\r\nhis side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when\r\nthey gazed at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does so need a mother,\xe2\x80\x9d Jane said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy admitted rather forlornly; \xe2\x80\x9cno one knows it so\r\nwell as I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and the\r\nshameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nWendy rushed to the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is just for spring cleaning time,\xe2\x80\x9d Jane said, \xe2\x80\x9che wants me always\r\nto do his spring cleaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only I could go with you,\xe2\x80\x9d Wendy sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see you can\xe2\x80\x99t fly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane.\r\n\r\nOf course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse\r\nof her shows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky\r\nuntil they were as small as stars.\r\n\r\nAs you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her\r\nfigure little again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is now a\r\ncommon grown-up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring\r\ncleaning time, except when he forgets, Peter comes for Margaret and\r\ntakes her to the Neverland, where she tells him stories about himself,\r\nto which he listens eagerly. When Margaret grows up she will have a\r\ndaughter, who is to be Peter\xe2\x80\x99s mother in turn; and thus it will go on,\r\nso long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PETER PAN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 16-0.txt or 16-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/16/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
