To be content with what we at present know, is, for the\r\nmost part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very\r\ngradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and\r\nemancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set\r\naside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be\r\ndaily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and\r\nanxiety to acquire.\r\n\r\nAnd this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which\r\nprogress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which\r\npersons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu\r\nof their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away\r\ntraditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues\r\nof sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive\r\nsuperstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The\r\ncredulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as\r\npowerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy\r\nscepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of\r\nconservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church.\r\nHistory and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent\r\ntimes, are subjected to very different handling from that which the\r\nindulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere statements are\r\njealously watched, and the motives of the writer form as important an\r\ningredient in the analysis of his history, as the facts he records.\r\nProbability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it is by this\r\ntroublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is\r\nsifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its\r\ndemands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere\r\nfacts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of extended experience,\r\nis the best help to the criticism of human history. Historical\r\ncharacters can only be estimated by the standard which human\r\nexperience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form\r\ncorrect views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a\r\ngreat whole\xe2\x80\x94we must measure them by their relation to the mass of\r\nbeings by whom they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents\r\nin their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we\r\nmust rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than\r\nthe respective probability of its details.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know\r\nleast, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere1 have, perhaps,\r\ncontributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any\r\nother three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all\r\nthree has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left\r\nus little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will\r\nfollow. The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in\r\nwhich critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon\r\neverything else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or\r\nless of doubt and uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the\r\ncontradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one\r\nof the _dramatis personae_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in\r\nstyle. He appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their\r\ntone as those of the writers who have handed them down. When we have\r\nread Plato _or_ Xenophon, we think we know something of Socrates; when\r\nwe have fairly read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are\r\nsomething worse than ignorant.\r\n\r\nIt has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny\r\nthe personal or real existence of men and things whose life and\r\ncondition were too much for our belief. This system\xe2\x80\x94which has often\r\ncomforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of\r\nStrauss for those of the New Testament\xe2\x80\x94has been of incalculable value\r\nto the historical theorists of the last and present centuries. To\r\nquestion the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more\r\nexcusable act, than to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a fact\r\nrelated in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory\r\ndeveloped from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in\r\nthe same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured\r\nold king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized\xe2\x80\x94_Numa\r\nPompilius._\r\n\r\nScepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer,\r\nand the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free\r\npermission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all\r\nwritten tradition, concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and\r\nOdyssey. What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily\r\ndismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\ncannot be true, because it is not true; and, that is not true, because\r\nit cannot be true.\xe2\x80\x9d Such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon\r\ntestimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are\r\npartly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which\r\ntruth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of\r\nthe Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken\r\nof the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to\r\nHerodotus.\r\n\r\nAccording to this document, the city of Cumae in \xc3\x86olia, was, at an\r\nearly period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of\r\nGreece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes.\r\nAlthough poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl named\r\nCritheis. The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the\r\nguardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this\r\nmaiden that we \xe2\x80\x9care indebted for so much happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Homer was the\r\nfirst fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of\r\nMelesigenes, from having been born near the river Meles, in Boeotia,\r\nwhither Critheis had been transported in order to save her reputation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this time,\xe2\x80\x9d continues our narrative, \xe2\x80\x9cthere lived at Smyrna a man\r\nnamed Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being\r\nmarried, engaged Critheis to manage his household, and spin the flax he\r\nreceived as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was\r\nher performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made\r\nproposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement,\r\nwilling to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man,\r\nif he were carefully brought up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature\r\nhad bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every\r\nattainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius\r\ndied, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon\r\nfollowed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father\xe2\x80\x99s school with great\r\nsuccess, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna,\r\nbut also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially\r\nin the exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these\r\nvisitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who\r\nevinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times,\r\npersuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his\r\ntravels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him\r\nwith a further stipend, urging, that, \xe2\x80\x9cWhile he was yet young, it was\r\nfitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities\r\nwhich might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses.\xe2\x80\x9d Melesigenes\r\nconsented, and set out with his patron, \xe2\x80\x9cexamining all the curiosities\r\nof the countries they visited, and informing himself of everything by\r\ninterrogating those whom he met.\xe2\x80\x9d We may also suppose, that he wrote\r\nmemoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation. Having set sail\r\nfrom Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here Melesigenes, who\r\nhad already suffered in his eyes, became much worse, and Mentes, who\r\nwas about to leave for Leucadia, left him to the medical\r\nsuperintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of Alcinor.\r\nUnder his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly became\r\nacquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards formed\r\nthe subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that it\r\nwas here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophomans make their\r\ncity the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where he\r\napplied himself to the study of poetry.3\r\n\r\nBut poverty soon drove him to Cumae. Having passed over the Hermaean\r\nplain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumae.\r\nHere his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of\r\none Tychias, an armourer. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd up to my time,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the author,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a\r\nrecitation of his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also\r\na poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes\r\narrived\xe2\x80\x9d.4\r\n\r\nBut poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being\r\nthe most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph\r\non Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater\r\nprobability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.5\r\n\r\nArrived at Cumae, he frequented the _converzationes_6 of the old men,\r\nand delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by this\r\nfavourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a\r\npublic maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously\r\nrenowned. They avowed their willingness to support him in the measure\r\nhe proposed, and procured him an audience in the council. Having made\r\nthe speech, with the purport of which our author has forgotten to\r\nacquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate respecting the answer\r\nto be given to his proposal.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndemand, but one man observed that \xe2\x80\x9cif they were to feed _Homers,_ they\r\nwould be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFrom this\r\ncircumstance,\xe2\x80\x9d says the writer, \xe2\x80\x9cMelesigenes acquired the name of\r\nHomer, for the Cumans call blind men _Homers._\xe2\x80\x9d7 With a love of\r\neconomy, which shows how similar the world has always been in its\r\ntreatment of literary men, the pension was denied, and the poet vented\r\nhis disappointment in a wish that Cumoea might never produce a poet\r\ncapable of giving it renown and glory.\r\n\r\nAt Phocoea, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.\r\nOne Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept\r\nHomer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the\r\nverses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficient\r\npoetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary\r\npublishers, neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him.\r\nAt his departure, Homer is said to have observed: \xe2\x80\x9cO Thestorides, of\r\nthe many things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more\r\nunintelligible than the human heart.\xe2\x80\x9d8\r\n\r\nHomer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian\r\nmerchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him\r\nrecite, acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a\r\nprofitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at\r\nonce determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be\r\nsetting sail thither, but he found one ready to start for Erythrae, a\r\ntown of Ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the\r\nseamen to allow him to accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a\r\nfavourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the\r\nimposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn\r\ndown the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.\r\n\r\nAt Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in\r\nPhocoea, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty,\r\nreached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure,\r\nwhich we will continue in the words of our author. \xe2\x80\x9cHaving set out from\r\nPithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were\r\npasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus\r\n(for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up\r\nquickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For some\r\ntime he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a\r\nplace alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then went up to\r\nhim, and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate places\r\nand untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting\r\nto him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion;\r\nand he took him, and led him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade\r\nhim sup.9\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according\r\nto their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O\r\nGlaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs\r\ntheir supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since,\r\nwhilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.\r\n\r\nGlaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author.\r\nHaving finished supper, they banqueted10 afresh on conversation, Homer\r\nnarrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had visited.\r\n\r\nAt length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus\r\nresolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with\r\nHomer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left\r\nHomer at home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus,\r\na place near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole\r\nstory respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to\r\nwhat he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and\r\nfeeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the\r\nstranger to him.\r\n\r\nGlaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him,\r\nassuring him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon\r\nshowed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general\r\nknowledge, and the Chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the\r\ncharge of his children.11\r\n\r\nBesides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the\r\nisland, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of\r\nChios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo this day,\xe2\x80\x9d says Chandler,12 \xe2\x80\x9cthe most curious remain is that which\r\nhas been named, without reason, the School of Homer. It is on the\r\ncoast, at some distance from the city, northward, and appears to have\r\nbeen an open temple of Cybele, formed on the top of a rock. The shape\r\nis oval, and in the centre is the image of the goddess, the head and an\r\narm wanting. She is represented, as usual, sitting. The chair has a\r\nlion carved on each side, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low\r\nrim, or seat, and about five yards over. The whole is hewn out of the\r\nmountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of the most remote\r\nantiquity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo successful was this school, that Homer realised a considerable\r\nfortune. He married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single,\r\nthe other married a Chian.\r\n\r\nThe following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the\r\npersonages of the poems with the history of the poet, which has already\r\nbeen mentioned:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards\r\nMentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his\r\npoem as the companion of Ulysses,13 in return for the care taken of him\r\nwhen afflicted with blindness. He also testifies his gratitude to\r\nPhemius, who had given him both sustenance and instruction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to\r\nvisit Greece, whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is\r\nsaid, made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity\r\nof the Athenians, of whose city he had hitherto made no mention,14 he\r\nsent out for Samos. Here being recognized by a Samian, who had met with\r\nhim in Chios, he was handsomely received, and invited to join in\r\ncelebrating the Apaturian festival. He recited some verses, which gave\r\ngreat satisfaction, and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon\r\nfestivals, he earned a subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich,\r\nwith whose children he was very popular.\r\n\r\nIn the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios,\r\nnow Ino, where he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that his\r\ndeath arose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma\r\nproposed by some fishermen\xe2\x80\x99s children.15\r\n\r\nSuch is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we\r\npossess, and so broad are the evidences of its historical\r\nworthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in\r\ndetail. Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a\r\npersevering, patient, and learned\xe2\x80\x94but by no means consistent\xe2\x80\x94series of\r\ninvestigations has led. In doing so, I profess to bring forward\r\nstatements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHomer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost in\r\ndoubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who\r\nhave done honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The\r\nmajestic stream of his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the\r\nNile, through many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the\r\nNile, its fountains will ever remain concealed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics\r\nhas eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the\r\nHomeric question is involved. With no less truth and feeling he\r\nproceeds:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of\r\nthings makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the\r\nregion of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The\r\ncreations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for\r\nthe most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were\r\nin possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly\r\nexplain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in\r\nall essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet.\xe2\x80\x9d 16\r\n\r\nFrom this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of\r\nhuman nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic\r\ninvestigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer\r\nan individual?17 or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an\r\ningenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?\r\n\r\nWell has Landor remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cSome tell us there were twenty Homers; some\r\ndeny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the\r\ncontents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are\r\nperpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our\r\ndevotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know\r\nwhat is good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our\r\nadmiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do.\xe2\x80\x9d 18\r\n\r\nBut, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented\r\nwith the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and\r\nfostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions\r\nby minute analysis\xe2\x80\x94our editorial office compels us to give some\r\nattention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric\r\nquestion is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to\r\nprefer his judgment to his imagination, and to condescend to dry\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, entering into particulars respecting the question of\r\nthis unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) I must\r\nexpress my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following\r\nremarks:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the\r\nbetter, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its\r\noriginal composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that\r\nits primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to\r\nassert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not\r\nthe best qualification for the profound feeling, the comprehensive\r\nconception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite anatomist may be\r\nno judge of the symmetry of the human frame: and we would take the\r\nopinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty\r\nof a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines\r\nof Pope.\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The critic eye\xe2\x80\x94that microscope of wit\r\nSees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit,\r\nHow parts relate to parts, or they to whole,\r\nThe body\xe2\x80\x99s harmony, the beaming soul,\r\nAre things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse, shall see,\r\nWhen man\xe2\x80\x99s whole frame is obvious to a flea.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d19\r\nLong was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. The grave and cautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo,20 the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics. Longinus, in an oft quoted passage, merely expressed an opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad,21 and, among a mass of ancient authors, whose very names22 it would be tedious to detail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of Homer ever arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject; let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on\r\nthe subject, and we find Bentley remarking that \xe2\x80\x9cHomer wrote a sequel\r\nof songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and\r\ngood cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs\r\nwere not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about\r\nPeisistratus\xe2\x80\x99 time, about five hundred years after.\xe2\x80\x9d23\r\n\r\nTwo French writers\xe2\x80\x94Hedelin and Perrault\xe2\x80\x94avowed a similar scepticism on\r\nthe subject; but it is in the \xe2\x80\x9cScienza Nuova\xe2\x80\x9d of Battista Vico, that we\r\nfirst meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf\r\nwith so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the Wolfian\r\ntheory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold\r\nhypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote24\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,\r\nturning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently\r\npublished, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of\r\nthe Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by\r\nno means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously\r\nannounced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent\r\nportions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into\r\nany compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of\r\nPeisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards\r\nthat conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem\r\ncould be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their\r\ncomposition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect\r\nsymmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived\r\nby any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to\r\nposterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be\r\nindispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks,\r\nwas thus one of the points in Wolf\xe2\x80\x99s case against the primitive\r\nintegrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading\r\nopponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to\r\nhave been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered\r\nincumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the\r\nIliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to\r\nPeisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are\r\nnowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that\r\nview of the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to\r\ncontrovert it, we were driven to the necessity of admitting long\r\nwritten poems, in the ninth century before the Christian aera. Few\r\nthings, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight,\r\nopposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than\r\nWolf himself. The traces of writing in Greece, even in the seventh\r\ncentury before the Christian aera, are exceedingly trifling. We have no\r\nremaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad, and the early\r\ninscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even assure\r\nourselves whether Archilochus, Simonides of Amorgus, Kallinus,\r\nTyrtaeus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and lyric poets,\r\ncommitted their compositions to writing, or at what time the practice\r\nof doing so became familiar. The first positive ground which authorizes\r\nus to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in the famous\r\nordinance of Solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at the Panathenaea:\r\nbut for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed, we are\r\nunable to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the\r\nbeginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the\r\nexisting habits of society with regard to poetry\xe2\x80\x94for they admit\r\ngenerally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and\r\nheard,\xe2\x80\x94but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been\r\nmanuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems\xe2\x80\x94the unassisted\r\nmemory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy. But here\r\nwe only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater; for the\r\nexistence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary memory, 25 is far\r\nless astonishing than that of long manuscripts, in an age essentially\r\nnon-reading and non-writing, and when even suitable instruments and\r\nmaterials for the process are not obvious. Moreover, there is a strong\r\npositive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of\r\nrefreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript; for if such had been\r\nthe fact, blindness would have been a disqualification for the\r\nprofession, which we know that it was not, as well from the example of\r\nDemodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the blind bard of Chios, in\r\nthe Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as well as the general\r\ntenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer himself. The author of\r\nthat hymn, be he who he may, could never have described a blind man as\r\nattaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he had been conscious\r\nthat the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference\r\nto the manuscript in his chest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe loss of the digamma, that _crux_ of critics, that quicksand upon\r\nwhich even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond\r\na doubt, that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a\r\nconsiderable change. Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the\r\nHomeric poems could have suffered by this change, had written copies\r\nbeen preserved. If Chaucer\xe2\x80\x99s poetry, for instance, had not been\r\nwritten, it could only have come down to us in a softened form, more\r\nlike the effeminate version of Dryden, than the rough, quaint, noble\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what period,\xe2\x80\x9d continues Grote, \xe2\x80\x9cthese poems, or indeed any other\r\nGreek poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture,\r\nthough there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of\r\nSolon. If, in the absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any\r\nmore determinate period, the question at once suggests itself, What\r\nwere the purposes which, in that state of society, a manuscript at its\r\nfirst commencement must have been intended to answer? For whom was a\r\nwritten Iliad necessary? Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was\r\nnot only planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the feelings,\r\nand conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of\r\nvoice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were required for\r\nemphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never\r\nreproduce. Not for the general public\xe2\x80\x94they were accustomed to receive\r\nit with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn\r\nand crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would\r\nbe suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of\r\nreaders capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had\r\nexperienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the\r\nwritten words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the\r\nimpression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may\r\nseem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and\r\nthere was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed.\r\nIf we could discover at what time such a class first began to be\r\nformed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic\r\npoems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with\r\nthe greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the\r\nformation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle\r\nof the seventh century before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C.\r\n630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonides of\r\nAmorgus, &c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in\r\nthe character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music\xe2\x80\x94the elegiac\r\nand the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the\r\nprimitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred\r\nfrom the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a\r\nchange was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of\r\npublication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the\r\nnearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at\r\nthe old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new\r\npoetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be\r\nconsidered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their\r\nown individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric\r\nrhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and\r\neulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer. There seems,\r\ntherefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this\r\nnewly-formed and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of the\r\nHomeric poems and other old epics,\xe2\x80\x94the Thebais and the Cypria, as well\r\nas the Iliad and the Odyssey,\xe2\x80\x94began to be compiled towards the middle\r\nof the seventh century (B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to Grecian\r\ncommerce, which took place about the same period, would furnish\r\nincreased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon.\r\nA reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly increase, and\r\nthe number of manuscripts along with it; so that before the time of\r\nSolon, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though\r\nstill comparatively few, might have attained a certain recognized\r\nauthority, and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness\r\nof individual rhapsodes.\xe2\x80\x9d26\r\n\r\nBut even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of\r\nthe credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following\r\nobservations\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion,\r\nthrow some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid\r\ncompilation, at least over the theory, that the Iliad was cast into its\r\npresent stately and harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian\r\nruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the bright period of\r\nGrecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited little more than the\r\nfame, and the faint echo, if Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonides were\r\nemployed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much\r\nmust have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is\r\nalmost incredible, that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should\r\nnot remain. Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies\r\nwhich no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the\r\nHomeric age, however the irregular use of the digamma may have\r\nperplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have\r\ncaused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the\r\nheroes of her age, however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the\r\nHomeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic\r\ndialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics\xe2\x80\x94still it is difficult to suppose that the language,\r\nparticularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts,\r\nshould not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient\r\nand modern forms of expression. It is not quite in character with such\r\na period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an\r\nimperfect poem in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott\r\nhas done in his continuation of Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian\r\ncompilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total\r\nabsence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of\r\nobservation. In later, and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times,\r\nthe Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their\r\nancestors. But, amid all the traditions of the glories of early Greece\r\nembodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and\r\ninsignificant part. Even the few passages which relate to their\r\nancestors, Mr. Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible,\r\nindeed, that in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic\r\nfact, that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against\r\nthe rival and half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadae, the chieftain\r\nof Thessaly, from his valour and the number of his forces, may have\r\nbeen the most important ally of the Peloponnesian sovereign; the\r\npreeminent value of the ancient poetry on the Trojan war may thus have\r\nforced the national feeling of the Athenians to yield to their taste.\r\nThe songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were, no doubt, of\r\nfar inferior sublimity and popularity, or, at first sight, a Theseid\r\nwould have been much more likely to have emanated from an Athenian\r\nsynod of compilers of ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Olysseid.\r\nCould France have given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the\r\nhero of the Jerusalem. If, however, the Homeric ballads, as they are\r\nsometimes called, which related the wrath of Achilles, with all its\r\ndireful consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the poetic\r\ncycle, as to admit no rivalry,\xe2\x80\x94it is still surprising, that throughout\r\nthe whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship\r\nof an Athenian hand, and that the national spirit of a race, who have\r\nat a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring\r\nneighbours, the French, should submit with lofty self denial to the\r\nalmost total exclusion of their own ancestors\xe2\x80\x94or, at least, to the\r\nquestionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled\r\nin the military tactics of his age.\xe2\x80\x9d27\r\n\r\nTo return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that\r\nWolf\xe2\x80\x99s objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey\r\nhave never been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they\r\nhave failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the\r\ndifficulties with which the whole subject is beset, are rather\r\naugmented than otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis. Nor is\r\nLachmann\xe2\x80\x99s28 modification of his theory any better. He divides the\r\nfirst twenty-two books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs, and\r\ntreats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one\r\nregular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of Peisistratus.\r\nThis, as Grote observes, \xe2\x80\x9cexplains the gaps and contradictions in the\r\nnarrative, but it explains nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d Moreover, we find no\r\ncontradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called sixteen poets\r\nconcur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle\r\nafter the secession of Achilles: Elphenor, chief of the Euboeans;\r\nTlepolemus, of the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odius, of the\r\nHalizonians; Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroes\r\nagain make their appearance, and we can but agree with Colonel Mure,\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cit seems strange that any number of independent poets should have\r\nso harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe discrepancy, by which Pylaemenes, who is represented as dead in the\r\nfifth book, weeps at his son\xe2\x80\x99s funeral in the thirteenth, can only be\r\nregarded as the result of an interpolation.\r\n\r\nGrote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the\r\nsubject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian\r\ntheory, and of Lachmann\xe2\x80\x99s modifications with the character of\r\nPeisistratus. But he has also shown, and we think with equal success,\r\nthat the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems,\r\nor, supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by\r\nPeisistratus, and not before his time, are essentially distinct. In\r\nshort, \xe2\x80\x9ca man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of\r\npre-existing songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the\r\nperiod of its first compilation.\xe2\x80\x9d The friends or literary _employes_ of\r\nPeisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already ancient, and the\r\nsilence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crecension,\xe2\x80\x9d goes far to prove, that, among the numerous manuscripts\r\nthey examined, this was either wanting, or thought unworthy of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoreover,\xe2\x80\x9d he continues, \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole tenor of the poems themselves\r\nconfirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad\r\nor Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age\r\nof Peisistratus\xe2\x80\x94nothing which brings to our view the alterations\r\nbrought about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined\r\nmoney, the habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican\r\ngovernments, the close military array, the improved construction of\r\nships, the Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of\r\nreligious festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, &c.,\r\nfamiliar to the latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus, and the\r\nother literary friends of Peisistratus, could hardly have failed to\r\nnotice, even without design, had they then, for the first time,\r\nundertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into\r\none large aggregate. Everything in the two great Homeric poems, both in\r\nsubstance and in language, belongs to an age two or three centuries\r\nearlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the interpolations (or those\r\npassages which, on the best grounds, are pronounced to be such) betray\r\nno trace of the sixth century before Christ, and may well have been\r\nheard by Archilochus and Kallinus\xe2\x80\x94in some cases even by Arktinus and\r\nHesiod\xe2\x80\x94as genuine Homeric matter. As far as the evidences on the case,\r\nas well internal as external, enable us to judge, we seem warranted in\r\nbelieving that the Iliad and Odyssey were recited substantially as they\r\nnow stand (always allowing for partial divergences of text and\r\ninterpolations) in 776 B.C., our first trustworthy mark of Grecian\r\ntime; and this ancient date, let it be added, as it is the\r\nbest-authenticated fact, so it is also the most important attribute of\r\nthe Homeric poems, considered in reference to Grecian history; for they\r\nthus afford us an insight into the anti-historical character of the\r\nGreeks, enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the\r\nnation, and to seize instructive contrasts between their former and\r\ntheir later condition.\xe2\x80\x9d30\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of\r\nPeisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, although, I must\r\nconfess, that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his\r\nlabours. At the same time, so far from believing that the composition\r\nor primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the\r\nwork of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and\r\nelegant mind of that Athenian31 would lead him to preserve an ancient\r\nand traditional order of the poems, rather than to patch and\r\nre-construct them according to a fanciful hypothesis. I will not repeat\r\nthe many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not,\r\nor whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed\r\nauthor. Suffice it to say, that the more we read, the less satisfied we\r\nare upon either subject.\r\n\r\nI cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the\r\npreservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version\r\nof the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical\r\nprobability must be measured by that of many others relating to the\r\nSpartan Confucius.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories, with an attempt,\r\nmade by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like\r\nconsistency. It is as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors\r\nof some fifty years ago, some one qualified to \xe2\x80\x98discourse in excellent\r\nmusic\xe2\x80\x99 among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the\r\nUnited States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing\r\naround them. But what was passing around them? The grand events of a\r\nspirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the\r\nmystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides\r\nwhich, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and\r\nwas cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first,\r\nand down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely\r\nrecitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative,\r\nprobably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the\r\nmemory considerably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a\r\npoet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most\r\nprobably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great\r\nutility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of\r\nHellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays, connecting them\r\nby a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Odyssea.\xe2\x80\x99 The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem,\r\nwhich, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic\r\ndialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He\r\ntherefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is\r\nrather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging\r\narrangement of other people\xe2\x80\x99s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed,\r\narguing for the unity of authorship, \xe2\x80\x98a great poet might have re-cast\r\npre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere\r\narrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad,\r\nrecording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind seized\r\nthe hint that there presented itself, and the Achilleis32 grew under\r\nhis hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the poem\r\nunder the same pseudonyme as his former work: and the disjointed lays\r\nof the ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to the\r\nCid, into a chronicle history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew that\r\nthe poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but,\r\nfirst, the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and\r\ncorruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the streets,\r\nassemblies, and agoras. However, Solon first, and then Peisistratus,\r\nand afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored\r\nthe works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great\r\nmeasure.\xe2\x80\x9d33\r\n\r\nHaving thus given some general notion of the strange theories which\r\nhave developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I\r\nmust still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of\r\nthe Homeric poems. To deny that many corruptions and interpolations\r\ndisfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here\r\nand there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of\r\nthe copyist, would be an absurd and captious assumption, but it is to a\r\nhigher criticism that we must appeal, if we would either understand or\r\nenjoy these poems. In maintaining the authenticity and personality of\r\ntheir one author, be he Homer or Melesigenes, _quocunque nomine vocari\r\neum jus fasque sit,_ I feel conscious that, while the whole weight of\r\nhistorical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these\r\ngreat works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful internal\r\nevidence, and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate\r\nimpulse of the soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise.\r\nIndeed, considering the character of some of my own books, such an\r\nattempt would be gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its\r\nimportance in a philological view, I am inclined to set little store on\r\nits aesthetic value, especially in poetry. Three parts of the\r\nemendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had\r\nthey been suggested to the author by his Maecenas or Africanus, he\r\nwould probably have adopted. Moreover, those who are most exact in\r\nlaying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often\r\nleast competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not\r\npoets by profession, but may be so _per accidens._ I do not at this\r\nmoment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated to substantially\r\nimprove the poetry of a passage, although a mass of remarks, from\r\nHerodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a thousand minute\r\npoints, without which our Greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune.\r\n\r\nBut it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will\r\nexercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an\r\nheroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously\r\ndissected his words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the\r\npruning knife by wholesale, and inconsistent in everything but their\r\nwish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book\r\nafter book, passage after passage, till the author is reduced to a\r\ncollection of fragments, or till those, who fancied they possessed the\r\nworks of some great man, find that they have been put off with a vile\r\ncounterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare the theories of\r\nKnight, Wolf, Lachmann, and others, we shall feel better satisfied of\r\nthe utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of\r\nHomer. One rejects what another considers the turning-point of his\r\ntheory. One cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would\r\nexplain by omitting something else.\r\n\r\nNor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon\r\nas a literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill,\r\nseems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies\r\nattributed to Seneca are by _four_ different authors.34 Now, I will\r\nventure to assert, that these tragedies are so uniform, not only in\r\ntheir borrowed phraseology\xe2\x80\x94a phraseology with which writers like\r\nBoethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves\xe2\x80\x94in their\r\nfreedom from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an ultra-refined\r\nand consistent abandonment of good taste, that few writers of the\r\npresent day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman, be\r\nhe Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a great many more\r\nequally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin astonished the world\r\nwith the startling announcement that the \xc3\x86neid of Virgil, and the\r\nsatires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now, without wishing to\r\nsay one word of disrespect against the industry and learning\xe2\x80\x94nay, the\r\nrefined acuteness\xe2\x80\x94which scholars, like Wolf, have bestowed upon this\r\nsubject, I must express my fears, that many of our modern Homeric\r\ntheories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment, rather\r\nthan the instruction, of posterity. Nor can I help thinking, that the\r\nliterary history of more recent times will account for many points of\r\ndifficulty in the transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey to a period so\r\nremote from that of their first creation.\r\n\r\nI have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus\r\nwere of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason\r\nwhy corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in\r\nhis day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should\r\nhave given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after\r\nall, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand\r\ntoo great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully\r\nappeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has\r\nsought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer, does too much\r\nviolence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with\r\nlove and admiration for the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author\r\nof the Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the powers of human\r\ninvention; to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most\r\nennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the ocean in the\r\ncontemplation of a polypus. There is a catholicity, so to speak, in the\r\nvery name of Homer. Our faith in the author of the Iliad may be a\r\nmistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a better.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature\r\nherself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in\r\nbelieving in Homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers\r\nround the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth\r\nof imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust,\xe2\x80\x94still I am\r\nfar from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a\r\nrich fund of tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse from whence\r\nhe might derive both subject and embellishment. But it is one thing to\r\n_use_ existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to\r\npatch up the poem itself from such materials. What consistency of style\r\nand execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what\r\nbad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?\r\n\r\nA blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other\r\nbards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In\r\nfact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward\r\nimpressions\xe2\x80\x94nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents\r\nwhich support and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless there be\r\nsome grand pervading principle\xe2\x80\x94some invisible, yet most distinctly\r\nstamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never\r\ncome to the birth. Traditions the most picturesque, episodes the most\r\npathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and\r\ngreat men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in more\r\nsubstantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power to\r\ncreate a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and\r\nembellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a\r\nparterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their\r\nwild redundancy: we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which will\r\nrequire little acuteness to detect.\r\n\r\nSensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware\r\nas I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief,\r\nit still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved\r\nfor a higher criticism than it has often obtained. We are not by nature\r\nintended to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which\r\nthe greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Were\r\nfaith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our\r\nignorance on any matter. But we are too well taught the contrary\r\nlesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried\r\ntouching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon\r\nthe condition of humanity. And there is a kind of sacredness attached\r\nto the memory of the great and the good, which seems to bid us repulse\r\nthe scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing\r\napologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic\r\ndynameter.\r\n\r\nLong and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts\r\neven to his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and\r\nwith a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply\r\nwrapped in admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the minute spots\r\nwhich mere analysis can discover. In reading an heroic poem we must\r\ntransform ourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination\r\nmust fight over the same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the\r\nsame sense of injury, as an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can but\r\nattain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely\r\nsuffice for the reading of Homer), we shall feel that the poems of\r\nHomer are not only the work of one writer, but of the greatest writer\r\nthat ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song.\r\n\r\nAnd it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems\r\ntheir powerful influence over the minds of the men of old. Heeren, who\r\nis evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely\r\nobserves:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation. No poet has\r\never, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his countrymen.\r\nProphets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the character of other\r\nnations; it was reserved to a poet to form that of the Greeks. This is\r\na feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the\r\nperiod of their degeneracy. When lawgivers and sages appeared in\r\nGreece, the work of the poet had already been accomplished; and they\r\npaid homage to his superior genius. He held up before his nation the\r\nmirror, in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no\r\nless than of feeble mortals, and to behold them reflected with purity\r\nand truth. His poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature;\r\non the love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which\r\noutweighs all others, the love of glory. His songs were poured forth\r\nfrom a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man; and\r\ntherefore they enter, and will continue to enter, every breast which\r\ncherishes the same sympathies. If it is granted to his immortal spirit,\r\nfrom another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth, to look down\r\non his race, to see the nations from the fields of Asia to the forests\r\nof Hercynia, performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic\r\nwand caused to flow; if it is permitted to him to view the vast\r\nassemblage of grand, of elevated, of glorious productions, which had\r\nbeen called into being by means of his songs; wherever his immortal\r\nspirit may reside, this alone would suffice to complete his\r\nhappiness.\xe2\x80\x9d35\r\n\r\nCan we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the \xe2\x80\x9cApotheosis of\r\nHomer\xe2\x80\x9d36 is depictured, and not feel how much of pleasing association,\r\nhow much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds,\r\nis lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition? The more\r\nwe read, and the more we think\xe2\x80\x94think as becomes the readers of\r\nHomer,\xe2\x80\x94the more rooted becomes the conviction that the Father of Poetry\r\ngave us this rich inheritance, whole and entire. Whatever were the\r\nmeans of its preservation, let us rather be thankful for the treasury\r\nof taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use, than seek to make it\r\na mere centre around which to drive a series of theories, whose\r\nwildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each other.\r\n\r\nAs the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer, are not\r\nincluded in Pope\xe2\x80\x99s translation, I will content myself with a brief\r\naccount of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, from the pen of a writer\r\nwho has done it full justice37:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis poem,\xe2\x80\x9d says Coleridge, \xe2\x80\x9cis a short mock-heroic of ancient date.\r\nThe text varies in different editions, and is obviously disturbed and\r\ncorrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to have been a juvenile\r\nessay of Homer\xe2\x80\x99s genius; others have attributed it to the same Pigrees,\r\nmentioned above, and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited\r\nthe appropriation of any piece of ancient wit, the author of which was\r\nuncertain; so little did the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies,\r\nknow or care about that department of criticism employed in determining\r\nthe genuineness of ancient writings. As to this little poem being a\r\nyouthful profusion of Homer, it seems sufficient to say that from the\r\nbeginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody, not only of the\r\ngeneral spirit, but of the numerous passages of the Iliad itself; and\r\neven, if no such intention to parody were discernible in it, the\r\nobjection would still remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque\r\nto be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse\r\nthat order in the development of national taste, which the history of\r\nevery other people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost\r\nascertained to be a law of the human mind; it is in a state of society\r\nmuch more refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad, that\r\nany popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is\r\ncontained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed three\r\nother poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see, with as\r\nmuch reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe that none of\r\nthem were of the Homeric age. Knight infers from the usage of the word\r\ndeltos, \xe2\x80\x9cwriting tablet,\xe2\x80\x9d instead of diphthera, \xe2\x80\x9cskin,\xe2\x80\x9d which,\r\naccording to Herod. 5, 58, was the material employed by the Asiatic\r\nGreeks for that purpose, that this poem was another offspring of Attic\r\ningenuity; and generally that the familiar mention of the cock (v. 191)\r\nis a strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndesign, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation,\r\nand on my own purpose in the present edition.\r\n\r\nPope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his\r\nearliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby.\r\nIt is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a\r\ndisposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive\r\ndeeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his\r\nwhole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a\r\ntranslation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes,\r\nwhich prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical\r\nattainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it\r\nis probable that these examinations were the result rather of the\r\ncontradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a\r\nperfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called\r\nliteral translation was less cultivated than at present. If something\r\nlike the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of\r\na practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing\r\nfluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the\r\npoet\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, his _words_ were less jealously sought for, and those\r\nwho could read so good a poem as Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Iliad had fair reason to be\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nIt would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope\xe2\x80\x99s translation by our own\r\nadvancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to look at\r\nit as a most delightful work in itself,\xe2\x80\x94a work which is as much a part\r\nof English literature as Homer himself is of Greek. We must not be torn\r\nfrom our kindly associations with the old Iliad, that once was our most\r\ncherished companion, or our most looked-for prize, merely because\r\nButtmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to\r\namphikupellon being an adjective, and not a substantive. Far be it from\r\nus to defend the faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfine, bold, rough old English;\xe2\x80\x94far be it from us to hold up his\r\ntranslation as what a translation of Homer _might_ be. But we can still\r\ndismiss Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the\r\nconsciousness that they must have read a very great number of books\r\nbefore they have read its fellow.\r\n\r\nAs to the Notes accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up\r\nwithout pretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general\r\nreader. Having some little time since translated all the works of Homer\r\nfor another publisher, I might have brought a large amount of\r\naccumulated matter, sometimes of a critical character, to bear upon the\r\ntext. But Pope\xe2\x80\x99s version was no field for such a display; and my\r\npurpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions,\r\nto notice occasionally _some_ departures from the original, and to give\r\na few parallel passages from our English Homer, Milton. In the latter\r\ntask I cannot pretend to novelty, but I trust that my other\r\nannotations, while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views, will be\r\nfound to convey as much as is wanted; at least, as far as the necessary\r\nlimits of these volumes could be expected to admit. To write a\r\ncommentary on Homer is not my present aim; but if I have made Pope\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntranslation a little more entertaining and instructive to a mass of\r\nmiscellaneous readers, I shall consider my wishes satisfactorily\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ALOIS BUCKLEY.\r\n\r\n_Christ Church._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPE\xe2\x80\x99S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER\r\n\r\n\r\nHomer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any\r\nwriter whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested\r\nwith him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular\r\nexcellences; but his invention remains yet unrivalled. Nor is it a\r\nwonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most\r\nexcelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the\r\ninvention that, in different degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses:\r\nthe utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry, which\r\nmasters everything besides, can never attain to this. It furnishes art\r\nwith all her materials, and without it judgment itself can at best but\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csteal wisely:\xe2\x80\x9d for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on\r\nmanaging the riches of nature. Whatever praises may be given to works\r\nof judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them to which the\r\ninvention must not contribute: as in the most regular gardens, art can\r\nonly reduce beauties of nature to more regularity, and such a figure,\r\nwhich the common eye may better take in, and is, therefore, more\r\nentertained with. And, perhaps, the reason why common critics are\r\ninclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and\r\nfruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue\r\ntheir observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art, than to\r\ncomprehend the vast and various extent of nature.\r\n\r\nOur author\xe2\x80\x99s work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the\r\nbeauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the\r\nnumber of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery,\r\nwhich contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of\r\nwhich those who followed him have but selected some particular plants,\r\neach according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things\r\nare too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if\r\nothers are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only because\r\nthey are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature.\r\n\r\nIt is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute\r\nthat unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer, that no\r\nman of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him.\r\nWhat he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thing\r\nmoves, every thing lives, and is put in action. If a council be called,\r\nor a battle fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said or\r\ndone as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by\r\nthe force of the poet\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, and turns in one place to a\r\nhearer, in another to a spectator. The course of his verses resembles\r\nthat of the army he describes,\r\n\r\nHoid\xe2\x80\x99 ar\xe2\x80\x99 isan hosei te puri chthon pasa nemoito. \xe2\x80\x9cThey pour along like\r\na fire that sweeps the whole earth before it.\xe2\x80\x9d It is, however,\r\nremarkable, that his fancy, which is everywhere vigorous, is not\r\ndiscovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest\r\nsplendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and others, and\r\nbecomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity. Exact\r\ndisposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers, may\r\nhave been found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this \xe2\x80\x9cvivida vis\r\nanimi,\xe2\x80\x9d in a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect or\r\nneglected, this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even while\r\nwe disapprove. Nay, where this appears, though attended with\r\nabsurdities, it brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing\r\nbut its own splendour. This fire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned\r\nas through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than fierce, but\r\neverywhere equal and constant: in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in\r\nsudden, short, and interrupted flashes: In Milton it glows like a\r\nfurnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art: in\r\nShakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental fire from\r\nheaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burns everywhere clearly and\r\neverywhere irresistibly.\r\n\r\nI shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in\r\na manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent\r\nparts of his work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which\r\ndistinguishes him from all other authors.\r\n\r\nThis strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the\r\nviolence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed\r\nnot enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole\r\ncompass of nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward\r\npassions and affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all\r\nthe outward forms and images of things for his descriptions: but\r\nwanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and\r\nboundless walk for his imagination, and created a world for himself in\r\nthe invention of fable. That which Aristotle calls \xe2\x80\x9cthe soul of\r\npoetry,\xe2\x80\x9d was first breathed into it by Homer. I shall begin with\r\nconsidering him in his part, as it is naturally the first; and I speak\r\nof it both as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken for\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\nFable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the\r\nmarvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as,\r\nthough they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature;\r\nor of such as, though they did, became fables by the additional\r\nepisodes and manner of telling them. Of this sort is the main story of\r\nan epic poem, \xe2\x80\x9cThe return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in\r\nItaly,\xe2\x80\x9d or the like. That of the Iliad is the \xe2\x80\x9canger of Achilles,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nmost short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet\r\nthis he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events, and\r\ncrowded with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and\r\nepisodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those poems whose\r\nschemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is\r\nhurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration\r\nemploys not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a\r\ngenius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as\r\na greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npoems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The\r\nother epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it\r\nso far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of\r\naction, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor\r\nis it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his\r\ninvention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of\r\nstory. If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up\r\ntheir forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus,\r\nVirgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them)\r\ndestroys the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses\r\nvisit the shades, the \xc3\x86neas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent\r\nafter him. If he be detained from his return by the allurements of\r\nCalypso, so is \xc3\x86neas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be\r\nabsent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem,\r\nRinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account. If he\r\ngives his hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil and Tasso make the\r\nsame present to theirs. Virgil has not only observed this close\r\nimitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the way, supplied the\r\nwant from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon, and the taking\r\nof Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word from\r\nPisander, as the loves of Dido and \xc3\x86neas are taken from those of Medea\r\nand Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.\r\n\r\nTo proceed to the allegorical fable\xe2\x80\x94If we reflect upon those\r\ninnumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy\r\nwhich Homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories,\r\nwhat a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us!\r\nHow fertile will that imagination appear, which was able to clothe all\r\nthe properties of elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues\r\nand vices, in forms and persons, and to introduce them into actions\r\nagreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed! This is a field in\r\nwhich no succeeding poets could dispute with Homer, and whatever\r\ncommendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means for\r\ntheir invention in having enlarged his circle, but for their judgment\r\nin having contracted it. For when the mode of learning changed in the\r\nfollowing ages, and science was delivered in a plainer manner, it then\r\nbecame as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside, as it\r\nwas in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was no unhappy\r\ncircumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that demand\r\nupon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all\r\nthose allegorical parts of a poem.\r\n\r\nThe marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially\r\nthe machines of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced the\r\ndeities (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of Greece, he seems\r\nthe first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and\r\nsuch a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we find\r\nthose authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods,\r\nconstantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support\r\nof it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a\r\nphilosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic,\r\nthat mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have\r\nbeen able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set:\r\nevery attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the\r\nvarious changes of times and religions, his gods continue to this day\r\nthe gods of poetry.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no\r\nauthor has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a\r\nvariety, or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them.\r\nEvery one has something so singularly his own, that no painter could\r\nhave distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by\r\ntheir manners. Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has\r\nobserved in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single\r\nquality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters\r\nof the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and intractable; that of\r\nDiomede forward, yet listening to advice, and subject to command; that\r\nof Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of Hector, active and vigilant:\r\nthe courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition;\r\nthat of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people: we\r\nfind in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in Sarpedon a gallant and\r\ngenerous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be\r\nfound only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each\r\ncharacter, but even in the under parts of it, to which he takes care to\r\ngive a tincture of that principal one. For example: the main characters\r\nof Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this,\r\nthat the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural,\r\nopen, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage; and\r\nthis quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of\r\nhis prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other\r\nupon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these\r\nkinds. The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open\r\nmanner; they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and,\r\nwhere they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to\r\nthose of Homer. His characters of valour are much alike; even that of\r\nTurnus seems no way peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and\r\nwe see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of\r\nSergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest. In like manner it may be remarked of\r\nStatius\xe2\x80\x99s heroes, that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; the\r\nsame horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus,\r\nHippomedon, &c. They have a parity of character, which makes them seem\r\nbrothers of one family. I believe when the reader is led into this\r\ntract of reflection, if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic\r\nwriters, he will be convinced how infinitely superior, in this point,\r\nthe invention of Homer was to that of all others.\r\n\r\nThe speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters;\r\nbeing perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners,\r\nof those who utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the\r\nIliad, so there is of speeches, than in any other poem. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything in\r\nit has manner\xe2\x80\x9d (as Aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is\r\nacted or spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how\r\nsmall a number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the\r\ndramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches\r\noften consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be\r\nequally just in any person\xe2\x80\x99s mouth upon the same occasion. As many of\r\nhis persons have no apparent characters, so many of his speeches escape\r\nbeing applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think of\r\nthe author himself when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in\r\nHomer, all which are the effects of a colder invention, that interests\r\nus less in the action described. Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil\r\nleaves us readers.\r\n\r\nIf, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same\r\npresiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his\r\nthoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part\r\nHomer principally excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the\r\ngrandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that they\r\nhave so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture. Duport, in his\r\nGnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this sort.\r\nAnd it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if\r\nVirgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so\r\nmany that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom rises\r\ninto very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the Iliad.\r\n\r\nIf we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the\r\ninvention still predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast\r\ncomprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance\r\nof art, and individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and\r\nfecundity of his imagination to which all things, in their various\r\nviews presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions\r\ntaken off to perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full\r\nprospects of things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side\r\nviews, unobserved by any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as\r\nthe descriptions of his battles, which take up no less than half the\r\nIliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents, that no\r\none bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that\r\nno two heroes are wounded in the same manner, and such a profusion of\r\nnoble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in greatness,\r\nhorror, and confusion. It is certain there is not near that number of\r\nimages and descriptions in any epic poet, though every one has assisted\r\nhimself with a great quantity out of him; and it is evident of Virgil\r\nespecially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\nIf we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright\r\nimagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We\r\nacknowledge him the father of poetical diction; the first who taught\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9clanguage of the gods\xe2\x80\x9d to men. His expression is like the\r\ncolouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be laid on\r\nboldly, and executed with rapidity. It is, indeed, the strongest and\r\nmost glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit.\r\nAristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who had found out\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cliving words;\xe2\x80\x9d there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than\r\nin any good author whatever. An arrow is \xe2\x80\x9cimpatient\xe2\x80\x9d to be on the wing,\r\na weapon \xe2\x80\x9cthirsts\xe2\x80\x9d to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like, yet\r\nhis expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in\r\nproportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the\r\ndiction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the\r\nsame degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter,\r\nas that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass\r\nin the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a\r\ngreater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the\r\nheat more intense.\r\n\r\nTo throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected\r\nthe compound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper\r\nto poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted\r\nand filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise\r\nconduced in some measure to thicken the images. On this last\r\nconsideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of\r\nhis invention, since (as he has managed them) they are a sort of\r\nsupernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were\r\njoined. We see the motion of Hector\xe2\x80\x99s plumes in the epithet\r\nKorythaiolos, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Einosiphyllos,\r\nand so of others, which particular images could not have been insisted\r\nupon so long as to express them in a description (though but of a\r\nsingle line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal\r\naction or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these\r\nepithets is a short description.\r\n\r\nLastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a\r\nshare of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not\r\nsatisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of\r\nGreece, but searched through its different dialects with this\r\nparticular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered\r\nthese as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and\r\naccordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater\r\nsmoothness or strength. What he most affected was the Ionic, which has\r\na peculiar sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its\r\ncustom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make\r\nthe words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency.\r\nWith this he mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the\r\nfeebler \xc3\x86olic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its\r\naccent, and completed this variety by altering some letters with the\r\nlicence of poetry. Thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his\r\nsense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his\r\nrapture, and even to give a further representation of his notions, in\r\nthe correspondence of their sounds to what they signified. Out of all\r\nthese he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not\r\nonly the richest head, but the finest ear in the world. This is so\r\ngreat a truth, that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses,\r\neven without understanding them (with the same sort of diligence as we\r\ndaily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will find more\r\nsweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language of\r\npoetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be\r\ncopied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to\r\nascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has some\r\nadvantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and\r\ncadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language.\r\nVirgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in\r\nworking up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was\r\ncapable of, and, in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his\r\nline to a beautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has\r\nnot been so frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the\r\nonly reason is, that fewer critics have understood one language than\r\nthe other. Dionysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our\r\nauthor\xe2\x80\x99s beauties in this kind, in his treatise of the Composition of\r\nWords. It suffices at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow\r\nwith so much ease, as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than\r\nto transcribe as fast as the Muses dictated, and, at the same time,\r\nwith so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise\r\nus like the sound of a trumpet. They roll along as a plentiful river,\r\nalways in motion, and always full; while we are borne away by a tide of\r\nverse, the most rapid, and yet the most smooth imaginable.\r\n\r\nThus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us\r\nis his invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of\r\nhis work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more\r\nextensive and copious than any other, his manners more lively and\r\nstrongly marked, his speeches more affecting and transported, his\r\nsentiments more warm and sublime, his images and descriptions more full\r\nand animated, his expression more raised and daring, and his numbers\r\nmore rapid and various. I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with\r\nregard to any of these heads, I have no way derogated from his\r\ncharacter. Nothing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of\r\ncomparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in\r\nthem, and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole.\r\nWe ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and\r\ndistinguishing excellence of each: it is in that we are to consider\r\nhim, and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him. No\r\nauthor or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty; and\r\nas Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in judgment. Not that\r\nwe are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because Virgil had it in a\r\nmore eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, because Homer\r\npossessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors had more of\r\nboth than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in\r\ncomparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the\r\nbetter artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work.\r\nHomer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil\r\nleads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generous\r\nprofusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like the\r\nNile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a\r\nriver in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold\r\ntheir battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they\r\ncelebrate. Homer, boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all\r\nbefore him, and shines more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil,\r\ncalmly daring, like \xc3\x86neas, appears undisturbed in the midst of the\r\naction; disposes all about him, and conquers with tranquillity. And\r\nwhen we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his own Jupiter in\r\nhis terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the\r\nheavens: Virgil, like the same power in his benevolence, counselling\r\nwith the gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his\r\nwhole creation.\r\n\r\nBut after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they\r\nnaturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to\r\ndistinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As\r\nprudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment\r\ndecline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or\r\nextravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness. If we\r\nlook upon Homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief objections\r\nagainst him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this\r\nfaculty.\r\n\r\nAmong these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which\r\nso much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of\r\nprobability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with\r\ngigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength,\r\nexceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become\r\nmiracles in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit\r\nsomething near extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable\r\nperformances. Thus Homer has his \xe2\x80\x9cspeaking horses;\xe2\x80\x9d and Virgil his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmyrtles distilling blood;\xe2\x80\x9d where the latter has not so much as\r\ncontrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have been\r\nthought too exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of this\r\nfaculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability to confine\r\nitself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is\r\ngrounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images, which,\r\nhowever, are so managed as not to overpower the main one. His similes\r\nare like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its\r\nproportion given agreeable to the original, but is also set off with\r\noccasional ornaments and prospects. The same will account for his\r\nmanner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when\r\nhis fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent\r\nimages. The reader will easily extend this observation to more\r\nobjections of the same kind.\r\n\r\nIf there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or\r\nnarrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will\r\nbe found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the\r\ntimes he lived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods;\r\nand the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here\r\nspeak a word of the latter, as it is a point generally carried into\r\nextremes, both by the censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a\r\nstrange partiality to antiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,38 \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthose times and manners are so much the more excellent, as they are\r\nmore contrary to ours.\xe2\x80\x9d Who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to\r\nmagnify the felicity of those ages, when a spirit of revenge and\r\ncruelty, joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reigned\r\nthrough the world: when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre;\r\nwhen the greatest princes were put to the sword, and their wives and\r\ndaughters made slaves and concubines? On the other side, I would not be\r\nso delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked at the servile\r\noffices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of\r\nHomer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity,\r\nin opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholding monarchs\r\nwithout their guards; princes tending their flocks, and princesses\r\ndrawing water from the springs. When we read Homer, we ought to reflect\r\nthat we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world; and\r\nthose who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in the\r\nperusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted with nations\r\nand people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost three\r\nthousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining\r\nthemselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to\r\nbe found, the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means\r\nalone their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates\r\ntheir dislike, will become a satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThis consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of\r\nthe same epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the \xe2\x80\x9cfar-darting\r\nPhoebus,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cblue-eyed Pallas,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cswift-footed Achilles,\xe2\x80\x9d &c.,\r\nwhich some have censured as impertinent, and tediously repeated. Those\r\nof the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to\r\nbelong to them; and had contracted a weight and veneration from the\r\nrites and solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of\r\nattributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all\r\noccasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit. As for the epithets\r\nof great men, Mons. Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature\r\nof surnames, and repeated as such; for the Greeks having no names\r\nderived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinction\r\nof each person; either naming his parents expressly, or his place of\r\nbirth, profession, or the like: as Alexander the son of Philip,\r\nHerodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &c. Homer, therefore,\r\ncomplying with the custom of his country, used such distinctive\r\nadditions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we have something\r\nparallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold\r\nHarefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince,\r\n&c. If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for\r\nthe repetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the\r\nworld into its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the\r\nbrazen and the iron one, of \xe2\x80\x9cheroes distinct from other men; a divine\r\nrace who fought at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by\r\nthe care of Jupiter in the islands of the blessed.\xe2\x80\x9d Now among the\r\ndivine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in\r\ncommon with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an\r\nepithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their\r\nfamilies, actions or qualities.\r\n\r\nWhat other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly\r\ndeserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the\r\ncourse of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious\r\nendeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should\r\nthink to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation: one\r\nwould imagine, by the whole course of their parallels, that these\r\ncritics never so much as heard of Homer\xe2\x80\x99s having written first; a\r\nconsideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have\r\nalways in his eye. Some accuse him for the same things which they\r\noverlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the fable and\r\nmoral of the \xc3\x86neis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which\r\nmight set the Odyssey above the \xc3\x86neis; as that the hero is a wiser man,\r\nand the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of\r\nthe other; or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed;\r\nas because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as \xc3\x86neas, when\r\nthe very moral of his poem required a contrary character: it is thus\r\nthat Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Others select\r\nthose particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as some\r\nthat Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of Scaliger\r\nin his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean\r\nexpressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement, oftener\r\nfrom an ignorance of the graces of the original, and then triumph in\r\nthe awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of\r\nPerrault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to\r\na fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer,\r\nand that of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the\r\ngreat reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his\r\ntimes, and the prejudice of those that followed; and in pursuance of\r\nthis principle, they make those accidents (such as the contention of\r\nthe cities, &c.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality\r\nthe consequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of\r\nVirgil, or any great author whose general character will infallibly\r\nraise many casual additions to their reputation. This is the method of\r\nMons. de la Mott; who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age\r\nHomer had lived, he must have been the greatest poet of his nation, and\r\nthat he may be said in his sense to be the master even of those who\r\nsurpassed him.39\r\n\r\nIn all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to\r\nthe honour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed\r\nthe characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his\r\nfollowers, he still continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may\r\ncommit fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of\r\ncritics: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most\r\nuniversal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the\r\nstrongest enchantment. Homer not only appears the inventor of poetry,\r\nbut excels all the inventors of other arts, in this, that he has\r\nswallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him. What he has done\r\nadmitted no increase, it only left room for contraction or regulation.\r\nHe showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in\r\nsome of his flights, it was but because he attempted everything. A work\r\nof this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from the most\r\nvigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and produces the\r\nfinest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit\r\njoin to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults, have\r\nonly said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of\r\nnature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.\r\n\r\nHaving now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it\r\nremains to treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief\r\ncharacteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem,\r\nsuch as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice\r\nit but by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in\r\nevery particular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too\r\nmuch softens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the\r\nfirst grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and\r\nunmaimed; and for the rest, the diction and versification only are his\r\nproper province, since these must be his own, but the others he is to\r\ntake as he finds them.\r\n\r\nIt should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in\r\nour language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no\r\nliteral translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior\r\nlanguage: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that\r\na rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no\r\nless in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the\r\nmodern manners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there\r\nis often a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a\r\nversion almost literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but\r\nthose which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original,\r\nand supporting the poetical style of the translation: and I will\r\nventure to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by\r\na servile, dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours\r\nby a chimerical, insolent hope of raising and improving their author.\r\nIt is not to be doubted, that the fire of the poem is what a translator\r\nshould principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his\r\nmanaging: however, it is his safest way to be content with preserving\r\nthis to his utmost in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than\r\nhe finds his author is, in any particular place. It is a great secret\r\nin writing, to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figurative;\r\nand it is what Homer will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in\r\nhis footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours\r\nas high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to\r\nbe deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of\r\na mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to have been\r\nmore commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of his\r\ntranslators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the\r\nsublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of\r\nsimplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some\r\nsweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the\r\ncertain signs of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in\r\nhis train, while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an\r\nunaffected and equal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes\r\none could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be\r\nenvied for such commendations, as he may gain by that character of\r\nstyle, which his friends must agree together to call simplicity, and\r\nthe rest of the world will call dulness. There is a graceful and\r\ndignified simplicity, as well as a bold and sordid one; which differ as\r\nmuch from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven:\r\nit is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all.\r\nSimplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity.\r\n\r\nThis pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the\r\nScripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the\r\ninspired writings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words\r\nbut what were intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that\r\npart of the world; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his\r\nstyle must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books\r\nthan that of any other writer. This consideration (together with what\r\nhas been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks,\r\ninduce a translator, on the one hand, to give in to several of those\r\ngeneral phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a\r\nveneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament;\r\nas, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the\r\nDivinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.\r\n\r\nFor a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care\r\nshould be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and\r\nproverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They have\r\nsomething venerable, and as I may say, oracular, in that unadorned\r\ngravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which\r\nwould be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more\r\ningenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the mixture of some Graecisms and old words after the manner of\r\nMilton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill\r\neffect in a version of this particular work, which most of any other\r\nseems to require a venerable, antique cast. But certainly the use of\r\nmodern terms of war and government, such as \xe2\x80\x9cplatoon, campaign, junto,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor the like, (into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot be\r\nallowable; those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat\r\nthe subjects in any living language.\r\n\r\nThere are two peculiarities in Homer\xe2\x80\x99s diction, which are a sort of\r\nmarks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first\r\nsight; those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as\r\ndefects, and those who are, seemed pleased with them as beauties. I\r\nspeak of his compound epithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the\r\nformer cannot be done literally into English without destroying the\r\npurity of our language. I believe such should be retained as slide\r\neasily of themselves into an English compound, without violence to the\r\near or to the received rules of composition, as well as those which\r\nhave received a sanction from the authority of our best poets, and are\r\nbecome familiar through their use of them; such as \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ncloud-compelling Jove,\xe2\x80\x9d &c. As for the rest, whenever any can be as\r\nfully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded\r\none, the course to be taken is obvious.\r\n\r\nSome that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one\r\nor two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the\r\nepithet einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous\r\ntranslated literally \xe2\x80\x9cleaf-shaking,\xe2\x80\x9d but affords a majestic idea in the\r\nperiphrasis: \xe2\x80\x9cthe lofty mountain shakes his waving woods.\xe2\x80\x9d Others that\r\nadmit of different significations, may receive an advantage from a\r\njudicious variation, according to the occasions on which they are\r\nintroduced. For example, the epithet of Apollo, hekaebolos or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfar-shooting,\xe2\x80\x9d is capable of two explications; one literal, in respect\r\nof the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the other allegorical,\r\nwith regard to the rays of the sun; therefore, in such places where\r\nApollo is represented as a god in person, I would use the former\r\ninterpretation; and where the effects of the sun are described, I would\r\nmake choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be necessary to\r\navoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in\r\nHomer, and which, though it might be accommodated (as has been already\r\nshown) to the ear of those times, is by no means so to ours: but one\r\nmay wait for opportunities of placing them, where they derive an\r\nadditional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed; and in\r\ndoing this properly, a translator may at once show his fancy and his\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nAs for Homer\xe2\x80\x99s repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of\r\nwhole narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or\r\nhemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these,\r\nas neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor\r\nto offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not\r\nungraceful in those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders\r\nit a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods\r\nto men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or\r\nwhere the ceremonial of religion seems to require it, in the solemn\r\nforms of prayers, oaths, or the like. In other cases, I believe the\r\nbest rule is, to be guided by the nearness, or distance, at which the\r\nrepetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close, one\r\nmay vary the expression; but it is a question, whether a professed\r\ntranslator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious, the author is\r\nto answer for it.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said)\r\nis perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every\r\nnew subject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of\r\npoetry, and attainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for it\r\nin the Greek, and Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what may\r\nsometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully possessed\r\nof his image: however, it may reasonably be believed they designed\r\nthis, in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to\r\nall others. Few readers have the ear to be judges of it: but those who\r\nhave, will see I have endeavoured at this beauty.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing\r\njustice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may\r\nentertain without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him\r\nthan any entire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those\r\nof Chapman, Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an\r\nimmeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce\r\nany paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent\r\ninterpolations of four or six lines; and I remember one in the\r\nthirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty\r\nverses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one\r\nmight think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other places of\r\nhis notes insist so much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had a\r\nstrong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author;\r\ninsomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of the mysteries\r\nhe had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the\r\nobvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in fustian; a\r\nfault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the\r\ntragedy of Bussy d\xe2\x80\x99Amboise, &c. In a word, the nature of the man may\r\naccount for his whole performance; for he appears, from his preface and\r\nremarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in poetry.\r\nHis own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less than fifteen\r\nweeks, shows with what negligence his version was performed. But that\r\nwhich is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover\r\nhis defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation,\r\nwhich is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have\r\nwrit before he arrived at years of discretion.\r\n\r\nHobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but\r\nfor particulars and circumstances he continually lops them, and often\r\nomits the most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close\r\ntranslation, I doubt not many have been led into that error by the\r\nshortness of it, which proceeds not from his following the original\r\nline by line, but from the contractions above mentioned. He sometimes\r\nomits whole similes and sentences; and is now and then guilty of\r\nmistakes, into which no writer of his learning could have fallen, but\r\nthrough carelessness. His poetry, as well as Ogilby\xe2\x80\x99s, is too mean for\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nIt is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live\r\nto translate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book, and a small\r\npart of the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly\r\ninterpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be\r\nexcused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to\r\nhave had too much regard to Chapman, whose words he sometimes copies,\r\nand has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the\r\noriginal. However, had he translated the whole work, I would no more\r\nhave attempted Homer after him than Virgil: his version of whom\r\n(notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spirited\r\ntranslation I know in any language. But the fate of great geniuses is\r\nlike that of great ministers: though they are confessedly the first in\r\nthe commonwealth of letters, they must be envied and calumniated only\r\nfor being at the head of it.\r\n\r\nThat which, in my opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one who\r\ntranslates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and\r\nfire which makes his chief character: in particular places, where the\r\nsense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as\r\nmost agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of\r\nhis style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve,\r\nin the more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the\r\nmore sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a\r\nfulness and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not\r\nto neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor\r\nsometimes the very cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound\r\nany rites or customs of antiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the\r\nwhole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any\r\ntranslator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry. What\r\nI would further recommend to him is, to study his author rather from\r\nhis own text, than from any commentaries, how learned soever, or\r\nwhatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world; to\r\nconsider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the\r\nancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these, the\r\nArchbishop of Cambray\xe2\x80\x99s Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the\r\nspirit and turn of our author; and Bossu\xe2\x80\x99s admirable Treatise of the\r\nEpic Poem the justest notion of his design and conduct. But after all,\r\nwith whatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever\r\nhappiness he may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few;\r\nthose only who have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning.\r\nFor to satisfy such a want either, is not in the nature of this\r\nundertaking; since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not\r\nmodern, and a pedant nothing that is not Greek.\r\n\r\nWhat I have done is submitted to the public; from whose opinions I am\r\nprepared to learn; though I fear no judges so little as our best poets,\r\nwho are most sensible of the weight of this task. As for the worst,\r\nwhatever they shall please to say, they may give me some concern as\r\nthey are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers. I was\r\nguided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and\r\nby persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be\r\ntrue, that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men\r\nof wit. Mr. Addison was the first whose advice determined me to\r\nundertake this task; who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion\r\nin such terms as I cannot repeat without vanity. I was obliged to Sir\r\nRichard Steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the\r\npublic. Dr. Swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he\r\nalways serves his friend. The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel\r\nGarth are what I never knew wanting on any occasion. I must also\r\nacknowledge, with infinite pleasure, the many friendly offices, as well\r\nas sincere criticisms, of Mr. Congreve, who had led me the way in\r\ntranslating some parts of Homer. I must add the names of Mr. Rowe, and\r\nDr. Parnell, though I shall take a further opportunity of doing justice\r\nto the last, whose good nature (to give it a great panegyric), is no\r\nless extensive than his learning. The favour of these gentlemen is not\r\nentirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection. But\r\nwhat can I say of the honour so many of the great have done me; while\r\nthe first names of the age appear as my subscribers, and the most\r\ndistinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief\r\nencouragers? Among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find,\r\nthat my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to\r\nthe name of poet: that his grace the Duke of Buckingham was not\r\ndispleased I should undertake the author to whom he has given (in his\r\nexcellent Essay), so complete a praise:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead Homer once, and you can read no more;\r\nFor all books else appear so mean, so poor,\r\nVerse will seem prose: but still persist to read,\r\nAnd Homer will be all the books you need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThat the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me; of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his generosity or his example: that such a genius as my Lord Bolingbroke, not more distinguished in the great scenes of business, than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning, has not refused to be the critic of these sheets, and the patron of their writer: and that the noble author of the tragedy of \xe2\x80\x9cHeroic Love\xe2\x80\x9d has continued his partiality to me, from my writing pastorals to my attempting the Iliad. I cannot deny myself the pride of confessing, that I have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general, but their correction of several particulars of this translation.\r\n\r\nI could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the\r\nEarl of Carnarvon; but it is almost absurd to particularize any one\r\ngenerous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of\r\nthem. Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary of state, will pardon my\r\ndesire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair.\r\nThe particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late Lord\r\nChancellor) gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his\r\nfriendship. I must attribute to the same motive that of several others\r\nof my friends: to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by\r\nthe privileges of a familiar correspondence; and I am satisfied I can\r\nno way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence.\r\n\r\nIn short, I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. He would\r\nhave thought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens that\r\nhas been shown me by its learned rival, the University of Oxford. And I\r\ncan hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death, when\r\nI reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy\r\nfriendships, which make the satisfaction of life. This distinction is\r\nthe more to be acknowledged, as it is shown to one whose pen has never\r\ngratified the prejudices of particular parties, or the vanities of\r\nparticular men. Whatever the success may prove, I shall never repent of\r\nan undertaking in which I have experienced the candour and friendship\r\nof so many persons of merit; and in which I hope to pass some of those\r\nyears of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies, after a\r\nmanner neither wholly unuseful to others, nor disagreeable to myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ILIAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.40\r\n\r\nTHE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.\r\n\r\nIn the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring\r\ntowns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseis and\r\nBriseis, allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles.\r\nChryses, the father of Chryseis, and priest of Apollo, comes to the\r\nGrecian camp to ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in\r\nthe tenth year of the siege. The priest being refused, and insolently\r\ndismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who\r\ninflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and\r\nencourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the\r\nrefusal of Chryseis. The king, being obliged to send back his captive,\r\nenters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies;\r\nhowever, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on\r\nBriseis in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his\r\nforces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she\r\nsupplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her\r\nson, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter, granting her suit,\r\nincenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till they are\r\nreconciled by the address of Vulcan.\r\n\r\nThe time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine during\r\nthe plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes, and twelve\r\nfor Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s stay with the \xc3\x86thiopians, at whose return Thetis prefers\r\nher petition. The scene lies in the Grecian camp, then changes to\r\nChrysa, and lastly to Olympus.\r\n\r\nAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 wrath, to Greece the direful spring\r\nOf woes unnumber\xe2\x80\x99d, heavenly goddess, sing!\r\nThat wrath which hurl\xe2\x80\x99d to Pluto\xe2\x80\x99s gloomy reign\r\nThe souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;\r\nWhose limbs unburied on the naked shore,\r\nDevouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.41\r\nSince great Achilles and Atrides strove,\r\nSuch was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove!42\r\n\r\nDeclare, O Muse! in what ill-fated hour43\r\nSprung the fierce strife, from what offended power\r\nLatona\xe2\x80\x99s son a dire contagion spread,44\r\nAnd heap\xe2\x80\x99d the camp with mountains of the dead;\r\nThe king of men his reverent priest defied,45\r\nAnd for the king\xe2\x80\x99s offence the people died.\r\n\r\nFor Chryses sought with costly gifts to gain\r\nHis captive daughter from the victor\xe2\x80\x99s chain.\r\nSuppliant the venerable father stands;\r\nApollo\xe2\x80\x99s awful ensigns grace his hands:\r\nBy these he begs; and lowly bending down,\r\nExtends the sceptre and the laurel crown.\r\nHe sued to all, but chief implored for grace\r\nThe brother-kings, of Atreus\xe2\x80\x99 royal race46\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe kings and warriors! may your vows be crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd Troy\xe2\x80\x99s proud walls lie level with the ground.\r\nMay Jove restore you when your toils are o\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nSafe to the pleasures of your native shore.\r\nBut, oh! relieve a wretched parent\xe2\x80\x99s pain,\r\nAnd give Chryseis to these arms again;\r\nIf mercy fail, yet let my presents move,\r\nAnd dread avenging Phoebus, son of Jove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Greeks in shouts their joint assent declare,\r\nThe priest to reverence, and release the fair.\r\nNot so Atrides; he, with kingly pride,\r\nRepulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains,\r\nNor ask, presumptuous, what the king detains:\r\n\r\nHence, with thy laurel crown, and golden rod,\r\nNor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.\r\nMine is thy daughter, priest, and shall remain;\r\nAnd prayers, and tears, and bribes, shall plead in vain;\r\nTill time shall rifle every youthful grace,\r\nAnd age dismiss her from my cold embrace,\r\nIn daily labours of the loom employ\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nOr doom\xe2\x80\x99d to deck the bed she once enjoy\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nHence then; to Argos shall the maid retire,\r\nFar from her native soil and weeping sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOMER INVOKING THE MUSE.]\r\n\r\nThe trembling priest along the shore return\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd in the anguish of a father mourn\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nDisconsolate, not daring to complain,\r\nSilent he wander\xe2\x80\x99d by the sounding main;\r\nTill, safe at distance, to his god he prays,\r\nThe god who darts around the world his rays.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Smintheus! sprung from fair Latona\xe2\x80\x99s line,47\r\nThou guardian power of Cilla the divine,48\r\nThou source of light! whom Tenedos adores,\r\nAnd whose bright presence gilds thy Chrysa\xe2\x80\x99s shores.\r\nIf e\xe2\x80\x99er with wreaths I hung thy sacred fane,49\r\nOr fed the flames with fat of oxen slain;\r\nGod of the silver bow!

The\r\ngeneral, who is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy without his\r\nassistance, but fears the army was discouraged by his absence, and the\r\nlate plague, as well as by the length of time, contrives to make trial\r\nof their disposition by a stratagem. He first communicates his design\r\nto the princes in council, that he would propose a return to the\r\nsoldiers, and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal was\r\nembraced. Then he assembles the whole host, and upon moving for a\r\nreturn to Greece, they unanimously agree to it, and run to prepare the\r\nships. They are detained by the management of Ulysses, who chastises\r\nthe insolence of Thersites. The assembly is recalled, several speeches\r\nmade on the occasion, and at length the advice of Nestor followed,\r\nwhich was to make a general muster of the troops, and to divide them\r\ninto their several nations, before they proceeded to battle. This gives\r\noccasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the Greeks and\r\nTrojans, and in a large catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day. The\r\nscene lies in the Grecian camp, and upon the sea-shore; towards the end\r\nit removes to Troy.\r\n\r\nNow pleasing sleep had seal\xe2\x80\x99d each mortal eye,\r\nStretch\xe2\x80\x99d in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:\r\nThe immortals slumber\xe2\x80\x99d on their thrones above;\r\nAll, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.76\r\nTo honour Thetis\xe2\x80\x99 son he bends his care,\r\nAnd plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:\r\nThen bids an empty phantom rise to sight,\r\nAnd thus commands the vision of the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFly hence, deluding Dream! and light as air,77\r\nTo Agamemnon\xe2\x80\x99s ample tent repair.\r\nBid him in arms draw forth the embattled train,\r\nLead all his Grecians to the dusty plain.\r\nDeclare, e\xe2\x80\x99en now \xe2\x80\x99tis given him to destroy\r\nThe lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.\r\nFor now no more the gods with fate contend,\r\nAt Juno\xe2\x80\x99s suit the heavenly factions end.\r\nDestruction hangs o\xe2\x80\x99er yon devoted wall,\r\nAnd nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSwift as the word the vain illusion fled,\r\nDescends, and hovers o\xe2\x80\x99er Atrides\xe2\x80\x99 head;\r\nClothed in the figure of the Pylian sage,\r\nRenown\xe2\x80\x99d for wisdom, and revered for age:\r\nAround his temples spreads his golden wing,\r\nAnd thus the flattering dream deceives the king.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUPITER SENDING THE EVIL DREAM TO AGAMEMNON.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCanst thou, with all a monarch\xe2\x80\x99s cares oppress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nO Atreus\xe2\x80\x99 son! canst thou indulge thy rest?78\r\nIll fits a chief who mighty nations guides,\r\nDirects in council, and in war presides,\r\nTo whom its safety a whole people owes,\r\nTo waste long nights in indolent repose.79\r\nMonarch, awake! \xe2\x80\x99tis Jove\xe2\x80\x99s command I bear;\r\nThou, and thy glory, claim his heavenly care.\r\nIn just array draw forth the embattled train,\r\nLead all thy Grecians to the dusty plain;\r\nE\xe2\x80\x99en now, O king! \xe2\x80\x99tis given thee to destroy\r\nThe lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.\r\nFor now no more the gods with fate contend,\r\nAt Juno\xe2\x80\x99s suit the heavenly factions end.\r\nDestruction hangs o\xe2\x80\x99er yon devoted wall,\r\nAnd nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.\r\nAwake, but waking this advice approve,\r\nAnd trust the vision that descends from Jove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe phantom said; then vanish\xe2\x80\x99d from his sight,\r\nResolves to air, and mixes with the night.\r\nA thousand schemes the monarch\xe2\x80\x99s mind employ;\r\nElate in thought he sacks untaken Troy:\r\nVain as he was, and to the future blind,\r\nNor saw what Jove and secret fate design\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhat mighty toils to either host remain,\r\nWhat scenes of grief, and numbers of the slain!\r\nEager he rises, and in fancy hears\r\nThe voice celestial murmuring in his ears.\r\nFirst on his limbs a slender vest he drew,\r\nAround him next the regal mantle threw,\r\nThe embroider\xe2\x80\x99d sandals on his feet were tied;\r\nThe starry falchion glitter\xe2\x80\x99d at his side;\r\nAnd last, his arm the massy sceptre loads,\r\nUnstain\xe2\x80\x99d, immortal, and the gift of gods.\r\n\r\nNow rosy Morn ascends the court of Jove,\r\nLifts up her light, and opens day above.\r\nThe king despatch\xe2\x80\x99d his heralds with commands\r\nTo range the camp and summon all the bands:\r\nThe gathering hosts the monarch\xe2\x80\x99s word obey;\r\nWhile to the fleet Atrides bends his way.\r\nIn his black ship the Pylian prince he found;\r\nThere calls a senate of the peers around:\r\nThe assembly placed, the king of men express\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe counsels labouring in his artful breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriends and confederates! with attentive ear\r\nReceive my words, and credit what you hear.\r\nLate as I slumber\xe2\x80\x99d in the shades of night,\r\nA dream divine appear\xe2\x80\x99d before my sight;\r\nWhose visionary form like Nestor came,\r\nThe same in habit, and in mien the same.80\r\nThe heavenly phantom hover\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er my head,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, dost thou sleep, O Atreus\xe2\x80\x99 son?

this warning should be lost!\r\nThen let us haste, obey the god\xe2\x80\x99s alarms,\r\nAnd join to rouse the sons of Greece to arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus spoke the sage: the kings without delay\r\nDissolve the council, and their chief obey:\r\nThe sceptred rulers lead; the following host,\r\nPour\xe2\x80\x99d forth by thousands, darkens all the coast.\r\nAs from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees\r\nClustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,\r\nRolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms,\r\nWith deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms;\r\nDusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,\r\nAnd o\xe2\x80\x99er the vale descends the living cloud.81\r\nSo, from the tents and ships, a lengthen\xe2\x80\x99d train\r\nSpreads all the beach, and wide o\xe2\x80\x99ershades the plain:\r\nAlong the region runs a deafening sound;\r\nBeneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.\r\nFame flies before the messenger of Jove,\r\nAnd shining soars, and claps her wings above.\r\nNine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud82\r\nThe monarch\xe2\x80\x99s will, suspend the listening crowd.\r\nSoon as the throngs in order ranged appear,\r\nAnd fainter murmurs died upon the ear,\r\nThe king of kings his awful figure raised:\r\nHigh in his hand the golden sceptre blazed;\r\nThe golden sceptre, of celestial flame,\r\nBy Vulcan form\xe2\x80\x99d, from Jove to Hermes came.\r\nTo Pelops he the immortal gift resign\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThe immortal gift great Pelops left behind,\r\nIn Atreus\xe2\x80\x99 hand, which not with Atreus ends,\r\nTo rich Thyestes next the prize descends;\r\nAnd now the mark of Agamemnon\xe2\x80\x99s reign,\r\nSubjects all Argos, and controls the main.83\r\n\r\nOn this bright sceptre now the king reclined,\r\nAnd artful thus pronounced the speech design\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe sons of Mars, partake your leader\xe2\x80\x99s care,\r\nHeroes of Greece, and brothers of the war!\r\nOf partial Jove with justice I complain,\r\nAnd heavenly oracles believed in vain\r\nA safe return was promised to our toils,\r\nRenown\xe2\x80\x99d, triumphant, and enrich\xe2\x80\x99d with spoils.\r\nNow shameful flight alone can save the host,\r\nOur blood, our treasure, and our glory lost.\r\nSo Jove decrees, resistless lord of all!\r\nAt whose command whole empires rise or fall:\r\nHe shakes the feeble props of human trust,\r\nAnd towns and armies humbles to the dust.\r\nWhat shame to Greece a fruitful war to wage,\r\nOh, lasting shame in every future age!\r\nOnce great in arms, the common scorn we grow,\r\nRepulsed and baffled by a feeble foe.\r\nSo small their number, that if wars were ceased,\r\nAnd Greece triumphant held a general feast,\r\nAll rank\xe2\x80\x99d by tens, whole decades when they dine\r\nMust want a Trojan slave to pour the wine.84\r\nBut other forces have our hopes o\xe2\x80\x99erthrown,\r\nAnd Troy prevails by armies not her own.\r\nNow nine long years of mighty Jove are run,\r\nSince first the labours of this war begun:\r\nOur cordage torn, decay\xe2\x80\x99d our vessels lie,\r\nAnd scarce insure the wretched power to fly.\r\nHaste, then, for ever leave the Trojan wall!\r\nOur weeping wives, our tender children call:\r\nLove, duty, safety, summon us away,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis nature\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and nature we obey.\r\nOur shatter\xe2\x80\x99d barks may yet transport us o\xe2\x80\x99er,\r\nSafe and inglorious, to our native shore.\r\nFly, Grecians, fly, your sails and oars employ,\r\nAnd dream no more of heaven-defended Troy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis deep design unknown, the hosts approve\r\nAtrides\xe2\x80\x99 speech. The mighty numbers move.\r\nSo roll the billows to the Icarian shore,\r\nFrom east and south when winds begin to roar,\r\nBurst their dark mansions in the clouds, and sweep\r\nThe whitening surface of the ruffled deep.\r\nAnd as on corn when western gusts descend,85\r\nBefore the blast the lofty harvests bend:\r\nThus o\xe2\x80\x99er the field the moving host appears,\r\nWith nodding plumes and groves of waving spears.\r\nThe gathering murmur spreads, their trampling feet\r\nBeat the loose sands, and thicken to the fleet;\r\nWith long-resounding cries they urge the train\r\nTo fit the ships, and launch into the main.\r\nThey toil, they sweat, thick clouds of dust arise,\r\nThe doubling clamours echo to the skies.\r\nE\xe2\x80\x99en then the Greeks had left the hostile plain,\r\nAnd fate decreed the fall of Troy in vain;\r\nBut Jove\xe2\x80\x99s imperial queen their flight survey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd sighing thus bespoke the blue-eyed maid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall then the Grecians fly! O dire disgrace!\r\nAnd leave unpunish\xe2\x80\x99d this perfidious race?\r\nShall Troy, shall Priam, and the adulterous spouse,\r\nIn peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows?\r\nAnd bravest chiefs, in Helen\xe2\x80\x99s quarrel slain,\r\nLie unrevenged on yon detested plain?\r\nNo: let my Greeks, unmoved by vain alarms,\r\nOnce more refulgent shine in brazen arms.\r\nHaste, goddess, haste! the flying host detain,\r\nNor let one sail be hoisted on the main.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPallas obeys, and from Olympus\xe2\x80\x99 height\r\nSwift to the ships precipitates her flight.\r\nUlysses, first in public cares, she found,\r\nFor prudent counsel like the gods renown\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nOppress\xe2\x80\x99d with generous grief the hero stood,\r\nNor drew his sable vessels to the flood.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it thus, divine Laertes\xe2\x80\x99 son,\r\nThus fly the Greeks (the martial maid begun),\r\nThus to their country bear their own disgrace,\r\nAnd fame eternal leave to Priam\xe2\x80\x99s race?\r\nShall beauteous Helen still remain unfreed,\r\nStill unrevenged, a thousand heroes bleed!\r\nHaste, generous Ithacus! prevent the shame,\r\nRecall your armies, and your chiefs reclaim.\r\nYour own resistless eloquence employ,\r\nAnd to the immortals trust the fall of Troy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice divine confess\xe2\x80\x99d the warlike maid,\r\nUlysses heard, nor uninspired obey\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nThen meeting first Atrides, from his hand\r\nReceived the imperial sceptre of command.\r\nThus graced, attention and respect to gain,\r\nHe runs, he flies through all the Grecian train;\r\nEach prince of name, or chief in arms approved,\r\nHe fired with praise, or with persuasion moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarriors like you, with strength and wisdom bless\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nBy brave examples should confirm the rest.\r\nThe monarch\xe2\x80\x99s will not yet reveal\xe2\x80\x99d appears;\r\nHe tries our courage, but resents our fears.\r\nThe unwary Greeks his fury may provoke;\r\nNot thus the king in secret council spoke.\r\nJove loves our chief, from Jove his honour springs,\r\nBeware! for dreadful is the wrath of kings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut if a clamorous vile plebeian rose,\r\nHim with reproof he check\xe2\x80\x99d or tamed with blows.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe still, thou slave, and to thy betters yield;\r\nUnknown alike in council and in field!\r\nYe gods, what dastards would our host command!\r\nSwept to the war, the lumber of a land.\r\nBe silent, wretch, and think not here allow\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThat worst of tyrants, an usurping crowd.\r\nTo one sole monarch Jove commits the sway;\r\nHis are the laws, and him let all obey.\xe2\x80\x9d86\r\n\r\nWith words like these the troops Ulysses ruled,\r\nThe loudest silenced, and the fiercest cool\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nBack to the assembly roll the thronging train,\r\nDesert the ships, and pour upon the plain.\r\nMurmuring they move, as when old ocean roars,\r\nAnd heaves huge surges to the trembling shores;\r\nThe groaning banks are burst with bellowing sound,\r\nThe rocks remurmur and the deeps rebound.\r\nAt length the tumult sinks, the noises cease,\r\nAnd a still silence lulls the camp to peace.\r\nThersites only clamour\xe2\x80\x99d in the throng,\r\nLoquacious, loud, and turbulent of tongue:\r\nAwed by no shame, by no respect controll\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nIn scandal busy, in reproaches bold:\r\nWith witty malice studious to defame,\r\nScorn all his joy, and laughter all his aim:\xe2\x80\x94\r\nBut chief he gloried with licentious style\r\nTo lash the great, and monarchs to revile.\r\nHis figure such as might his soul proclaim;\r\nOne eye was blinking, and one leg was lame:\r\nHis mountain shoulders half his breast o\xe2\x80\x99erspread,\r\nThin hairs bestrew\xe2\x80\x99d his long misshapen head.\r\nSpleen to mankind his envious heart possess\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd much he hated all, but most the best:\r\nUlysses or Achilles still his theme;\r\nBut royal scandal his delight supreme,\r\nLong had he lived the scorn of every Greek,\r\nVex\xe2\x80\x99d when he spoke, yet still they heard him speak.\r\nSharp was his voice; which in the shrillest tone,\r\nThus with injurious taunts attack\xe2\x80\x99d the throne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmidst the glories of so bright a reign,\r\nWhat moves the great Atrides to complain?\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis thine whate\xe2\x80\x99er the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s breast inflames,\r\nThe golden spoil, and thine the lovely dames.\r\nWith all the wealth our wars and blood bestow,\r\nThy tents are crowded and thy chests o\xe2\x80\x99erflow.\r\nThus at full ease in heaps of riches roll\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhat grieves the monarch? Is it thirst of gold?\r\nSay, shall we march with our unconquer\xe2\x80\x99d powers\r\n(The Greeks and I) to Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s hostile towers,\r\nAnd bring the race of royal bastards here,\r\nFor Troy to ransom at a price too dear?\r\nBut safer plunder thy own host supplies;\r\nSay, wouldst thou seize some valiant leader\xe2\x80\x99s prize?\r\nOr, if thy heart to generous love be led,\r\nSome captive fair, to bless thy kingly bed?\r\nWhate\xe2\x80\x99er our master craves submit we must,\r\nPlagued with his pride, or punish\xe2\x80\x99d for his lust.\r\nOh women of Achaia; men no more!\r\nHence let us fly, and let him waste his store\r\nIn loves and pleasures on the Phrygian shore.\r\nWe may be wanted on some busy day,\r\nWhen Hector comes: so great Achilles may:\r\nFrom him he forced the prize we jointly gave,\r\nFrom him, the fierce, the fearless, and the brave:\r\nAnd durst he, as he ought, resent that wrong,\r\nThis mighty tyrant were no tyrant long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFierce from his seat at this Ulysses springs,87\r\nIn generous vengeance of the king of kings.\r\nWith indignation sparkling in his eyes,\r\nHe views the wretch, and sternly thus replies:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, factious monster, born to vex the state,\r\nWith wrangling talents form\xe2\x80\x99d for foul debate:\r\nCurb that impetuous tongue, nor rashly vain,\r\nAnd singly mad, asperse the sovereign reign.\r\nHave we not known thee, slave! of all our host,\r\nThe man who acts the least, upbraids the most?\r\nThink not the Greeks to shameful flight to bring,\r\nNor let those lips profane the name of king.\r\nFor our return we trust the heavenly powers;\r\nBe that their care; to fight like men be ours.\r\nBut grant the host with wealth the general load,\r\nExcept detraction, what hast thou bestow\xe2\x80\x99d?\r\nSuppose some hero should his spoils resign,\r\nArt thou that hero, could those spoils be thine?\r\nGods! let me perish on this hateful shore,\r\nAnd let these eyes behold my son no more;\r\nIf, on thy next offence, this hand forbear\r\nTo strip those arms thou ill deserv\xe2\x80\x99st to wear,\r\nExpel the council where our princes meet,\r\nAnd send thee scourged and howling through the fleet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said, and cowering as the dastard bends,\r\nThe weighty sceptre on his back descends.88\r\nOn the round bunch the bloody tumours rise:\r\nThe tears spring starting from his haggard eyes;\r\nTrembling he sat, and shrunk in abject fears,\r\nFrom his vile visage wiped the scalding tears;\r\nWhile to his neighbour each express\xe2\x80\x99d his thought:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe gods! what wonders has Ulysses wrought!\r\nWhat fruits his conduct and his courage yield!\r\nGreat in the council, glorious in the field.\r\nGenerous he rises in the crown\xe2\x80\x99s defence,\r\nTo curb the factious tongue of insolence,\r\nSuch just examples on offenders shown,\r\nSedition silence, and assert the throne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas thus the general voice the hero praised,\r\nWho, rising, high the imperial sceptre raised:\r\nThe blue-eyed Pallas, his celestial friend,\r\n(In form a herald,) bade the crowds attend.\r\nThe expecting crowds in still attention hung,\r\nTo hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue.\r\nThen deeply thoughtful, pausing ere he spoke,\r\nHis silence thus the prudent hero broke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy monarch! whom the Grecian race\r\nWith shame deserting, heap with vile disgrace.\r\nNot such at Argos was their generous vow:\r\nOnce all their voice, but ah! forgotten now:\r\nNe\xe2\x80\x99er to return, was then the common cry,\r\nTill Troy\xe2\x80\x99s proud structures should in ashes lie.\r\nBehold them weeping for their native shore;\r\nWhat could their wives or helpless children more?\r\nWhat heart but melts to leave the tender train,\r\nAnd, one short month, endure the wintry main?\r\nFew leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat,\r\nWhen the ship tosses, and the tempests beat:\r\nThen well may this long stay provoke their tears,\r\nThe tedious length of nine revolving years.\r\nNot for their grief the Grecian host I blame;\r\nBut vanquish\xe2\x80\x99d! baffled! oh, eternal shame!\r\nExpect the time to Troy\xe2\x80\x99s destruction given.\r\nAnd try the faith of Chalcas and of heaven.\r\nWhat pass\xe2\x80\x99d at Aulis, Greece can witness bear,89\r\nAnd all who live to breathe this Phrygian air.\r\nBeside a fountain\xe2\x80\x99s sacred brink we raised\r\nOur verdant altars, and the victims blazed:\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas where the plane-tree spread its shades around,\r\nThe altars heaved; and from the crumbling ground\r\nA mighty dragon shot, of dire portent;\r\nFrom Jove himself the dreadful sign was sent.\r\nStraight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd curl\xe2\x80\x99d around in many a winding fold;\r\nThe topmost branch a mother-bird possess\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nEight callow infants fill\xe2\x80\x99d the mossy nest;\r\nHerself the ninth; the serpent, as he hung,\r\nStretch\xe2\x80\x99d his black jaws and crush\xe2\x80\x99d the crying young;\r\nWhile hovering near, with miserable moan,\r\nThe drooping mother wail\xe2\x80\x99d her children gone.\r\nThe mother last, as round the nest she flew,\r\nSeized by the beating wing, the monster slew;\r\nNor long survived: to marble turn\xe2\x80\x99d, he stands\r\nA lasting prodigy on Aulis\xe2\x80\x99 sands.\r\nSuch was the will of Jove; and hence we dare\r\nTrust in his omen, and support the war.\r\nFor while around we gazed with wondering eyes,\r\nAnd trembling sought the powers with sacrifice,\r\nFull of his god, the reverend Chalcas cried,90\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ye Grecian warriors! lay your fears aside.\r\nThis wondrous signal Jove himself displays,\r\nOf long, long labours, but eternal praise.\r\nAs many birds as by the snake were slain,\r\nSo many years the toils of Greece remain;\r\nBut wait the tenth, for Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s fall decreed:\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThus spoke the prophet, thus the Fates succeed.\r\nObey, ye Grecians! with submission wait,\r\nNor let your flight avert the Trojan fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe said: the shores with loud applauses sound,\r\nThe hollow ships each deafening shout rebound.\r\nThen Nestor thus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThese vain debates forbear,\r\nYe talk like children, not like heroes dare.\r\nWhere now are all your high resolves at last?\r\nYour leagues concluded, your engagements past?\r\nVow\xe2\x80\x99d with libations and with victims then,\r\nNow vanish\xe2\x80\x99d like their smoke: the faith of men!\r\nWhile useless words consume the unactive hours,\r\nNo wonder Troy so long resists our powers.\r\nRise, great Atrides! and with courage sway;\r\nWe march to war, if thou direct the way.\r\nBut leave the few that dare resist thy laws,\r\nThe mean deserters of the Grecian cause,\r\nTo grudge the conquests mighty Jove prepares,\r\nAnd view with envy our successful wars.\r\nOn that great day, when first the martial train,\r\nBig with the fate of Ilion, plough\xe2\x80\x99d the main,\r\nJove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent,\r\nAnd thunder rolling shook the firmament.\r\nEncouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife,\r\nTill every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife,\r\nTill Helen\xe2\x80\x99s woes at full revenged appear,\r\nAnd Troy\xe2\x80\x99s proud matrons render tear for tear.\r\nBefore that day, if any Greek invite\r\nHis country\xe2\x80\x99s troops to base, inglorious flight,\r\nStand forth that Greek! and hoist his sail to fly,\r\nAnd die the dastard first, who dreads to die.\r\nBut now, O monarch! all thy chiefs advise:91\r\nNor what they offer, thou thyself despise.\r\nAmong those counsels, let not mine be vain;\r\nIn tribes and nations to divide thy train:\r\nHis separate troops let every leader call,\r\nEach strengthen each, and all encourage all.\r\nWhat chief, or soldier, of the numerous band,\r\nOr bravely fights, or ill obeys command,\r\nWhen thus distinct they war, shall soon be known\r\nAnd what the cause of Ilion not o\xe2\x80\x99erthrown;\r\nIf fate resists, or if our arms are slow,\r\nIf gods above prevent, or men below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo him the king: \xe2\x80\x9cHow much thy years excel\r\nIn arts of counsel, and in speaking well!\r\nO would the gods, in love to Greece, decree\r\nBut ten such sages as they grant in thee;\r\nSuch wisdom soon should Priam\xe2\x80\x99s force destroy,\r\nAnd soon should fall the haughty towers of Troy!\r\nBut Jove forbids, who plunges those he hates\r\nIn fierce contention and in vain debates:\r\nNow great Achilles from our aid withdraws,\r\nBy me provoked; a captive maid the cause:\r\nIf e\xe2\x80\x99er as friends we join, the Trojan wall\r\nMust shake, and heavy will the vengeance fall!\r\nBut now, ye warriors, take a short repast;\r\nAnd, well refresh\xe2\x80\x99d, to bloody conflict haste.\r\nHis sharpen\xe2\x80\x99d spear let every Grecian wield,\r\nAnd every Grecian fix his brazen shield,\r\nLet all excite the fiery steeds of war,\r\nAnd all for combat fit the rattling car.\r\nThis day, this dreadful day, let each contend;\r\nNo rest, no respite, till the shades descend;\r\nTill darkness, or till death, shall cover all:\r\nLet the war bleed, and let the mighty fall;\r\nTill bathed in sweat be every manly breast,\r\nWith the huge shield each brawny arm depress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nEach aching nerve refuse the lance to throw,\r\nAnd each spent courser at the chariot blow.\r\nWho dares, inglorious, in his ships to stay,\r\nWho dares to tremble on this signal day;\r\nThat wretch, too mean to fall by martial power,\r\nThe birds shall mangle, and the dogs devour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe monarch spoke; and straight a murmur rose,\r\nLoud as the surges when the tempest blows,\r\nThat dash\xe2\x80\x99d on broken rocks tumultuous roar,\r\nAnd foam and thunder on the stony shore.\r\nStraight to the tents the troops dispersing bend,\r\nThe fires are kindled, and the smokes ascend;\r\nWith hasty feasts they sacrifice, and pray,\r\nTo avert the dangers of the doubtful day.\r\nA steer of five years\xe2\x80\x99 age, large limb\xe2\x80\x99d, and fed,92\r\nTo Jove\xe2\x80\x99s high altars Agamemnon led:\r\nThere bade the noblest of the Grecian peers;\r\nAnd Nestor first, as most advanced in years.\r\nNext came Idomeneus, and Tydeus\xe2\x80\x99 son,93\r\nAjax the less, and Ajax Telamon;95\r\nThen wise Ulysses in his rank was placed;\r\nAnd Menelaus came, unbid, the last.96\r\nThe chiefs surround the destined beast, and take\r\nThe sacred offering of the salted cake:\r\nWhen thus the king prefers his solemn prayer;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO thou! whose thunder rends the clouded air,\r\nWho in the heaven of heavens hast fixed thy throne,\r\nSupreme of gods! unbounded, and alone!\r\nHear! and before the burning sun descends,\r\nBefore the night her gloomy veil extends,\r\nLow in the dust be laid yon hostile spires,\r\nBe Priam\xe2\x80\x99s palace sunk in Grecian fires.\r\nIn Hector\xe2\x80\x99s breast be plunged this shining sword,\r\nAnd slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d heroes groan around their lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus prayed the chief: his unavailing prayer\r\nGreat Jove refused, and toss\xe2\x80\x99d in empty air:\r\nThe God averse, while yet the fumes arose,\r\nPrepared new toils, and doubled woes on woes.\r\nTheir prayers perform\xe2\x80\x99d the chiefs the rite pursue,\r\nThe barley sprinkled, and the victim slew.\r\nThe limbs they sever from the inclosing hide,\r\nThe thighs, selected to the gods, divide.\r\nOn these, in double cauls involved with art,\r\nThe choicest morsels lie from every part,\r\nFrom the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire\r\nWhile the fat victims feed the sacred fire.\r\nThe thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest;\r\nThen spread the tables, the repast prepare,\r\nEach takes his seat, and each receives his share.\r\nSoon as the rage of hunger was suppress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe generous Nestor thus the prince address\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow bid thy heralds sound the loud alarms,\r\nAnd call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arms;\r\nNow seize the occasion, now the troops survey,\r\nAnd lead to war when heaven directs the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said; the monarch issued his commands;\r\nStraight the loud heralds call the gathering bands;\r\nThe chiefs inclose their king; the hosts divide,\r\nIn tribes and nations rank\xe2\x80\x99d on either side.\r\nHigh in the midst the blue-eyed virgin flies;\r\nFrom rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes;\r\nThe dreadful aegis, Jove\xe2\x80\x99s immortal shield,\r\nBlazed on her arm, and lighten\xe2\x80\x99d all the field:\r\nRound the vast orb a hundred serpents roll\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nForm\xe2\x80\x99d the bright fringe, and seem\xe2\x80\x99d to burn in gold,\r\nWith this each Grecian\xe2\x80\x99s manly breast she warms,\r\nSwells their bold hearts, and strings their nervous arms,\r\nNo more they sigh, inglorious, to return,\r\nBut breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.\r\n\r\nAs on some mountain, through the lofty grove,\r\nThe crackling flames ascend, and blaze above;\r\nThe fires expanding, as the winds arise,\r\nShoot their long beams, and kindle half the skies:\r\nSo from the polish\xe2\x80\x99d arms, and brazen shields,\r\nA gleamy splendour flash\xe2\x80\x99d along the fields.\r\nNot less their number than the embodied cranes,\r\nOr milk-white swans in Asius\xe2\x80\x99 watery plains.\r\nThat, o\xe2\x80\x99er the windings of Cayster\xe2\x80\x99s springs,97\r\nStretch their long necks, and clap their rustling wings,\r\nNow tower aloft, and course in airy rounds,\r\nNow light with noise; with noise the field resounds.\r\nThus numerous and confused, extending wide,\r\nThe legions crowd Scamander\xe2\x80\x99s flowery side;98\r\nWith rushing troops the plains are cover\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er,\r\nAnd thundering footsteps shake the sounding shore.\r\nAlong the river\xe2\x80\x99s level meads they stand,\r\nThick as in spring the flowers adorn the land,\r\nOr leaves the trees; or thick as insects play,\r\nThe wandering nation of a summer\xe2\x80\x99s day:\r\nThat, drawn by milky steams, at evening hours,\r\nIn gather\xe2\x80\x99d swarms surround the rural bowers;\r\nFrom pail to pail with busy murmur run\r\nThe gilded legions, glittering in the sun.\r\nSo throng\xe2\x80\x99d, so close, the Grecian squadrons stood\r\nIn radiant arms, and thirst for Trojan blood.\r\nEach leader now his scatter\xe2\x80\x99d force conjoins\r\nIn close array, and forms the deepening lines.\r\nNot with more ease the skilful shepherd-swain\r\nCollects his flocks from thousands on the plain.\r\nThe king of kings, majestically tall,\r\nTowers o\xe2\x80\x99er his armies, and outshines them all;\r\nLike some proud bull, that round the pastures leads\r\nHis subject herds, the monarch of the meads,\r\nGreat as the gods, the exalted chief was seen,\r\nHis strength like Neptune, and like Mars his mien;99\r\nJove o\xe2\x80\x99er his eyes celestial glories spread,\r\nAnd dawning conquest played around his head.\r\n\r\nSay, virgins, seated round the throne divine,\r\nAll-knowing goddesses!

Iris is sent to call Helen to behold the\r\nfight. She leads her to the walls of Troy, where Priam sat with his\r\ncounsellers observing the Grecian leaders on the plain below, to whom\r\nHelen gives an account of the chief of them. The kings on either part\r\ntake the solemn oath for the conditions of the combat. The duel ensues;\r\nwherein Paris being overcome, he is snatched away in a cloud by Venus,\r\nand transported to his apartment. She then calls Helen from the walls,\r\nand brings the lovers together. Agamemnon, on the part of the Grecians,\r\ndemands the restoration of Helen, and the performance of the articles.\r\n\r\nThe three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book. The\r\nscene is sometimes in the fields before Troy, and sometimes in Troy\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThus by their leaders\xe2\x80\x99 care each martial band\r\nMoves into ranks, and stretches o\xe2\x80\x99er the land.\r\nWith shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar,\r\nProclaim their motions, and provoke the war.\r\nSo when inclement winters vex the plain\r\nWith piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,\r\nTo warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,108\r\nWith noise, and order, through the midway sky;\r\nTo pigmy nations wounds and death they bring,\r\nAnd all the war descends upon the wing,\r\nBut silent, breathing rage, resolved and skill\xe2\x80\x99d109\r\nBy mutual aids to fix a doubtful field,\r\nSwift march the Greeks: the rapid dust around\r\nDarkening arises from the labour\xe2\x80\x99d ground.\r\nThus from his flaggy wings when Notus sheds\r\nA night of vapours round the mountain heads,\r\nSwift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade,\r\nTo thieves more grateful than the midnight shade;\r\nWhile scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey,\r\nLost and confused amidst the thicken\xe2\x80\x99d day:\r\nSo wrapp\xe2\x80\x99d in gathering dust, the Grecian train,\r\nA moving cloud, swept on, and hid the plain.\r\n\r\nNow front to front the hostile armies stand,\r\nEager of fight, and only wait command;\r\nWhen, to the van, before the sons of fame\r\nWhom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came:\r\nIn form a god! the panther\xe2\x80\x99s speckled hide\r\nFlow\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er his armour with an easy pride:\r\nHis bended bow across his shoulders flung,\r\nHis sword beside him negligently hung;\r\nTwo pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,\r\nAnd dared the bravest of the Grecian race.\r\n\r\nAs thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,\r\nHe boldly stalk\xe2\x80\x99d, the foremost on the plain,\r\nHim Menelaus, loved of Mars, espies,\r\nWith heart elated, and with joyful eyes:\r\nSo joys a lion, if the branching deer,\r\nOr mountain goat, his bulky prize, appear;\r\nEager he seizes and devours the slain,\r\nPress\xe2\x80\x99d by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.\r\nThus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,\r\nIn clanging arms he leaps upon the ground\r\nFrom his high chariot: him, approaching near,\r\nThe beauteous champion views with marks of fear,\r\nSmit with a conscious sense, retires behind,\r\nAnd shuns the fate he well deserved to find.\r\nAs when some shepherd, from the rustling trees110\r\nShot forth to view, a scaly serpent sees,\r\nTrembling and pale, he starts with wild affright\r\nAnd all confused precipitates his flight:\r\nSo from the king the shining warrior flies,\r\nAnd plunged amid the thickest Trojans lies.\r\n\r\nAs godlike Hector sees the prince retreat,\r\nHe thus upbraids him with a generous heat:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy Paris! but to women brave!111\r\nSo fairly form\xe2\x80\x99d, and only to deceive!\r\nOh, hadst thou died when first thou saw\xe2\x80\x99st the light,\r\nOr died at least before thy nuptial rite!\r\nA better fate than vainly thus to boast,\r\nAnd fly, the scandal of thy Trojan host.\r\nGods! how the scornful Greeks exult to see\r\nTheir fears of danger undeceived in thee!\r\nThy figure promised with a martial air,\r\nBut ill thy soul supplies a form so fair.\r\nIn former days, in all thy gallant pride,\r\nWhen thy tall ships triumphant stemm\xe2\x80\x99d the tide,\r\nWhen Greece beheld thy painted canvas flow,\r\nAnd crowds stood wondering at the passing show,\r\nSay, was it thus, with such a baffled mien,\r\nYou met the approaches of the Spartan queen,\r\nThus from her realm convey\xe2\x80\x99d the beauteous prize,\r\nAnd both her warlike lords outshined in Helen\xe2\x80\x99s eyes?\r\nThis deed, thy foes\xe2\x80\x99 delight, thy own disgrace,\r\nThy father\xe2\x80\x99s grief, and ruin of thy race;\r\nThis deed recalls thee to the proffer\xe2\x80\x99d fight;\r\nOr hast thou injured whom thou dar\xe2\x80\x99st not right?\r\nSoon to thy cost the field would make thee know\r\nThou keep\xe2\x80\x99st the consort of a braver foe.\r\nThy graceful form instilling soft desire,\r\nThy curling tresses, and thy silver lyre,\r\nBeauty and youth; in vain to these you trust,\r\nWhen youth and beauty shall be laid in dust:\r\nTroy yet may wake, and one avenging blow\r\nCrush the dire author of his country\xe2\x80\x99s woe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis silence here, with blushes, Paris breaks:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis just, my brother, what your anger speaks:\r\nBut who like thee can boast a soul sedate,\r\nSo firmly proof to all the shocks of fate?\r\nThy force, like steel, a temper\xe2\x80\x99d hardness shows,\r\nStill edged to wound, and still untired with blows,\r\nLike steel, uplifted by some strenuous swain,\r\nWith falling woods to strew the wasted plain.\r\nThy gifts I praise; nor thou despise the charms\r\nWith which a lover golden Venus arms;\r\nSoft moving speech, and pleasing outward show,\r\nNo wish can gain them, but the gods bestow.\r\nYet, would\xe2\x80\x99st thou have the proffer\xe2\x80\x99d combat stand,\r\nThe Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand;\r\nThen let a midway space our hosts divide,\r\nAnd, on that stage of war, the cause be tried:\r\nBy Paris there the Spartan king be fought,\r\nFor beauteous Helen and the wealth she brought;\r\nAnd who his rival can in arms subdue,\r\nHis be the fair, and his the treasure too.\r\nThus with a lasting league your toils may cease,\r\nAnd Troy possess her fertile fields in peace;\r\nThus may the Greeks review their native shore,\r\nMuch famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said. The challenge Hector heard with joy,\r\nThen with his spear restrain\xe2\x80\x99d the youth of Troy,\r\nHeld by the midst, athwart; and near the foe\r\nAdvanced with steps majestically slow:\r\nWhile round his dauntless head the Grecians pour\r\nTheir stones and arrows in a mingled shower.\r\n\r\nThen thus the monarch, great Atrides, cried:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForbear, ye warriors! lay the darts aside:\r\nA parley Hector asks, a message bears;\r\nWe know him by the various plume he wears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAwed by his high command the Greeks attend,\r\nThe tumult silence, and the fight suspend.\r\n\r\nWhile from the centre Hector rolls his eyes\r\nOn either host, and thus to both applies:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,\r\nWhat Paris, author of the war, demands.\r\nYour shining swords within the sheath restrain,\r\nAnd pitch your lances in the yielding plain.\r\nHere in the midst, in either army\xe2\x80\x99s sight,\r\nHe dares the Spartan king to single fight;\r\nAnd wills that Helen and the ravish\xe2\x80\x99d spoil,\r\nThat caused the contest, shall reward the toil.\r\nLet these the brave triumphant victor grace,\r\nAnd different nations part in leagues of peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke: in still suspense on either side\r\nEach army stood: the Spartan chief replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right\r\nA world engages in the toils of fight.\r\nTo me the labour of the field resign;\r\nMe Paris injured; all the war be mine.\r\nFall he that must, beneath his rival\xe2\x80\x99s arms;\r\nAnd live the rest, secure of future harms.\r\nTwo lambs, devoted by your country\xe2\x80\x99s rite,\r\nTo earth a sable, to the sun a white,\r\nPrepare, ye Trojans! while a third we bring\r\nSelect to Jove, the inviolable king.\r\nLet reverend Priam in the truce engage,\r\nAnd add the sanction of considerate age;\r\nHis sons are faithless, headlong in debate,\r\nAnd youth itself an empty wavering state;\r\nCool age advances, venerably wise,\r\nTurns on all hands its deep-discerning eyes;\r\nSees what befell, and what may yet befall,\r\nConcludes from both, and best provides for all.\r\n\r\nThe nations hear with rising hopes possess\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd peaceful prospects dawn in every breast.\r\nWithin the lines they drew their steeds around,\r\nAnd from their chariots issued on the ground;\r\nNext, all unbuckling the rich mail they wore,\r\nLaid their bright arms along the sable shore.\r\nOn either side the meeting hosts are seen\r\nWith lances fix\xe2\x80\x99d, and close the space between.\r\nTwo heralds now, despatch\xe2\x80\x99d to Troy, invite\r\nThe Phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite.\r\n\r\nTalthybius hastens to the fleet, to bring\r\nThe lamb for Jove, the inviolable king.\r\n\r\nMeantime to beauteous Helen, from the skies\r\nThe various goddess of the rainbow flies:\r\n(Like fair Laodice in form and face,\r\nThe loveliest nymph of Priam\xe2\x80\x99s royal race:)\r\nHer in the palace, at her loom she found;\r\nThe golden web her own sad story crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe Trojan wars she weaved (herself the prize)\r\nAnd the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes.\r\nTo whom the goddess of the painted bow:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApproach, and view the wondrous scene below!112\r\nEach hardy Greek, and valiant Trojan knight,\r\nSo dreadful late, and furious for the fight,\r\nNow rest their spears, or lean upon their shields;\r\nCeased is the war, and silent all the fields.\r\nParis alone and Sparta\xe2\x80\x99s king advance,\r\nIn single fight to toss the beamy lance;\r\nEach met in arms, the fate of combat tries,\r\nThy love the motive, and thy charms the prize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis said, the many-coloured maid inspires\r\nHer husband\xe2\x80\x99s love, and wakes her former fires;\r\nHer country, parents, all that once were dear,\r\nRush to her thought, and force a tender tear,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er her fair face a snowy veil she threw,\r\nAnd, softly sighing, from the loom withdrew.\r\nHer handmaids, Clymene and \xc3\x86thra, wait\r\nHer silent footsteps to the Scaean gate.\r\n\r\nThere sat the seniors of the Trojan race:\r\n(Old Priam\xe2\x80\x99s chiefs, and most in Priam\xe2\x80\x99s grace,)\r\nThe king the first; Thymoetes at his side;\r\nLampus and Clytius, long in council tried;\r\nPanthus, and Hicetaon, once the strong;\r\nAnd next, the wisest of the reverend throng,\r\nAntenor grave, and sage Ucalegon,\r\nLean\xe2\x80\x99d on the walls and bask\xe2\x80\x99d before the sun:\r\nChiefs, who no more in bloody fights engage,\r\nBut wise through time, and narrative with age,\r\nIn summer days, like grasshoppers rejoice,\r\nA bloodless race, that send a feeble voice.\r\nThese, when the Spartan queen approach\xe2\x80\x99d the tower,\r\nIn secret own\xe2\x80\x99d resistless beauty\xe2\x80\x99s power:\r\nThey cried, \xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder such celestial charms113\r\nFor nine long years have set the world in arms;\r\nWhat winning graces! what majestic mien!\r\nShe moves a goddess, and she looks a queen!\r\nYet hence, O Heaven, convey that fatal face,\r\nAnd from destruction save the Trojan race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe good old Priam welcomed her, and cried,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApproach, my child, and grace thy father\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\nSee on the plain thy Grecian spouse appears,\r\nThe friends and kindred of thy former years.\r\nNo crime of thine our present sufferings draws,\r\nNot thou, but Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s disposing will, the cause\r\nThe gods these armies and this force employ,\r\nThe hostile gods conspire the fate of Troy.\r\nBut lift thy eyes, and say, what Greek is he\r\n(Far as from hence these aged orbs can see)\r\nAround whose brow such martial graces shine,\r\nSo tall, so awful, and almost divine!\r\nThough some of larger stature tread the green,\r\nNone match his grandeur and exalted mien:\r\nHe seems a monarch, and his country\xe2\x80\x99s pride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThus ceased the king, and thus the fair replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore thy presence, father, I appear,\r\nWith conscious shame and reverential fear.\r\nAh! had I died, ere to these walls I fled,\r\nFalse to my country, and my nuptial bed;\r\nMy brothers, friends, and daughter left behind,\r\nFalse to them all, to Paris only kind!\r\nFor this I mourn, till grief or dire disease\r\nShall waste the form whose fault it was to please!\r\nThe king of kings, Atrides, you survey,\r\nGreat in the war, and great in arts of sway:\r\nMy brother once, before my days of shame!\r\nAnd oh! that still he bore a brother\xe2\x80\x99s name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith wonder Priam view\xe2\x80\x99d the godlike man,\r\nExtoll\xe2\x80\x99d the happy prince, and thus began:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO bless\xe2\x80\x99d Atrides! born to prosperous fate,\r\nSuccessful monarch of a mighty state!\r\nHow vast thy empire! Of your matchless train\r\nWhat numbers lost, what numbers yet remain!\r\nIn Phrygia once were gallant armies known,\r\nIn ancient time, when Otreus fill\xe2\x80\x99d the throne,\r\nWhen godlike Mygdon led their troops of horse,\r\nAnd I, to join them, raised the Trojan force:\r\nAgainst the manlike Amazons we stood,114\r\nAnd Sangar\xe2\x80\x99s stream ran purple with their blood.\r\nBut far inferior those, in martial grace,\r\nAnd strength of numbers, to this Grecian race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis said, once more he view\xe2\x80\x99d the warrior train;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he, whose arms lie scatter\xe2\x80\x99d on the plain?\r\nBroad is his breast, his shoulders larger spread,\r\nThough great Atrides overtops his head.\r\nNor yet appear his care and conduct small;\r\nFrom rank to rank he moves, and orders all.\r\nThe stately ram thus measures o\xe2\x80\x99er the ground,\r\nAnd, master of the flock, surveys them round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Helen thus: \xe2\x80\x9cWhom your discerning eyes\r\nHave singled out, is Ithacus the wise;\r\nA barren island boasts his glorious birth;\r\nHis fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAntenor took the word, and thus began:115\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMyself, O king! have seen that wondrous man\r\nWhen, trusting Jove and hospitable laws,\r\nTo Troy he came, to plead the Grecian cause;\r\n(Great Menelaus urged the same request;)\r\nMy house was honour\xe2\x80\x99d with each royal guest:\r\nI knew their persons, and admired their parts,\r\nBoth brave in arms, and both approved in arts.\r\nErect, the Spartan most engaged our view;\r\nUlysses seated, greater reverence drew.\r\nWhen Atreus\xe2\x80\x99 son harangued the listening train,\r\nJust was his sense, and his expression plain,\r\nHis words succinct, yet full, without a fault;\r\nHe spoke no more than just the thing he ought.\r\nBut when Ulysses rose, in thought profound,116\r\nHis modest eyes he fix\xe2\x80\x99d upon the ground;\r\nAs one unskill\xe2\x80\x99d or dumb, he seem\xe2\x80\x99d to stand,\r\nNor raised his head, nor stretch\xe2\x80\x99d his sceptred hand;\r\nBut, when he speaks, what elocution flows!\r\nSoft as the fleeces of descending snows,117\r\nThe copious accents fall, with easy art;\r\nMelting they fall, and sink into the heart!\r\nWondering we hear, and fix\xe2\x80\x99d in deep surprise,\r\nOur ears refute the censure of our eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king then ask\xe2\x80\x99d (as yet the camp he view\xe2\x80\x99d)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat chief is that, with giant strength endued,\r\nWhose brawny shoulders, and whose swelling chest,\r\nAnd lofty stature, far exceed the rest?\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAjax the great, (the beauteous queen replied,)\r\nHimself a host: the Grecian strength and pride.\r\nSee! bold Idomeneus superior towers\r\nAmid yon circle of his Cretan powers,\r\nGreat as a god! I saw him once before,\r\nWith Menelaus on the Spartan shore.\r\nThe rest I know, and could in order name;\r\nAll valiant chiefs, and men of mighty fame.\r\nYet two are wanting of the numerous train,\r\nWhom long my eyes have sought, but sought in vain:\r\nCastor and Pollux, first in martial force,\r\nOne bold on foot, and one renown\xe2\x80\x99d for horse.\r\nMy brothers these; the same our native shore,\r\nOne house contain\xe2\x80\x99d us, as one mother bore.\r\nPerhaps the chiefs, from warlike toils at ease,\r\nFor distant Troy refused to sail the seas;\r\nPerhaps their swords some nobler quarrel draws,\r\nAshamed to combat in their sister\xe2\x80\x99s cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spoke the fair, nor knew her brothers\xe2\x80\x99 doom;118\r\nWrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb;\r\nAdorn\xe2\x80\x99d with honours in their native shore,\r\nSilent they slept, and heard of wars no more.\r\n\r\nMeantime the heralds, through the crowded town,\r\nBring the rich wine and destined victims down.\r\nIdaeus\xe2\x80\x99 arms the golden goblets press\xe2\x80\x99d,119\r\nWho thus the venerable king address\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArise, O father of the Trojan state!\r\nThe nations call, thy joyful people wait\r\nTo seal the truce, and end the dire debate.\r\nParis, thy son, and Sparta\xe2\x80\x99s king advance,\r\nIn measured lists to toss the weighty lance;\r\nAnd who his rival shall in arms subdue,\r\nHis be the dame, and his the treasure too.\r\nThus with a lasting league our toils may cease,\r\nAnd Troy possess her fertile fields in peace:\r\nSo shall the Greeks review their native shore,\r\nMuch famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith grief he heard, and bade the chiefs prepare\r\nTo join his milk-white coursers to the car;\r\nHe mounts the seat, Antenor at his side;\r\nThe gentle steeds through Scaea\xe2\x80\x99s gates they guide:120\r\nNext from the car descending on the plain,\r\nAmid the Grecian host and Trojan train,\r\nSlow they proceed: the sage Ulysses then\r\nArose, and with him rose the king of men.\r\nOn either side a sacred herald stands,\r\nThe wine they mix, and on each monarch\xe2\x80\x99s hands\r\nPour the full urn; then draws the Grecian lord\r\nHis cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword;\r\nFrom the sign\xe2\x80\x99d victims crops the curling hair;121\r\nThe heralds part it, and the princes share;\r\nThen loudly thus before the attentive bands\r\nHe calls the gods, and spreads his lifted hands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO first and greatest power! whom all obey,\r\nWho high on Ida\xe2\x80\x99s holy mountain sway,\r\nEternal Jove! and you bright orb that roll\r\nFrom east to west, and view from pole to pole!\r\nThou mother Earth! and all ye living floods!\r\nInfernal furies, and Tartarean gods,\r\nWho rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare\r\nFor perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!\r\nHear, and be witness. If, by Paris slain,\r\nGreat Menelaus press the fatal plain;\r\nThe dame and treasures let the Trojan keep,\r\nAnd Greece returning plough the watery deep.\r\nIf by my brother\xe2\x80\x99s lance the Trojan bleed,\r\nBe his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed:\r\nThe appointed fine let Ilion justly pay,\r\nAnd every age record the signal day.\r\nThis if the Phrygians shall refuse to yield,\r\nArms must revenge, and Mars decide the field.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that the chief the tender victims slew,\r\nAnd in the dust their bleeding bodies threw;\r\nThe vital spirit issued at the wound,\r\nAnd left the members quivering on the ground.\r\nFrom the same urn they drink the mingled wine,\r\nAnd add libations to the powers divine.\r\nWhile thus their prayers united mount the sky,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, mighty Jove!

She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus, who is\r\nwounded, but cured by Machaon. In the meantime some of the Trojan\r\ntroops attack the Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts\r\nof a good general; he reviews the troops, and exhorts the leaders, some\r\nby praises and others by reproof. Nestor is particularly celebrated for\r\nhis military discipline. The battle joins, and great numbers are slain\r\non both sides.\r\n\r\nThe same day continues through this as through the last book (as it\r\ndoes also through the two following, and almost to the end of the\r\nseventh book). The scene is wholly in the field before Troy.\r\n\r\nAnd now Olympus\xe2\x80\x99 shining gates unfold;\r\nThe gods, with Jove, assume their thrones of gold:\r\nImmortal Hebe, fresh with bloom divine,\r\nThe golden goblet crowns with purple wine:\r\nWhile the full bowls flow round, the powers employ\r\nTheir careful eyes on long-contended Troy.\r\n\r\nWhen Jove, disposed to tempt Saturnia\xe2\x80\x99s spleen,\r\nThus waked the fury of his partial queen,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo powers divine the son of Atreus aid,\r\nImperial Juno, and the martial maid;125\r\nBut high in heaven they sit, and gaze from far,\r\nThe tame spectators of his deeds of war.\r\nNot thus fair Venus helps her favour\xe2\x80\x99d knight,\r\nThe queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight,\r\nEach danger wards, and constant in her care,\r\nSaves in the moment of the last despair.\r\nHer act has rescued Paris\xe2\x80\x99 forfeit life,\r\nThough great Atrides gain\xe2\x80\x99d the glorious strife.\r\nThen say, ye powers! what signal issue waits\r\nTo crown this deed, and finish all the fates!\r\nShall Heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare,\r\nOr rouse the furies, and awake the war?\r\nYet, would the gods for human good provide,\r\nAtrides soon might gain his beauteous bride,\r\nStill Priam\xe2\x80\x99s walls in peaceful honours grow,\r\nAnd through his gates the crowding nations flow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enraged,\r\nAnd queen of war, in close consult engaged:\r\nApart they sit, their deep designs employ,\r\nAnd meditate the future woes of Troy.\r\nThough secret anger swell\xe2\x80\x99d Minerva\xe2\x80\x99s breast,\r\nThe prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nBut Juno, impotent of passion, broke\r\nHer sullen silence, and with fury spoke:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COUNCIL OF THE GODS.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall then, O tyrant of the ethereal reign!\r\nMy schemes, my labours, and my hopes be vain?\r\nHave I, for this, shook Ilion with alarms,\r\nAssembled nations, set two worlds in arms?\r\nTo spread the war, I flew from shore to shore;\r\nThe immortal coursers scarce the labour bore.\r\nAt length ripe vengeance o\xe2\x80\x99er their heads impends,\r\nBut Jove himself the faithless race defends.\r\nLoth as thou art to punish lawless lust,\r\nNot all the gods are partial and unjust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy skies,\r\nSighs from his inmost soul, and thus replies:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh lasting rancour! oh insatiate hate\r\nTo Phrygia\xe2\x80\x99s monarch, and the Phrygian state!\r\nWhat high offence has fired the wife of Jove?\r\nCan wretched mortals harm the powers above,\r\nThat Troy, and Troy\xe2\x80\x99s whole race thou wouldst confound,\r\nAnd yon fair structures level with the ground!\r\nHaste, leave the skies, fulfil thy stern desire,\r\nBurst all her gates, and wrap her walls in fire!\r\nLet Priam bleed! if yet you thirst for more,\r\nBleed all his sons, and Ilion float with gore:\r\nTo boundless vengeance the wide realm be given,\r\nTill vast destruction glut the queen of heaven!\r\nSo let it be, and Jove his peace enjoy,126\r\nWhen heaven no longer hears the name of Troy.\r\nBut should this arm prepare to wreak our hate\r\nOn thy loved realms, whose guilt demands their fate;\r\nPresume not thou the lifted bolt to stay,\r\nRemember Troy, and give the vengeance way.\r\nFor know, of all the numerous towns that rise\r\nBeneath the rolling sun and starry skies,\r\nWhich gods have raised, or earth-born men enjoy,\r\nNone stands so dear to Jove as sacred Troy.\r\nNo mortals merit more distinguish\xe2\x80\x99d grace\r\nThan godlike Priam, or than Priam\xe2\x80\x99s race.\r\nStill to our name their hecatombs expire,\r\nAnd altars blaze with unextinguish\xe2\x80\x99d fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes,\r\nThen on the Thunderer fix\xe2\x80\x99d them, and replies:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree towns are Juno\xe2\x80\x99s on the Grecian plains,\r\nMore dear than all the extended earth contains,\r\nMycenae, Argos, and the Spartan wall;127\r\n\r\nThese thou mayst raze, nor I forbid their fall:\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis not in me the vengeance to remove;\r\nThe crime\xe2\x80\x99s sufficient that they share my love.\r\nOf power superior why should I complain?\r\nResent I may, but must resent in vain.\r\nYet some distinction Juno might require,\r\nSprung with thyself from one celestial sire,\r\nA goddess born, to share the realms above,\r\nAnd styled the consort of the thundering Jove;\r\nNor thou a wife and sister\xe2\x80\x99s right deny;128\r\nLet both consent, and both by terms comply;\r\nSo shall the gods our joint decrees obey,\r\nAnd heaven shall act as we direct the way.\r\nSee ready Pallas waits thy high commands\r\nTo raise in arms the Greek and Phrygian bands;\r\nTheir sudden friendship by her arts may cease,\r\nAnd the proud Trojans first infringe the peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sire of men and monarch of the sky\r\nThe advice approved, and bade Minerva fly,\r\nDissolve the league, and all her arts employ\r\nTo make the breach the faithless act of Troy.\r\nFired with the charge, she headlong urged her flight,\r\nAnd shot like lightning from Olympus\xe2\x80\x99 height.\r\nAs the red comet, from Saturnius sent\r\nTo fright the nations with a dire portent,\r\n(A fatal sign to armies on the plain,\r\nOr trembling sailors on the wintry main,)\r\nWith sweeping glories glides along in air,\r\nAnd shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair:129\r\nBetween both armies thus, in open sight\r\nShot the bright goddess in a trail of light,\r\nWith eyes erect the gazing hosts admire\r\nThe power descending, and the heavens on fire!\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gods (they cried), the gods this signal sent,\r\nAnd fate now labours with some vast event:\r\nJove seals the league, or bloodier scenes prepares;\r\nJove, the great arbiter of peace and wars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey said, while Pallas through the Trojan throng,\r\n(In shape a mortal,) pass\xe2\x80\x99d disguised along.\r\nLike bold Laodocus, her course she bent,\r\nWho from Antenor traced his high descent.\r\nAmidst the ranks Lycaon\xe2\x80\x99s son she found,\r\nThe warlike Pandarus, for strength renown\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nWhose squadrons, led from black \xc3\x86sepus\xe2\x80\x99 flood,130\r\nWith flaming shields in martial circle stood.\r\nTo him the goddess: \xe2\x80\x9cPhrygian! canst thou hear\r\nA well-timed counsel with a willing ear?\r\nWhat praise were thine, couldst thou direct thy dart,\r\nAmidst his triumph, to the Spartan\xe2\x80\x99s heart?\r\nWhat gifts from Troy, from Paris wouldst thou gain,\r\nThy country\xe2\x80\x99s foe, the Grecian glory slain?\r\nThen seize the occasion, dare the mighty deed,\r\nAim at his breast, and may that aim succeed!\r\nBut first, to speed the shaft, address thy vow\r\nTo Lycian Phoebus with the silver bow,\r\nAnd swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay,\r\nOn Zelia\xe2\x80\x99s altars, to the god of day.\xe2\x80\x9d131\r\n\r\nHe heard, and madly at the motion pleased,\r\nHis polish\xe2\x80\x99d bow with hasty rashness seized.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas form\xe2\x80\x99d of horn, and smooth\xe2\x80\x99d with artful toil:\r\nA mountain goat resign\xe2\x80\x99d the shining spoil.\r\nWho pierced long since beneath his arrows bled;\r\nThe stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead,\r\nAnd sixteen palms his brow\xe2\x80\x99s large honours spread:\r\nThe workmen join\xe2\x80\x99d, and shaped the bended horns,\r\nAnd beaten gold each taper point adorns.\r\nThis, by the Greeks unseen, the warrior bends,\r\nScreen\xe2\x80\x99d by the shields of his surrounding friends:\r\nThere meditates the mark; and couching low,\r\nFits the sharp arrow to the well-strung bow.\r\nOne from a hundred feather\xe2\x80\x99d deaths he chose,\r\nFated to wound, and cause of future woes;\r\nThen offers vows with hecatombs to crown\r\nApollo\xe2\x80\x99s altars in his native town.\r\n\r\nNow with full force the yielding horn he bends,\r\nDrawn to an arch, and joins the doubling ends;\r\nClose to his breast he strains the nerve below,\r\nTill the barb\xe2\x80\x99d points approach the circling bow;\r\nThe impatient weapon whizzes on the wing;\r\nSounds the tough horn, and twangs the quivering string.\r\n\r\nBut thee, Atrides! in that dangerous hour\r\nThe gods forget not, nor thy guardian power,\r\nPallas assists, and (weakened in its force)\r\nDiverts the weapon from its destined course:\r\nSo from her babe, when slumber seals his eye,\r\nThe watchful mother wafts the envenom\xe2\x80\x99d fly.\r\nJust where his belt with golden buckles join\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhere linen folds the double corslet lined,\r\nShe turn\xe2\x80\x99d the shaft, which, hissing from above,\r\nPass\xe2\x80\x99d the broad belt, and through the corslet drove;\r\nThe folds it pierced, the plaited linen tore,\r\nAnd razed the skin, and drew the purple gore.\r\nAs when some stately trappings are decreed\r\nTo grace a monarch on his bounding steed,\r\nA nymph in Caria or Maeonia bred,\r\nStains the pure ivory with a lively red;\r\nWith equal lustre various colours vie,\r\nThe shining whiteness, and the Tyrian dye:\r\nSo great Atrides! show\xe2\x80\x99d thy sacred blood,\r\nAs down thy snowy thigh distill\xe2\x80\x99d the streaming flood.\r\nWith horror seized, the king of men descried\r\nThe shaft infix\xe2\x80\x99d, and saw the gushing tide:\r\nNor less the Spartan fear\xe2\x80\x99d, before he found\r\nThe shining barb appear above the wound,\r\nThen, with a sigh, that heaved his manly breast,\r\nThe royal brother thus his grief express\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd grasp\xe2\x80\x99d his hand; while all the Greeks around\r\nWith answering sighs return\xe2\x80\x99d the plaintive sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear as life!

his clanging arms resound,\r\nAnd his broad buckler rings against the ground.\r\n\r\nSeized with affright the boldest foes appear;\r\nE\xe2\x80\x99en godlike Hector seems himself to fear;\r\nSlow he gave way, the rest tumultuous fled;\r\nThe Greeks with shouts press on, and spoil the dead:\r\nBut Phoebus now from Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s towering height\r\nShines forth reveal\xe2\x80\x99d, and animates the fight.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrojans, be bold, and force with force oppose;\r\nYour foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes!\r\nNor are their bodies rocks, nor ribb\xe2\x80\x99d with steel;\r\nYour weapons enter, and your strokes they feel.\r\nHave ye forgot what seem\xe2\x80\x99d your dread before?\r\nThe great, the fierce Achilles fights no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApollo thus from Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s lofty towers,\r\nArray\xe2\x80\x99d in terrors, roused the Trojan powers:\r\nWhile war\xe2\x80\x99s fierce goddess fires the Grecian foe,\r\nAnd shouts and thunders in the fields below.\r\nThen great Diores fell, by doom divine,\r\nIn vain his valour and illustrious line.\r\nA broken rock the force of Pyrus threw,\r\n(Who from cold \xc3\x86nus led the Thracian crew,)142\r\nFull on his ankle dropp\xe2\x80\x99d the ponderous stone,\r\nBurst the strong nerves, and crash\xe2\x80\x99d the solid bone.\r\nSupine he tumbles on the crimson sands,\r\nBefore his helpless friends, and native bands,\r\nAnd spreads for aid his unavailing hands.\r\nThe foe rush\xe2\x80\x99d furious as he pants for breath,\r\nAnd through his navel drove the pointed death:\r\nHis gushing entrails smoked upon the ground,\r\nAnd the warm life came issuing from the wound.\r\n\r\nHis lance bold Thoas at the conqueror sent,\r\nDeep in his breast above the pap it went,\r\nAmid the lungs was fix\xe2\x80\x99d the winged wood,\r\nAnd quivering in his heaving bosom stood:\r\nTill from the dying chief, approaching near,\r\nThe \xc3\x86tolian warrior tugg\xe2\x80\x99d his weighty spear:\r\nThen sudden waved his flaming falchion round,\r\nAnd gash\xe2\x80\x99d his belly with a ghastly wound;\r\nThe corpse now breathless on the bloody plain,\r\nTo spoil his arms the victor strove in vain;\r\nThe Thracian bands against the victor press\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nA grove of lances glitter\xe2\x80\x99d at his breast.\r\nStern Thoas, glaring with revengeful eyes,\r\nIn sullen fury slowly quits the prize.\r\n\r\nThus fell two heroes; one the pride of Thrace,\r\nAnd one the leader of the Epeian race;\r\nDeath\xe2\x80\x99s sable shade at once o\xe2\x80\x99ercast their eyes,\r\nIn dust the vanquish\xe2\x80\x99d and the victor lies.\r\nWith copious slaughter all the fields are red,\r\nAnd heap\xe2\x80\x99d with growing mountains of the dead.\r\n\r\nHad some brave chief this martial scene beheld,\r\nBy Pallas guarded through the dreadful field;\r\nMight darts be bid to turn their points away,\r\nAnd swords around him innocently play;\r\nThe war\xe2\x80\x99s whole art with wonder had he seen,\r\nAnd counted heroes where he counted men.\r\n\r\nSo fought each host, with thirst of glory fired,\r\nAnd crowds on crowds triumphantly expired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of the Plain of Troy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACTS OF DIOMED.\r\n\r\nDiomed, assisted by Pallas, performs wonders in this day\xe2\x80\x99s battle.\r\nPandarus wounds him with an arrow, but the goddess cures him, enables\r\nhim to discern gods from mortals, and prohibits him from contending\r\nwith any of the former, excepting Venus. \xc3\x86neas joins Pandarus to oppose\r\nhim; Pandarus is killed, and \xc3\x86neas in great danger but for the\r\nassistance of Venus; who, as she is removing her son from the fight, is\r\nwounded on the hand by Diomed. Apollo seconds her in his rescue, and at\r\nlength carries off \xc3\x86neas to Troy, where he is healed in the temple of\r\nPergamus. Mars rallies the Trojans, and assists Hector to make a stand.\r\nIn the meantime \xc3\x86neas is restored to the field, and they overthrow\r\nseveral of the Greeks; among the rest Tlepolemus is slain by Sarpedon.\r\nJuno and Minerva descend to resist Mars; the latter incites Diomed to\r\ngo against that god; he wounds him, and sends him groaning to heaven.\r\n\r\nThe first battle continues through this book. The scene is the same as\r\nin the former.\r\n\r\nBut Pallas now Tydides\xe2\x80\x99 soul inspires,143\r\nFills with her force, and warms with all her fires,\r\nAbove the Greeks his deathless fame to raise,\r\nAnd crown her hero with distinguish\xe2\x80\x99d praise.\r\nHigh on his helm celestial lightnings play,\r\nHis beamy shield emits a living ray;\r\nThe unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,\r\nLike the red star that fires the autumnal skies,\r\nWhen fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight,\r\nAnd, bathed in ocean, shoots a keener light.\r\nSuch glories Pallas on the chief bestow\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nSuch, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nOnward she drives him, furious to engage,\r\nWhere the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.\r\n\r\nThe sons of Dares first the combat sought,\r\nA wealthy priest, but rich without a fault;\r\nIn Vulcan\xe2\x80\x99s fane the father\xe2\x80\x99s days were led,\r\nThe sons to toils of glorious battle bred;\r\nThese singled from their troops the fight maintain,\r\nThese, from their steeds, Tydides on the plain.\r\nFierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near,\r\nAnd first bold Phegeus cast his sounding spear,\r\nWhich o\xe2\x80\x99er the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder took its course,\r\nAnd spent in empty air its erring force.\r\nNot so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain,\r\nBut pierced his breast, and stretch\xe2\x80\x99d him on the plain.\r\nSeized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled,\r\nLeft the rich chariot, and his brother dead.\r\nAnd had not Vulcan lent celestial aid,\r\nHe too had sunk to death\xe2\x80\x99s eternal shade;\r\nBut in a smoky cloud the god of fire\r\nPreserved the son, in pity to the sire.\r\nThe steeds and chariot, to the navy led,\r\nIncreased the spoils of gallant Diomed.\r\n\r\nStruck with amaze and shame, the Trojan crew,\r\nOr slain, or fled, the sons of Dares view;\r\nWhen by the blood-stain\xe2\x80\x99d hand Minerva press\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe god of battles, and this speech address\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStern power of war! by whom the mighty fall,\r\nWho bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!\r\nLet the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;\r\nAnd whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide:\r\nWhile we from interdicted fields retire,\r\nNor tempt the wrath of heaven\xe2\x80\x99s avenging sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer words allay the impetuous warrior\xe2\x80\x99s heat,\r\nThe god of arms and martial maid retreat;\r\nRemoved from fight, on Xanthus\xe2\x80\x99 flowery bounds\r\nThey sat, and listen\xe2\x80\x99d to the dying sounds.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue,\r\nAnd some bold chieftain every leader slew:\r\nFirst Odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,\r\nHis death ennobled by Atrides\xe2\x80\x99 hand:\r\n\r\nAs he to flight his wheeling car address\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe speedy javelin drove from back to breast.\r\nIn dust the mighty Halizonian lay,\r\nHis arms resound, the spirit wings its way.\r\n\r\nThy fate was next, O Phaestus! doom\xe2\x80\x99d to feel\r\nThe great Idomeneus\xe2\x80\x99 protended steel;\r\nWhom Borus sent (his son and only joy)\r\nFrom fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy.\r\nThe Cretan javelin reach\xe2\x80\x99d him from afar,\r\nAnd pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car;\r\nBack from the car he tumbles to the ground,\r\nAnd everlasting shades his eyes surround.\r\n\r\nThen died Scamandrius, expert in the chase,\r\nIn woods and wilds to wound the savage race;\r\nDiana taught him all her sylvan arts,\r\nTo bend the bow, and aim unerring darts:\r\nBut vainly here Diana\xe2\x80\x99s arts he tries,\r\nThe fatal lance arrests him as he flies;\r\nFrom Menelaus\xe2\x80\x99 arm the weapon sent,\r\nThrough his broad back and heaving bosom went:\r\nDown sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,\r\nHis brazen armour rings against the ground.\r\n\r\nNext artful Phereclus untimely fell;\r\nBold Merion sent him to the realms of hell.\r\nThy father\xe2\x80\x99s skill, O Phereclus! was thine,\r\nThe graceful fabric and the fair design;\r\nFor loved by Pallas, Pallas did impart\r\nTo him the shipwright\xe2\x80\x99s and the builder\xe2\x80\x99s art.\r\nBeneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose,\r\nThe fatal cause of all his country\xe2\x80\x99s woes;\r\nBut he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,\r\nNor saw his country\xe2\x80\x99s peril, nor his own.\r\nThe hapless artist, while confused he fled,\r\nThe spear of Merion mingled with the dead.\r\nThrough his right hip, with forceful fury cast,\r\nBetween the bladder and the bone it pass\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nProne on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,\r\nAnd death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.\r\n\r\nFrom Meges\xe2\x80\x99 force the swift Pedaeus fled,\r\nAntenor\xe2\x80\x99s offspring from a foreign bed,\r\nWhose generous spouse, Theanor, heavenly fair,\r\nNursed the young stranger with a mother\xe2\x80\x99s care.\r\nHow vain those cares! when Meges in the rear\r\nFull in his nape infix\xe2\x80\x99d the fatal spear;\r\nSwift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,\r\nAnd the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.\r\n\r\nThen died Hypsenor, generous and divine,\r\nSprung from the brave Dolopion\xe2\x80\x99s mighty line,\r\nWho near adored Scamander made abode,\r\nPriest of the stream, and honoured as a god.\r\nOn him, amidst the flying numbers found,\r\nEurypylus inflicts a deadly wound;\r\nOn his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand,\r\nThence glancing downwards, lopp\xe2\x80\x99d his holy hand,\r\nWhich stain\xe2\x80\x99d with sacred blood the blushing sand.\r\nDown sunk the priest: the purple hand of death\r\nClosed his dim eye, and fate suppress\xe2\x80\x99d his breath.\r\n\r\nThus toil\xe2\x80\x99d the chiefs, in different parts engaged.\r\nIn every quarter fierce Tydides raged;\r\nAmid the Greek, amid the Trojan train,\r\nRapt through the ranks he thunders o\xe2\x80\x99er the plain;\r\nNow here, now there, he darts from place to place,\r\nPours on the rear, or lightens in their face.\r\nThus from high hills the torrents swift and strong\r\nDeluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,\r\nThrough ruin\xe2\x80\x99d moles the rushing wave resounds,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99erwhelm\xe2\x80\x99s the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds;\r\nThe yellow harvests of the ripen\xe2\x80\x99d year,\r\nAnd flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear!144\r\nWhile Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain,\r\nAnd all the labours of mankind are vain.\r\n\r\nSo raged Tydides, boundless in his ire,\r\nDrove armies back, and made all Troy retire.\r\nWith grief the leader of the Lycian band\r\nSaw the wide waste of his destructive hand:\r\nHis bended bow against the chief he drew;\r\nSwift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew,\r\nWhose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,\r\nDeep in his shoulder pierced, and drank the gore:\r\nThe rushing stream his brazen armour dyed,\r\nWhile the proud archer thus exulting cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHither, ye Trojans, hither drive your steeds!\r\nLo! by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds,\r\nNot long the deathful dart he can sustain;\r\nOr Phoebus urged me to these fields in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSo spoke he, boastful: but the winged dart\r\nStopp\xe2\x80\x99d short of life, and mock\xe2\x80\x99d the shooter\xe2\x80\x99s art.\r\nThe wounded chief, behind his car retired,\r\nThe helping hand of Sthenelus required;\r\nSwift from his seat he leap\xe2\x80\x99d upon the ground,\r\nAnd tugg\xe2\x80\x99d the weapon from the gushing wound;\r\nWhen thus the king his guardian power address\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe purple current wandering o\xe2\x80\x99er his vest:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO progeny of Jove! unconquer\xe2\x80\x99d maid!\r\nIf e\xe2\x80\x99er my godlike sire deserved thy aid,\r\nIf e\xe2\x80\x99er I felt thee in the fighting field;\r\nNow, goddess, now, thy sacred succour yield.\r\nO give my lance to reach the Trojan knight,\r\nWhose arrow wounds the chief thou guard\xe2\x80\x99st in fight;\r\nAnd lay the boaster grovelling on the shore,\r\nThat vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus pray\xe2\x80\x99d Tydides, and Minerva heard,\r\nHis nerves confirm\xe2\x80\x99d, his languid spirits cheer\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nHe feels each limb with wonted vigour light;\r\nHis beating bosom claim\xe2\x80\x99d the promised fight.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe bold, (she cried), in every combat shine,\r\nWar be thy province, thy protection mine;\r\nRush to the fight, and every foe control;\r\nWake each paternal virtue in thy soul:\r\nStrength swells thy boiling breast, infused by me,\r\nAnd all thy godlike father breathes in thee;\r\nYet more, from mortal mists I purge thy eyes,145\r\nAnd set to view the warring deities.\r\nThese see thou shun, through all the embattled plain;\r\nNor rashly strive where human force is vain.\r\nIf Venus mingle in the martial band,\r\nHer shalt thou wound: so Pallas gives command.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, the blue-eyed virgin wing\xe2\x80\x99d her flight;\r\nThe hero rush\xe2\x80\x99d impetuous to the fight;\r\nWith tenfold ardour now invades the plain,\r\nWild with delay, and more enraged by pain.\r\nAs on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls,\r\nAmidst the field a brindled lion falls;\r\nIf chance some shepherd with a distant dart\r\nThe savage wound, he rouses at the smart,\r\nHe foams, he roars; the shepherd dares not stay,\r\nBut trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey;\r\nHeaps fall on heaps; he bathes with blood the ground,\r\nThen leaps victorious o\xe2\x80\x99er the lofty mound.\r\nNot with less fury stern Tydides flew;\r\nAnd two brave leaders at an instant slew;\r\nAstynous breathless fell, and by his side,\r\nHis people\xe2\x80\x99s pastor, good Hypenor, died;\r\nAstynous\xe2\x80\x99 breast the deadly lance receives,\r\nHypenor\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder his broad falchion cleaves.\r\nThose slain he left, and sprung with noble rage\r\nAbas and Polyidus to engage;\r\nSons of Eurydamus, who, wise and old,\r\nCould fate foresee, and mystic dreams unfold;\r\nThe youths return\xe2\x80\x99d not from the doubtful plain,\r\nAnd the sad father tried his arts in vain;\r\nNo mystic dream could make their fates appear,\r\nThough now determined by Tydides\xe2\x80\x99 spear.\r\n\r\nYoung Xanthus next, and Thoon felt his rage;\r\nThe joy and hope of Phaenops\xe2\x80\x99 feeble age:\r\nVast was his wealth, and these the only heirs\r\nOf all his labours and a life of cares.\r\nCold death o\xe2\x80\x99ertakes them in their blooming years,\r\nAnd leaves the father unavailing tears:\r\nTo strangers now descends his heapy store,\r\nThe race forgotten, and the name no more.\r\n\r\nTwo sons of Priam in one chariot ride,\r\nGlittering in arms, and combat side by side.\r\nAs when the lordly lion seeks his food\r\nWhere grazing heifers range the lonely wood,\r\nHe leaps amidst them with a furious bound,\r\nBends their strong necks, and tears them to the ground:\r\nSo from their seats the brother chiefs are torn,\r\nTheir steeds and chariot to the navy borne.\r\n\r\nWith deep concern divine \xc3\x86neas view\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe foe prevailing, and his friends pursued;\r\nThrough the thick storm of singing spears he flies,\r\nExploring Pandarus with careful eyes.\r\nAt length he found Lycaon\xe2\x80\x99s mighty son;\r\nTo whom the chief of Venus\xe2\x80\x99 race begun:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, Pandarus, are all thy honours now,\r\nThy winged arrows and unerring bow,\r\nThy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall\xe2\x80\x99d fame,\r\nAnd boasted glory of the Lycian name?\r\nO pierce that mortal! if we mortal call\r\nThat wondrous force by which whole armies fall;\r\nOr god incensed, who quits the distant skies\r\nTo punish Troy for slighted sacrifice;\r\n(Which, oh avert from our unhappy state!\r\nFor what so dreadful as celestial hate)?\r\nWhoe\xe2\x80\x99er he be, propitiate Jove with prayer;\r\nIf man, destroy; if god, entreat to spare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo him the Lycian: \xe2\x80\x9cWhom your eyes behold,\r\nIf right I judge, is Diomed the bold:\r\nSuch coursers whirl him o\xe2\x80\x99er the dusty field,\r\nSo towers his helmet, and so flames his shield.\r\nIf \xe2\x80\x99tis a god, he wears that chief\xe2\x80\x99s disguise:\r\nOr if that chief, some guardian of the skies,\r\nInvolved in clouds, protects him in the fray,\r\nAnd turns unseen the frustrate dart away.\r\nI wing\xe2\x80\x99d an arrow, which not idly fell,\r\nThe stroke had fix\xe2\x80\x99d him to the gates of hell;\r\nAnd, but some god, some angry god withstands,\r\nHis fate was due to these unerring hands.\r\nSkill\xe2\x80\x99d in the bow, on foot I sought the war,\r\nNor join\xe2\x80\x99d swift horses to the rapid car.\r\nTen polish\xe2\x80\x99d chariots I possess\xe2\x80\x99d at home,\r\nAnd still they grace Lycaon\xe2\x80\x99s princely dome:\r\nThere veil\xe2\x80\x99d in spacious coverlets they stand;\r\nAnd twice ten coursers wait their lord\xe2\x80\x99s command.\r\nThe good old warrior bade me trust to these,\r\nWhen first for Troy I sail\xe2\x80\x99d the sacred seas;\r\nIn fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide,\r\nAnd through the ranks of death triumphant ride.\r\nBut vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclined,\r\nI heard his counsels with unheedful mind,\r\nAnd thought the steeds (your large supplies unknown)\r\nMight fail of forage in the straiten\xe2\x80\x99d town;\r\nSo took my bow and pointed darts in hand\r\nAnd left the chariots in my native land.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late, O friend! my rashness I deplore;\r\nThese shafts, once fatal, carry death no more.\r\nTydeus\xe2\x80\x99 and Atreus\xe2\x80\x99 sons their points have found,\r\nAnd undissembled gore pursued the wound.\r\nIn vain they bleed: this unavailing bow\r\nServes, not to slaughter, but provoke the foe.\r\nIn evil hour these bended horns I strung,\r\nAnd seized the quiver where it idly hung.\r\nCursed be the fate that sent me to the field\r\nWithout a warrior\xe2\x80\x99s arms, the spear and shield!\r\nIf e\xe2\x80\x99er with life I quit the Trojan plain,\r\nIf e\xe2\x80\x99er I see my spouse and sire again,\r\nThis bow, unfaithful to my glorious aims,\r\nBroke by my hand, shall feed the blazing flames.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo whom the leader of the Dardan race:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe calm, nor Phoebus\xe2\x80\x99 honour\xe2\x80\x99d gift disgrace.\r\nThe distant dart be praised, though here we need\r\nThe rushing chariot and the bounding steed.\r\nAgainst yon hero let us bend our course,\r\nAnd, hand to hand, encounter force with force.\r\nNow mount my seat, and from the chariot\xe2\x80\x99s height\r\nObserve my father\xe2\x80\x99s steeds, renown\xe2\x80\x99d in fight;\r\nPractised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,\r\nTo dare the shock, or urge the rapid race;\r\nSecure with these, through fighting fields we go;\r\nOr safe to Troy, if Jove assist the foe.\r\nHaste, seize the whip, and snatch the guiding rein;\r\nThe warrior\xe2\x80\x99s fury let this arm sustain;\r\nOr, if to combat thy bold heart incline,\r\nTake thou the spear, the chariot\xe2\x80\x99s care be mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO prince! (Lycaon\xe2\x80\x99s valiant son replied)\r\nAs thine the steeds, be thine the task to guide.\r\nThe horses, practised to their lord\xe2\x80\x99s command,\r\nShall bear the rein, and answer to thy hand;\r\nBut, if, unhappy, we desert the fight,\r\nThy voice alone can animate their flight;\r\nElse shall our fates be number\xe2\x80\x99d with the dead,\r\nAnd these, the victor\xe2\x80\x99s prize, in triumph led.\r\nThine be the guidance, then: with spear and shield\r\nMyself will charge this terror of the field.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now both heroes mount the glittering car;\r\nThe bounding coursers rush amidst the war;\r\nTheir fierce approach bold Sthenelus espied,\r\nWho thus, alarm\xe2\x80\x99d, to great Tydides cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO friend! two chiefs of force immense I see,\r\nDreadful they come, and bend their rage on thee:\r\nLo the brave heir of old Lycaon\xe2\x80\x99s line,\r\nAnd great \xc3\x86neas, sprung from race divine!\r\nEnough is given to fame. Ascend thy car!\r\nAnd save a life, the bulwark of our war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this the hero cast a gloomy look,\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d on the chief with scorn; and thus he spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?\r\nMe wouldst thou move to base, inglorious flight?\r\nKnow, \xe2\x80\x99tis not honest in my soul to fear,\r\nNor was Tydides born to tremble here.\r\nI hate the cumbrous chariot\xe2\x80\x99s slow advance,\r\nAnd the long distance of the flying lance;\r\nBut while my nerves are strong, my force entire,\r\nThus front the foe, and emulate my sire.\r\nNor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey\r\nThose threatening heroes, bear them both away;\r\nOne chief at least beneath this arm shall die;\r\nSo Pallas tells me, and forbids to fly.\r\nBut if she dooms, and if no god withstand,\r\nThat both shall fall by one victorious hand,\r\nThen heed my words: my horses here detain,\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d to the chariot by the straiten\xe2\x80\x99d rein;\r\nSwift to \xc3\x86neas\xe2\x80\x99 empty seat proceed,\r\nAnd seize the coursers of ethereal breed;\r\nThe race of those, which once the thundering god146\r\nFor ravish\xe2\x80\x99d Ganymede on Tros bestow\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe best that e\xe2\x80\x99er on earth\xe2\x80\x99s broad surface run,\r\nBeneath the rising or the setting sun.\r\nHence great Anchises stole a breed unknown,\r\nBy mortal mares, from fierce Laomedon:\r\nFour of this race his ample stalls contain,\r\nAnd two transport \xc3\x86neas o\xe2\x80\x99er the plain.\r\nThese, were the rich immortal prize our own,\r\nThrough the wide world should make our glory known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus while they spoke, the foe came furious on,\r\nAnd stern Lycaon\xe2\x80\x99s warlike race begun:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrince, thou art met.

heedful of thy high commands,\r\nLoth I gave way, and warn\xe2\x80\x99d our Argive bands:\r\nFor Mars, the homicide, these eyes beheld,\r\nWith slaughter red, and raging round the field.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen thus Minerva:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBrave Tydides, hear!\r\nNot Mars himself, nor aught immortal, fear.\r\nFull on the god impel thy foaming horse:\r\nPallas commands, and Pallas lends thee force.\r\nRash, furious, blind, from these to those he flies,\r\nAnd every side of wavering combat tries;\r\nLarge promise makes, and breaks the promise made:\r\nNow gives the Grecians, now the Trojans aid.\xe2\x80\x9d159\r\n\r\nShe said, and to the steeds approaching near,\r\nDrew from his seat the martial charioteer.\r\nThe vigorous power the trembling car ascends,\r\nFierce for revenge; and Diomed attends:\r\nThe groaning axle bent beneath the load;\r\nSo great a hero, and so great a god.\r\nShe snatch\xe2\x80\x99d the reins, she lash\xe2\x80\x99d with all her force,\r\nAnd full on Mars impelled the foaming horse:\r\nBut first, to hide her heavenly visage, spread\r\nBlack Orcus\xe2\x80\x99 helmet o\xe2\x80\x99er her radiant head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIOMED CASTING HIS SPEAR AT MARS.]\r\n\r\nJust then gigantic Periphas lay slain,\r\nThe strongest warrior of the \xc3\x86tolian train;\r\nThe god, who slew him, leaves his prostrate prize\r\nStretch\xe2\x80\x99d where he fell, and at Tydides flies.\r\nNow rushing fierce, in equal arms appear\r\nThe daring Greek, the dreadful god of war!\r\nFull at the chief, above his courser\xe2\x80\x99s head,\r\nFrom Mars\xe2\x80\x99s arm the enormous weapon fled:\r\nPallas opposed her hand, and caused to glance\r\nFar from the car the strong immortal lance.\r\nThen threw the force of Tydeus\xe2\x80\x99 warlike son;\r\nThe javelin hiss\xe2\x80\x99d; the goddess urged it on:\r\nWhere the broad cincture girt his armour round,\r\nIt pierced the god: his groin received the wound.\r\nFrom the rent skin the warrior tugs again\r\nThe smoking steel. Mars bellows with the pain:\r\nLoud as the roar encountering armies yield,\r\nWhen shouting millions shake the thundering field.\r\nBoth armies start, and trembling gaze around;\r\nAnd earth and heaven re-bellow to the sound.\r\nAs vapours blown by Auster\xe2\x80\x99s sultry breath,\r\nPregnant with plagues, and shedding seeds of death,\r\nBeneath the rage of burning Sirius rise,\r\nChoke the parch\xe2\x80\x99d earth, and blacken all the skies;\r\nIn such a cloud the god from combat driven,\r\nHigh o\xe2\x80\x99er the dusky whirlwind scales the heaven.\r\nWild with his pain, he sought the bright abodes,\r\nThere sullen sat beneath the sire of gods,\r\nShow\xe2\x80\x99d the celestial blood, and with a groan\r\nThus pour\xe2\x80\x99d his plaints before the immortal throne:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan Jove, supine, flagitious facts survey,\r\nAnd brook the furies of this daring day?\r\nFor mortal men celestial powers engage,\r\nAnd gods on gods exert eternal rage:\r\nFrom thee, O father! all these ills we bear,\r\nAnd thy fell daughter with the shield and spear;\r\nThou gavest that fury to the realms of light,\r\nPernicious, wild, regardless of the right.\r\nAll heaven beside reveres thy sovereign sway,\r\nThy voice we hear, and thy behests obey:\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis hers to offend, and even offending share\r\nThy breast, thy counsels, thy distinguish\xe2\x80\x99d care:\r\nSo boundless she, and thou so partial grown,\r\nWell may we deem the wondrous birth thy own.\r\nNow frantic Diomed, at her command,\r\nAgainst the immortals lifts his raging hand:\r\nThe heavenly Venus first his fury found,\r\nMe next encountering, me he dared to wound;\r\nVanquish\xe2\x80\x99d I fled; even I, the god of fight,\r\nFrom mortal madness scarce was saved by flight.\r\nElse hadst thou seen me sink on yonder plain,\r\nHeap\xe2\x80\x99d round, and heaving under loads of slain!\r\nOr pierced with Grecian darts, for ages lie,\r\nCondemn\xe2\x80\x99d to pain, though fated not to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHim thus upbraiding, with a wrathful look\r\nThe lord of thunders view\xe2\x80\x99d, and stern bespoke:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me, perfidious! this lamenting strain?\r\nOf lawless force shall lawless Mars complain?\r\nOf all the gods who tread the spangled skies,\r\nThou most unjust, most odious in our eyes!\r\nInhuman discord is thy dire delight,\r\nThe waste of slaughter, and the rage of fight.\r\nNo bounds, no law, thy fiery temper quells,\r\nAnd all thy mother in thy soul rebels.\r\nIn vain our threats, in vain our power we use;\r\nShe gives the example, and her son pursues.\r\nYet long the inflicted pangs thou shall not mourn,\r\nSprung since thou art from Jove, and heavenly-born.\r\nElse, singed with lightning, hadst thou hence been thrown,\r\nWhere chain\xe2\x80\x99d on burning rocks the Titans groan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus he who shakes Olympus with his nod;\r\nThen gave to Paeon\xe2\x80\x99s care the bleeding god.160\r\nWith gentle hand the balm he pour\xe2\x80\x99d around,\r\nAnd heal\xe2\x80\x99d the immortal flesh, and closed the wound.\r\nAs when the fig\xe2\x80\x99s press\xe2\x80\x99d juice, infused in cream,\r\nTo curds coagulates the liquid stream,\r\nSudden the fluids fix the parts combined;\r\nSuch, and so soon, the ethereal texture join\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nCleansed from the dust and gore, fair Hebe dress\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nHis mighty limbs in an immortal vest.\r\nGlorious he sat, in majesty restored,\r\nFast by the throne of heaven\xe2\x80\x99s superior lord.\r\nJuno and Pallas mount the bless\xe2\x80\x99d abodes,\r\nTheir task perform\xe2\x80\x99d, and mix among the gods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUNO.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nTHE EPISODES OF GLAUCUS AND DIOMED, AND OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE.\r\n\r\nThe gods having left the field, the Grecians prevail. Helenus, the\r\nchief augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to\r\nappoint a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the\r\ntemple of Minerva, to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. The\r\nbattle relaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed have\r\nan interview between the two armies; where, coming to the knowledge, of\r\nthe friendship and hospitality passed between their ancestors, they\r\nmake exchange of their arms. Hector, having performed the orders of\r\nHelenus, prevails upon Paris to return to the battle, and, taking a\r\ntender leave of his wife Andromache, hastens again to the field.\r\n\r\nThe scene is first in the field of battle, between the rivers Simois\r\nand Scamander, and then changes to Troy.\r\n\r\nNow heaven forsakes the fight: the immortals yield\r\nTo human force and human skill the field:\r\nDark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes;\r\nNow here, now there, the tide of combat flows;\r\nWhile Troy\xe2\x80\x99s famed streams, that bound the deathful plain\r\nOn either side, run purple to the main.\r\n\r\nGreat Ajax first to conquest led the way,\r\nBroke the thick ranks, and turn\xe2\x80\x99d the doubtful day.\r\nThe Thracian Acamas his falchion found,\r\nAnd hew\xe2\x80\x99d the enormous giant to the ground;\r\nHis thundering arm a deadly stroke impress\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nWhere the black horse-hair nodded o\xe2\x80\x99er his crest;\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d in his front the brazen weapon lies,\r\nAnd seals in endless shades his swimming eyes.\r\nNext Teuthras\xe2\x80\x99 son distain\xe2\x80\x99d the sands with blood,\r\nAxylus, hospitable, rich, and good:\r\nIn fair Arisbe\xe2\x80\x99s walls (his native place)161\r\nHe held his seat! a friend to human race.\r\nFast by the road, his ever-open door\r\nObliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.\r\nTo stern Tydides now he falls a prey,\r\nNo friend to guard him in the dreadful day!\r\nBreathless the good man fell, and by his side\r\nHis faithful servant, old Calesius died.\r\n\r\nBy great Euryalus was Dresus slain,\r\nAnd next he laid Opheltius on the plain.\r\nTwo twins were near, bold, beautiful, and young,\r\nFrom a fair naiad and Bucolion sprung:\r\n(Laomedon\xe2\x80\x99s white flocks Bucolion fed,\r\nThat monarch\xe2\x80\x99s first-born by a foreign bed;\r\nIn secret woods he won the naiad\xe2\x80\x99s grace,\r\nAnd two fair infants crown\xe2\x80\x99d his strong embrace:)\r\nHere dead they lay in all their youthful charms;\r\nThe ruthless victor stripp\xe2\x80\x99d their shining arms.\r\n\r\nAstyalus by Polypoetes fell;\r\nUlysses\xe2\x80\x99 spear Pidytes sent to hell;\r\nBy Teucer\xe2\x80\x99s shaft brave Aretaon bled,\r\nAnd Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s son laid stern Ablerus dead;\r\nGreat Agamemnon, leader of the brave,\r\nThe mortal wound of rich Elatus gave,\r\nWho held in Pedasus his proud abode,162\r\nAnd till\xe2\x80\x99d the banks where silver Satnio flow\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nMelanthius by Eurypylus was slain;\r\nAnd Phylacus from Leitus flies in vain.\r\n\r\nUnbless\xe2\x80\x99d Adrastus next at mercy lies\r\nBeneath the Spartan spear, a living prize.\r\nScared with the din and tumult of the fight,\r\nHis headlong steeds, precipitate in flight,\r\nRush\xe2\x80\x99d on a tamarisk\xe2\x80\x99s strong trunk, and broke\r\nThe shatter\xe2\x80\x99d chariot from the crooked yoke;\r\nWide o\xe2\x80\x99er the field, resistless as the wind,\r\nFor Troy they fly, and leave their lord behind.\r\nProne on his face he sinks beside the wheel:\r\nAtrides o\xe2\x80\x99er him shakes his vengeful steel;\r\nThe fallen chief in suppliant posture press\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe victor\xe2\x80\x99s knees, and thus his prayer address\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO spare my youth, and for the life I owe\r\nLarge gifts of price my father shall bestow.\r\nWhen fame shall tell, that, not in battle slain,\r\nThy hollow ships his captive son detain:\r\nRich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told,163\r\nAnd steel well-temper\xe2\x80\x99d, and persuasive gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: compassion touch\xe2\x80\x99d the hero\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nHe stood, suspended with the lifted dart:\r\nAs pity pleaded for his vanquish\xe2\x80\x99d prize,\r\nStern Agamemnon swift to vengeance flies,\r\nAnd, furious, thus: \xe2\x80\x9cOh impotent of mind!164\r\nShall these, shall these Atrides\xe2\x80\x99 mercy find?\r\nWell hast thou known proud Troy\xe2\x80\x99s perfidious land,\r\nAnd well her natives merit at thy hand!\r\nNot one of all the race, nor sex, nor age,\r\nShall save a Trojan from our boundless rage:\r\nIlion shall perish whole, and bury all;\r\nHer babes, her infants at the breast, shall fall;165\r\nA dreadful lesson of exampled fate,\r\nTo warn the nations, and to curb the great!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe monarch spoke; the words, with warmth address\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nTo rigid justice steel\xe2\x80\x99d his brother\xe2\x80\x99s breast.\r\nFierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust;\r\nThe monarch\xe2\x80\x99s javelin stretch\xe2\x80\x99d him in the dust,\r\nThen pressing with his foot his panting heart,\r\nForth from the slain he tugg\xe2\x80\x99d the reeking dart.\r\nOld Nestor saw, and roused the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s rage;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus, heroes! thus the vigorous combat wage;\r\nNo son of Mars descend, for servile gains,\r\nTo touch the booty, while a foe remains.\r\nBehold yon glittering host, your future spoil!\r\nFirst gain the conquest, then reward the toil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now had Greece eternal fame acquired,\r\nAnd frighted Troy within her walls, retired,\r\nHad not sage Helenus her state redress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nTaught by the gods that moved his sacred breast.\r\nWhere Hector stood, with great \xc3\x86neas join\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe seer reveal\xe2\x80\x99d the counsels of his mind:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe generous chiefs! on whom the immortals lay\r\nThe cares and glories of this doubtful day;\r\nOn whom your aids, your country\xe2\x80\x99s hopes depend;\r\nWise to consult, and active to defend!\r\nHere, at our gates, your brave efforts unite,\r\nTurn back the routed, and forbid the flight,\r\nEre yet their wives\xe2\x80\x99 soft arms the cowards gain,\r\nThe sport and insult of the hostile train.\r\nWhen your commands have hearten\xe2\x80\x99d every band,\r\nOurselves, here fix\xe2\x80\x99d, will make the dangerous stand;\r\nPress\xe2\x80\x99d as we are, and sore of former fight,\r\nThese straits demand our last remains of might.\r\nMeanwhile thou, Hector, to the town retire,\r\nAnd teach our mother what the gods require:\r\nDirect the queen to lead the assembled train\r\nOf Troy\xe2\x80\x99s chief matrons to Minerva\xe2\x80\x99s fane;166\r\nUnbar the sacred gates, and seek the power,\r\nWith offer\xe2\x80\x99d vows, in Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s topmost tower.\r\nThe largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold,\r\nMost prized for art, and labour\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er with gold,\r\nBefore the goddess\xe2\x80\x99 honour\xe2\x80\x99d knees be spread,\r\nAnd twelve young heifers to her altars led:\r\nIf so the power, atoned by fervent prayer,\r\nOur wives, our infants, and our city spare,\r\nAnd far avert Tydides\xe2\x80\x99 wasteful ire,\r\nThat mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire;\r\nNot thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread,\r\nSprung though he was from more than mortal bed;\r\nNot thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,\r\nIn rage unbounded, and unmatch\xe2\x80\x99d in might.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHector obedient heard: and, with a bound,\r\nLeap\xe2\x80\x99d from his trembling chariot to the ground;\r\nThrough all his host inspiring force he flies,\r\nAnd bids the thunder of the battle rise.\r\nWith rage recruited the bold Trojans glow,\r\nAnd turn the tide of conflict on the foe:\r\nFierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;\r\nAll Greece recedes, and \xe2\x80\x99midst her triumphs fears;\r\nSome god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,\r\nShot down avenging from the vault of stars.\r\n\r\nThen thus aloud: \xe2\x80\x9cYe dauntless Dardans, hear!\r\nAnd you whom distant nations send to war!\r\nBe mindful of the strength your fathers bore;\r\nBe still yourselves, and Hector asks no more.\r\nOne hour demands me in the Trojan wall,\r\nTo bid our altars flame, and victims fall:\r\nNor shall, I trust, the matrons\xe2\x80\x99 holy train,\r\nAnd reverend elders, seek the gods in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis said, with ample strides the hero pass\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThe shield\xe2\x80\x99s large orb behind his shoulder cast,\r\nHis neck o\xe2\x80\x99ershading, to his ankle hung;\r\nAnd as he march\xe2\x80\x99d the brazen buckler rung.\r\n\r\nNow paused the battle (godlike Hector gone),167\r\nWhere daring Glaucus and great Tydeus\xe2\x80\x99 son\r\nBetween both armies met: the chiefs from far\r\nObserved each other, and had mark\xe2\x80\x99d for war.\r\nNear as they drew, Tydides thus began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou, boldest of the race of man?\r\nOur eyes till now that aspect ne\xe2\x80\x99er beheld,\r\nWhere fame is reap\xe2\x80\x99d amid the embattled field;\r\nYet far before the troops thou dar\xe2\x80\x99st appear,\r\nAnd meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.\r\nUnhappy they, and born of luckless sires,\r\nWho tempt our fury when Minerva fires!\r\nBut if from heaven, celestial, thou descend,\r\nKnow with immortals we no more contend.\r\nNot long Lycurgus view\xe2\x80\x99d the golden light,\r\nThat daring man who mix\xe2\x80\x99d with gods in fight.\r\nBacchus, and Bacchus\xe2\x80\x99 votaries, he drove,\r\nWith brandish\xe2\x80\x99d steel, from Nyssa\xe2\x80\x99s sacred grove:\r\nTheir consecrated spears lay scatter\xe2\x80\x99d round,\r\nWith curling vines and twisted ivy bound;\r\nWhile Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,\r\nAnd Thetis\xe2\x80\x99 arms received the trembling god.\r\nNor fail\xe2\x80\x99d the crime the immortals\xe2\x80\x99 wrath to move;\r\n(The immortals bless\xe2\x80\x99d with endless ease above;)\r\nDeprived of sight by their avenging doom,\r\nCheerless he breathed, and wander\xe2\x80\x99d in the gloom,\r\nThen sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,\r\nA wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!\r\nI brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth\r\nSustain thy life, and human be thy birth,\r\nBold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,\r\nApproach, and enter the dark gates of death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, or from whence I am, or who my sire,\r\n(Replied the chief,) can Tydeus\xe2\x80\x99 son inquire?\r\nLike leaves on trees the race of man is found,\r\nNow green in youth, now withering on the ground;\r\nAnother race the following spring supplies;\r\nThey fall successive, and successive rise:\r\nSo generations in their course decay;\r\nSo flourish these, when those are pass\xe2\x80\x99d away.\r\nBut if thou still persist to search my birth,\r\nThen hear a tale that fills the spacious earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA city stands on Argos\xe2\x80\x99 utmost bound,\r\n(Argos the fair, for warlike steeds renown\xe2\x80\x99d,)\r\nAeolian Sisyphus, with wisdom bless\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nIn ancient time the happy wall possess\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThen call\xe2\x80\x99d Ephyre: Glaucus was his son;\r\nGreat Glaucus, father of Bellerophon,\r\nWho o\xe2\x80\x99er the sons of men in beauty shined,\r\nLoved for that valour which preserves mankind.\r\nThen mighty Praetus Argos\xe2\x80\x99 sceptre sway\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhose hard commands Bellerophon obey\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nWith direful jealousy the monarch raged,\r\nAnd the brave prince in numerous toils engaged.\r\nFor him Antaea burn\xe2\x80\x99d with lawless flame,\r\nAnd strove to tempt him from the paths of fame:\r\nIn vain she tempted the relentless youth,\r\nEndued with wisdom, sacred fear, and truth.\r\nFired at his scorn the queen to Praetus fled,\r\nAnd begg\xe2\x80\x99d revenge for her insulted bed:\r\nIncensed he heard, resolving on his fate;\r\nBut hospitable laws restrain\xe2\x80\x99d his hate:\r\nTo Lycia the devoted youth he sent,\r\nWith tablets seal\xe2\x80\x99d, that told his dire intent.168\r\nNow bless\xe2\x80\x99d by every power who guards the good,\r\nThe chief arrived at Xanthus\xe2\x80\x99 silver flood:\r\nThere Lycia\xe2\x80\x99s monarch paid him honours due,\r\nNine days he feasted, and nine bulls he slew.\r\nBut when the tenth bright morning orient glow\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe faithful youth his monarch\xe2\x80\x99s mandate show\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nThe fatal tablets, till that instant seal\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe deathful secret to the king reveal\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nFirst, dire Chimaera\xe2\x80\x99s conquest was enjoin\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nA mingled monster of no mortal kind!\r\nBehind, a dragon\xe2\x80\x99s fiery tail was spread;\r\nA goat\xe2\x80\x99s rough body bore a lion\xe2\x80\x99s head;\r\nHer pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire;\r\nHer gaping throat emits infernal fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis pest he slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d, (for he read the skies,\r\nAnd trusted heaven\xe2\x80\x99s informing prodigies,)\r\nThen met in arms the Solymaean crew,169\r\n(Fiercest of men,) and those the warrior slew;\r\nNext the bold Amazons\xe2\x80\x99 whole force defied;\r\nAnd conquer\xe2\x80\x99d still, for heaven was on his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor ended here his toils: his Lycian foes,\r\nAt his return, a treacherous ambush rose,\r\nWith levell\xe2\x80\x99d spears along the winding shore:\r\nThere fell they breathless, and return\xe2\x80\x99d no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt length the monarch, with repentant grief,\r\nConfess\xe2\x80\x99d the gods, and god-descended chief;\r\nHis daughter gave, the stranger to detain,\r\nWith half the honours of his ample reign:\r\nThe Lycians grant a chosen space of ground,\r\nWith woods, with vineyards, and with harvests crown\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nThere long the chief his happy lot possess\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWith two brave sons and one fair daughter bless\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\n(Fair e\xe2\x80\x99en in heavenly eyes: her fruitful love\r\nCrown\xe2\x80\x99d with Sarpedon\xe2\x80\x99s birth the embrace of Jove;)\r\nBut when at last, distracted in his mind,\r\nForsook by heaven, forsaking humankind,\r\nWide o\xe2\x80\x99er the Aleian field he chose to stray,\r\nA long, forlorn, uncomfortable way!170\r\nWoes heap\xe2\x80\x99d on woes consumed his wasted heart:\r\nHis beauteous daughter fell by Phoebe\xe2\x80\x99s dart;\r\nHis eldest born by raging Mars was slain,\r\nIn combat on the Solymaean plain.\r\nHippolochus survived: from him I came,\r\nThe honour\xe2\x80\x99d author of my birth and name;\r\nBy his decree I sought the Trojan town;\r\nBy his instructions learn to win renown,\r\nTo stand the first in worth as in command,\r\nTo add new honours to my native land,\r\nBefore my eyes my mighty sires to place,\r\nAnd emulate the glories of our race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke, and transport fill\xe2\x80\x99d Tydides\xe2\x80\x99 heart;\r\nIn earth the generous warrior fix\xe2\x80\x99d his dart,\r\nThen friendly, thus the Lycian prince address\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, my brave hereditary guest!\r\nThus ever let us meet, with kind embrace,\r\nNor stain the sacred friendship of our race.\r\nKnow, chief, our grandsires have been guests of old;\r\nOEneus the strong, Bellerophon the bold:\r\nOur ancient seat his honour\xe2\x80\x99d presence graced,\r\nWhere twenty days in genial rites he pass\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nThe parting heroes mutual presents left;\r\nA golden goblet was thy grandsire\xe2\x80\x99s gift;\r\nOEneus a belt of matchless work bestowed,\r\nThat rich with Tyrian dye refulgent glow\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n(This from his pledge I learn\xe2\x80\x99d, which, safely stored\r\nAmong my treasures, still adorns my board:\r\nFor Tydeus left me young, when Thebe\xe2\x80\x99s wall\r\nBeheld the sons of Greece untimely fall.)\r\nMindful of this, in friendship let us join;\r\nIf heaven our steps to foreign lands incline,\r\nMy guest in Argos thou, and I in Lycia thine.\r\nEnough of Trojans to this lance shall yield,\r\nIn the full harvest of yon ample field;\r\nEnough of Greeks shall dye thy spear with gore;\r\nBut thou and Diomed be foes no more.\r\nNow change we arms, and prove to either host\r\nWe guard the friendship of the line we boast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus having said, the gallant chiefs alight,\r\nTheir hands they join, their mutual faith they plight;\r\nBrave Glaucus then each narrow thought resign\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\n(Jove warm\xe2\x80\x99d his bosom, and enlarged his mind,)\r\nFor Diomed\xe2\x80\x99s brass arms, of mean device,\r\nFor which nine oxen paid, (a vulgar price,)\r\nHe gave his own, of gold divinely wrought,171\r\nA hundred beeves the shining purchase bought.\r\n\r\nMeantime the guardian of the Trojan state,\r\nGreat Hector, enter\xe2\x80\x99d at the Scaean gate.172\r\nBeneath the beech-tree\xe2\x80\x99s consecrated shades,\r\nThe Trojan matrons and the Trojan maids\r\nAround him flock\xe2\x80\x99d, all press\xe2\x80\x99d with pious care\r\nFor husbands, brothers, sons, engaged in war.\r\nHe bids the train in long procession go,\r\nAnd seek the gods, to avert the impending woe.\r\nAnd now to Priam\xe2\x80\x99s stately courts he came,\r\nRais\xe2\x80\x99d on arch\xe2\x80\x99d columns of stupendous frame;\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er these a range of marble structure runs,\r\nThe rich pavilions of his fifty sons,\r\nIn fifty chambers lodged: and rooms of state,173\r\nOpposed to those, where Priam\xe2\x80\x99s daughters sate.\r\nTwelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone,\r\nOf equal beauty, and of polish\xe2\x80\x99d stone.\r\nHither great Hector pass\xe2\x80\x99d, nor pass\xe2\x80\x99d unseen\r\nOf royal Hecuba, his mother-queen.\r\n(With her Laodice, whose beauteous face\r\nSurpass\xe2\x80\x99d the nymphs of Troy\xe2\x80\x99s illustrious race.)\r\nLong in a strict embrace she held her son,\r\nAnd press\xe2\x80\x99d his hand, and tender thus begun:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Hector! say, what great occasion calls\r\nMy son from fight, when Greece surrounds our walls;\r\nCom\xe2\x80\x99st thou to supplicate the almighty power\r\nWith lifted hands, from Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s lofty tower?\r\nStay, till I bring the cup with Bacchus crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nIn Jove\xe2\x80\x99s high name, to sprinkle on the ground,\r\nAnd pay due vows to all the gods around.\r\nThen with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul,\r\nAnd draw new spirits from the generous bowl;\r\nSpent as thou art with long laborious fight,\r\nThe brave defender of thy country\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar hence be Bacchus\xe2\x80\x99 gifts; (the chief rejoin\xe2\x80\x99d;)\r\nInflaming wine, pernicious to mankind,\r\nUnnerves the limbs, and dulls the noble mind.\r\nLet chiefs abstain, and spare the sacred juice\r\nTo sprinkle to the gods, its better use.\r\nBy me that holy office were profaned;\r\nIll fits it me, with human gore distain\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nTo the pure skies these horrid hands to raise,\r\nOr offer heaven\xe2\x80\x99s great Sire polluted praise.\r\nYou, with your matrons, go! a spotless train,\r\nAnd burn rich odours in Minerva\xe2\x80\x99s fane.\r\nThe largest mantle your full wardrobes hold,\r\nMost prized for art, and labour\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er with gold,\r\nBefore the goddess\xe2\x80\x99 honour\xe2\x80\x99d knees be spread,\r\nAnd twelve young heifers to her altar led.\r\nSo may the power, atoned by fervent prayer,\r\nOur wives, our infants, and our city spare;\r\nAnd far avert Tydides\xe2\x80\x99 wasteful ire,\r\nWho mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire.\r\nBe this, O mother, your religious care:\r\nI go to rouse soft Paris to the war;\r\nIf yet not lost to all the sense of shame,\r\nThe recreant warrior hear the voice of fame.\r\nOh, would kind earth the hateful wretch embrace,\r\nThat pest of Troy, that ruin of our race!174\r\nDeep to the dark abyss might he descend,\r\nTroy yet should flourish, and my sorrows end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis heard, she gave command: and summon\xe2\x80\x99d came\r\nEach noble matron and illustrious dame.\r\nThe Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went,\r\nWhere treasured odours breathed a costly scent.\r\nThere lay the vestures of no vulgar art,\r\nSidonian maids embroider\xe2\x80\x99d every part,\r\nWhom from soft Sidon youthful Paris bore,\r\nWith Helen touching on the Tyrian shore.\r\nHere, as the queen revolved with careful eyes\r\nThe various textures and the various dyes,\r\nShe chose a veil that shone superior far,\r\nAnd glow\xe2\x80\x99d refulgent as the morning star.\r\nHerself with this the long procession leads;\r\nThe train majestically slow proceeds.\r\nSoon as to Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s topmost tower they come,\r\nAnd awful reach the high Palladian dome,\r\nAntenor\xe2\x80\x99s consort, fair Theano, waits\r\nAs Pallas\xe2\x80\x99 priestess, and unbars the gates.\r\nWith hands uplifted and imploring eyes,\r\nThey fill the dome with supplicating cries.\r\nThe priestess then the shining veil displays,\r\nPlaced on Minerva\xe2\x80\x99s knees, and thus she prays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid,\r\nTroy\xe2\x80\x99s strong defence, unconquer\xe2\x80\x99d Pallas, aid!\r\nBreak thou Tydides\xe2\x80\x99 spear, and let him fall\r\nProne on the dust before the Trojan wall!\r\nSo twelve young heifers, guiltless of the yoke,\r\nShall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke.\r\nBut thou, atoned by penitence and prayer,\r\nOurselves, our infants, and our city spare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSo pray\xe2\x80\x99d the priestess in her holy fane;\r\nSo vow\xe2\x80\x99d the matrons, but they vow\xe2\x80\x99d in vain.\r\n\r\nWhile these appear before the power with prayers,\r\nHector to Paris\xe2\x80\x99 lofty dome repairs.175\r\nHimself the mansion raised, from every part\r\nAssembling architects of matchless art.\r\nNear Priam\xe2\x80\x99s court and Hector\xe2\x80\x99s palace stands\r\nThe pompous structure, and the town commands.\r\nA spear the hero bore of wondrous strength,\r\nOf full ten cubits was the lance\xe2\x80\x99s length,\r\nThe steely point with golden ringlets join\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nBefore him brandish\xe2\x80\x99d, at each motion shined\r\nThus entering, in the glittering rooms he found\r\nHis brother-chief, whose useless arms lay round,\r\nHis eyes delighting with their splendid show,\r\nBrightening the shield, and polishing the bow.\r\nBeside him Helen with her virgins stands,\r\nGuides their rich labours, and instructs their hands.\r\n\r\nHim thus inactive, with an ardent look\r\nThe prince beheld, and high-resenting spoke.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy hate to Troy, is this the time to show?\r\n(O wretch ill-fated, and thy country\xe2\x80\x99s foe!)\r\nParis and Greece against us both conspire,\r\nThy close resentment, and their vengeful ire.\r\nFor thee great Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s guardian heroes fall,\r\nTill heaps of dead alone defend her wall,\r\nFor thee the soldier bleeds, the matron mourns,\r\nAnd wasteful war in all its fury burns.\r\nUngrateful man! deserves not this thy care,\r\nOur troops to hearten, and our toils to share?\r\nRise, or behold the conquering flames ascend,\r\nAnd all the Phrygian glories at an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother, \xe2\x80\x99tis just, (replied the beauteous youth,)\r\nThy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth:\r\nYet charge my absence less, O generous chief!\r\nOn hate to Troy, than conscious shame and grief:\r\nHere, hid from human eyes, thy brother sate,\r\nAnd mourn\xe2\x80\x99d, in secret, his and Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s fate.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis now enough; now glory spreads her charms,\r\nAnd beauteous Helen calls her chief to arms.\r\nConquest to-day my happier sword may bless,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis man\xe2\x80\x99s to fight, but heaven\xe2\x80\x99s to give success.\r\nBut while I arm, contain thy ardent mind;\r\nOr go, and Paris shall not lag behind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HECTOR CHIDING PARIS.]\r\n\r\nHe said, nor answer\xe2\x80\x99d Priam\xe2\x80\x99s warlike son;\r\nWhen Helen thus with lowly grace

Apollo, seeing her\r\ndescend from Olympus, joins her near the Scaean gate. They agree to put\r\noff the general engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge\r\nthe Greeks to a single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the\r\nchallenge, the lot is cast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after\r\nseveral attacks, are parted by the night. The Trojans calling a\r\ncouncil, Antenor purposes the delivery of Helen to the Greeks, to which\r\nParis will not consent, but offers to restore them her riches. Priam\r\nsends a herald to make this offer, and to demand a truce for burning\r\nthe dead, the last of which only is agreed to by Agamemnon. When the\r\nfunerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of Nestor,\r\nerect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with\r\ntowers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune testifies his\r\njealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter. Both\r\narmies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans\r\nwith thunder, and other signs of his wrath.\r\n\r\nThe three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax, the\r\nnext day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the funeral rites\r\nof the slain and one more in building the fortification before the\r\nships. So that somewhat about three days is employed in this book. The\r\nscene lies wholly in the field.\r\n\r\nSo spoke the guardian of the Trojan state,\r\nThen rush\xe2\x80\x99d impetuous through the Scaean gate.\r\nHim Paris follow\xe2\x80\x99d to the dire alarms;\r\nBoth breathing slaughter, both resolved in arms.\r\nAs when to sailors labouring through the main,\r\nThat long have heaved the weary oar in vain,\r\nJove bids at length the expected gales arise;\r\nThe gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies.\r\nSo welcome these to Troy\xe2\x80\x99s desiring train,\r\nThe bands are cheer\xe2\x80\x99d, the war awakes again.\r\n\r\nBold Paris first the work of death begun\r\nOn great Menestheus, Areithous\xe2\x80\x99 son,\r\nSprung from the fair Philomeda\xe2\x80\x99s embrace,\r\nThe pleasing Arne was his native place.\r\nThen sunk Eioneus to the shades below,\r\nBeneath his steely casque he felt the blow177\r\nFull on his neck, from Hector\xe2\x80\x99s weighty hand;\r\nAnd roll\xe2\x80\x99d, with limbs relax\xe2\x80\x99d, along the land.\r\nBy Glaucus\xe2\x80\x99 spear the bold Iphinous bleeds,\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;\r\nHeadlong he tumbles: his slack nerves unbound,\r\nDrop the cold useless members on the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen now Minerva saw her Argives slain,\r\nFrom vast Olympus to the gleaming plain\r\nFierce she descends: Apollo marked her flight,\r\nNor shot less swift from Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s towery height.\r\nRadiant they met, beneath the beechen shade;\r\nWhen thus Apollo to the blue-eyed maid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat cause, O daughter of Almighty Jove!\r\nThus wings thy progress from the realms above?\r\nOnce more impetuous dost thou bend thy way,\r\nTo give to Greece the long divided day?\r\nToo much has Troy already felt thy hate,\r\nNow breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate;\r\nThis day, the business of the field suspend;\r\nWar soon shall kindle, and great Ilion bend;\r\nSince vengeful goddesses confederate join\r\nTo raze her walls, though built by hands divine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo whom the progeny of Jove replies:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left, for this, the council of the skies:\r\nBut who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear,\r\nWhat art shall calm the furious sons of war?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTo her the god: \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Hector\xe2\x80\x99s soul incite\r\nTo dare the boldest Greek to single fight,\r\nTill Greece, provoked, from all her numbers show\r\nA warrior worthy to be Hector\xe2\x80\x99s foe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew;\r\nSage Helenus their secret counsels knew;\r\nHector, inspired, he sought: to him address\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThus told the dictates of his sacred breast:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO son of Priam! let thy faithful ear\r\nReceive my words: thy friend and brother hear!\r\nGo forth persuasive, and a while engage\r\nThe warring nations to suspend their rage;\r\nThen dare the boldest of the hostile train\r\nTo mortal combat on the listed plain.\r\nFor not this day shall end thy glorious date;\r\nThe gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: the warrior heard the word with joy;\r\nThen with his spear restrain\xe2\x80\x99d the youth of Troy,\r\nHeld by the midst athwart. On either hand\r\nThe squadrons part; the expecting Trojans stand;\r\nGreat Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear:\r\nThey breathe, and hush the tumult of the war.\r\nThe Athenian maid, and glorious god of day,178\r\nWith silent joy the settling hosts survey:\r\nIn form of vultures, on the beech\xe2\x80\x99s height\r\nThey sit conceal\xe2\x80\x99d, and wait the future fight.\r\n\r\nThe thronging troops obscure the dusky fields,\r\nHorrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.\r\nAs when a general darkness veils the main,\r\n(Soft Zephyr curling the wide wat\xe2\x80\x99ry plain,)\r\nThe waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps,\r\nAnd a still horror saddens all the deeps;\r\nThus in thick orders settling wide around,\r\nAt length composed they sit, and shade the ground.\r\nGreat Hector first amidst both armies broke\r\nThe solemn silence, and their powers bespoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,\r\nWhat my soul prompts, and what some god commands.\r\nGreat Jove, averse our warfare to compose,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes;\r\nWar with a fiercer tide once more returns,\r\nTill Ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.\r\nYou then, O princes of the Greeks! appear;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis Hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear:\r\nFrom all your troops select the boldest knight,\r\nAnd him, the boldest, Hector dares to fight.\r\nHere if I fall, by chance of battle slain,\r\nBe his my spoil, and his these arms remain;\r\nBut let my body, to my friends return\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nBy Trojan hands and Trojan flames be burn\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nAnd if Apollo, in whose aid I trust,\r\nShall stretch your daring champion in the dust;\r\nIf mine the glory to despoil the foe;\r\nOn Phoebus\xe2\x80\x99 temple I\xe2\x80\x99ll his arms bestow:\r\nThe breathless carcase to your navy sent,\r\nGreece on the shore shall raise a monument;\r\nWhich when some future mariner surveys,\r\nWash\xe2\x80\x99d by broad Hellespont\xe2\x80\x99s resounding seas,\r\nThus shall he say, \xe2\x80\x98A valiant Greek lies there,\r\nBy Hector slain, the mighty man of war,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe stone shall tell your vanquish\xe2\x80\x99d hero\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nAnd distant ages learn the victor\xe2\x80\x99s fame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis fierce defiance Greece astonish\xe2\x80\x99d heard,\r\nBlush\xe2\x80\x99d to refuse, and to accept it fear\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nStern Menelaus first the silence broke,\r\nAnd, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen of Greece! O scandal of your race,\r\nWhose coward souls your manly form disgrace,\r\nHow great the shame, when every age shall know\r\nThat not a Grecian met this noble foe!\r\nGo then! resolve to earth, from whence ye grew,\r\nA heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew!\r\nBe what ye seem, unanimated clay,\r\nMyself will dare the danger of the day;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis man\xe2\x80\x99s bold task the generous strife to try,\r\nBut in the hands of God is victory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nHis manly limbs in azure arms he dress\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nThat day, Atrides! a superior hand\r\nHad stretch\xe2\x80\x99d thee breathless on the hostile strand;\r\nBut all at once, thy fury to compose,\r\nThe kings of Greece, an awful band, arose;\r\nEven he their chief, great Agamemnon, press\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThy daring hand, and this advice address\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither, O Menelaus! wouldst thou run,\r\nAnd tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?\r\nGrieved though thou art, forbear the rash design;\r\nGreat Hector\xe2\x80\x99s arm is mightier far than thine:\r\nEven fierce Achilles learn\xe2\x80\x99d its force to fear,\r\nAnd trembling met this dreadful son of war.\r\nSit thou secure, amidst thy social band;\r\nGreece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.\r\nThe mightiest warrior of the Achaian name,\r\nThough bold and burning with desire of fame,\r\nContent the doubtful honour might forego,\r\nSo great the danger, and so brave the foe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said, and turn\xe2\x80\x99d his brother\xe2\x80\x99s vengeful mind;\r\nHe stoop\xe2\x80\x99d to reason, and his rage resign\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nNo longer bent to rush on certain harms;\r\nHis joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.\r\n\r\nHe from whose lips divine persuasion flows,\r\nGrave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose;\r\nThus to the kings he spoke: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat grief, what shame\r\nAttend on Greece, and all the Grecian name!\r\nHow shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn\r\nTheir sons degenerate, and their race a scorn!\r\nWhat tears shall down thy silvery beard be roll\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nO Peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!\r\nOnce with what joy the generous prince would hear\r\nOf every chief who fought this glorious war,\r\nParticipate their fame, and pleased inquire\r\nEach name, each action, and each hero\xe2\x80\x99s sire!\r\nGods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,\r\nAnd trembling all before one hostile hand;\r\nHow would he lift his aged arms on high,\r\nLament inglorious Greece, and beg to die!\r\nOh! would to all the immortal powers above,\r\nMinerva, Phoebus, and almighty Jove!\r\nYears might again roll back, my youth renew,\r\nAnd give this arm the spring which once it knew\r\nWhen fierce in war, where Jardan\xe2\x80\x99s waters fall,\r\nI led my troops to Phea\xe2\x80\x99s trembling wall,\r\nAnd with the Arcadian spears my prowess tried,\r\nWhere Celadon rolls down his rapid tide.179\r\nThere Ereuthalion braved us in the field,\r\nProud Areithous\xe2\x80\x99 dreadful arms to wield;\r\nGreat Areithous, known from shore to shore\r\nBy the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore;\r\nNo lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,\r\nBut broke, with this, the battle of the foe.\r\nHim not by manly force Lycurgus slew,\r\nWhose guileful javelin from the thicket flew,\r\nDeep in a winding way his breast assailed,\r\nNor aught the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s thundering mace avail\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nSupine he fell: those arms which Mars before\r\nHad given the vanquish\xe2\x80\x99d, now the victor bore:\r\nBut when old age had dimm\xe2\x80\x99d Lycurgus\xe2\x80\x99 eyes,\r\nTo Ereuthalion he consign\xe2\x80\x99d the prize.\r\nFurious with this he crush\xe2\x80\x99d our levell\xe2\x80\x99d bands,\r\nAnd dared the trial of the strongest hands;\r\nNor could the strongest hands his fury stay:\r\nAll saw, and fear\xe2\x80\x99d, his huge tempestuous sway\r\nTill I, the youngest of the host, appear\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd, youngest, met whom all our army fear\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nI fought the chief: my arms Minerva crown\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nProne fell the giant o\xe2\x80\x99er a length of ground.\r\nWhat then I was, O were your Nestor now!\r\nNot Hector\xe2\x80\x99s self should want an equal foe.\r\nBut, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,\r\nThe flower of Greece, the examples of our host,\r\nSprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,\r\nCan you stand trembling, and desert the day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;\r\nAnd nine, the noblest of the Grecian name,\r\nUp-started fierce: but far before the rest\r\nThe king of men advanced his dauntless breast:\r\nThen bold Tydides, great in arms, appear\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nAnd next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nOileus follow\xe2\x80\x99d; Idomen was there,180\r\nAnd Merion, dreadful as the god of war:\r\nWith these Eurypylus and Thoas stand,\r\nAnd wise Ulysses closed the daring band.\r\nAll these, alike inspired with noble rage,\r\nDemand the fight. To whom the Pylian sage:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLest thirst of glory your brave souls divide,\r\nWhat chief shall combat, let the gods decide.\r\nWhom heaven shall choose, be his the chance to raise\r\nHis country\xe2\x80\x99s fame, his own immortal praise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lots produced, each hero signs his own:\r\nThen in the general\xe2\x80\x99s helm the fates are thrown,181\r\nThe people pray, with lifted eyes and hands,\r\nAnd vows like these ascend from all the bands:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrant, thou Almighty! in whose hand is fate,\r\nA worthy champion for the Grecian state:\r\nThis task let Ajax or Tydides prove,\r\nOr he, the king of kings, beloved by Jove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nOld Nestor shook the casque. By heaven inspired,\r\nLeap\xe2\x80\x99d forth the lot, of every Greek desired.\r\nThis from the right to left the herald bears,\r\nHeld out in order to the Grecian peers;\r\nEach to his rival yields the mark unknown,\r\nTill godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;\r\nSurveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,\r\nThen casts before him, and with transport cries:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarriors! I claim the lot, and arm with joy;\r\nBe mine the conquest of this chief of Troy.\r\nNow while my brightest arms my limbs invest,\r\nTo Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s son be all your vows address\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nBut pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,\r\nAnd deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.\r\nSaid I in secret? No, your vows declare\r\nIn such a voice as fills the earth and air,\r\nLives there a chief whom Ajax ought to dread?\r\nAjax, in all the toils of battle bred!\r\nFrom warlike Salamis I drew my birth,\r\nAnd, born to combats, fear no force on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said. The troops with elevated eyes,\r\nImplore the god whose thunder rends the skies:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO father of mankind, superior lord!\r\nOn lofty Ida\xe2\x80\x99s holy hill adored:\r\nWho in the highest heaven hast fix\xe2\x80\x99d thy throne,\r\nSupreme of gods! unbounded and alone:\r\nGrant thou, that Telamon may bear away\r\nThe praise and conquest of this doubtful day;\r\nOr, if illustrious Hector be thy care,\r\nThat both may claim it, and that both may share.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;\r\nSheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:\r\nHe moves to combat with majestic pace;\r\nSo stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace,182\r\nWhen Jove to punish faithless men prepares,\r\nAnd gives whole nations to the waste of wars,\r\nThus march\xe2\x80\x99d the chief, tremendous as a god;\r\nGrimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:183\r\nHis massy javelin quivering in his hand,\r\nHe stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band.\r\nThrough every Argive heart new transport ran;\r\nAll Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:\r\nEven Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nFelt his great heart suspended in his breast:\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;\r\nHimself had challenged, and the foe drew near.\r\n\r\nStern Telamon behind his ample shield,\r\nAs from a brazen tower, o\xe2\x80\x99erlook\xe2\x80\x99d the field.\r\nHuge was its orb, with seven thick folds o\xe2\x80\x99ercast,\r\nOf tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last,\r\n(The work of Tychius, who in Hyle dwell\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nAnd in all arts of armoury excell\xe2\x80\x99d,)\r\nThis Ajax bore before his manly breast,\r\nAnd, threatening, thus his adverse chief address\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHector! approach my arm, and singly know\r\nWhat strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe.\r\nAchilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,\r\nNot void of soul, and not unskill\xe2\x80\x99d in war:\r\nLet him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,\r\nIndulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;\r\nWhole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,\r\nAnd sends thee one, a sample of her host,\r\nSuch as I am, I come to prove thy might;\r\nNo more\xe2\x80\x94be sudden, and begin the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO son of Telamon, thy country\xe2\x80\x99s pride!\r\n(To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)\r\nMe, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,\r\nNew to the field, and trembling at the fight?\r\nThou meet\xe2\x80\x99st a chief deserving of thy arms,\r\nTo combat born, and bred amidst alarms:\r\nI know to shift my ground, remount the car,\r\nTurn, charge, and answer every call of war;\r\nTo right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,\r\nAnd bear thick battle on my sounding shield/\r\nBut open be our fight, and bold each blow;\r\nI steal no conquest from a noble foe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said, and rising, high above the field\r\nWhirl\xe2\x80\x99d the long lance against the sevenfold shield.\r\nFull on the brass descending from above\r\nThrough six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,\r\nTill in the seventh it fix\xe2\x80\x99d. Then Ajax threw;\r\nThrough Hector\xe2\x80\x99s shield the forceful javelin flew,\r\nHis corslet enters, and his garment rends,\r\nAnd glancing downwards, near his flank descends.\r\nThe wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low\r\nBeneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.\r\nFrom their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,\r\nThen close impetuous, and the charge renew;\r\nFierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,\r\nOr foaming boars, the terror of the wood.\r\nAt Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;\r\nThe blunted point against the buckler bends;\r\nBut Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,\r\nDrove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;\r\nIt reach\xe2\x80\x99d his neck, with matchless strength impell\xe2\x80\x99d!\r\nSpouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.\r\nYet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,\r\nIn his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,\r\nBlack, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;\r\nFull on the brazen boss the stone descends;\r\nThe hollow brass resounded with the shock:\r\nThen Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,\r\nApplied each nerve, and swinging round on high,\r\nWith force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;\r\nThe huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:\r\nHis slacken\xe2\x80\x99d knees received the numbing stroke;\r\nGreat Hector falls extended on the field,\r\nHis bulk supporting on the shatter\xe2\x80\x99d shield:\r\nNor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo\xe2\x80\x99s might\r\nConfirm\xe2\x80\x99d his sinews, and restored to fight.\r\nAnd now both heroes their broad falchions drew\r\nIn flaming circles round their heads they flew;\r\nBut then by heralds\xe2\x80\x99 voice the word was given.\r\nThe sacred ministers of earth and heaven:\r\nDivine Talthybius, whom the Greeks employ,\r\nAnd sage Idaeus on the part of Troy,\r\nBetween the swords their peaceful sceptres rear\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nAnd first Idaeus\xe2\x80\x99 awful voice was heard:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HECTOR AND AJAX SEPARATED BY THE HERALDS.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForbear, my sons! your further force to prove,\r\nBoth dear to men, and both beloved of Jove.\r\nTo either host your matchless worth is known,\r\nEach sounds your praise, and war is all your own.\r\nBut now the Night extends her awful shade;\r\nThe goddess parts you; be the night obey\xe2\x80\x99d.\xe2\x80\x9d184\r\n\r\nTo whom great Ajax his high soul express\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO sage! to Hector be these words address\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nLet him, who first provoked our chiefs to fight,\r\nLet him demand the sanction of the night;\r\nIf first he ask\xe2\x80\x99d it, I content obey,\r\nAnd cease the strife when Hector shows the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO first of Greeks!

The generous Greek bestow\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nA radiant belt that rich with purple glow\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nThen with majestic grace they quit the plain;\r\nThis seeks the Grecian, that the Phrygian train.\r\n\r\nThe Trojan bands returning Hector wait,\r\nAnd hail with joy the Champion of their state;\r\nEscaped great Ajax, they survey him round,\r\nAlive, unarm\xe2\x80\x99d, and vigorous from his wound;\r\nTo Troy\xe2\x80\x99s high gates the godlike man they bear\r\nTheir present triumph, as their late despair.\r\n\r\nBut Ajax, glorying in his hardy deed,\r\nThe well-arm\xe2\x80\x99d Greeks to Agamemnon lead.\r\nA steer for sacrifice the king design\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nOf full five years, and of the nobler kind.\r\nThe victim falls; they strip the smoking hide,\r\nThe beast they quarter, and the joints divide;\r\nThen spread the tables, the repast prepare,\r\nEach takes his seat, and each receives his share.\r\nThe king himself (an honorary sign)\r\nBefore great Ajax placed the mighty chine.185\r\nWhen now the rage of hunger was removed,\r\nNestor, in each persuasive art approved,\r\nThe sage whose counsels long had sway\xe2\x80\x99d the rest,\r\nIn words like these his prudent thought express\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dear, O kings! this fatal day has cost,\r\nWhat Greeks are perish\xe2\x80\x99d! what a people lost!\r\nWhat tides of blood have drench\xe2\x80\x99d Scamander\xe2\x80\x99s shore!\r\nWhat crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more!\r\nThen hear me, chief! nor let the morrow\xe2\x80\x99s light\r\nAwake thy squadrons to new toils of fight:\r\nSome space at least permit the war to breathe,\r\nWhile we to flames our slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d friends bequeath,\r\nFrom the red field their scatter\xe2\x80\x99d bodies bear,\r\nAnd nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear;\r\nSo decent urns their snowy bones may keep,\r\nAnd pious children o\xe2\x80\x99er their ashes weep.\r\nHere, where on one promiscuous pile they blazed,\r\nHigh o\xe2\x80\x99er them all a general tomb be raised;\r\nNext, to secure our camp and naval powers,\r\nRaise an embattled wall, with lofty towers;\r\nFrom space to space be ample gates around,\r\nFor passing chariots; and a trench profound.\r\nSo Greece to combat shall in safety go,\r\nNor fear the fierce incursions of the foe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved;\r\nThe sceptred kings of Greece his words approved.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, convened at Priam\xe2\x80\x99s palace-gate,\r\nThe Trojan peers in nightly council sate;\r\nA senate void of order, as of choice:\r\nTheir hearts were fearful, and confused their voice.\r\nAntenor, rising, thus demands their ear:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliars, hear!\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires,\r\nAnd I but move what every god requires:\r\nLet Sparta\xe2\x80\x99s treasures be this hour restored,\r\nAnd Argive Helen own her ancient lord.\r\nThe ties of faith, the sworn alliance, broke,\r\nOur impious battles the just gods provoke.\r\nAs this advice ye practise, or reject,\r\nSo hope success, or dread the dire effect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe senior spoke and sate. To whom replied\r\nThe graceful husband of the Spartan bride:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCold counsels, Trojan, may become thy years\r\nBut sound ungrateful in a warrior\xe2\x80\x99s ears:\r\nOld man, if void of fallacy or art,\r\nThy words express the purpose of thy heart,\r\nThou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given;\r\nBut wisdom has its date, assign\xe2\x80\x99d by heaven.\r\nThen hear me, princes of the Trojan name!\r\nTheir treasures I\xe2\x80\x99ll restore, but not the dame;\r\nMy treasures too, for peace, I will resign;\r\nBut be this bright possession ever mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas then, the growing discord to compose,\r\nSlow from his seat the reverend Priam rose:\r\nHis godlike aspect deep attention drew:\r\nHe paused, and these pacific words ensue:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliar bands!\r\nNow take refreshment as the hour demands;\r\nGuard well the walls, relieve the watch of night.\r\nTill the new sun restores the cheerful light.\r\nThen shall our herald, to the Atrides sent,\r\nBefore their ships proclaim my son\xe2\x80\x99s intent.\r\nNext let a truce be ask\xe2\x80\x99d, that Troy may burn\r\nHer slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d heroes, and their bones inurn;\r\nThat done, once more the fate of war be tried,\r\nAnd whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe monarch spoke: the warriors snatch\xe2\x80\x99d with haste\r\n(Each at his post in arms) a short repast.\r\nSoon as the rosy morn had waked the day,\r\nTo the black ships Idaeus bent his way;\r\nThere, to the sons of Mars, in council found,\r\nHe raised his voice: the host stood listening round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe sons of Atreus, and ye Greeks, give ear!\r\nThe words of Troy, and Troy\xe2\x80\x99s great monarch, hear.\r\nPleased may ye hear (so heaven succeed my prayers)\r\nWhat Paris, author of the war, declares.\r\nThe spoils and treasures he to Ilion bore\r\n(Oh had he perish\xe2\x80\x99d ere they touch\xe2\x80\x99d our shore!)\r\nHe proffers injured Greece: with large increase\r\nOf added Trojan wealth to buy the peace.\r\nBut to restore the beauteous bride again,\r\nThis Greece demands, and Troy requests in vain.\r\nNext, O ye chiefs! we ask a truce to burn\r\nOur slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d heroes, and their bones inurn.\r\nThat done, once more the fate of war be tried,\r\nAnd whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Greeks gave ear, but none the silence broke;\r\nAt length Tydides rose, and rising spoke:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, take not, friends! defrauded of your fame,\r\nTheir proffer\xe2\x80\x99d wealth, nor even the Spartan dame.\r\nLet conquest make them ours: fate shakes their wall,\r\nAnd Troy already totters to her fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe admiring chiefs, and all the Grecian name,\r\nWith general shouts return\xe2\x80\x99d him loud acclaim.\r\nThen thus the king of kings rejects the peace:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerald! in him thou hear\xe2\x80\x99st the voice of Greece\r\nFor what remains; let funeral flames be fed\r\nWith heroes\xe2\x80\x99 corps: I war not with the dead:\r\nGo search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain,\r\nAnd gratify the manes of the slain.\r\nBe witness, Jove, whose thunder rolls on high!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe said, and rear\xe2\x80\x99d his sceptre to the sky.\r\n\r\nTo sacred Troy, where all her princes lay\r\nTo wait the event, the herald bent his way.\r\nHe came, and standing in the midst, explain\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe peace rejected, but the truce obtain\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nStraight to their several cares the Trojans move,\r\nSome search the plains, some fell the sounding grove:\r\nNor less the Greeks, descending on the shore,\r\nHew\xe2\x80\x99d the green forests, and the bodies bore.\r\nAnd now from forth the chambers of the main,\r\nTo shed his sacred light on earth again,\r\nArose the golden chariot of the day,\r\nAnd tipp\xe2\x80\x99d the mountains with a purple ray.\r\nIn mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train\r\nThrough heaps of carnage search\xe2\x80\x99d the mournful plain.\r\nScarce could the friend his slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d friend explore,\r\nWith dust dishonour\xe2\x80\x99d, and deformed with gore.\r\nThe wounds they wash\xe2\x80\x99d, their pious tears they shed,\r\nAnd, laid along their cars, deplored the dead.\r\nSage Priam check\xe2\x80\x99d their grief: with silent haste\r\nThe bodies decent on the piles were placed:\r\nWith melting hearts the cold remains they burn\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd, sadly slow, to sacred Troy return\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nNor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed,\r\nAnd decent on the pile dispose the dead;\r\nThe cold remains consume with equal care;\r\nAnd slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair.\r\nNow, ere the morn had streak\xe2\x80\x99d with reddening light\r\nThe doubtful confines of the day and night,\r\nAbout the dying flames the Greeks appear\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd round the pile a general tomb they rear\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nThen, to secure the camp and naval powers,\r\nThey raised embattled walls with lofty towers:186\r\nFrom space to space were ample gates around,\r\nFor passing chariots, and a trench profound\r\nOf large extent; and deep in earth below,\r\nStrong piles infix\xe2\x80\x99d stood adverse to the foe.\r\n\r\nSo toil\xe2\x80\x99d the Greeks: meanwhile the gods above,\r\nIn shining circle round their father Jove,\r\nAmazed beheld the wondrous works of man:\r\nThen he, whose trident shakes the earth, began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mortals henceforth shall our power adore,\r\nOur fanes frequent, our oracles implore,\r\nIf the proud Grecians thus successful boast\r\nTheir rising bulwarks on the sea-beat coast?\r\nSee the long walls extending to the main,\r\nNo god consulted, and no victim slain!\r\nTheir fame shall fill the world\xe2\x80\x99s remotest ends,\r\nWide as the morn her golden beam extends;\r\nWhile old Laomedon\xe2\x80\x99s divine abodes,\r\nThose radiant structures raised by labouring gods,\r\nShall, razed and lost, in long oblivion sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.\r\n\r\nThe almighty Thunderer with a frown replies,\r\nThat clouds the world, and blackens half the skies:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrong god of ocean! thou, whose rage can make\r\nThe solid earth\xe2\x80\x99s eternal basis shake!\r\nWhat cause of fear from mortal works could move187\r\nThe meanest subject of our realms above?\r\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99er the sun\xe2\x80\x99s refulgent rays are cast,\r\nThy power is honour\xe2\x80\x99d, and thy fame shall last.\r\nBut yon proud work no future age shall view,\r\nNo trace remain where once the glory grew.\r\nThe sapp\xe2\x80\x99d foundations by thy force shall fall,\r\nAnd, whelm\xe2\x80\x99d beneath the waves, drop the huge wall:\r\nVast drifts of sand shall change the former shore:\r\nThe ruin vanish\xe2\x80\x99d, and the name no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus they in heaven: while, o\xe2\x80\x99er the Grecian train,\r\nThe rolling sun descending to the main\r\nBeheld the finish\xe2\x80\x99d work. Their bulls they slew;\r\nBack from the tents the savoury vapour flew.\r\nAnd now the fleet, arrived from Lemnos\xe2\x80\x99 strands,\r\nWith Bacchus\xe2\x80\x99 blessings cheered the generous bands.\r\nOf fragrant wines the rich Eunaeus sent\r\nA thousant measures to the royal tent.\r\n(Eunaeus, whom Hypsipyle of yore\r\nTo Jason, shepherd of his people, bore,)\r\nThe rest they purchased at their proper cost,\r\nAnd well the plenteous freight supplied the host:\r\nEach, in exchange, proportion\xe2\x80\x99d treasures gave;188\r\nSome, brass or iron; some, an ox, or slave.\r\nAll night they feast, the Greek and Trojan powers:\r\nThose on the fields, and these within their towers.\r\nBut Jove averse the signs of wrath display\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade:\r\nHumbled they stood; pale horror seized on all,\r\nWhile the deep thunder shook the aerial hall.\r\nEach pour\xe2\x80\x99d to Jove before the bowl was crown\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nAnd large libations drench\xe2\x80\x99d the thirsty ground:\r\nThen late, refresh\xe2\x80\x99d with sleep from toils of fight,\r\nEnjoy\xe2\x80\x99d the balmy blessings of the night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREEK AMPHORA\xe2\x80\x94WINE VESSELS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BATTLE, AND THE DISTRESS OF THE GREEKS.\r\n\r\nJupiter assembles a council of the deities, and threatens them with the\r\npains of Tartarus if they assist either side: Minerva only obtains of\r\nhim that she may direct the Greeks by her counsels. The armies join\r\nbattle: Jupiter on Mount Ida weighs in his balances the fates of both,\r\nand affrights the Greeks with his thunders and lightnings. Nestor alone\r\ncontinues in the field in great danger: Diomed relieves him; whose\r\nexploits, and those of Hector, are excellently described. Juno\r\nendeavours to animate Neptune to the assistance of the Greeks, but in\r\nvain. The acts of Teucer, who is at length wounded by Hector, and\r\ncarried off. Juno and Minerva prepare to aid the Grecians, but are\r\nrestrained by Iris, sent from Jupiter. The night puts an end to the\r\nbattle. Hector continues in the field, (the Greeks being driven to\r\ntheir fortifications before the ships,) and gives orders to keep the\r\nwatch all night in the camp, to prevent the enemy from re-embarking and\r\nescaping by flight. They kindle fires through all the fields, and pass\r\nthe night under arms.\r\n\r\nThe time of seven and twenty days is employed from the opening of the\r\npoem to the end of this book. The scene here (except of the celestial\r\nmachines) lies in the field towards the seashore.\r\n\r\nAurora now, fair daughter of the dawn,\r\nSprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn;\r\nWhen Jove convened the senate of the skies,\r\nWhere high Olympus\xe2\x80\x99 cloudy tops arise,\r\nThe sire of gods his awful silence broke;\r\nThe heavens attentive trembled as he spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelestial states! immortal gods! give ear,\r\nHear our decree, and reverence what ye hear;\r\nThe fix\xe2\x80\x99d decree which not all heaven can move;\r\nThou, fate! fulfil it! and, ye powers, approve!\r\nWhat god but enters yon forbidden field,\r\nWho yields assistance, or but wills to yield,\r\nBack to the skies with shame he shall be driven,\r\nGash\xe2\x80\x99d with dishonest wounds, the scorn of heaven;\r\nOr far, oh far, from steep Olympus thrown,\r\nLow in the dark Tartarean gulf shall groan,\r\nWith burning chains fix\xe2\x80\x99d to the brazen floors,\r\nAnd lock\xe2\x80\x99d by hell\xe2\x80\x99s inexorable doors;\r\nAs deep beneath the infernal centre hurl\xe2\x80\x99d,190\r\nAs from that centre to the ethereal world.\r\nLet him who tempts me, dread those dire abodes:\r\nAnd know, the Almighty is the god of gods.\r\nLeague all your forces, then, ye powers above,\r\nJoin all, and try the omnipotence of Jove.\r\nLet down our golden everlasting chain191\r\nWhose strong embrace holds heaven, and earth, and main\r\nStrive all, of mortal and immortal birth,\r\nTo drag, by this, the Thunderer down to earth:\r\nYe strive in vain! if I but stretch this hand,\r\nI heave the gods, the ocean, and the land;\r\nI fix the chain to great Olympus\xe2\x80\x99 height,\r\nAnd the vast world hangs trembling in my sight!\r\nFor such I reign, unbounded and above;\r\nAnd such are men, and gods, compared to Jove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe all-mighty spoke, nor durst the powers reply:\r\nA reverend horror silenced all the sky;\r\nTrembling they stood before their sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s look;\r\nAt length his best-beloved, the power of wisdom, spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO first and greatest! God, by gods adored\r\nWe own thy might, our father and our lord!\r\nBut, ah! permit to pity human state:\r\nIf not to help, at least lament their fate.\r\nFrom fields forbidden we submiss refrain,\r\nWith arms unaiding mourn our Argives slain;\r\nYet grant my counsels still their breasts may move,\r\nOr all must perish in the wrath of Jove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cloud-compelling god her suit approved,\r\nAnd smiled superior on his best beloved;\r\nThen call\xe2\x80\x99d his coursers, and his chariot took;\r\nThe stedfast firmament beneath them shook:\r\nRapt by the ethereal steeds the chariot roll\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nBrass were their hoofs, their curling manes of gold:\r\nOf heaven\xe2\x80\x99s undrossy gold the gods array,\r\nRefulgent, flash\xe2\x80\x99d intolerable day.\r\nHigh on the throne he shines: his coursers fly\r\nBetween the extended earth and starry sky.\r\nBut when to Ida\xe2\x80\x99s topmost height he came,\r\n(Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game,)\r\nWhere o\xe2\x80\x99er her pointed summits proudly raised,\r\nHis fane breathed odours, and his altar blazed:\r\nThere, from his radiant car, the sacred sire\r\nOf gods and men released the steeds of fire:\r\nBlue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced;\r\nHigh on the cloudy point his seat he placed;\r\nThence his broad eye the subject world surveys,\r\nThe town, and tents, and navigable seas.\r\n\r\nNow had the Grecians snatch\xe2\x80\x99d a short repast,\r\nAnd buckled on their shining arms with haste.\r\nTroy roused as soon; for on this dreadful day\r\nThe fate of fathers, wives, and infants lay.\r\nThe gates unfolding pour forth all their train;\r\nSquadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain:\r\nMen, steeds, and chariots shake the trembling ground,\r\nThe tumult thickens, and the skies resound;\r\nAnd now with shouts the shocking armies closed,\r\nTo lances lances, shields to shields opposed,\r\nHost against host with shadowy legends drew,\r\nThe sounding darts in iron tempests flew;\r\nVictors and vanquish\xe2\x80\x99d join promiscuous cries,\r\nTriumphant shouts and dying groans arise;\r\nWith streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,\r\nAnd slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d heroes swell the dreadful tide.\r\nLong as the morning beams, increasing bright,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er heaven\xe2\x80\x99s clear azure spread the sacred light,\r\nCommutual death the fate of war confounds,\r\nEach adverse battle gored with equal wounds.\r\nBut when the sun the height of heaven ascends,\r\nThe sire of gods his golden scales suspends,192\r\nWith equal hand: in these explored the fate\r\nOf Greece and Troy, and poised the mighty weight:\r\nPress\xe2\x80\x99d with its load, the Grecian balance lies\r\nLow sunk on earth, the Trojan strikes the skies.\r\nThen Jove from Ida\xe2\x80\x99s top his horrors spreads;\r\nThe clouds burst dreadful o\xe2\x80\x99er the Grecian heads;\r\nThick lightnings flash; the muttering thunder rolls;\r\nTheir strength he withers, and unmans their souls.\r\nBefore his wrath the trembling hosts retire;\r\nThe gods in terrors, and the skies on fire.\r\nNor great Idomeneus that sight could bear,\r\nNor each stern Ajax, thunderbolts of war:\r\nNor he, the king of war, the alarm sustain\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nNestor alone, amidst the storm remain\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nUnwilling he remain\xe2\x80\x99d, for Paris\xe2\x80\x99 dart\r\nHad pierced his courser in a mortal part;\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d in the forehead, where the springing mane\r\nCurl\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er the brow, it stung him to the brain;\r\nMad with his anguish, he begins to rear,\r\nPaw with his hoofs aloft, and lash the air.\r\nScarce had his falchion cut the reins, and freed\r\nThe encumber\xe2\x80\x99d chariot from the dying steed,\r\nWhen dreadful Hector, thundering through the war,\r\nPour\xe2\x80\x99d to the tumult on his whirling car.\r\nThat day had stretch\xe2\x80\x99d beneath his matchless hand\r\nThe hoary monarch of the Pylian band,\r\nBut Diomed beheld; from forth the crowd\r\nHe rush\xe2\x80\x99d, and on Ulysses call\xe2\x80\x99d aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither, oh whither does Ulysses run?\r\nOh, flight unworthy great Laertes\xe2\x80\x99 son!\r\nMix\xe2\x80\x99d with the vulgar shall thy fate be found,\r\nPierced in the back, a vile, dishonest wound?\r\nOh turn and save from Hector\xe2\x80\x99s direful rage\r\nThe glory of the Greeks, the Pylian sage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHis fruitless words are lost unheard in air,\r\nUlysses seeks the ships, and shelters there.\r\nBut bold Tydides to the rescue goes,\r\nA single warrior midst a host of foes;\r\nBefore the coursers with a sudden spring\r\nHe leap\xe2\x80\x99d, and anxious thus bespoke the king:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat perils, father! wait the unequal fight;\r\nThese younger champions will oppress thy might.\r\nThy veins no more with ancient vigour glow,\r\nWeak is thy servant, and thy coursers slow.\r\nThen haste, ascend my seat, and from the car\r\nObserve the steeds of Tros, renown\xe2\x80\x99d in war.\r\nPractised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,\r\nTo dare the fight, or urge the rapid race:\r\nThese late obey\xe2\x80\x99d \xc3\x86neas\xe2\x80\x99 guiding rein;\r\nLeave thou thy chariot to our faithful train;\r\nWith these against yon Trojans will we go,\r\nNor shall great Hector want an equal foe;\r\nFierce as he is, even he may learn to fear\r\nThe thirsty fury of my flying spear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus said the chief; and Nestor, skill\xe2\x80\x99d in war,\r\nApproves his counsel, and ascends the car:\r\nThe steeds he left, their trusty servants hold;\r\nEurymedon, and Sthenelus the bold:\r\nThe reverend charioteer directs the course,\r\nAnd strains his aged arm to lash the horse.\r\nHector they face; unknowing how to fear,\r\nFierce he drove on; Tydides whirl\xe2\x80\x99d his spear.\r\nThe spear with erring haste mistook its way,\r\nBut plunged in Eniopeus\xe2\x80\x99 bosom lay.\r\nHis opening hand in death forsakes the rein;\r\nThe steeds fly back: he falls, and spurns the plain.\r\nGreat Hector sorrows for his servant kill\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nYet unrevenged permits to press the field;\r\nTill, to supply his place and rule the car,\r\nRose Archeptolemus, the fierce in war.\r\nAnd now had death and horror cover\xe2\x80\x99d all;193\r\nLike timorous flocks the Trojans in their wall\r\nInclosed had bled: but Jove with awful sound\r\nRoll\xe2\x80\x99d the big thunder o\xe2\x80\x99er the vast profound:\r\nFull in Tydides\xe2\x80\x99 face the lightning flew;\r\nThe ground before him flamed with sulphur blue;\r\nThe quivering steeds fell prostrate at the sight;\r\nAnd Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s trembling hand confess\xe2\x80\x99d his fright:\r\nHe dropp\xe2\x80\x99d the reins: and, shook with sacred dread,\r\nThus, turning, warn\xe2\x80\x99d the intrepid Diomed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO chief!

The weapon flies\r\nAt Hector\xe2\x80\x99s breast, and sings along the skies:\r\nHe miss\xe2\x80\x99d the mark; but pierced Gorgythio\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\nAnd drench\xe2\x80\x99d in royal blood the thirsty dart.\r\n(Fair Castianira, nymph of form divine,\r\nThis offspring added to king Priam\xe2\x80\x99s line.)\r\nAs full-blown poppies, overcharged with rain,196\r\nDecline the head, and drooping kiss the plain;\r\nSo sinks the youth: his beauteous head, depress\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nBeneath his helmet, drops upon his breast.\r\nAnother shaft the raging archer drew,\r\nThat other shaft with erring fury flew,\r\n(From Hector, Phoebus turn\xe2\x80\x99d the flying wound,)\r\nYet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground:\r\nThy breast, brave Archeptolemus! it tore,\r\nAnd dipp\xe2\x80\x99d its feathers in no vulgar gore.\r\nHeadlong he falls: his sudden fall alarms\r\nThe steeds, that startle at his sounding arms.\r\nHector with grief his charioteer beheld\r\nAll pale and breathless on the sanguine field:\r\nThen bids Cebriones direct the rein,\r\nQuits his bright car, and issues on the plain.\r\nDreadful he shouts: from earth a stone he took,\r\nAnd rush\xe2\x80\x99d on Teucer with the lifted rock.\r\nThe youth already strain\xe2\x80\x99d the forceful yew;\r\nThe shaft already to his shoulder drew;\r\nThe feather in his hand, just wing\xe2\x80\x99d for flight,\r\nTouch\xe2\x80\x99d where the neck and hollow chest unite;\r\nThere, where the juncture knits the channel bone,\r\nThe furious chief discharged the craggy stone:\r\nThe bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow,\r\nAnd his numb\xe2\x80\x99d hand dismiss\xe2\x80\x99d his useless bow.\r\nHe fell: but Ajax his broad shield display\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd screen\xe2\x80\x99d his brother with the mighty shade;\r\nTill great Alaster, and Mecistheus, bore\r\nThe batter\xe2\x80\x99d archer groaning to the shore.\r\n\r\nTroy yet found grace before the Olympian sire,\r\nHe arm\xe2\x80\x99d their hands, and fill\xe2\x80\x99d their breasts with fire.\r\nThe Greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall,\r\nOr in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.\r\nFirst of the foe, great Hector march\xe2\x80\x99d along,\r\nWith terror clothed, and more than mortal strong.\r\nAs the bold hound, that gives the lion chase,\r\nWith beating bosom, and with eager pace,\r\nHangs on his haunch, or fastens on his heels,\r\nGuards as he turns, and circles as he wheels;\r\nThus oft the Grecians turn\xe2\x80\x99d, but still they flew;\r\nThus following, Hector still the hindmost slew.\r\nWhen flying they had pass\xe2\x80\x99d the trench profound,\r\nAnd many a chief lay gasping on the ground;\r\nBefore the ships a desperate stand they made,\r\nAnd fired the troops, and called the gods to aid.\r\nFierce on his rattling chariot Hector came:\r\nHis eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame\r\nThat wither\xe2\x80\x99d all their host: like Mars he stood:\r\nDire as the monster, dreadful as the god!\r\nTheir strong distress the wife of Jove survey\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThen pensive thus, to war\xe2\x80\x99s triumphant maid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO daughter of that god, whose arm can wield\r\nThe avenging bolt, and shake the sable shield!\r\nNow, in this moment of her last despair,\r\nShall wretched Greece no more confess our care,\r\nCondemn\xe2\x80\x99d to suffer the full force of fate,\r\nAnd drain the dregs of heaven\xe2\x80\x99s relentless hate?\r\nGods! shall one raging hand thus level all?\r\nWhat numbers fell! what numbers yet shall fall!\r\nWhat power divine shall Hector\xe2\x80\x99s wrath assuage?\r\nStill swells the slaughter, and still grows the rage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spake the imperial regent of the skies;\r\nTo whom the goddess with the azure eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong since had Hector stain\xe2\x80\x99d these fields with gore,\r\nStretch\xe2\x80\x99d by some Argive on his native shore:\r\nBut he above, the sire of heaven, withstands,\r\nMocks our attempts, and slights our just demands;\r\nThe stubborn god, inflexible and hard,\r\nForgets my service and deserved reward:\r\nSaved I, for this, his favourite son distress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nBy stern Eurystheus with long labours press\xe2\x80\x99d?\r\nHe begg\xe2\x80\x99d, with tears he begg\xe2\x80\x99d, in deep dismay;\r\nI shot from heaven, and gave his arm the day.\r\nOh had my wisdom known this dire event,\r\nWhen to grim Pluto\xe2\x80\x99s gloomy gates he went;\r\nThe triple dog had never felt his chain,\r\nNor Styx been cross\xe2\x80\x99d, nor hell explored in vain.\r\nAverse to me of all his heaven of gods,\r\nAt Thetis\xe2\x80\x99 suit the partial Thunderer nods;\r\nTo grace her gloomy, fierce, resenting son,\r\nMy hopes are frustrate, and my Greeks undone.\r\nSome future day, perhaps, he may be moved\r\nTo call his blue-eyed maid his best beloved.\r\nHaste, launch thy chariot, through yon ranks to ride;\r\nMyself will arm, and thunder at thy side.\r\nThen, goddess! say, shall Hector glory then?\r\n(That terror of the Greeks, that man of men)\r\nWhen Juno\xe2\x80\x99s self, and Pallas shall appear,\r\nAll dreadful in the crimson walks of war!\r\nWhat mighty Trojan then, on yonder shore,\r\nExpiring, pale, and terrible no more,\r\nShall feast the fowls, and glut the dogs with gore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ceased, and Juno rein\xe2\x80\x99d the steeds with care:\r\n(Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s awful empress, Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s other heir:)\r\nPallas, meanwhile, her various veil unbound,\r\nWith flowers adorn\xe2\x80\x99d, with art immortal

on her ample breast.\r\nThe vigorous power the trembling car ascends:\r\nShook by her arm, the massy javelin bends:\r\nHuge, ponderous, strong! that when her fury burns\r\nProud tyrants humbles, and

or unfold, the eternal gates of day\r\nBar heaven with clouds, or roll those clouds away.\r\nThe sounding hinges ring, the clouds divide.\r\nProne down the steep of heaven their course they guide.\r\nBut Jove, incensed, from Ida\xe2\x80\x99s top survey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd thus enjoin\xe2\x80\x99d the many-colour\xe2\x80\x99d maid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUNO AND MINERVA GOING TO ASSIST

eternal Thunderer sat, enthroned in gold.\r\nHigh heaven the footstool of his feet he makes,\r\nAnd wide beneath him all Olympus shakes.\r\nTrembling afar the offending powers appear\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nConfused and silent, for his frown they fear\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nHe saw their soul, and thus his word imparts:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPallas and Juno! say, why heave your hearts?\r\nSoon was your battle o\xe2\x80\x99er: proud Troy retired\r\nBefore your face, and in your wrath expired.\r\nBut know, whoe\xe2\x80\x99er almighty power withstand!\r\nUnmatch\xe2\x80\x99d our force, unconquer\xe2\x80\x99d is our hand:\r\nWho shall the sovereign of the skies control?\r\nNot all the gods that crown the starry pole.\r\nYour hearts shall tremble, if our arms we take,\r\nAnd each immortal nerve with horror shake.\r\nFor thus I speak, and what I speak shall stand;\r\nWhat power soe\xe2\x80\x99er provokes our lifted hand,\r\nOn this our hill no more shall hold his place;\r\nCut off, and exiled from the ethereal race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJuno and Pallas grieving hear the doom,\r\nBut feast their souls on Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s woes to come.\r\nThough secret anger swell\xe2\x80\x99d Minerva\xe2\x80\x99s breast,\r\nThe prudent goddess yet her wrath repress\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nBut Juno, impotent of rage, replies:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat hast thou said, O tyrant of the skies!\r\nStrength and omnipotence invest thy throne;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis thine to punish; ours to grieve alone.\r\nFor Greece we grieve, abandon\xe2\x80\x99d by her fate\r\nTo drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate.\r\nFrom fields forbidden we submiss refrain,\r\nWith arms unaiding see our Argives slain;\r\nYet grant our counsels still their breasts may move,\r\nLest all should perish in the rage of Jove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe goddess thus; and thus the god replies,\r\nWho swells the clouds, and blackens all the skies:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe morning sun, awaked by loud alarms,\r\nShall see the almighty Thunderer in arms.\r\nWhat heaps of Argives then shall load the plain,\r\nThose radiant eyes shall view, and view in vain.\r\nNor shall great Hector cease the rage of fight,\r\nThe navy flaming, and thy Greeks in flight,\r\nEven till the day when certain fates ordain\r\nThat stern Achilles (his Patroclus slain)\r\nShall rise in vengeance, and lay waste the plain.\r\nFor such is fate, nor canst thou turn its course\r\nWith all thy rage, with all thy rebel force.\r\nFly, if thy wilt, to earth\xe2\x80\x99s remotest bound,\r\nWhere on her utmost verge the seas resound;\r\nWhere cursed Iapetus and Saturn dwell,\r\nFast by the brink, within the streams of hell;\r\nNo sun e\xe2\x80\x99er gilds the gloomy horrors there;\r\nNo cheerful gales refresh the lazy air:\r\nThere arm once more the bold Titanian band;\r\nAnd arm in vain; for what I will, shall stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow deep in ocean sunk the lamp of light,\r\nAnd drew behind the cloudy veil of night:\r\nThe conquering Trojans mourn his beams decay\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThe Greeks rejoicing bless the friendly shade.\r\n\r\nThe victors keep the field; and Hector calls\r\nA martial council near the navy walls;\r\nThese to Scamander\xe2\x80\x99s bank apart he led,\r\nWhere thinly scatter\xe2\x80\x99d lay the heaps of dead.\r\nThe assembled chiefs, descending on the ground,\r\nAttend his order, and their prince surround.\r\nA massy spear he bore of mighty strength,\r\nOf full ten cubits was the lance\xe2\x80\x99s length;\r\nThe point was brass, refulgent to behold,\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d to the wood with circling rings of gold:\r\nThe noble Hector on his lance reclined,\r\nAnd, bending forward, thus reveal\xe2\x80\x99d his mind:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe valiant Trojans, with attention hear!\r\nYe Dardan bands, and generous aids, give ear!\r\nThis day, we hoped, would wrap in conquering flame\r\nGreece with her ships, and crown our toils with fame.\r\nBut darkness now, to save the cowards, falls,\r\nAnd guards them trembling in their wooden walls.\r\nObey the night, and use her peaceful hours\r\nOur steeds to forage, and refresh our powers.\r\nStraight from the town be sheep and oxen sought,\r\nAnd strengthening bread and generous wine be brought.\r\nWide o\xe2\x80\x99er the field, high blazing to the sky,\r\nLet numerous fires the absent sun supply,\r\nThe flaming piles with plenteous fuel raise,\r\nTill the bright morn her purple beam displays;\r\nLest, in the silence and the shades of night,\r\nGreece on her sable ships attempt her flight.\r\nNot unmolested let the wretches gain\r\nTheir lofty decks, or safely cleave the main;\r\nSome hostile wound let every dart bestow,\r\nSome lasting token of the Phrygian foe,\r\nWounds, that long hence may ask their spouses\xe2\x80\x99 care.\r\nAnd warn their children from a Trojan war.\r\nNow through the circuit of our Ilion wall,\r\nLet sacred heralds sound the solemn call;\r\nTo bid the sires with hoary honours crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd beardless youths, our battlements surround.\r\nFirm be the guard, while distant lie our powers,\r\nAnd let the matrons hang with lights the towers;\r\nLest, under covert of the midnight shade,\r\nThe insidious foe the naked town invade.\r\nSuffice, to-night, these orders to obey;\r\nA nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day.\r\nThe gods, I trust, shall give to Hector\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\nFrom these detested foes to free the land,\r\nWho plough\xe2\x80\x99d, with fates averse, the watery way:\r\nFor Trojan vultures a predestined prey.\r\nOur common safety must be now the care;\r\nBut soon as morning paints the fields of air,\r\nSheathed in bright arms let every troop engage,\r\nAnd the fired fleet behold the battle rage.\r\nThen, then shall Hector and Tydides prove\r\nWhose fates are heaviest in the scales of Jove.\r\nTo-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s light (O haste the glorious morn!)\r\nShall see his bloody spoils in triumph borne,\r\nWith this keen javelin shall his breast be gored,\r\nAnd prostrate heroes bleed around their lord.\r\nCertain as this, oh! might my days endure,\r\nFrom age inglorious, and black death secure;\r\nSo might my life and glory know no bound,\r\nLike Pallas worshipp\xe2\x80\x99d, like the sun renown\xe2\x80\x99d!\r\nAs the next dawn, the last they shall enjoy,\r\nShall crush the Greeks, and end the woes of Troy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe leader spoke. From all his host around\r\nShouts of applause along the shores resound.\r\nEach from the yoke the smoking steeds untied,\r\nAnd fix\xe2\x80\x99d their headstalls to his chariot-side.\r\nFat sheep and oxen from the town are led,\r\nWith generous wine, and all-sustaining bread,\r\nFull hecatombs lay burning on the shore:\r\nThe winds to heaven the curling vapours bore.\r\nUngrateful offering to the immortal powers!197\r\nWhose wrath hung heavy o\xe2\x80\x99er the Trojan towers:\r\nNor Priam nor his sons obtain\xe2\x80\x99d their grace;\r\nProud Troy they hated, and her guilty race.\r\n\r\nThe troops exulting sat in order round,\r\nAnd beaming fires illumined all the ground.\r\nAs when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,198\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er heaven\xe2\x80\x99s pure azure spreads her sacred light,\r\nWhen not a breath disturbs the deep serene,\r\nAnd not a cloud o\xe2\x80\x99ercasts the solemn scene,\r\nAround her throne the vivid planets roll,\r\nAnd stars unnumber\xe2\x80\x99d gild the glowing pole,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,\r\nAnd tip with silver every mountain\xe2\x80\x99s head:\r\nThen shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,\r\nA flood of glory bursts from all the skies:\r\nThe conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight,\r\nEye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.\r\nSo many flames before proud Ilion blaze,\r\nAnd lighten glimmering Xanthus with their rays.\r\nThe long reflections of the distant fires\r\nGleam on the walls, and tremble on the spires.\r\nA thousand piles the dusky horrors gild,\r\nAnd shoot a shady lustre o\xe2\x80\x99er the field.\r\nFull fifty guards each flaming pile attend,\r\nWhose umber\xe2\x80\x99d arms, by fits, thick flashes send,\r\nLoud neigh the coursers o\xe2\x80\x99er their heaps of corn,\r\nAnd ardent warriors wait the rising morn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SHIELD OF ACHILLES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nTHE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.\r\n\r\nAgamemnon, after the last day\xe2\x80\x99s defeat, proposes to the Greeks to quit\r\nthe siege, and return to their country. Diomed opposes this, and Nestor\r\nseconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard to\r\nbe strengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what measures are\r\nto be followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, and\r\nNestor further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in\r\norder to move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice\r\nof, who are accompanied by old Phoenix. They make, each of them, very\r\nmoving and pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by\r\nAchilles, who notwithstanding retains Phoenix in his tent. The\r\nambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake\r\nthemselves to sleep.\r\n\r\nThis book, and the next following, take up the space of one night,\r\nwhich is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem. The scene\r\nlies on the sea-shore, the station of the Grecian ships.\r\n\r\nThus joyful Troy maintain\xe2\x80\x99d the watch of night;\r\nWhile fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,199\r\nAnd heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,\r\nSat on each face, and sadden\xe2\x80\x99d every heart.\r\nAs from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,\r\nA double tempest of the west and north\r\nSwells o\xe2\x80\x99er the sea, from Thracia\xe2\x80\x99s frozen shore,\r\nHeaps waves on waves, and bids the \xc3\x86gean roar:\r\nThis way and that the boiling deeps are toss\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nSuch various passions urged the troubled host,\r\nGreat Agamemnon grieved above the rest;\r\nSuperior sorrows swell\xe2\x80\x99d his royal breast;\r\nHimself his orders to the heralds bears,\r\nTo bid to council all the Grecian peers,\r\nBut bid in whispers: these surround their chief,\r\nIn solemn sadness and majestic grief.\r\nThe king amidst the mournful circle rose:\r\nDown his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.\r\nSo silent fountains, from a rock\xe2\x80\x99s tall head,\r\nIn sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.\r\nWith more than vulgar grief he stood oppress\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nWords, mix\xe2\x80\x99d with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe sons of Greece! partake your leader\xe2\x80\x99s care;\r\nFellows in arms and princes of the war!\r\nOf partial Jove too justly we complain,\r\nAnd heavenly oracles believed in vain.\r\nA safe return was promised to our toils,\r\nWith conquest honour\xe2\x80\x99d and enrich\xe2\x80\x99d with spoils:\r\nNow shameful flight alone can save the host;\r\nOur wealth, our people, and our glory lost.\r\nSo Jove decrees, almighty lord of all!\r\nJove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall,\r\nWho shakes the feeble props of human trust,\r\nAnd towers and armies humbles to the dust.\r\nHaste then, for ever quit these fatal fields,\r\nHaste to the joys our native country yields;\r\nSpread all your canvas, all your oars employ,\r\nNor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: deep silence held the Grecian band;\r\nSilent, unmov\xe2\x80\x99d in dire dismay they stand;\r\nA pensive scene! till Tydeus\xe2\x80\x99 warlike son\r\nRoll\xe2\x80\x99d on the king his eyes, and thus begun:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen kings advise us to renounce our fame,\r\nFirst let him speak who first has suffer\xe2\x80\x99d shame.\r\nIf I oppose thee, prince! thy wrath withhold,\r\nThe laws of council bid my tongue be bold.\r\nThou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight,\r\nDurst brand my courage, and defame my might:\r\nNor from a friend the unkind reproach appear\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe Greeks stood witness, all our army heard.\r\nThe gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring,\r\nThe gods have made thee but by halves a king:\r\nThey gave thee sceptres, and a wide command;\r\nThey gave dominion o\xe2\x80\x99er the seas and land;\r\nThe noblest power that might the world control\r\nThey gave thee not\xe2\x80\x94a brave and virtuous soul.\r\nIs this a general\xe2\x80\x99s voice, that would suggest\r\nFears like his own to every Grecian breast?\r\nConfiding in our want of worth, he stands;\r\nAnd if we fly, \xe2\x80\x99tis what our king commands.\r\nGo thou, inglorious! from the embattled plain;\r\nShips thou hast store, and nearest to the main;\r\nA noble care the Grecians shall employ,\r\nTo combat, conquer, and extirpate Troy.\r\nHere Greece shall stay; or, if all Greece retire,\r\nMyself shall stay, till Troy or I expire;\r\nMyself, and Sthenelus, will fight for fame;\r\nGod bade us fight, and \xe2\x80\x99twas with God we came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ceased; the Greeks loud acclamations raise,\r\nAnd voice to voice resounds Tydides\xe2\x80\x99 praise.\r\nWise Nestor then his reverend figure rear\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nHe spoke: the host in still attention heard:200\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO truly great! in whom the gods have join\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nSuch strength of body with such force of mind:\r\nIn conduct, as in courage, you excel,\r\nStill first to act what you advise so well.\r\nThese wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves,\r\nApplauding Greece with common voice approves.\r\nKings thou canst blame; a bold but prudent youth:\r\nAnd blame even kings with praise, because with truth.\r\nAnd yet those years that since thy birth have run\r\nWould hardly style thee Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s youngest son.\r\nThen let me add what yet remains behind,\r\nA thought unfinish\xe2\x80\x99d in that generous mind;\r\nAge bids me speak! nor shall the advice I bring\r\nDistaste the people, or offend the king:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCursed is the man, and void of law and right,\r\nUnworthy property, unworthy light,\r\nUnfit for public rule, or private care,\r\nThat wretch, that monster, who delights in war;\r\nWhose lust is murder, and whose horrid joy,\r\nTo tear his country, and his kind destroy!\r\nThis night, refresh and fortify thy train;\r\nBetween the trench and wall let guards remain:\r\nBe that the duty of the young and bold;\r\nBut thou, O king, to council call the old;\r\nGreat is thy sway, and weighty are thy cares;\r\nThy high commands must spirit all our wars.\r\nWith Thracian wines recruit thy honour\xe2\x80\x99d guests,\r\nFor happy counsels flow from sober feasts.\r\nWise, weighty counsels aid a state distress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd such a monarch as can choose the best.\r\nSee what a blaze from hostile tents aspires,\r\nHow near our fleet approach the Trojan fires!\r\nWho can, unmoved, behold the dreadful light?\r\nWhat eye beholds them, and can close to-night?\r\nThis dreadful interval determines all;\r\nTo-morrow, Troy must flame, or Greece must fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus spoke the hoary sage: the rest obey;\r\nSwift through the gates the guards direct their way.\r\nHis son was first to pass the lofty mound,\r\nThe generous Thrasymed, in arms renown\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nNext him, Ascalaphus, Ialmen, stood,\r\nThe double offspring of the warrior-god:\r\nDeipyrus, Aphareus, Merion join,\r\nAnd Lycomed of Creon\xe2\x80\x99s noble line.\r\nSeven were the leaders of the nightly bands,\r\nAnd each bold chief a hundred spears commands.\r\nThe fires they light, to short repasts they fall,\r\nSome line the trench, and others man the wall.\r\n\r\nThe king of men, on public counsels bent,\r\nConvened the princes in his ample tent,\r\nEach seized a portion of the kingly feast,\r\nBut stay\xe2\x80\x99d his hand when thirst and hunger ceased.\r\nThen Nestor spoke, for wisdom long approved,\r\nAnd slowly rising, thus the council moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonarch of nations! whose superior sway\r\nAssembled states, and lords of earth obey,\r\nThe laws and sceptres to thy hand are given,\r\nAnd millions own the care of thee and Heaven.\r\nO king! the counsels of my age attend;\r\nWith thee my cares begin, with thee must end.\r\nThee, prince! it fits alike to speak and hear,\r\nPronounce with judgment, with regard give ear,\r\nTo see no wholesome motion be withstood,\r\nAnd ratify the best for public good.\r\nNor, though a meaner give advice, repine,\r\nBut follow it, and make the wisdom thine.\r\nHear then a thought, not now conceived in haste,\r\nAt once my present judgment and my past.\r\nWhen from Pelides\xe2\x80\x99 tent you forced the maid,\r\nI first opposed, and faithful, durst dissuade;\r\nBut bold of soul, when headlong fury fired,\r\nYou wronged the man, by men and gods admired:\r\nNow seek some means his fatal wrath to end,\r\nWith prayers to move him, or with gifts to bend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo whom the king. \xe2\x80\x9cWith justice hast thou shown\r\nA prince\xe2\x80\x99s faults, and I with reason own.\r\nThat happy man, whom Jove still honours most,\r\nIs more than armies, and himself a host.\r\nBless\xe2\x80\x99d in his love, this wondrous hero stands;\r\nHeaven fights his war, and humbles all our bands.\r\nFain would my heart, which err\xe2\x80\x99d through frantic rage,\r\nThe wrathful chief and angry gods assuage.\r\nIf gifts immense his mighty soul can bow,201\r\nHear, all ye Greeks, and witness what I vow.\r\nTen weighty talents of the purest gold,\r\nAnd twice ten vases of refulgent mould:\r\nSeven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame\r\nYet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;\r\nTwelve steeds unmatch\xe2\x80\x99d in fleetness and in force,\r\nAnd still victorious in the dusty course;\r\n(Rich were the man whose ample stores exceed\r\nThe prizes purchased by their winged speed;)\r\nSeven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,\r\nSkill\xe2\x80\x99d in each art, unmatch\xe2\x80\x99d in form divine,\r\nThe same I chose for more than vulgar charms,\r\nWhen Lesbos sank beneath the hero\xe2\x80\x99s arms:\r\nAll these, to buy his friendship, shall be paid,\r\nAnd join\xe2\x80\x99d with these the long-contested maid;\r\nWith all her charms, Briseis I resign,\r\nAnd solemn swear those charms were never mine;\r\nUntouch\xe2\x80\x99d she stay\xe2\x80\x99d, uninjured she removes,\r\nPure from my arms, and guiltless of my loves,202\r\nThese instant shall be his; and if the powers\r\nGive to our arms proud Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s hostile towers,\r\nThen shall he store (when Greece the spoil divides)\r\nWith gold and brass his loaded navy\xe2\x80\x99s sides:\r\nBesides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race\r\nWith copious love shall crown his warm embrace,\r\nSuch as himself will choose; who yield to none,\r\nOr yield to Helen\xe2\x80\x99s heavenly charms alone.\r\nYet hear me further: when our wars are o\xe2\x80\x99er,\r\nIf safe we land on Argos\xe2\x80\x99 fruitful shore,\r\nThere shall he live my son, our honours share,\r\nAnd with Orestes\xe2\x80\x99 self divide my care.\r\nYet more\xe2\x80\x94three daughters in my court are bred,\r\nAnd each well worthy of a royal bed;\r\nLaodice and Iphigenia fair,203\r\nAnd bright Chrysothemis with golden hair;\r\nHer let him choose whom most his eyes approve,\r\nI ask no presents, no reward for love:\r\nMyself will give the dower; so vast a store\r\nAs never father gave a child before.\r\nSeven ample cities shall confess his sway,\r\nHim Enope, and Pherae him obey,\r\nCardamyle with ample turrets crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd sacred Pedasus for vines renown\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\n\xc3\x86pea fair, the pastures Hira yields,\r\nAnd rich Antheia with her flowery fields:204\r\nThe whole extent to Pylos\xe2\x80\x99 sandy plain,\r\nAlong the verdant margin of the main.\r\nThere heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;\r\nBold are the men, and generous is the soil;\r\nThere shall he reign, with power and justice crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd rule the tributary realms around.\r\nAll this I give, his vengeance to control,\r\nAnd sure all this may move his mighty soul.\r\nPluto, the grisly god, who never spares,\r\nWho feels no mercy, and who hears no prayers,\r\nLives dark and dreadful in deep hell\xe2\x80\x99s abodes,\r\nAnd mortals hate him, as the worst of gods.\r\nGreat though he be, it fits him to obey,\r\nSince more than his my years, and more my sway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLUTO.]\r\n\r\nThe monarch thus. The reverend Nestor then:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Agamemnon! glorious king of men!\r\nSuch are thy offers as a prince may take,\r\nAnd such as fits a generous king to make.\r\nLet chosen delegates this hour be sent\r\n(Myself will name them) to Pelides\xe2\x80\x99 tent.\r\nLet Phoenix lead, revered for hoary age,\r\nGreat Ajax next, and Ithacus the sage.\r\nYet more to sanctify the word you send,\r\nLet Hodius and Eurybates attend.\r\nNow pray to Jove to grant what Greece demands;\r\nPray in deep silence,205 and with purest hands.\xe2\x80\x9d206\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.]\r\n\r\nHe said; and all approved. The heralds bring\r\nThe cleansing water from the living spring.\r\nThe youth with wine the sacred goblets crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd large libations drench\xe2\x80\x99d the sands around.\r\nThe rite perform\xe2\x80\x99d, the chiefs their thirst allay,\r\nThen from the royal tent they take their way;\r\nWise Nestor turns on each his careful eye,\r\nForbids to offend, instructs them to apply;\r\nMuch he advised them all, Ulysses most,\r\nTo deprecate the chief, and save the host.\r\nThrough the still night they march, and hear the roar\r\nOf murmuring billows on the sounding shore.\r\nTo Neptune, ruler of the seas profound,\r\nWhose liquid arms the mighty globe surround,\r\nThey pour forth vows, their embassy to bless,\r\nAnd calm the rage of stern \xc3\x86acides.\r\nAnd now, arrived, where on the sandy bay\r\nThe Myrmidonian tents and vessels lay;\r\nAmused at ease, the godlike man they found,\r\nPleased with the solemn harp\xe2\x80\x99s harmonious sound.\r\n(The well wrought harp from conquered Thebae came;\r\nOf polish\xe2\x80\x99d silver was its costly frame.)\r\nWith this he soothes his angry soul, and sings\r\nThe immortal deeds of heroes and of kings.\r\nPatroclus only of the royal train,\r\nPlaced in his tent, attends the lofty strain:\r\nFull opposite he sat, and listen\xe2\x80\x99d long,\r\nIn silence waiting till he ceased the song.\r\nUnseen the Grecian embassy proceeds\r\nTo his high tent; the great Ulysses leads.\r\nAchilles starting, as the chiefs he spied,\r\nLeap\xe2\x80\x99d from his seat, and laid the harp aside.\r\nWith like surprise arose Menoetius\xe2\x80\x99 son:\r\nPelides grasp\xe2\x80\x99d their hands, and thus begun:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrinces, all hail! whatever brought you here.\r\nOr strong necessity, or urgent fear;\r\nWelcome, though Greeks! for not as foes ye came;\r\nTo me more dear than all that bear the name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, the chiefs beneath his roof he led,\r\nAnd placed in seats with purple carpets spread.\r\nThen thus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cPatroclus, crown a larger bowl,\r\nMix purer wine, and open every soul.\r\nOf all the warriors yonder host can send,\r\nThy friend most honours these, and these thy friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: Patroclus o\xe2\x80\x99er the blazing fire\r\nHeaps in a brazen vase three chines entire:\r\nThe brazen vase Automedon sustains,\r\nWhich flesh of porker, sheep, and goat contains.\r\nAchilles at the genial feast presides,\r\nThe parts transfixes, and with skill divides.\r\nMeanwhile Patroclus sweats, the fire to raise;\r\nThe tent is brighten\xe2\x80\x99d with the rising blaze:\r\nThen, when the languid flames at length subside,\r\nHe strows a bed of glowing embers wide,\r\nAbove the coals the smoking fragments turns\r\nAnd sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns;\r\nWith bread the glittering canisters they load,\r\nWhich round the board Menoetius\xe2\x80\x99 son bestow\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nHimself, opposed to Ulysses full in sight,\r\nEach portion parts, and orders every rite.\r\nThe first fat offering to the immortals due,\r\nAmidst the greedy flames Patroclus threw;\r\nThen each, indulging in the social feast,\r\nHis thirst and hunger soberly repress\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nThat done, to Phoenix Ajax gave the sign:\r\nNot unperceived; Ulysses crown\xe2\x80\x99d with wine\r\nThe foaming bowl, and instant thus began,\r\nHis speech addressing to the godlike man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHealth to Achilles! happy are thy guests!\r\nNot those more honour\xe2\x80\x99d whom Atrides feasts:\r\nThough generous plenty crown thy loaded boards,\r\nThat, Agamemnon\xe2\x80\x99s regal tent affords;\r\nBut greater cares sit heavy on our souls,\r\nNor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls.\r\nWhat scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear!\r\nThe dead we mourn, and for the living fear;\r\nGreece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands,\r\nAnd owns no help but from thy saving hands:\r\nTroy and her aids for ready vengeance call;\r\nTheir threatening tents already shade our wall:\r\nHear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim,\r\nAnd point at every ship their vengeful flame!\r\nFor them the father of the gods declares,\r\nTheirs are his omens, and his thunder theirs.\r\nSee, full of Jove, avenging Hector rise!\r\nSee! heaven and earth the raging chief defies;\r\nWhat fury in his breast, what lightning in his eyes!\r\nHe waits but for the morn, to sink in flame\r\nThe ships, the Greeks, and all the Grecian name.\r\nHeavens! how my country\xe2\x80\x99s woes distract my mind,\r\nLest Fate accomplish all his rage design\xe2\x80\x99d!\r\nAnd must we, gods! our heads inglorious lay\r\nIn Trojan dust, and this the fatal day?\r\nReturn, Achilles: oh return, though late,\r\nTo save thy Greeks, and stop the course of Fate;\r\nIf in that heart or grief or courage lies,\r\nRise to redeem; ah, yet to conquer, rise!\r\nThe day may come, when, all our warriors slain,\r\nThat heart shall melt, that courage rise in vain:\r\nRegard in time, O prince divinely brave!\r\nThose wholesome counsels which thy father gave.\r\nWhen Peleus in his aged arms embraced\r\nHis parting son, these accents were his last:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My child! with strength, with glory, and success,\r\nThy arms may Juno and Minerva bless!\r\nTrust that to Heaven: but thou, thy cares engage\r\nTo calm thy passions, and subdue thy rage:\r\nFrom gentler manners let thy glory grow,\r\nAnd shun contention, the sure source of woe;\r\nThat young and old may in thy praise combine,\r\nThe virtues of humanity be thine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThis now-despised advice thy father gave;\r\nAh! check thy anger; and be truly brave.\r\nIf thou wilt yield to great Atrides\xe2\x80\x99 prayers,\r\nGifts worthy thee his royal hand prepares;\r\nIf not\xe2\x80\x94but hear me, while I number o\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nThe proffer\xe2\x80\x99d presents, an exhaustless store.\r\nTen weighty talents of the purest gold,\r\nAnd twice ten vases of refulgent mould;\r\nSeven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame\r\nYet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;\r\nTwelve steeds unmatched in fleetness and in force,\r\nAnd still victorious in the dusty course;\r\n(Rich were the man, whose ample stores exceed\r\nThe prizes purchased by their winged speed;)\r\nSeven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,\r\nSkill\xe2\x80\x99d in each art, unmatch\xe2\x80\x99d in form divine,\r\nThe same he chose for more than vulgar charms,\r\nWhen Lesbos sank beneath thy conquering arms.\r\nAll these, to buy thy friendship shall be paid,\r\nAnd, join\xe2\x80\x99d with these, the long-contested maid;\r\nWith all her charms, Briseis he\xe2\x80\x99ll resign,\r\nAnd solemn swear those charms were only thine;\r\nUntouch\xe2\x80\x99d she stay\xe2\x80\x99d, uninjured she removes,\r\nPure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.\r\nThese instant shall be thine; and if the powers\r\nGive to our arms proud Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s hostile towers,\r\nThen shalt thou store (when Greece the spoil divides)\r\nWith gold and brass thy loaded navy\xe2\x80\x99s sides.\r\nBesides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race\r\nWith copious love shall crown thy warm embrace;\r\nSuch as thyself shall chose; who yield to none,\r\nOr yield to Helen\xe2\x80\x99s heavenly charms alone.\r\nYet hear me further: when our wars are o\xe2\x80\x99er,\r\nIf safe we land on Argos\xe2\x80\x99 fruitful shore,\r\nThere shalt thou live his son, his honour share,\r\nAnd with Orestes\xe2\x80\x99 self divide his care.\r\nYet more\xe2\x80\x94three daughters in his court are bred,\r\nAnd each well worthy of a royal bed:\r\nLaodice and Iphigenia fair,\r\nAnd bright Chrysothemis with golden hair:\r\nHer shalt thou wed whom most thy eyes approve;\r\nHe asks no presents, no reward for love:\r\nHimself will give the dower; so vast a store\r\nAs never father gave a child before.\r\nSeven ample cities shall confess thy sway,\r\nThe Enope and Pherae thee obey,\r\nCardamyle with ample turrets crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd sacred Pedasus, for vines renown\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\xc3\x86pea fair, the pastures Hira yields,\r\nAnd rich Antheia with her flowery fields;\r\nThe whole extent to Pylos\xe2\x80\x99 sandy plain,\r\nAlong the verdant margin of the main.\r\nThere heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;\r\nBold are the men, and generous is the soil.\r\nThere shalt thou reign, with power and justice crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd rule the tributary realms around.\r\nSuch are the proffers which this day we bring,\r\nSuch the repentance of a suppliant king.\r\nBut if all this, relentless, thou disdain,\r\nIf honour and if interest plead in vain,\r\nYet some redress to suppliant Greece afford,\r\nAnd be, amongst her guardian gods, adored.\r\nIf no regard thy suffering country claim,\r\nHear thy own glory, and the voice of fame:\r\nFor now that chief, whose unresisted ire\r\nMade nations tremble, and whole hosts retire,\r\nProud Hector, now, the unequal fight demands,\r\nAnd only triumphs to deserve thy hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen thus the goddess-born: \xe2\x80\x9cUlysses, hear\r\nA faithful speech, that knows nor art nor fear;\r\nWhat in my secret soul is understood,\r\nMy tongue shall utter, and my deeds make good.\r\nLet Greece then know, my purpose I retain:\r\nNor with new treaties vex my peace in vain.\r\nWho dares think one thing, and another tell,\r\nMy heart detests him as the gates of hell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen thus in short my fix\xe2\x80\x99d resolves attend,\r\nWhich nor Atrides nor his Greeks can bend;\r\nLong toils, long perils in their cause I bore,\r\nBut now the unfruitful glories charm no more.\r\nFight or not fight, a like reward we claim,\r\nThe wretch and hero find their prize the same.\r\nAlike regretted in the dust he lies,\r\nWho yields ignobly, or who bravely dies.\r\nOf all my dangers, all my glorious pains,\r\nA life of labours, lo! what fruit remains?\r\nAs the bold bird her helpless young attends,\r\nFrom danger guards them, and from want defends;\r\nIn search of prey she wings the spacious air,\r\nAnd with the untasted food supplies her care:\r\nFor thankless Greece such hardships have I braved,\r\nHer wives, her infants, by my labours saved;\r\nLong sleepless nights in heavy arms I stood,\r\nAnd sweat laborious days in dust and blood.\r\nI sack\xe2\x80\x99d twelve ample cities on the main,207\r\nAnd twelve lay smoking on the Trojan plain:\r\nThen at Atrides\xe2\x80\x99 haughty feet were laid\r\nThe wealth I gathered, and the spoils I made.\r\nYour mighty monarch these in peace possess\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nSome few my soldiers had, himself the rest.\r\nSome present, too, to every prince was paid;\r\nAnd every prince enjoys the gift he made:\r\nI only must refund, of all his train;\r\nSee what pre-eminence our merits gain!\r\nMy spoil alone his greedy soul delights:\r\nMy spouse alone must bless his lustful nights:\r\nThe woman, let him (as he may) enjoy;\r\nBut what\xe2\x80\x99s the quarrel, then, of Greece to Troy?\r\nWhat to these shores the assembled nations draws,\r\nWhat calls for vengeance but a woman\xe2\x80\x99s cause?\r\nAre fair endowments and a beauteous face\r\nBeloved by none but those of Atreus\xe2\x80\x99 race?\r\nThe wife whom choice and passion doth approve,\r\nSure every wise and worthy man will love.\r\nNor did my fair one less distinction claim;\r\nSlave as she was, my soul adored the dame.\r\nWrong\xe2\x80\x99d in my love, all proffers I disdain;\r\nDeceived for once, I trust not kings again.\r\nYe have my answer\xe2\x80\x94what remains to do,\r\nYour king, Ulysses, may consult with you.\r\nWhat needs he the defence this arm can make?\r\nHas he not walls no human force can shake?\r\nHas he not fenced his guarded navy round\r\nWith piles, with ramparts, and a trench profound?\r\nAnd will not these (the wonders he has done)\r\nRepel the rage of Priam\xe2\x80\x99s single son?\r\nThere was a time (\xe2\x80\x99twas when for Greece I fought)\r\nWhen Hector\xe2\x80\x99s prowess no such wonders wrought;\r\nHe kept the verge of Troy, nor dared to wait\r\nAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 fury at the Scaean gate;\r\nHe tried it once, and scarce was saved by fate.\r\nBut now those ancient enmities are o\xe2\x80\x99er;\r\nTo-morrow we the favouring gods implore;\r\nThen shall you see our parting vessels crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd hear with oars the Hellespont resound.\r\nThe third day hence shall Pythia greet our sails,208\r\nIf mighty Neptune send propitious gales;\r\nPythia to her Achilles shall restore\r\nThe wealth he left for this detested shore:\r\nThither the spoils of this long war shall pass,\r\nThe ruddy gold, the steel, and shining brass:\r\nMy beauteous captives thither I\xe2\x80\x99ll convey,\r\nAnd all that rests of my unravish\xe2\x80\x99d prey.\r\nOne only valued gift your tyrant gave,\r\nAnd that resumed\xe2\x80\x94the fair Lyrnessian slave.\r\nThen tell him: loud, that all the Greeks may hear,\r\nAnd learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear;\r\n(For arm\xe2\x80\x99d in impudence, mankind he braves,\r\nAnd meditates new cheats on all his slaves;\r\nThough shameless as he is, to face these eyes\r\nIs what he dares not: if he dares he dies;)\r\nTell him, all terms, all commerce I decline,\r\nNor share his council, nor his battle join;\r\nFor once deceiv\xe2\x80\x99d, was his; but twice were mine,\r\nNo\xe2\x80\x94let the stupid prince, whom Jove deprives\r\nOf sense and justice, run where frenzy drives;\r\nHis gifts are hateful: kings of such a kind\r\nStand but as slaves before a noble mind,\r\nNot though he proffer\xe2\x80\x99d all himself possess\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd all his rapine could from others wrest:\r\nNot all the golden tides of wealth that crown\r\nThe many-peopled Orchomenian town;209\r\nNot all proud Thebes\xe2\x80\x99 unrivall\xe2\x80\x99d walls contain,\r\nThe world\xe2\x80\x99s great empress on the Egyptian plain\r\n(That spreads her conquests o\xe2\x80\x99er a thousand states,\r\nAnd pours her heroes through a hundred gates,\r\nTwo hundred horsemen and two hundred cars\r\nFrom each wide portal issuing to the wars);210\r\nThough bribes were heap\xe2\x80\x99d on bribes, in number more\r\nThan dust in fields, or sands along the shore;\r\nShould all these offers for my friendship call,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis he that offers, and I scorn them all.\r\nAtrides\xe2\x80\x99 daughter never shall be led\r\n(An ill-match\xe2\x80\x99d consort) to Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 bed;\r\nLike golden Venus though she charm\xe2\x80\x99d the heart,\r\nAnd vied with Pallas in the works of art;\r\nSome greater Greek let those high nuptials grace,\r\nI hate alliance with a tyrant\xe2\x80\x99s race.\r\nIf heaven restore me to my realms with life,\r\nThe reverend Peleus shall elect my wife;\r\nThessalian nymphs there are of form divine,\r\nAnd kings that sue to mix their blood with mine.\r\nBless\xe2\x80\x99d in kind love, my years shall glide away,\r\nContent with just hereditary sway;\r\nThere, deaf for ever to the martial strife,\r\nEnjoy the dear prerogative of life.\r\nLife is not to be bought with heaps of gold.\r\nNot all Apollo\xe2\x80\x99s Pythian treasures hold,\r\nOr Troy once held, in peace and pride of sway,\r\nCan bribe the poor possession of a day!\r\nLost herds and treasures we by arms regain,\r\nAnd steeds unrivall\xe2\x80\x99d on the dusty plain:\r\nBut from our lips the vital spirit fled,\r\nReturns no more to wake the silent dead.\r\nMy fates long since by Thetis were disclosed,\r\nAnd each alternate, life or fame, proposed;\r\nHere, if I stay, before the Trojan town,\r\nShort is my date, but deathless my renown:\r\nIf I return, I quit immortal praise\r\nFor years on years, and long-extended days.\r\nConvinced, though late, I find my fond mistake,\r\nAnd warn the Greeks the wiser choice to make;\r\nTo quit these shores, their native seats enjoy,\r\nNor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.\r\nJove\xe2\x80\x99s arm display\xe2\x80\x99d asserts her from the skies!\r\nHer hearts are strengthen\xe2\x80\x99d, and her glories rise.\r\nGo then to Greece, report our fix\xe2\x80\x99d design;\r\nBid all your counsels, all your armies join,\r\nLet all your forces, all your arts conspire,\r\nTo save the ships, the troops, the chiefs, from fire.\r\nOne stratagem has fail\xe2\x80\x99d, and others will:\r\nYe find, Achilles is unconquer\xe2\x80\x99d still.\r\nGo then\xe2\x80\x94digest my message as ye may\xe2\x80\x94\r\nBut here this night let reverend Phoenix stay:\r\nHis tedious toils and hoary hairs demand\r\nA peaceful death in Pythia\xe2\x80\x99s friendly land.\r\nBut whether he remain or sail with me,\r\nHis age be sacred, and his will be free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREEK GALLEY.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Peleus ceased: the chiefs around\r\nIn silence wrapt, in consternation drown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAttend the stern reply. Then Phoenix rose;\r\n(Down his white beard a stream of sorrow flows;)\r\nAnd while the fate of suffering Greece he mourn\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWith accent weak these tender words return\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROSERPINE.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDivine Achilles! wilt thou then retire,\r\nAnd leave our hosts in blood, our fleets on fire?\r\nIf wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind,\r\nHow shall thy friend, thy Phoenix, stay behind?\r\nThe royal Peleus, when from Pythia\xe2\x80\x99s coast\r\nHe sent thee early to the Achaian host;\r\nThy youth as then in sage debates unskill\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd new to perils of the direful field:\r\nHe bade me teach thee all the ways of war,\r\nTo shine in councils, and in camps to dare.\r\nNever, ah, never let me leave thy side!\r\nNo time shall part us, and no fate divide,\r\nNot though the god, that breathed my life, restore\r\nThe bloom I boasted, and the port I bore,\r\nWhen Greece of old beheld my youthful flames\r\n(Delightful Greece, the land of lovely dames),\r\nMy father faithless to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms,\r\nOld as he was, adored a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s charms.\r\nI tried what youth could do (at her desire)\r\nTo win the damsel, and prevent my sire.\r\nMy sire with curses loads my hated head,\r\nAnd cries, \xe2\x80\x98Ye furies! barren be his bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nInfernal Jove, the vengeful fiends below,\r\nAnd ruthless Proserpine, confirm\xe2\x80\x99d his vow.\r\nDespair and grief distract my labouring mind!\r\nGods! what a crime my impious heart design\xe2\x80\x99d!\r\nI thought (but some kind god that thought suppress\xe2\x80\x99d)\r\nTo plunge the poniard in my father\xe2\x80\x99s breast;\r\nThen meditate my flight: my friends in vain\r\nWith prayers entreat me, and with force detain.\r\nOn fat of rams, black bulls, and brawny swine,\r\nThey daily feast, with draughts of fragrant wine;\r\nStrong guards they placed, and watch\xe2\x80\x99d nine nights entire;\r\nThe roofs and porches flamed with constant fire.\r\nThe tenth, I forced the gates, unseen of all:\r\nAnd, favour\xe2\x80\x99d by the night, o\xe2\x80\x99erleap\xe2\x80\x99d the wall,\r\nMy travels thence through spacious Greece extend;\r\nIn Phthia\xe2\x80\x99s court at last my labours end.\r\nYour sire received me, as his son caress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWith gifts enrich\xe2\x80\x99d, and with possessions bless\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nThe strong Dolopians thenceforth own\xe2\x80\x99d my reign,\r\nAnd all the coast that runs along the main.\r\nBy love to thee his bounties I repaid,\r\nAnd early wisdom to thy soul convey\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nGreat as thou art, my lessons made thee brave:\r\nA child I took thee, but a hero gave.\r\nThy infant breast a like affection show\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nStill in my arms (an ever-pleasing load)\r\nOr at my knee, by Phoenix wouldst thou stand;\r\nNo food was grateful but from Phoenix\xe2\x80\x99 hand.211\r\nI pass my watchings o\xe2\x80\x99er thy helpless years,\r\nThe tender labours, the compliant cares,\r\nThe gods (I thought) reversed their hard decree,\r\nAnd Phoenix felt a father\xe2\x80\x99s joys in thee:\r\nThy growing virtues justified my cares,\r\nAnd promised comfort to my silver hairs.\r\nNow be thy rage, thy fatal rage, resign\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nA cruel heart ill suits a manly mind:\r\nThe gods (the only great, and only wise)\r\nAre moved by offerings, vows, and sacrifice;\r\nOffending man their high compassion wins,\r\nAnd daily prayers atone for daily sins.\r\nPrayers are Jove\xe2\x80\x99s daughters, of celestial race,\r\nLame are their feet, and wrinkled is their face;\r\nWith humble mien, and with dejected eyes,\r\nConstant they follow, where injustice flies.\r\nInjustice swift, erect, and unconfined,\r\nSweeps the wide earth, and tramples o\xe2\x80\x99er mankind,\r\nWhile Prayers, to heal her wrongs, move slow behind.\r\nWho hears these daughters of almighty Jove,\r\nFor him they mediate to the throne above:\r\nWhen man rejects the humble suit they make,\r\nThe sire revenges for the daughters\xe2\x80\x99 sake;\r\nFrom Jove commission\xe2\x80\x99d, fierce injustice then\r\nDescends to punish unrelenting men.\r\nO let not headlong passion bear the sway\r\nThese reconciling goddesses obey:\r\nDue honours to the seed of Jove belong,\r\nDue honours calm the fierce, and bend the strong.\r\nWere these not paid thee by the terms we bring,\r\nWere rage still harbour\xe2\x80\x99d in the haughty king;\r\nNor Greece nor all her fortunes should engage\r\nThy friend to plead against so just a rage.\r\nBut since what honour asks the general sends,\r\nAnd sends by those whom most thy heart commends;\r\nThe best and noblest of the Grecian train;\r\nPermit not these to sue, and sue in vain!\r\nLet me (my son) an ancient fact unfold,\r\nA great example drawn from times of old;\r\nHear what our fathers were, and what their praise,\r\nWho conquer\xe2\x80\x99d their revenge in former days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere Calydon on rocky mountains stands212\r\nOnce fought the \xc3\x86tolian and Curetian bands;\r\nTo guard it those; to conquer, these advance;\r\nAnd mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.\r\nThe silver Cynthia bade contention rise,\r\nIn vengeance of neglected sacrifice;\r\nOn OEneus fields she sent a monstrous boar,\r\nThat levell\xe2\x80\x99d harvests, and whole forests tore:\r\nThis beast (when many a chief his tusks had slain)\r\nGreat Meleager stretch\xe2\x80\x99d along the plain,\r\nThen, for his spoils, a new debate arose,\r\nThe neighbour nations thence commencing foes.\r\nStrong as they were, the bold Curetes fail\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhile Meleager\xe2\x80\x99s thundering arm prevail\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nTill rage at length inflamed his lofty breast\r\n(For rage invades the wisest and the best).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCursed by Althaea, to his wrath he yields,\r\nAnd in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s embrace forgets the fields.\r\n(She from Marpessa sprung, divinely fair,\r\nAnd matchless Idas, more than man in war:\r\nThe god of day adored the mother\xe2\x80\x99s charms;\r\nAgainst the god the father bent his arms:\r\nThe afflicted pair, their sorrows to proclaim,\r\nFrom Cleopatra changed their daughter\xe2\x80\x99s name,\r\nAnd call\xe2\x80\x99d Alcyone; a name to show\r\nThe father\xe2\x80\x99s grief, the mourning mother\xe2\x80\x99s woe.)\r\nTo her the chief retired from stern debate,\r\nBut found no peace from fierce Althaea\xe2\x80\x99s hate:\r\nAlthaea\xe2\x80\x99s hate the unhappy warrior drew,\r\nWhose luckless hand his royal uncle slew;\r\nShe beat the ground, and call\xe2\x80\x99d the powers beneath\r\nOn her own son to wreak her brother\xe2\x80\x99s death;\r\nHell heard her curses from the realms profound,\r\nAnd the red fiends that walk the nightly round.\r\nIn vain \xc3\x86tolia her deliverer waits,\r\nWar shakes her walls, and thunders at her gates.\r\nShe sent ambassadors, a chosen band,\r\nPriests of the gods, and elders of the land;\r\nBesought the chief to save the sinking state:\r\nTheir prayers were urgent, and their proffers great:\r\n(Full fifty acres of the richest ground,\r\nHalf pasture green, and half with vineyards crown\xe2\x80\x99d:)\r\nHis suppliant father, aged OEneus, came;\r\nHis sisters follow\xe2\x80\x99d; even the vengeful dame,\r\nAlthaea, sues; his friends before him fall:\r\nHe stands relentless, and rejects them all.\r\nMeanwhile the victor\xe2\x80\x99s shouts ascend the skies;\r\nThe walls are scaled; the rolling flames arise;\r\nAt length his wife (a form divine) appears,\r\nWith piercing cries, and supplicating tears;\r\nShe paints the horrors of a conquer\xe2\x80\x99d town,\r\nThe heroes slain, the palaces o\xe2\x80\x99erthrown,\r\nThe matrons ravish\xe2\x80\x99d, the whole race enslaved:\r\nThe warrior heard, he vanquish\xe2\x80\x99d, and he saved.\r\nThe \xc3\x86tolians, long disdain\xe2\x80\x99d, now took their turn,\r\nAnd left the chief their broken faith to mourn.\r\nLearn hence, betimes to curb pernicious ire,\r\nNor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire;\r\nAccept the presents; draw thy conquering sword;\r\nAnd be amongst our guardian gods adored.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus he: the stern Achilles thus replied:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy second father, and my reverend guide:\r\nThy friend, believe me, no such gifts demands,\r\nAnd asks no honours from a mortal\xe2\x80\x99s hands;\r\nJove honours me, and favours my designs;\r\nHis pleasure guides me, and his will confines;\r\nAnd here I stay (if such his high behest)\r\nWhile life\xe2\x80\x99s warm spirit beats within my breast.\r\nYet hear one word, and lodge it in thy heart:\r\nNo more molest me on Atrides\xe2\x80\x99 part:\r\nIs it for him these tears are taught to flow,\r\nFor him these sorrows? for my mortal foe?\r\nA generous friendship no cold medium knows,\r\nBurns with one love, with one resentment glows;\r\nOne should our interests and our passions be;\r\nMy friend must hate the man that injures me.\r\nDo this, my Phoenix, \xe2\x80\x99tis a generous part;\r\nAnd share my realms, my honours, and my heart.\r\nLet these return: our voyage, or our stay,\r\nRest undetermined till the dawning day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ceased; then order\xe2\x80\x99d for the sage\xe2\x80\x99s bed\r\nA warmer couch with numerous carpets spread.\r\nWith that, stern Ajax his long silence broke,\r\nAnd thus, impatient, to Ulysses spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHence let us go\xe2\x80\x94why waste we time in vain?\r\nSee what effect our low submissions gain!\r\nLiked or not liked, his words we must relate,\r\nThe Greeks expect them, and our heroes wait.\r\nProud as he is, that iron heart retains\r\nIts stubborn purpose, and his friends disdains.\r\nStern and unpitying! if a brother bleed,\r\nOn just atonement, we remit the deed;\r\nA sire the slaughter of his son forgives;\r\nThe price of blood discharged, the murderer lives:\r\nThe haughtiest hearts at length their rage resign,\r\nAnd gifts can conquer every soul but thine.213\r\nThe gods that unrelenting breast have steel\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield.\r\nOne woman-slave was ravish\xe2\x80\x99d from thy arms:\r\nLo, seven are offer\xe2\x80\x99d, and of equal charms.\r\nThen hear, Achilles! be of better mind;\r\nRevere thy roof, and to thy guests be kind;\r\nAnd know the men of all the Grecian host,\r\nWho honour worth, and prize thy valour most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO soul of battles, and thy people\xe2\x80\x99s guide!\r\n(To Ajax thus the first of Greeks replied)\r\nWell hast thou spoke; but at the tyrant\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nMy rage rekindles, and my soul\xe2\x80\x99s on flame:\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis just resentment, and becomes the brave:\r\nDisgraced, dishonour\xe2\x80\x99d, like the vilest slave!\r\nReturn, then, heroes! and our answer bear,\r\nThe glorious combat is no more my care;\r\nNot till, amidst yon sinking navy slain,\r\nThe blood of Greeks shall dye the sable main;\r\nNot till the flames, by Hector\xe2\x80\x99s fury thrown,\r\nConsume your vessels, and approach my own;\r\nJust there, the impetuous homicide shall stand,\r\nThere cease his battle, and there feel our hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis said, each prince a double goblet crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd cast a large libation on the ground;\r\nThen to their vessels, through the gloomy shades,\r\nThe chiefs return; divine Ulysses leads.\r\nMeantime Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 slaves prepared a bed,\r\nWith fleeces, carpets, and soft linen spread:\r\nThere, till the sacred morn restored the day,\r\nIn slumber sweet the reverend Phoenix lay.\r\nBut in his inner tent, an ampler space,\r\nAchilles slept; and in his warm embrace\r\nFair Diomede of the Lesbian race.\r\nLast, for Patroclus was the couch prepared,\r\nWhose nightly joys the beauteous Iphis shared;\r\nAchilles to his friend consign\xe2\x80\x99d her charms\r\nWhen Scyros fell before his conquering arms.\r\n\r\nAnd now the elected chiefs whom Greece had sent,\r\nPass\xe2\x80\x99d through the hosts, and reach\xe2\x80\x99d the royal tent.\r\nThen rising all, with goblets in their hands,\r\nThe peers and leaders of the Achaian bands\r\nHail\xe2\x80\x99d their return: Atrides first begun:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay what success? divine Laertes\xe2\x80\x99 son!\r\nAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 high resolves declare to all:\r\nReturns the chief, or must our navy fall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat king of nations! (Ithacus replied)\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d is his wrath, unconquer\xe2\x80\x99d is his pride;\r\nHe slights thy friendship, thy proposals scorns,\r\nAnd, thus implored, with fiercer fury burns.\r\nTo save our army, and our fleets to free,\r\nIs not his care; but left to Greece and thee.\r\nYour eyes shall view, when morning paints the sky,\r\nBeneath his oars the whitening billows fly;\r\nUs too he bids our oars and sails employ,\r\nNor hope the fall of heaven-protected Troy;\r\nFor Jove o\xe2\x80\x99ershades her with his arm divine,\r\nInspires her war, and bids her glory shine.\r\nSuch was his word: what further he declared,\r\nThese sacred heralds and great Ajax heard.\r\nBut Phoenix in his tent the chief retains,\r\nSafe to transport him to his native plains\r\nWhen morning dawns; if other he decree,\r\nHis age is sacred, and his choice is free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUlysses ceased: the great Achaian host,\r\nWith sorrow seized, in consternation lost,\r\nAttend the stern reply. Tydides broke\r\nThe general silence, and undaunted spoke.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we gifts to proud Achilles send,\r\nOr strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend?\r\nHis country\xe2\x80\x99s woes he glories to deride,\r\nAnd prayers will burst that swelling heart with pride.\r\nBe the fierce impulse of his rage obey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nOur battles let him or desert or aid;\r\nThen let him arm when Jove or he think fit:\r\nThat, to his madness, or to Heaven commit:\r\nWhat for ourselves we can, is always ours;\r\nThis night, let due repast refresh our powers;\r\n(For strength consists in spirits and in blood,\r\nAnd those are owed to generous wine and food;)\r\nBut when the rosy messenger of day\r\nStrikes the blue mountains with her golden ray,\r\nRanged at the ships, let all our squadrons shine\r\nIn flaming arms, a long-extended line:\r\nIn the dread front let great Atrides stand,\r\nThe first in danger, as in high command.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShouts of acclaim the listening heroes raise,\r\nThen each to Heaven the due libations pays;\r\nTill sleep, descending o\xe2\x80\x99er the tents, bestows\r\nThe grateful blessings of desired repose.214\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACHILLES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK X.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHT-ADVENTURE OF DIOMED AND ULYSSES.\r\n\r\nUpon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army, the distress of\r\nAgamemnon is described in the most lively manner. He takes no rest that\r\nnight, but passes through the camp, awaking the leaders, and contriving\r\nall possible methods for the public safety. Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses,\r\nand Diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They call\r\na council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemies\xe2\x80\x99 camp,\r\nto learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomed\r\nundertakes this hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for\r\nhis companion. In their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had\r\nsent on a like design to the camp of the Grecians. From him they are\r\ninformed of the situation of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, and\r\nparticularly of Rhesus, and the Thracians who were lately arrived. They\r\npass on with success; kill Rhesus, with several of his officers, and\r\nseize the famous horses of that prince, with which they return in\r\ntriumph to the camp.\r\n\r\nThe same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.\r\n\r\nAll night the chiefs before their vessels lay,\r\nAnd lost in sleep the labours of the day:\r\nAll but the king: with various thoughts oppress\xe2\x80\x99d,215\r\nHis country\xe2\x80\x99s cares lay rolling in his breast.\r\nAs when by lightnings Jove\xe2\x80\x99s ethereal power\r\nForetels the rattling hail, or weighty shower,\r\nOr sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,\r\nOr bids the brazen throat of war to roar;\r\nBy fits one flash succeeds as one expires,\r\nAnd heaven flames thick with momentary fires:\r\nSo bursting frequent from Atrides\xe2\x80\x99 breast,\r\nSighs following sighs his inward fears confess\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nNow o\xe2\x80\x99er the fields, dejected, he surveys\r\nFrom thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze;\r\nHears in the passing wind their music blow,\r\nAnd marks distinct the voices of the foe.\r\nNow looking backwards to the fleet and coast,\r\nAnxious he sorrows for the endangered host.\r\nHe rends his hair, in sacrifice to Jove,\r\nAnd sues to him that ever lives above:\r\nInly he groans; while glory and despair\r\nDivide his heart, and wage a double war.\r\n\r\nA thousand cares his labouring breast revolves;\r\nTo seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves,\r\nWith him, in wholesome counsels, to debate\r\nWhat yet remains to save the afflicted state.\r\nHe rose, and first he cast his mantle round,\r\nNext on his feet the shining sandals bound;\r\nA lion\xe2\x80\x99s yellow spoils his back conceal\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nHis warlike hand a pointed javelin held.\r\nMeanwhile his brother, press\xe2\x80\x99d with equal woes,\r\nAlike denied the gifts of soft repose,\r\nLaments for Greece, that in his cause before\r\nSo much had suffer\xe2\x80\x99d and must suffer more.\r\nA leopard\xe2\x80\x99s spotted hide his shoulders spread:\r\nA brazen helmet glitter\xe2\x80\x99d on his head:\r\nThus (with a javelin in his hand) he went\r\nTo wake Atrides in the royal tent.\r\nAlready waked, Atrides he descried,\r\nHis armour buckling at his vessel\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\nJoyful they met; the Spartan thus begun:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy puts my brother his bright armour on?\r\nSends he some spy, amidst these silent hours,\r\nTo try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?\r\nBut say, what hero shall sustain that task?\r\nSuch bold exploits uncommon courage ask;\r\nGuideless, alone, through night\xe2\x80\x99s dark shade to go,\r\nAnd midst a hostile camp explore the foe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo whom the king: \xe2\x80\x9cIn such distress we stand,\r\nNo vulgar counsel our affairs demand;\r\nGreece to preserve, is now no easy part,\r\nBut asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.\r\nFor Jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,\r\nAnd bows his head to Hector\xe2\x80\x99s sacrifice.\r\nWhat eye has witness\xe2\x80\x99d, or what ear believed,\r\nIn one great day, by one great arm achieved,\r\nSuch wondrous deeds as Hector\xe2\x80\x99s hand has done,\r\nAnd we beheld, the last revolving sun?\r\nWhat honours the beloved of Jove adorn!\r\nSprung from no god, and of no goddess born;\r\nYet such his acts, as Greeks unborn shall tell,\r\nAnd curse the battle where their fathers fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow speed thy hasty course along the fleet,\r\nThere call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete;\r\nOurself to hoary Nestor will repair;\r\nTo keep the guards on duty be his care,\r\n(For Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s influence best that quarter guides,\r\nWhose son with Merion, o\xe2\x80\x99er the watch presides.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\nTo whom the Spartan: \xe2\x80\x9cThese thy orders borne,\r\nSay, shall I stay, or with despatch return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere shall thou stay, (the king of men replied,)\r\nElse may we miss to meet, without a guide,\r\nThe paths so many, and the camp so wide.\r\nStill, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,\r\nUrge by their fathers\xe2\x80\x99 fame their future praise.\r\nForget we now our state and lofty birth;\r\nNot titles here, but works, must prove our worth.\r\nTo labour is the lot of man below;\r\nAnd when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis said, each parted to his several cares:\r\nThe king to Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s sable ship repairs;\r\nThe sage protector of the Greeks he found\r\nStretch\xe2\x80\x99d in his bed with all his arms around;\r\nThe various-colour\xe2\x80\x99d scarf, the shield he rears,\r\nThe shining helmet, and the pointed spears;\r\nThe dreadful weapons of the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s rage,\r\nThat, old in arms, disdain\xe2\x80\x99d the peace of age.\r\nThen, leaning on his hand his watchful head,\r\nThe hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,\r\nWhile others sleep, thus range the camp alone;\r\nSeek\xe2\x80\x99st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?\r\nStand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO son of Neleus, (thus the king rejoin\xe2\x80\x99d,)\r\nPride of the Greeks, and glory of thy kind!\r\nLo, here the wretched Agamemnon stands,\r\nThe unhappy general of the Grecian bands,\r\nWhom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend,\r\nAnd woes, that only with his life shall end!\r\nScarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,\r\nAnd scarce my heart support its load of pain.\r\nNo taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,\r\nConfused, and sad, I wander thus alone,\r\nWith fears distracted, with no fix\xe2\x80\x99d design;\r\nAnd all my people\xe2\x80\x99s miseries are mine.\r\nIf aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,\r\n(Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)\r\nImpart thy counsel, and assist thy friend;\r\nNow let us jointly to the trench descend,\r\nAt every gate the fainting guard excite,\r\nTired with the toils of day and watch of night;\r\nElse may the sudden foe our works invade,\r\nSo near, and favour\xe2\x80\x99d by the gloomy shade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo him thus Nestor: \xe2\x80\x9cTrust the powers above,\r\nNor think proud Hector\xe2\x80\x99s hopes confirm\xe2\x80\x99d by Jove:\r\nHow ill agree the views of vain mankind,\r\nAnd the wise counsels of the eternal mind!\r\nAudacious Hector, if the gods ordain\r\nThat great Achilles rise and rage again,\r\nWhat toils attend thee, and what woes remain!\r\nLo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys;\r\nThe care is next our other chiefs to raise:\r\nUlysses, Diomed, we chiefly need;\r\nMeges for strength, Oileus famed for speed.\r\nSome other be despatch\xe2\x80\x99d of nimbler feet,\r\nTo those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,\r\nWhere lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.216\r\nTo rouse the Spartan I myself decree;\r\nDear as he is to us, and dear to thee,\r\nYet must I tax his sloth, that claims no share\r\nWith his great brother in his martial care:\r\nHim it behoved to every chief to sue,\r\nPreventing every part perform\xe2\x80\x99d by you;\r\nFor strong necessity our toils demands,\r\nClaims all our hearts, and urges all our hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo whom the king: \xe2\x80\x9cWith reverence we allow\r\nThy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now:\r\nMy generous brother is of gentle kind,\r\nHe seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;\r\nThrough too much deference to our sovereign sway,\r\nContent to follow when we lead the way:\r\nBut now, our ills industrious to prevent,\r\nLong ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.\r\nThe chiefs you named, already at his call,\r\nPrepare to meet us near the navy-wall;\r\nAssembling there, between the trench and gates,\r\nNear the night-guards, our chosen council waits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen none (said Nestor) shall his rule withstand,\r\nFor great examples justify command.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWith that, the venerable warrior rose;\r\nThe shining greaves his manly legs enclose;\r\nHis purple mantle golden buckles join\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWarm with the softest wool, and doubly lined.\r\nThen rushing from his tent, he snatch\xe2\x80\x99d in haste\r\nHis steely lance, that lighten\xe2\x80\x99d as he pass\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nThe camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd,\r\nStopp\xe2\x80\x99d at Ulysses\xe2\x80\x99 tent, and call\xe2\x80\x99d aloud.\r\nUlysses, sudden as the voice was sent,\r\nAwakes, starts up, and issues from his tent.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat new distress, what sudden cause of fright,\r\nThus leads you wandering in the silent night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO prudent chief! (the Pylian sage replied)\r\nWise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:\r\nWhatever means of safety can be sought,\r\nWhatever counsels can inspire our thought,\r\nWhatever methods, or to fly or fight;\r\nAll, all depend on this important night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe heard, return\xe2\x80\x99d, and took his painted shield;\r\nThen join\xe2\x80\x99d the chiefs, and follow\xe2\x80\x99d through the field.\r\nWithout his tent, bold Diomed they found,\r\nAll sheathed in arms, his brave companions round:\r\nEach sunk in sleep, extended on the field,\r\nHis head reclining on his bossy shield.\r\nA wood of spears stood by, that, fix\xe2\x80\x99d upright,\r\nShot from their flashing points a quivering light.\r\nA bull\xe2\x80\x99s black hide composed the hero\xe2\x80\x99s bed;\r\nA splendid carpet roll\xe2\x80\x99d beneath his head.\r\nThen, with his foot, old Nestor gently shakes\r\nThe slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise, son of Tydeus! to the brave and strong\r\nRest seems inglorious, and the night too long.\r\nBut sleep\xe2\x80\x99st thou now, when from yon hill the foe\r\nHangs o\xe2\x80\x99er the fleet, and shades our walls below?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;\r\nThe warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,\r\nThough years and honours bid thee seek repose,\r\nLet younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake;\r\nIll fits thy age these toils to undertake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend, (he answered,) generous is thy care;\r\nThese toils, my subjects and my sons might bear;\r\nTheir loyal thoughts and pious love conspire\r\nTo ease a sovereign and relieve a sire:\r\nBut now the last despair surrounds our host;\r\nNo hour must pass, no moment must be lost;\r\nEach single Greek, in this conclusive strife,\r\nStands on the sharpest edge of death or life:\r\nYet, if my years thy kind regard engage,\r\nEmploy thy youth as I employ my age;\r\nSucceed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;\r\nHe serves me most, who serves his country best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis said, the hero o\xe2\x80\x99er his shoulders flung\r\nA lion\xe2\x80\x99s spoils, that to his ankles hung;\r\nThen seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.\r\nMeges the bold, with Ajax famed for speed,\r\nThe warrior roused, and to the entrenchments lead.\r\n\r\nAnd now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;\r\nA wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared:\r\nThe unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,\r\nAnd, couching close, repel invading sleep.\r\nSo faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,\r\nWith toil protected from the prowling train;\r\nWhen the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,\r\nSprings from the mountains toward the guarded fold:\r\nThrough breaking woods her rustling course they hear;\r\nLoud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear\r\nOf hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,\r\nWatch every side, and turn to every sound.\r\nThus watch\xe2\x80\x99d the Grecians, cautious of surprise,\r\nEach voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes:\r\nEach step of passing feet increased the affright;\r\nAnd hostile Troy was ever full in sight.\r\nNestor with joy the wakeful band survey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd thus accosted through the gloomy shade.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis well, my sons! your nightly cares employ;\r\nElse must our host become the scorn of Troy.\r\nWatch thus, and Greece shall live.\xe2\x80\x9d The hero said;\r\nThen o\xe2\x80\x99er the trench the following chieftains led.\r\nHis son, and godlike Merion, march\xe2\x80\x99d behind\r\n(For these the princes to their council join\xe2\x80\x99d).\r\nThe trenches pass\xe2\x80\x99d, the assembled kings around\r\nIn silent state the consistory crown\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nA place there was, yet undefiled with gore,\r\nThe spot where Hector stopp\xe2\x80\x99d his rage before;\r\nWhen night descending, from his vengeful hand\r\nReprieved the relics of the Grecian band:\r\n(The plain beside with mangled corps was spread,\r\nAnd all his progress mark\xe2\x80\x99d by heaps of dead:)\r\nThere sat the mournful kings: when Neleus\xe2\x80\x99 son,\r\nThe council opening, in these words begun:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there (said he) a chief so greatly brave,\r\nHis life to hazard, and his country save?\r\nLives there a man, who singly dares to go\r\nTo yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?\r\nOr favour\xe2\x80\x99d by the night approach so near,\r\nTheir speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?\r\nIf to besiege our navies they prepare,\r\nOr Troy once more must be the seat of war?\r\nThis could he learn, and to our peers recite,\r\nAnd pass unharm\xe2\x80\x99d the dangers of the night;\r\nWhat fame were his through all succeeding days,\r\nWhile Phoebus shines, or men have tongues to praise!\r\nWhat gifts his grateful country would bestow!\r\nWhat must not Greece to her deliverer owe?\r\nA sable ewe each leader should provide,\r\nWith each a sable lambkin by her side;\r\nAt every rite his share should be increased,\r\nAnd his the foremost honours of the feast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,\r\nTydides spoke\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe man you seek is here.\r\nThrough yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,\r\nSome god within commands, and I obey.\r\nBut let some other chosen warrior join,\r\nTo raise my hopes, and second my design.\r\nBy mutual confidence and mutual aid,\r\nGreat deeds are done, and great discoveries made;\r\nThe wise new prudence from the wise acquire,\r\nAnd one brave hero fans another\xe2\x80\x99s fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nContending leaders at the word arose;\r\nEach generous breast with emulation glows;\r\nSo brave a task each Ajax strove to share,\r\nBold Merion strove, and Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s valiant heir;\r\nThe Spartan wish\xe2\x80\x99d the second place to gain,\r\nAnd great Ulysses wish\xe2\x80\x99d, nor wish\xe2\x80\x99d in vain.\r\nThen thus the king of men the contest ends:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,\r\nUndaunted Diomed! what chief to join\r\nIn this great enterprise, is only thine.\r\nJust be thy choice, without affection made;\r\nTo birth, or office, no respect be paid;\r\nLet worth determine here.\xe2\x80\x9d The monarch spake,\r\nAnd inly trembled for his brother\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin\xe2\x80\x99d)\r\nMy choice declares the impulse of my mind.\r\nHow can I doubt, while great Ulysses stands\r\nTo lend his counsels and assist our hands?\r\nA chief, whose safety is Minerva\xe2\x80\x99s care;\r\nSo famed, so dreadful, in the works of war:\r\nBless\xe2\x80\x99d in his conduct, I no aid require;\r\nWisdom like his might pass through flames of fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,\r\n(Replied the sage,) to praise me, or to blame:\r\nPraise from a friend, or censure from a foe,\r\nAre lost on hearers that our merits know.\r\nBut let us haste\xe2\x80\x94Night rolls the hours away,\r\nThe reddening orient shows the coming day,\r\nThe stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains,\r\nAnd of night\xe2\x80\x99s empire but a third remains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus having spoke, with generous ardour press\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nIn arms terrific their huge limbs they dress\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nA two-edged falchion Thrasymed the brave,\r\nAnd ample buckler, to Tydides gave:\r\nThen in a leathern helm he cased his head,\r\nShort of its crest, and with no plume o\xe2\x80\x99erspread:\r\n(Such as by youths unused to arms are worn:)\r\nNo spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.\r\nNext him Ulysses took a shining sword,\r\nA bow and quiver, with bright arrows stored:\r\nA well-proved casque, with leather braces bound,\r\n(Thy gift, Meriones,) his temples crown\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nSoft wool within; without, in order spread,217\r\nA boar\xe2\x80\x99s white teeth grinn\xe2\x80\x99d horrid o\xe2\x80\x99er his head.\r\nThis from Amyntor, rich Ormenus\xe2\x80\x99 son,\r\nAutolycus by fraudful rapine won,\r\nAnd gave Amphidamas; from him the prize\r\nMolus received, the pledge of social ties;\r\nThe helmet next by Merion was possess\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd now Ulysses\xe2\x80\x99 thoughtful temples press\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nThus sheathed in arms, the council they forsake,\r\nAnd dark through paths oblique their progress take.\r\nJust then, in sign she favour\xe2\x80\x99d their intent,\r\nA long-wing\xe2\x80\x99d heron great Minerva sent:\r\nThis, though surrounding shades obscured their view,\r\nBy the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew.\r\nAs from the right she soar\xe2\x80\x99d, Ulysses pray\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nHail\xe2\x80\x99d the glad omen, and address\xe2\x80\x99d the maid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO daughter of that god whose arm can wield\r\nThe avenging bolt, and shake the saber shield!\r\nO thou! for ever present in my way,\r\nWho all my motions, all my toils survey!\r\nSafe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade,\r\nSafe by thy succour to our ships convey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd let some deed this signal night adorn,\r\nTo claim the tears of Trojans yet unborn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen godlike Diomed preferr\xe2\x80\x99d his prayer:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaughter of Jove, unconquer\xe2\x80\x99d Pallas! hear.\r\nGreat queen of arms, whose favour Tydeus won,\r\nAs thou defend\xe2\x80\x99st the sire, defend the son.\r\nWhen on \xc3\x86sopus\xe2\x80\x99 banks the banded powers\r\nOf Greece he left, and sought the Theban towers,\r\nPeace was his charge; received with peaceful show,\r\nHe went a legate, but return\xe2\x80\x99d a foe:\r\nThen help\xe2\x80\x99d by thee, and cover\xe2\x80\x99d by thy shield,\r\nHe fought with numbers, and made numbers yield.\r\nSo now be present, O celestial maid!\r\nSo still continue to the race thine aid!\r\nA youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke,\r\nUntamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,\r\nWith ample forehead, and with spreading horns,\r\nWhose taper tops refulgent gold adorns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe heroes pray\xe2\x80\x99d, and Pallas from the skies\r\nAccords their vow, succeeds their enterprise.\r\nNow, like two lions panting for the prey,\r\nWith dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way,\r\nThrough the black horrors of the ensanguined plain,\r\nThrough dust, through blood, o\xe2\x80\x99er arms, and hills of slain.\r\n\r\nNor less bold Hector, and the sons of Troy,\r\nOn high designs the wakeful hours employ;\r\nThe assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed;\r\nWho thus the counsels of his breast proposed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat glorious man, for high attempts prepared,\r\nDares greatly venture for a rich reward?\r\nOf yonder fleet a bold discovery make,\r\nWhat watch they keep, and what resolves they take?\r\nIf now subdued they meditate their flight,\r\nAnd, spent with toil, neglect the watch of night?\r\nHis be the chariot that shall please him most,\r\nOf all the plunder of the vanquish\xe2\x80\x99d host;\r\nHis the fair steeds that all the rest excel,\r\nAnd his the glory to have served so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA youth there was among the tribes of Troy,\r\nDolon his name, Eumedes\xe2\x80\x99 only boy,\r\n(Five girls beside the reverend herald told.)\r\nRich was the son in brass, and rich in gold;\r\nNot bless\xe2\x80\x99d by nature with the charms of face,\r\nBut swift of foot, and matchless in the race.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHector! (he said) my courage bids me meet\r\nThis high achievement, and explore the fleet:\r\nBut first exalt thy sceptre to the skies,\r\nAnd swear to grant me the demanded prize;\r\nThe immortal coursers, and the glittering car,\r\nThat bear Pelides through the ranks of war.\r\nEncouraged thus, no idle scout I go,\r\nFulfil thy wish, their whole intention know,\r\nEven to the royal tent pursue my way,\r\nAnd all their counsels, all their aims betray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,\r\nAttesting thus the monarch of the sky:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe witness thou! immortal lord of all!\r\nWhose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:\r\nBy none but Dolon shall this prize be borne,\r\nAnd him alone the immortal steeds adorn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus Hector swore: the gods were call\xe2\x80\x99d in vain,\r\nBut the rash youth prepares to scour the plain:\r\nAcross his back the bended bow he flung,\r\nA wolf\xe2\x80\x99s grey hide around his shoulders hung,\r\nA ferret\xe2\x80\x99s downy fur his helmet lined,\r\nAnd in his hand a pointed javelin shined.\r\nThen (never to return) he sought the shore,\r\nAnd trod the path his feet must tread no more.\r\nScarce had he pass\xe2\x80\x99d the steeds and Trojan throng,\r\n(Still bending forward as he coursed along,)\r\nWhen, on the hollow way, the approaching tread\r\nUlysses mark\xe2\x80\x99d, and thus to Diomed;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO friend! I hear some step of hostile feet,\r\nMoving this way, or hastening to the fleet;\r\nSome spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;\r\nOr nightly pillager that strips the slain.\r\nYet let him pass, and win a little space;\r\nThen rush behind him, and prevent his pace.\r\nBut if too swift of foot he flies before,\r\nConfine his course along the fleet and shore,\r\nBetwixt the camp and him our spears employ,\r\nAnd intercept his hoped return to Troy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that they stepp\xe2\x80\x99d aside, and stoop\xe2\x80\x99d their head,\r\n(As Dolon pass\xe2\x80\x99d,) behind a heap of dead:\r\nAlong the path the spy unwary flew;\r\nSoft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.\r\nSo distant they, and such the space between,\r\nAs when two teams of mules divide the green,\r\n(To whom the hind like shares of land allows,)\r\nWhen now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.\r\nNow Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nHector (he thought) had sent, and check\xe2\x80\x99d his haste,\r\nTill scarce at distance of a javelin\xe2\x80\x99s throw,\r\nNo voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.\r\nAs when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;\r\nOr chase through woods obscure the trembling hind;\r\nNow lost, now seen, they intercept his way,\r\nAnd from the herd still turn the flying prey:\r\nSo fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;\r\nSo close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.\r\nNow almost on the fleet the dastard falls,\r\nAnd mingles with the guards that watch the walls;\r\nWhen brave Tydides stopp\xe2\x80\x99d; a gen\xe2\x80\x99rous thought\r\n(Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,\r\nLest on the foe some forward Greek advance,\r\nAnd snatch the glory from his lifted lance.\r\nThen thus aloud: \xe2\x80\x9cWhoe\xe2\x80\x99er thou art, remain;\r\nThis javelin else shall fix thee to the plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe said, and high in air the weapon cast,\r\nWhich wilful err\xe2\x80\x99d, and o\xe2\x80\x99er his shoulder pass\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThen fix\xe2\x80\x99d in earth. Against the trembling wood\r\nThe wretch stood propp\xe2\x80\x99d, and quiver\xe2\x80\x99d as he stood;\r\nA sudden palsy seized his turning head;\r\nHis loose teeth chatter\xe2\x80\x99d, and his colour fled;\r\nThe panting warriors seize him as he stands,\r\nAnd with unmanly tears his life demands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO spare my youth, and for the breath I owe,\r\nLarge gifts of price my father shall bestow:\r\nVast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,\r\nAnd steel well-temper\xe2\x80\x99d and refulgent gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo whom Ulysses made this wise reply:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoe\xe2\x80\x99er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.\r\nWhat moves thee, say, when sleep has closed the sight,\r\nTo roam the silent fields in dead of night?\r\nCam\xe2\x80\x99st thou the secrets of our camp to find,\r\nBy Hector prompted, or thy daring mind?\r\nOr art some wretch by hopes of plunder led,\r\nThrough heaps of carnage, to despoil the dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen thus pale Dolon, with a fearful look:\r\n(Still, as he spoke, his limbs with horror shook:)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHither I came, by Hector\xe2\x80\x99s words deceived;\r\nMuch did he promise, rashly I believed:\r\nNo less a bribe than great Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 car,\r\nAnd those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war,\r\nUrged me, unwilling, this attempt to make;\r\nTo learn what counsels, what resolves you take:\r\nIf now subdued, you fix your hopes on flight,\r\nAnd, tired with toils, neglect the watch of night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBold was thy aim, and glorious was the prize,\r\n(Ulysses, with a scornful smile, replies,)\r\nFar other rulers those proud steeds demand,\r\nAnd scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand;\r\nEven great Achilles scarce their rage can tame,\r\nAchilles sprung from an immortal dame.\r\nBut say, be faithful, and the truth recite!\r\nWhere lies encamp\xe2\x80\x99d the Trojan chief to-night?\r\nWhere stand his coursers? in what quarter sleep\r\nTheir other princes? tell what watch they keep:\r\nSay, since this conquest, what their counsels are;\r\nOr here to combat, from their city far,\r\nOr back to Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s walls transfer the war?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUlysses thus, and thus Eumedes\xe2\x80\x99 son:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Dolon knows, his faithful tongue shall own.\r\nHector, the peers assembling in his tent,\r\nA council holds at Ilus\xe2\x80\x99 monument.\r\nNo certain guards the nightly watch partake;\r\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99er yon fires ascend, the Trojans wake:\r\nAnxious for Troy, the guard the natives keep;\r\nSafe in their cares, the auxiliar forces sleep,\r\nWhose wives and infants, from the danger far,\r\nDischarge their souls of half the fears of war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen sleep those aids among the Trojan train,\r\n(Inquired the chief,) or scattered o\xe2\x80\x99er the plain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTo whom the spy: \xe2\x80\x9cTheir powers they thus dispose\r\nThe Paeons, dreadful with their bended bows,\r\nThe Carians, Caucons, the Pelasgian host,\r\nAnd Leleges, encamp along the coast.\r\nNot distant far, lie higher on the land\r\nThe Lycian, Mysian, and Maeonian band,\r\nAnd Phrygia\xe2\x80\x99s horse, by Thymbras\xe2\x80\x99 ancient wall;\r\nThe Thracians utmost, and apart from all.\r\nThese Troy but lately to her succour won,\r\nLed on by Rhesus, great Eioneus\xe2\x80\x99 son:\r\nI saw his coursers in proud triumph go,\r\nSwift as the wind, and white as winter-snow;\r\nRich silver plates his shining car infold;\r\nHis solid arms, refulgent, flame with gold;\r\nNo mortal shoulders suit the glorious load,\r\nCelestial panoply, to grace a god!\r\nLet me, unhappy, to your fleet be borne,\r\nOr leave me here, a captive\xe2\x80\x99s fate to mourn,\r\nIn cruel chains, till your return reveal\r\nThe truth or falsehood of the news I tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Tydides, with a gloomy frown:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink not to live, though all the truth be shown:\r\nShall we dismiss thee, in some future strife\r\nTo risk more bravely thy now forfeit life?\r\nOr that again our camps thou may\xe2\x80\x99st explore?\r\nNo\xe2\x80\x94once a traitor, thou betray\xe2\x80\x99st no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSternly he spoke, and as the wretch prepared\r\nWith humble blandishment to stroke his beard,\r\nLike lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew,\r\nDivides the neck, and cuts the nerves in two;\r\nOne instant snatch\xe2\x80\x99d his trembling soul to hell,\r\nThe head, yet speaking, mutter\xe2\x80\x99d as it fell.\r\nThe furry helmet from his brow they tear,\r\nThe wolf\xe2\x80\x99s grey hide, the unbended bow and spear;\r\nThese great Ulysses lifting to the skies,\r\nTo favouring Pallas dedicates the prize:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat queen of arms, receive this hostile spoil,\r\nAnd let the Thracian steeds reward our toil;\r\nThee, first of all the heavenly host, we praise;\r\nO speed our labours, and direct our ways!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThis said, the spoils, with dropping gore defaced,\r\nHigh on a spreading tamarisk he placed;\r\nThen heap\xe2\x80\x99d with reeds and gathered boughs the plain,\r\nTo guide their footsteps to the place again.\r\n\r\nThrough the still night they cross the devious fields,\r\nSlippery with blood, o\xe2\x80\x99er arms and heaps of shields,\r\nArriving where the Thracian squadrons lay,\r\nAnd eased in sleep the labours of the day.\r\nRanged in three lines they view the prostrate band:\r\nThe horses yoked beside each warrior stand.\r\nTheir arms in order on the ground reclined,\r\nThrough the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined:\r\nAmidst lay Rhesus, stretch\xe2\x80\x99d in sleep profound,\r\nAnd the white steeds behind his chariot bound.\r\nThe welcome sight Ulysses first descries,\r\nAnd points to Diomed the tempting prize.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man, the coursers, and the car behold!\r\nDescribed by Dolon, with the arms of gold.\r\nNow, brave Tydides! now thy courage try,\r\nApproach the chariot, and the steeds untie;\r\nOr if thy soul aspire to fiercer deeds,\r\nUrge thou the slaughter, while I seize the steeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPallas (this said) her hero\xe2\x80\x99s bosom warms,\r\nBreathed in his heart, and strung his nervous arms;\r\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99er he pass\xe2\x80\x99d, a purple stream pursued\r\nHis thirsty falchion, fat with hostile blood,\r\nBathed all his footsteps, dyed the fields with gore,\r\nAnd a low groan remurmur\xe2\x80\x99d through the shore.\r\nSo the grim lion, from his nightly den,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99erleaps the fences, and invades the pen,\r\nOn sheep or goats, resistless in his way,\r\nHe falls, and foaming rends the guardless prey;\r\nNor stopp\xe2\x80\x99d the fury of his vengeful hand,\r\nTill twelve lay breathless of the Thracian band.\r\nUlysses following, as his partner slew,\r\nBack by the foot each slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d warrior drew;\r\nThe milk-white coursers studious to convey\r\nSafe to the ships, he wisely cleared the way:\r\nLest the fierce steeds, not yet to battles bred,\r\nShould start, and tremble at the heaps of dead.\r\nNow twelve despatch\xe2\x80\x99d, the monarch last they found;\r\nTydides\xe2\x80\x99 falchion fix\xe2\x80\x99d him to the ground.\r\nJust then a deathful dream Minerva sent,\r\nA warlike form appear\xe2\x80\x99d before his tent,\r\nWhose visionary steel his bosom tore:\r\nSo dream\xe2\x80\x99d the monarch, and awaked no more.218\r\n\r\nUlysses now the snowy steeds detains,\r\nAnd leads them, fasten\xe2\x80\x99d by the silver reins;\r\nThese, with his bow unbent, he lash\xe2\x80\x99d along;\r\n(The scourge forgot, on Rhesus\xe2\x80\x99 chariot hung;)\r\nThen gave his friend the signal to retire;\r\nBut him, new dangers, new achievements fire;\r\nDoubtful he stood, or with his reeking blade\r\nTo send more heroes to the infernal shade,\r\nDrag off the car where Rhesus\xe2\x80\x99 armour lay,\r\nOr heave with manly force, and lift away.\r\nWhile unresolved the son of Tydeus stands,\r\nPallas appears, and thus her chief commands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, my son; from further slaughter cease,\r\nRegard thy safety, and depart in peace;\r\nHaste to the ships, the gotten spoils enjoy,\r\nNor tempt too far the hostile gods of Troy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice divine confess\xe2\x80\x99d the martial maid;\r\nIn haste he mounted, and her word obey\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThe coursers fly before Ulysses\xe2\x80\x99 bow,\r\nSwift as the wind, and white as winter-snow.\r\n\r\nNot unobserved they pass\xe2\x80\x99d: the god of light\r\nHad watch\xe2\x80\x99d his Troy, and mark\xe2\x80\x99d Minerva\xe2\x80\x99s flight,\r\nSaw Tydeus\xe2\x80\x99 son with heavenly succour bless\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd vengeful anger fill\xe2\x80\x99d his sacred breast.\r\nSwift to the Trojan camp descends the power,\r\nAnd wakes Hippocoon in the morning-hour;\r\n(On Rhesus\xe2\x80\x99 side accustom\xe2\x80\x99d to attend,\r\nA faithful kinsman, and instructive friend;)\r\nHe rose, and saw the field deform\xe2\x80\x99d with blood,\r\nAn empty space where late the coursers stood,\r\nThe yet-warm Thracians panting on the coast;\r\nFor each he wept, but for his Rhesus most:\r\nNow while on Rhesus\xe2\x80\x99 name he calls in vain,\r\nThe gathering tumult spreads o\xe2\x80\x99er all the plain;\r\nOn heaps the Trojans rush, with wild affright,\r\nAnd wondering view the slaughters of the night.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the chiefs, arriving at the shade\r\nWhere late the spoils of Hector\xe2\x80\x99s spy were laid,\r\nUlysses stopp\xe2\x80\x99d; to him Tydides bore\r\nThe trophy, dropping yet with Dolon\xe2\x80\x99s gore:\r\nThen mounts again; again their nimbler feet\r\nThe coursers ply, and thunder towards the fleet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIOMED AND ULYSSES RETURNING WITH THE SPOILS OF RHESUS.]\r\n\r\nOld Nestor first perceived the approaching sound,\r\nBespeaking thus the Grecian peers around:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMethinks the noise of trampling steeds I hear,\r\nThickening this way, and gathering on my ear;\r\nPerhaps some horses of the Trojan breed\r\n(So may, ye gods! my pious hopes succeed)\r\nThe great Tydides and Ulysses bear,\r\nReturn\xe2\x80\x99d triumphant with this prize of war.\r\nYet much I fear (ah, may that fear be vain!)\r\nThe chiefs outnumber\xe2\x80\x99d by the Trojan train;\r\nPerhaps, even now pursued, they seek the shore;\r\nOr, oh! perhaps those heroes are no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScarce had he spoke, when, lo! the chiefs appear,\r\nAnd spring to earth; the Greeks dismiss their fear:\r\nWith words of friendship and extended hands\r\nThey greet the kings; and Nestor first demands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay thou, whose praises all our host proclaim,\r\nThou living glory of the Grecian name!\r\nSay whence these coursers? by what chance bestow\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe spoil of foes, or present of a god?\r\nNot those fair steeds, so radiant and so gay,\r\nThat draw the burning chariot of the day.\r\nOld as I am, to age I scorn to yield,\r\nAnd daily mingle in the martial field;\r\nBut sure till now no coursers struck my sight\r\nLike these, conspicuous through the ranks of fight.\r\nSome god, I deem, conferred the glorious prize,\r\nBless\xe2\x80\x99d as ye are, and favourites of the skies;\r\nThe care of him who bids the thunder roar,\r\nAnd her, whose fury bathes the world with gore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather! not so, (sage Ithacus rejoin\xe2\x80\x99d,)\r\nThe gifts of heaven are of a nobler kind.\r\nOf Thracian lineage are the steeds ye view,\r\nWhose hostile king the brave Tydides slew;\r\nSleeping he died, with all his guards around,\r\nAnd twelve beside lay gasping on the ground.\r\nThese other spoils from conquer\xe2\x80\x99d Dolon came,\r\nA wretch, whose swiftness was his only fame;\r\nBy Hector sent our forces to explore,\r\nHe now lies headless on the sandy shore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen o\xe2\x80\x99er the trench the bounding coursers flew;\r\nThe joyful Greeks with loud acclaim pursue.\r\nStraight to Tydides\xe2\x80\x99 high pavilion borne,\r\nThe matchless steeds his ample stalls adorn:\r\nThe neighing coursers their new fellows greet,\r\nAnd the full racks are heap\xe2\x80\x99d with generous wheat.\r\nBut Dolon\xe2\x80\x99s armour, to his ships convey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nHigh on the painted stern Ulysses laid,\r\nA trophy destin\xe2\x80\x99d to the blue-eyed maid.\r\n\r\nNow from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stain\r\nThey cleanse their bodies in the neighb\xe2\x80\x99ring main:\r\nThen in the polished bath, refresh\xe2\x80\x99d from toil,\r\nTheir joints they supple with dissolving oil,\r\nIn due repast indulge the genial hour,\r\nAnd first to Pallas the libations pour:\r\nThey sit, rejoicing in her aid divine,\r\nAnd the crown\xe2\x80\x99d goblet foams with floods of wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XI.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD BATTLE, AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON.\r\n\r\nAgamemnon, having armed himself, leads the Grecians to battle; Hector\r\nprepares the Trojans to receive them, while Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva\r\ngive the signals of war. Agamemnon bears all before him and Hector is\r\ncommanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that purpose) to decline the\r\nengagement, till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field.\r\nHe then makes a great slaughter of the enemy. Ulysses and Diomed put a\r\nstop to him for a time but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is\r\nobliged to desert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans,\r\nwounded, and in the utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him.\r\nHector comes against Ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes, and\r\nrallies the Greeks. In the meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the\r\narmy, is pierced with an arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in\r\nNestor\xe2\x80\x99s chariot. Achilles (who overlooked the action from his ship)\r\nsent Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded in that\r\nmanner; Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the\r\naccidents of the day, and a long recital of some former wars which he\r\nremembered, tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles to fight\r\nfor his countrymen, or at least to permit him to do it, clad in\r\nAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 armour. Patroclus, on his return, meets Eurypylus also\r\nwounded, and assists him in that distress.\r\n\r\nThis book opens with the eight-and-twentieth day of the poem, and the\r\nsame day, with its various actions and adventures is extended through\r\nthe twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth,\r\nand part of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in the field near the\r\nmonument of Ilus.\r\n\r\nThe saffron morn, with early blushes spread,219\r\nNow rose refulgent from Tithonus\xe2\x80\x99 bed;\r\nWith new-born day to gladden mortal sight,\r\nAnd gild the courts of heaven with sacred light:\r\nWhen baleful Eris, sent by Jove\xe2\x80\x99s command,\r\nThe torch of discord blazing in her hand,\r\nThrough the red skies her bloody sign extends,\r\nAnd, wrapt in tempests, o\xe2\x80\x99er the fleet descends.\r\nHigh on Ulysses\xe2\x80\x99 bark her horrid stand\r\nShe took, and thunder\xe2\x80\x99d through the seas and land.\r\n\r\nEven Ajax and Achilles heard the sound,\r\nWhose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound,\r\nThence the black fury through the Grecian throng\r\nWith horror sounds the loud Orthian song:\r\nThe navy shakes, and at the dire alarms\r\nEach bosom boils, each warrior starts to arms.\r\nNo more they sigh, inglorious to return,\r\nBut breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DESCENT OF DISCORD.]\r\n\r\nThe king of men his hardy host inspires\r\nWith loud command, with great example fires!\r\nHimself first rose, himself before the rest\r\nHis mighty limbs in radiant armour dress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd first he cased his manly legs around\r\nIn shining greaves with silver buckles bound;\r\nThe beaming cuirass next adorn\xe2\x80\x99d his breast,\r\nThe same which once king Cinyras possess\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n(The fame of Greece and her assembled host\r\nHad reach\xe2\x80\x99d that monarch on the Cyprian coast;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas then, the friendship of the chief to gain,\r\nThis glorious gift he sent, nor sent in vain:)\r\nTen rows of azure steel the work infold,\r\nTwice ten of tin, and twelve of ductile gold;\r\nThree glittering dragons to the gorget rise,\r\nWhose imitated scales against the skies\r\nReflected various light, and arching bow\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nLike colour\xe2\x80\x99d rainbows o\xe2\x80\x99er a showery cloud\r\n(Jove\xe2\x80\x99s wondrous bow, of three celestial dies,\r\nPlaced as a sign to man amidst the skies).\r\nA radiant baldric, o\xe2\x80\x99er his shoulder tied,\r\nSustain\xe2\x80\x99d the sword that glitter\xe2\x80\x99d at his side:\r\nGold was the hilt, a silver sheath encased\r\nThe shining blade, and golden hangers graced.\r\nHis buckler\xe2\x80\x99s mighty orb was next display\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThat round the warrior cast a dreadful shade;\r\nTen zones of brass its ample brim surround,\r\nAnd twice ten bosses the bright convex crown\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nTremendous Gorgon frown\xe2\x80\x99d upon its field,\r\nAnd circling terrors fill\xe2\x80\x99d the expressive shield:\r\nWithin its concave hung a silver thong,\r\nOn which a mimic serpent creeps along,\r\nHis azure length in easy waves extends,\r\nTill in three heads the embroider\xe2\x80\x99d monster ends.\r\nLast o\xe2\x80\x99er his brows his fourfold helm he placed,\r\nWith nodding horse-hair formidably graced;\r\nAnd in his hands two steely javelins wields,\r\nThat blaze to heaven, and lighten all the fields.\r\n\r\nThat instant Juno, and the martial maid,\r\nIn happy thunders promised Greece their aid;\r\nHigh o\xe2\x80\x99er the chief they clash\xe2\x80\x99d their arms in air,\r\nAnd, leaning from the clouds, expect the war.\r\n\r\nClose to the limits of the trench and mound,\r\nThe fiery coursers to their chariots bound\r\nThe squires restrain\xe2\x80\x99d: the foot, with those who wield\r\nThe lighter arms, rush forward to the field.\r\nTo second these, in close array combined,\r\nThe squadrons spread their sable wings behind.\r\nNow shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun,\r\nAs with the light the warriors\xe2\x80\x99 toils begun.\r\nEven Jove, whose thunder spoke his wrath, distill\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nRed drops of blood o\xe2\x80\x99er all the fatal field;220\r\nThe woes of men unwilling to survey,\r\nAnd all the slaughters that must stain the day.\r\n\r\nNear Ilus\xe2\x80\x99 tomb, in order ranged around,\r\nThe Trojan lines possess\xe2\x80\x99d the rising ground:\r\nThere wise Polydamas and Hector stood;\r\n\xc3\x86neas, honour\xe2\x80\x99d as a guardian god;\r\nBold Polybus, Agenor the divine;\r\nThe brother-warriors of Antenor\xe2\x80\x99s line:\r\nWith youthful Acamas, whose beauteous face\r\nAnd fair proportion match\xe2\x80\x99d the ethereal race.\r\nGreat Hector, cover\xe2\x80\x99d with his spacious shield,\r\nPlies all the troops, and orders all the field.\r\nAs the red star now shows his sanguine fires\r\nThrough the dark clouds, and now in night retires,\r\nThus through the ranks appear\xe2\x80\x99d the godlike man,\r\nPlunged in the rear, or blazing in the van;\r\nWhile streamy sparkles, restless as he flies,\r\nFlash from his arms, as lightning from the skies.\r\nAs sweating reapers in some wealthy field,\r\nRanged in two bands, their crooked weapons wield,\r\nBear down the furrows, till their labours meet;\r\nThick fall the heapy harvests at their feet:\r\nSo Greece and Troy the field of war divide,\r\nAnd falling ranks are strow\xe2\x80\x99d on every side.\r\nNone stoop\xe2\x80\x99d a thought to base inglorious flight;221\r\nBut horse to horse, and man to man they fight,\r\nNot rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey;\r\nEach wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day.\r\nDiscord with joy the scene of death descries,\r\nAnd drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes:\r\nDiscord alone, of all the immortal train,\r\nSwells the red horrors of this direful plain:\r\nThe gods in peace their golden mansions fill,\r\nRanged in bright order on the Olympian hill:\r\nBut general murmurs told their griefs above,\r\nAnd each accused the partial will of Jove.\r\nMeanwhile apart, superior, and alone,\r\nThe eternal Monarch, on his awful throne,\r\nWrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate;\r\nAnd fix\xe2\x80\x99d, fulfill\xe2\x80\x99d the just decrees of fate.\r\nOn earth he turn\xe2\x80\x99d his all-considering eyes,\r\nAnd mark\xe2\x80\x99d the spot where Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s towers arise;\r\nThe sea with ships, the fields with armies spread,\r\nThe victor\xe2\x80\x99s rage, the dying, and the dead.\r\n\r\nThus while the morning-beams, increasing bright,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er heaven\xe2\x80\x99s pure azure spread the glowing light,\r\nCommutual death the fate of war confounds,\r\nEach adverse battle gored with equal wounds.\r\nBut now (what time in some sequester\xe2\x80\x99d vale\r\nThe weary woodman spreads his sparing meal,\r\nWhen his tired arms refuse the axe to rear,\r\nAnd claim a respite from the sylvan war;\r\nBut not till half the prostrate forests lay\r\nStretch\xe2\x80\x99d in long ruin, and exposed to day)\r\nThen, nor till then, the Greeks\xe2\x80\x99 impulsive might\r\nPierced the black phalanx, and let in the light.\r\nGreat Agamemnon then the slaughter led,\r\nAnd slew Bienor at his people\xe2\x80\x99s head:\r\nWhose squire Oileus, with a sudden spring,\r\nLeap\xe2\x80\x99d from the chariot to revenge his king;\r\nBut in his front he felt the fatal wound,\r\nWhich pierced his brain, and stretch\xe2\x80\x99d him on the ground.\r\nAtrides spoil\xe2\x80\x99d, and left them on the plain:\r\nVain was their youth, their glittering armour vain:\r\nNow soil\xe2\x80\x99d with dust, and naked to the sky,\r\nTheir snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie.\r\n\r\nTwo sons of Priam next to battle move,\r\nThe product, one of marriage, one of love:222\r\nIn the same car the brother-warriors ride;\r\nThis took the charge to combat, that to guide:\r\nFar other task, than when they wont to keep,\r\nOn Ida\xe2\x80\x99s tops, their father\xe2\x80\x99s fleecy sheep.\r\nThese on the mountains once Achilles found,\r\nAnd captive led, with pliant osiers bound;\r\nThen to their sire for ample sums restored;\r\nBut now to perish by Atrides\xe2\x80\x99 sword:\r\nPierced in the breast the base-born Isus bleeds:\r\nCleft through the head his brother\xe2\x80\x99s fate succeeds,\r\nSwift to the spoil the hasty victor falls,\r\nAnd, stript, their features to his mind recalls.\r\nThe Trojans see the youths untimely die,\r\nBut helpless tremble for themselves, and fly.\r\nSo when a lion ranging o\xe2\x80\x99er the lawns,\r\nFinds, on some grassy lair, the couching fawns,\r\nTheir bones he cracks, their reeking vitals draws,\r\nAnd grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws;\r\nThe frighted hind beholds, and dares not stay,\r\nBut swift through rustling thickets bursts her way;\r\nAll drown\xe2\x80\x99d in sweat, the panting mother flies,\r\nAnd the big tears roll trickling from her eyes.\r\n\r\nAmidst the tumult of the routed train,\r\nThe sons of false Antimachus were slain;\r\nHe who for bribes his faithless counsels sold,\r\nAnd voted Helen\xe2\x80\x99s stay for Paris\xe2\x80\x99 gold.\r\nAtrides mark\xe2\x80\x99d, as these their safety sought,\r\nAnd slew the children for the father\xe2\x80\x99s fault;\r\nTheir headstrong horse unable to restrain,\r\nThey shook with fear, and dropp\xe2\x80\x99d the silken rein;\r\nThen in the chariot on their knees they fall,\r\nAnd thus with lifted hands for mercy call:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO spare our youth, and for the life we owe,\r\nAntimachus shall copious gifts bestow:\r\nSoon as he hears, that, not in battle slain,\r\nThe Grecian ships his captive sons detain,\r\nLarge heaps of brass in ransom shall be told,\r\nAnd steel well-tempered, and persuasive gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words, attended with the flood of tears,\r\nThe youths address\xe2\x80\x99d to unrelenting ears:\r\nThe vengeful monarch gave this stern reply:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf from Antimachus ye spring, ye die;\r\nThe daring wretch who once in council stood\r\nTo shed Ulysses\xe2\x80\x99 and my brother\xe2\x80\x99s blood,\r\nFor proffer\xe2\x80\x99d peace! and sues his seed for grace?\r\nNo, die, and pay the forfeit of your race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis said, Pisander from the car he cast,\r\nAnd pierced his breast: supine he breathed his last.\r\nHis brother leap\xe2\x80\x99d to earth; but, as he lay,\r\nThe trenchant falchion lopp\xe2\x80\x99d his hands away;\r\nHis sever\xe2\x80\x99d head was toss\xe2\x80\x99d among the throng,\r\nAnd, rolling, drew a bloody train along.\r\nThen, where the thickest fought, the victor flew;\r\nThe king\xe2\x80\x99s example all his Greeks pursue.\r\nNow by the foot the flying foot were slain,\r\nHorse trod by horse, lay foaming on the plain.\r\nFrom the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise,\r\nShade the black host, and intercept the skies.\r\nThe brass-hoof\xe2\x80\x99d steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,\r\nAnd the thick thunder beats the labouring ground,\r\nStill slaughtering on, the king of men proceeds;\r\nThe distanced army wonders at his deeds,\r\nAs when the winds with raging flames conspire,\r\nAnd o\xe2\x80\x99er the forests roll the flood of fire,\r\nIn blazing heaps the grove\xe2\x80\x99s old honours fall,\r\nAnd one refulgent ruin levels all:\r\nBefore Atrides\xe2\x80\x99 rage so sinks the foe,\r\nWhole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low.\r\nThe steeds fly trembling from his waving sword,\r\nAnd many a car, now lighted of its lord,\r\nWide o\xe2\x80\x99er the field with guideless fury rolls,\r\nBreaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls;\r\nWhile his keen falchion drinks the warriors\xe2\x80\x99 lives;\r\nMore grateful, now, to vultures than their wives!\r\n\r\nPerhaps great Hector then had found his fate,\r\nBut Jove and destiny prolong\xe2\x80\x99d his date.\r\nSafe from the darts, the care of heaven he stood,\r\nAmidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.\r\n\r\nNow past the tomb where ancient Ilus lay,\r\nThrough the mid field the routed urge their way:\r\nWhere the wild figs the adjoining summit crown,\r\nThe path they take, and speed to reach the town.\r\nAs swift, Atrides with loud shouts pursued,\r\nHot with his toil, and bathed in hostile blood.\r\nNow near the beech-tree, and the Scaean gates,\r\nThe hero halts, and his associates waits.\r\nMeanwhile on every side around the plain,\r\nDispersed, disorder\xe2\x80\x99d, fly the Trojan train.\r\nSo flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe lion\xe2\x80\x99s roaring through the midnight shade;\r\nOn heaps they tumble with successless haste;\r\nThe savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.\r\nNot with less fury stern Atrides flew,\r\nStill press\xe2\x80\x99d the rout, and still the hindmost slew;\r\nHurl\xe2\x80\x99d from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd rage, and death, and carnage load the field.\r\n\r\nNow storms the victor at the Trojan wall;\r\nSurveys the towers, and meditates their fall.\r\nBut Jove descending shook the Idaean hills,\r\nAnd down their summits pour\xe2\x80\x99d a hundred rills:\r\nThe unkindled lightning in his hand he took,\r\nAnd thus the many-coloured maid bespoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIris, with haste thy golden wings display,\r\nTo godlike Hector this our word convey\xe2\x80\x94\r\nWhile Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,\r\nFights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,\r\nBid him give way; but issue forth commands,\r\nAnd trust the war to less important hands:\r\nBut when, or wounded by the spear or dart,\r\nThat chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,\r\nThen Jove shall string his arm, and fire his breast,\r\nThen to her ships shall flying Greece be press\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nTill to the main the burning sun descend,\r\nAnd sacred night her awful shade extend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke, and Iris at his word obey\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nOn wings of winds descends the various maid.\r\nThe chief she found amidst the ranks of war,\r\nClose to the bulwarks, on his glittering car.\r\nThe goddess then: \xe2\x80\x9cO son of Priam, hear!\r\nFrom Jove I come, and his high mandate bear.\r\nWhile Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,\r\nFights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,\r\nAbstain from fight; yet issue forth commands,\r\nAnd trust the war to less important hands:\r\nBut when, or wounded by the spear or dart,\r\nThe chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,\r\nThen Jove shall string thy arm, and fire thy breast,\r\nThen to her ships shall flying Greece be press\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nTill to the main the burning sun descend,\r\nAnd sacred night her awful shade extend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said, and vanish\xe2\x80\x99d. Hector, with a bound,\r\nSprings from his chariot on the trembling ground,\r\nIn clanging arms: he grasps in either hand\r\nA pointed lance, and speeds from band to band;\r\nRevives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,\r\nAnd wakes anew the dying flames of fight.\r\nThey stand to arms: the Greeks their onset dare,\r\nCondense their powers, and wait the coming war.\r\nNew force, new spirit, to each breast returns;\r\nThe fight renew\xe2\x80\x99d with fiercer fury burns:\r\nThe king leads on: all fix on him their eye,\r\nAnd learn from him to conquer, or to die.\r\n\r\nYe sacred nine! celestial Muses! tell,\r\nWho faced him first, and by his prowess fell?\r\nThe great Iphidamas, the bold and young,\r\nFrom sage Antenor and Theano sprung;\r\nWhom from his youth his grandsire Cisseus bred,\r\nAnd nursed in Thrace where snowy flocks are fed.\r\nScarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest,\r\nAnd early honour warm his generous breast,\r\nWhen the kind sire consign\xe2\x80\x99d his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s charms\r\n(Theano\xe2\x80\x99s sister) to his youthful arms.\r\nBut call\xe2\x80\x99d by glory to the wars of Troy,\r\nHe leaves untasted the first fruits of joy;\r\nFrom his loved bride departs with melting eyes,\r\nAnd swift to aid his dearer country flies.\r\nWith twelve black ships he reach\xe2\x80\x99d Percope\xe2\x80\x99s strand,\r\nThence took the long laborious march by land.\r\nNow fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs,\r\nTowering in arms, and braves the king of kings.\r\nAtrides first discharged the missive spear;\r\nThe Trojan stoop\xe2\x80\x99d, the javelin pass\xe2\x80\x99d in air.\r\nThen near the corslet, at the monarch\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\nWith all his strength, the youth directs his dart:\r\nBut the broad belt, with plates of silver bound,\r\nThe point rebated, and repell\xe2\x80\x99d the wound.\r\nEncumber\xe2\x80\x99d with the dart, Atrides stands,\r\nTill, grasp\xe2\x80\x99d with force, he wrench\xe2\x80\x99d it from his hands;\r\nAt once his weighty sword discharged a wound\r\nFull on his neck, that fell\xe2\x80\x99d him to the ground.\r\nStretch\xe2\x80\x99d in the dust the unhappy warrior lies,\r\nAnd sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes.\r\nOh worthy better fate! oh early slain!\r\nThy country\xe2\x80\x99s friend; and virtuous, though in vain!\r\nNo more the youth shall join his consort\xe2\x80\x99s side,\r\nAt once a virgin, and at once a bride!\r\nNo more with presents her embraces meet,\r\nOr lay the spoils of conquest at her feet,\r\nOn whom his passion, lavish of his store,\r\nBestow\xe2\x80\x99d so much, and vainly promised more!\r\nUnwept, uncover\xe2\x80\x99d, on the plain he lay,\r\nWhile the proud victor bore his arms away.\r\n\r\nCoon, Antenor\xe2\x80\x99s eldest hope, was nigh:\r\nTears, at the sight, came starting from his eye,\r\nWhile pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd the pale features now deform\xe2\x80\x99d with blood.\r\nThen, with his spear, unseen, his time he took,\r\nAim\xe2\x80\x99d at the king, and near his elbow strook.\r\nThe thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part,\r\nAnd through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.\r\nSurprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear\r\nOn Coon rushes with his lifted spear:\r\nHis brother\xe2\x80\x99s corpse the pious Trojan draws,\r\nAnd calls his country to assert his cause;\r\nDefends him breathless on the sanguine field,\r\nAnd o\xe2\x80\x99er the body spreads his ample shield.\r\nAtrides, marking an unguarded part,\r\nTransfix\xe2\x80\x99d the warrior with his brazen dart;\r\nProne on his brother\xe2\x80\x99s bleeding breast he lay,\r\nThe monarch\xe2\x80\x99s falchion lopp\xe2\x80\x99d his head away:\r\nThe social shades the same dark journey go,\r\nAnd join each other in the realms below.\r\n\r\nThe vengeful victor rages round the fields,\r\nWith every weapon art or fury yields:\r\nBy the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,\r\nWhole ranks are broken, and whole troops o\xe2\x80\x99erthrown.\r\nThis, while yet warm distill\xe2\x80\x99d the purple flood;\r\nBut when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood,\r\nThen grinding tortures his strong bosom rend,\r\nLess keen those darts the fierce Ilythiae send:\r\n(The powers that cause the teeming matron\xe2\x80\x99s throes,\r\nSad mothers of unutterable woes!)\r\nStung with the smart, all-panting with the pain,\r\nHe mounts the car, and gives his squire the rein;\r\nThen with a voice which fury made more strong,\r\nAnd pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO friends! O Greeks! assert your honours won;\r\nProceed, and finish what this arm begun:\r\nLo! angry Jove forbids your chief to stay,\r\nAnd envies half the glories of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: the driver whirls his lengthful thong;\r\nThe horses fly; the chariot smokes along.\r\nClouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow,\r\nAnd from their sides the foam descends in snow;\r\nShot through the battle in a moment\xe2\x80\x99s space,\r\nThe wounded monarch at his tent they place.\r\n\r\nNo sooner Hector saw the king retired,\r\nBut thus his Trojans and his aids he fired:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, all ye Dardan, all ye Lycian race!\r\nFamed in close fight, and dreadful face to face:\r\nNow call to mind your ancient trophies won,\r\nYour great forefathers\xe2\x80\x99 virtues, and your own.\r\nBehold, the general flies! deserts his powers!\r\nLo, Jove himself declares the conquest ours!\r\nNow on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds;\r\nAnd, sure of glory, dare immortal deeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith words like these the fiery chief alarms\r\nHis fainting host, and every bosom warms.\r\nAs the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear\r\nThe brindled lion, or the tusky bear:\r\nWith voice and hand provokes their doubting heart,\r\nAnd springs the foremost with his lifted dart:\r\nSo godlike Hector prompts his troops to dare;\r\nNor prompts alone, but leads himself the war.\r\nOn the black body of the foe he pours;\r\nAs from the cloud\xe2\x80\x99s deep bosom, swell\xe2\x80\x99d with showers,\r\nA sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps,\r\nDrives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.\r\nSay, Muse! when Jove the Trojan\xe2\x80\x99s glory crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nBeneath his arm what heroes bit the ground?\r\nAssaeus, Dolops, and Autonous died,\r\nOpites next was added to their side;\r\nThen brave Hipponous, famed in many a fight,\r\nOpheltius, Orus, sunk to endless night;\r\n\xc3\x86symnus, Agelaus; all chiefs of name;\r\nThe rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame.\r\nAs when a western whirlwind, charged with storms,\r\nDispels the gather\xe2\x80\x99d clouds that Notus forms:\r\nThe gust continued, violent and strong,\r\nRolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along;\r\nNow to the skies the foaming billows rears,\r\nNow breaks the surge, and wide the bottom bares:\r\nThus, raging Hector, with resistless hands,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99erturns, confounds, and scatters all their bands.\r\nNow the last ruin the whole host appals;\r\nNow Greece had trembled in her wooden walls;\r\nBut wise Ulysses call\xe2\x80\x99d Tydides forth,\r\nHis soul rekindled, and awaked his worth.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd stand we deedless, O eternal shame!\r\nTill Hector\xe2\x80\x99s arm involve the ships in flame?\r\nHaste, let us join, and combat side by side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe warrior thus, and thus the friend replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo martial toil I shun, no danger fear;\r\nLet Hector come; I wait his fury here.\r\nBut Jove with conquest crowns the Trojan train:\r\nAnd, Jove our foe, all human force is vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sigh\xe2\x80\x99d; but, sighing, raised his vengeful steel,\r\nAnd from his car the proud Thymbraeus fell:\r\nMolion, the charioteer, pursued his lord,\r\nHis death ennobled by Ulysses\xe2\x80\x99 sword.\r\nThere slain, they left them in eternal night,\r\nThen plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.\r\nSo two wild boars outstrip the following hounds,\r\nThen swift revert, and wounds return for wounds.\r\nStern Hector\xe2\x80\x99s conquests in the middle plain\r\nStood check\xe2\x80\x99d awhile, and Greece respired again.\r\n\r\nThe sons of Merops shone amidst the war;\r\nTowering they rode in one refulgent car:\r\nIn deep prophetic arts their father skill\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nHad warn\xe2\x80\x99d his children from the Trojan field.\r\nFate urged them on: the father warn\xe2\x80\x99d in vain;\r\nThey rush\xe2\x80\x99d to fight, and perish\xe2\x80\x99d on the plain;\r\nTheir breasts no more the vital spirit warms;\r\nThe stern Tydides strips their shining arms.\r\nHypirochus by great Ulysses dies,\r\nAnd rich Hippodamus becomes his prize.\r\nGreat Jove from Ide with slaughter fills his sight,\r\nAnd level hangs the doubtful scale of fight.\r\nBy Tydeus\xe2\x80\x99 lance Agastrophus was slain,\r\nThe far-famed hero of Paeonian strain;\r\nWing\xe2\x80\x99d with his fears, on foot he strove to fly,\r\nHis steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh:\r\nThrough broken orders, swifter than the wind,\r\nHe fled, but flying left his life behind.\r\nThis Hector sees, as his experienced eyes\r\nTraverse the files, and to the rescue flies;\r\nShouts, as he pass\xe2\x80\x99d, the crystal regions rend,\r\nAnd moving armies on his march attend.\r\nGreat Diomed himself was seized with fear,\r\nAnd thus bespoke his brother of the war:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMark how this way yon bending squadrons yield!\r\nThe storm rolls on, and Hector rules the field:\r\nHere stand his utmost force.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94The warrior said;\r\nSwift at the word his ponderous javelin fled;\r\nNor miss\xe2\x80\x99d its aim, but where the plumage danced\r\nRazed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.\r\nSafe in his helm (the gift of Phoebus\xe2\x80\x99 hands)\r\nWithout a wound the Trojan hero stands;\r\nBut yet so stunn\xe2\x80\x99d, that, staggering on the plain.\r\nHis arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain;\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er his dim sight the misty vapours rise,\r\nAnd a short darkness shades his swimming eyes.\r\nTydides followed to regain his lance;\r\nWhile Hector rose, recover\xe2\x80\x99d from the trance,\r\nRemounts his car, and herds amidst the crowd:\r\nThe Greek pursues him, and exults aloud:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce more thank Phoebus for thy forfeit breath,\r\nOr thank that swiftness which outstrips the death.\r\nWell by Apollo are thy prayers repaid,\r\nAnd oft that partial power has lent his aid.\r\nThou shall not long the death deserved withstand,\r\nIf any god assist Tydides\xe2\x80\x99 hand.\r\nFly then, inglorious! but thy flight, this day,\r\nWhole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHim, while he triumph\xe2\x80\x99d, Paris eyed from far,\r\n(The spouse of Helen, the fair cause of war;)\r\nAround the fields his feather\xe2\x80\x99d shafts he sent,\r\nFrom ancient Ilus\xe2\x80\x99 ruin\xe2\x80\x99d monument:\r\nBehind the column placed, he bent his bow,\r\nAnd wing\xe2\x80\x99d an arrow at the unwary foe;\r\nJust as he stoop\xe2\x80\x99d, Agastrophus\xe2\x80\x99s crest\r\nTo seize, and drew the corslet from his breast,\r\nThe bowstring twang\xe2\x80\x99d; nor flew the shaft in vain,\r\nBut pierced his foot, and nail\xe2\x80\x99d it to the plain.\r\nThe laughing Trojan, with a joyful spring.\r\nLeaps from his ambush, and insults the king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe bleeds! (he cries) some god has sped my dart!\r\nWould the same god had fix\xe2\x80\x99d it in his heart!\r\nSo Troy, relieved from that wide-wasting hand,\r\nShould breathe from slaughter and in combat stand:\r\nWhose sons now tremble at his darted spear,\r\nAs scatter\xe2\x80\x99d lambs the rushing lion fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dauntless thus: \xe2\x80\x9cThou conqueror of the fair,\r\nThou woman-warrior with the curling hair;\r\nVain archer! trusting to the distant dart,\r\nUnskill\xe2\x80\x99d in arms to act a manly part!\r\nThou hast but done what boys or women can;\r\nSuch hands may wound, but not incense a man.\r\nNor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave,\r\nA coward\xe2\x80\x99s weapon never hurts the brave.\r\nNot so this dart, which thou may\xe2\x80\x99st one day feel;\r\nFate wings its flight, and death is on the steel:\r\nWhere this but lights, some noble life expires;\r\nIts touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires,\r\nSteeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,\r\nAnd leaves such objects as distract the fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nUlysses hastens with a trembling heart,\r\nBefore him steps, and bending draws the dart:\r\nForth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds;\r\nTydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.\r\n\r\nNow on the field Ulysses stands alone,\r\nThe Greeks all fled, the Trojans pouring on;\r\nBut stands collected in himself, and whole,\r\nAnd questions thus his own unconquer\xe2\x80\x99d soul:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat further subterfuge, what hopes remain?\r\nWhat shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?\r\nWhat danger, singly if I stand the ground,\r\nMy friends all scatter\xe2\x80\x99d, all the foes around?\r\nYet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice,\r\nThe brave meets danger, and the coward flies.\r\nTo die or conquer, proves a hero\xe2\x80\x99s heart;\r\nAnd, knowing this, I know a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts revolving in his careful breast,\r\nNear, and more near, the shady cohorts press\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThese, in the warrior, their own fate enclose;\r\nAnd round him deep the steely circle grows.\r\nSo fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds\r\nOf shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds;\r\nHe grinds his ivory tusks; he foams with ire;\r\nHis sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire;\r\nBy these, by those, on every part is plied;\r\nAnd the red slaughter spreads on every side.\r\nPierced through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell;\r\nNext Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell;\r\nChersidamas, beneath the navel thrust,\r\nFalls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.\r\nCharops, the son of Hippasus, was near;\r\nUlysses reach\xe2\x80\x99d him with the fatal spear;\r\nBut to his aid his brother Socus flies,\r\nSocus the brave, the generous, and the wise.\r\nNear as he drew, the warrior thus began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO great Ulysses! much-enduring man!\r\nNot deeper skill\xe2\x80\x99d in every martial sleight,\r\nThan worn to toils, and active in the fight!\r\nThis day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,\r\nAnd end at once the great Hippasian race,\r\nOr thou beneath this lance must press the field.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield:\r\nThrough the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,\r\nPlough\xe2\x80\x99d half his side, and bared it to the bone.\r\nBy Pallas\xe2\x80\x99 care, the spear, though deep infix\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nStopp\xe2\x80\x99d short of life, nor with his entrails mix\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n\r\nThe wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew,\r\nThen furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace,\r\nFate calls thee hence and finish\xe2\x80\x99d is thy race.\r\nNor longer check my conquests on the foe;\r\nBut, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,\r\nAnd add one spectre to the realms below!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke, while Socus, seized with sudden fright,\r\nTrembling gave way, and turn\xe2\x80\x99d his back to flight;\r\nBetween his shoulders pierced the following dart,\r\nAnd held its passage through the panting heart:\r\nWide in his breast appear\xe2\x80\x99d the grisly wound;\r\nHe falls; his armour rings against the ground.\r\nThen thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFamed son of Hippasus! there press the plain;\r\nThere ends thy narrow span assign\xe2\x80\x99d by fate,\r\nHeaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date.\r\nAh, wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose;\r\nThy dying eyes no tender mother close;\r\nBut hungry birds shall tear those balls away,\r\nAnd hovering vultures scream around their prey.\r\nMe Greece shall honour, when I meet my doom,\r\nWith solemn funerals and a lasting tomb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen raging with intolerable smart,\r\nHe writhes his body, and extracts the dart.\r\nThe dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,\r\nAnd gladden\xe2\x80\x99d Troy with sight of hostile blood.\r\nNow troops on troops the fainting chief invade,\r\nForced he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.\r\nThrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;\r\nThe well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears:\r\nAlarm\xe2\x80\x99d, to Ajax Telamon he cried,\r\nWho shares his labours, and defends his side:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO friend! Ulysses\xe2\x80\x99 shouts invade my ear;\r\nDistressed he seems, and no assistance near;\r\nStrong as he is, yet one opposed to all,\r\nOppress\xe2\x80\x99d by multitudes, the best may fall.\r\nGreece robb\xe2\x80\x99d of him must bid her host despair,\r\nAnd feel a loss not ages can repair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, where the cry directs, his course he bends;\r\nGreat Ajax, like the god of war, attends,\r\nThe prudent chief in sore distress they found,\r\nWith bands of furious Trojans compass\xe2\x80\x99d round.223\r\nAs when some huntsman, with a flying spear,\r\nFrom the blind thicket wounds a stately deer;\r\nDown his cleft side, while fresh the blood distils,\r\nHe bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills,\r\nTill life\xe2\x80\x99s warm vapour issuing through the wound,\r\nWild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround:\r\nJust as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade,\r\nThe lion rushes through the woodland shade,\r\nThe wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away;\r\nThe lordly savage vindicates his prey.\r\nUlysses thus, unconquer\xe2\x80\x99d by his pains,\r\nA single warrior half a host sustains:\r\nBut soon as Ajax leaves his tower-like shield,\r\nThe scattered crowds fly frighted o\xe2\x80\x99er the field;\r\nAtrides\xe2\x80\x99 arm the sinking hero stays,\r\nAnd, saved from numbers, to his car conveys.\r\n\r\nVictorious Ajax plies the routed crew;\r\nAnd first Doryclus, Priam\xe2\x80\x99s son, he slew,\r\nOn strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound,\r\nAnd lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.\r\nAs when a torrent, swell\xe2\x80\x99d with wintry rains,\r\nPours from the mountains o\xe2\x80\x99er the deluged plains,\r\nAnd pines and oaks, from their foundations torn,\r\nA country\xe2\x80\x99s ruins! to the seas are borne:\r\nFierce Ajax thus o\xe2\x80\x99erwhelms the yielding throng;\r\nMen, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.\r\n\r\nBut Hector, from this scene of slaughter far,\r\nRaged on the left, and ruled the tide of war:\r\nLoud groans proclaim his progress through the plain,\r\nAnd deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain.\r\nThere Nestor and Idomeneus oppose\r\nThe warrior\xe2\x80\x99s fury; there the battle glows;\r\nThere fierce on foot, or from the chariot\xe2\x80\x99s height,\r\nHis sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.\r\nThe spouse of Helen, dealing darts around,\r\nHad pierced Machaon with a distant wound:\r\nIn his right shoulder the broad shaft appear\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd trembling Greece for her physician fear\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nTo Nestor then Idomeneus begun:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlory of Greece, old Neleus\xe2\x80\x99 valiant son!\r\nAscend thy chariot, haste with speed away,\r\nAnd great Machaon to the ships convey;\r\nA wise physician skill\xe2\x80\x99d our wounds to heal,\r\nIs more than armies to the public weal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nOld Nestor mounts the seat; beside him rode\r\nThe wounded offspring of the healing god.\r\nHe lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet\r\nShake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.\r\n\r\nBut now Cebriones, from Hector\xe2\x80\x99s car,\r\nSurvey\xe2\x80\x99d the various fortune of the war:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile here (he cried) the flying Greeks are slain,\r\nTrojans on Trojans yonder load the plain.\r\nBefore great Ajax see the mingled throng\r\nOf men and chariots driven in heaps along!\r\nI know him well, distinguish\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er the field\r\nBy the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.\r\nThither, O Hector, thither urge thy steeds,\r\nThere danger calls, and there the combat bleeds;\r\nThere horse and foot in mingled deaths unite,\r\nAnd groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus having spoke, the driver\xe2\x80\x99s lash resounds;\r\nSwift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds;\r\nStung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.\r\nThe horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs are bathed in heroes\xe2\x80\x99 gore,\r\nAnd, dashing, purple all the car before;\r\nThe groaning axle sable drops distils,\r\nAnd mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.\r\nHere Hector, plunging through the thickest fight,\r\nBroke the dark phalanx, and let in the light:\r\n(By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,\r\nThe ranks he scatter\xe2\x80\x99d and the troops o\xe2\x80\x99erthrown:)\r\nAjax he shuns, through all the dire debate,\r\nAnd fears that arm whose force he felt so late.\r\nBut partial Jove, espousing Hector\xe2\x80\x99s part,\r\nShot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian\xe2\x80\x99s heart;\r\nConfused, unnerved in Hector\xe2\x80\x99s presence grown,\r\nAmazed he stood, with terrors not his own.\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er his broad back his moony shield he threw,\r\nAnd, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.\r\nThus the grim lion his retreat maintains,\r\nBeset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains;\r\nRepulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,\r\nThough rage impels him, and though hunger calls,\r\nLong stands the showering darts, and missile fires;\r\nThen sourly slow the indignant beast retires:\r\nSo turn\xe2\x80\x99d stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhile his swoln heart at every step rebell\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n\r\nAs the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,\r\nIn some wide field by troops of boys pursued,\r\nThough round his sides a wooden tempest rain,\r\nCrops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;\r\nThick on his hide the hollow blows resound,\r\nThe patient animal maintains his ground,\r\nScarce from the field with all their efforts chased,\r\nAnd stirs but slowly when he stirs at last:\r\nOn Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung,\r\nThe strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;\r\nConfiding now in bulky strength he stands,\r\nNow turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;\r\nNow stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,\r\nAnd threats his followers with retorted eye.\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d as the bar between two warring powers,\r\nWhile hissing darts descend in iron showers:\r\nIn his broad buckler many a weapon stood,\r\nIts surface bristled with a quivering wood;\r\nAnd many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,\r\nMarks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.\r\nBut bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,\r\nAnd dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;\r\nWhose eager javelin launch\xe2\x80\x99d against the foe,\r\nGreat Apisaon felt the fatal blow;\r\nFrom his torn liver the red current flow\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd his slack knees desert their dying load.\r\nThe victor rushing to despoil the dead,\r\nFrom Paris\xe2\x80\x99 bow a vengeful arrow fled;\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d was the point, but broken was the wood.\r\nBack to the lines the wounded Greek retired,\r\nYet thus retreating, his associates fired:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay\xe2\x80\x99d?\r\nOh, turn to arms; \xe2\x80\x99tis Ajax claims your aid.\r\nThis hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,\r\nAnd this the last brave battle he shall wage:\r\nHaste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave\r\nThe warrior rescue, and your country save.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThus urged the chief: a generous troop appears,\r\nWho spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,\r\nTo guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand\r\nWith pious care, great Ajax joins the band:\r\nEach takes new courage at the hero\xe2\x80\x99s sight;\r\nThe hero rallies, and renews the fight.\r\n\r\nThus raged both armies like conflicting fires,\r\nWhile Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s chariot far from fight retires:\r\nHis coursers steep\xe2\x80\x99d in sweat, and stain\xe2\x80\x99d with gore,\r\nThe Greeks\xe2\x80\x99 preserver, great Machaon, bore.\r\nThat hour Achilles, from the topmost height\r\nOf his proud fleet, o\xe2\x80\x99erlook\xe2\x80\x99d the fields of fight;\r\nHis feasted eyes beheld around the plain\r\nThe Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.\r\nHis friend Machaon singled from the rest,\r\nA transient pity touch\xe2\x80\x99d his vengeful breast.\r\nStraight to Menoetius\xe2\x80\x99 much-loved son he sent:\r\nGraceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent;\r\nIn evil hour! Then fate decreed his doom,\r\nAnd fix\xe2\x80\x99d the date of all his woes to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy calls my friend? thy loved injunctions lay;\r\nWhate\xe2\x80\x99er thy will, Patroclus shall obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO first of friends! (Pelides thus replied)\r\nStill at my heart, and ever at my side!\r\nThe time is come, when yon despairing host\r\nShall learn the value of the man they lost:\r\nNow at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moan,\r\nAnd proud Atrides tremble on his throne.\r\nGo now to Nestor, and from him be taught\r\nWhat wounded warrior late his chariot brought:\r\nFor, seen at distance, and but seen behind,\r\nHis form recall\xe2\x80\x99d Machaon to my mind;\r\nNor could I, through yon cloud, discern his face,\r\nThe coursers pass\xe2\x80\x99d me with so swift a pace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hero said. His friend obey\xe2\x80\x99d with haste,\r\nThrough intermingled ships and tents he pass\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThe chiefs descending from their car he found:\r\nThe panting steeds Eurymedon unbound.\r\nThe warriors standing on the breezy shore,\r\nTo dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,\r\nHere paused a moment, while the gentle gale\r\nConvey\xe2\x80\x99d that freshness the cool seas exhale;\r\nThen to consult on farther methods went,\r\nAnd took their seats beneath the shady tent.\r\nThe draught prescribed, fair Hecamede prepares,\r\nArsinous\xe2\x80\x99 daughter, graced with golden hairs:\r\n(Whom to his aged arms, a royal slave,\r\nGreece, as the prize of Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom gave:)\r\nA table first with azure feet she placed;\r\nWhose ample orb a brazen charger graced;\r\nHoney new-press\xe2\x80\x99d, the sacred flour of wheat,\r\nAnd wholesome garlic, crown\xe2\x80\x99d the savoury treat,\r\nNext her white hand an antique goblet brings,\r\nA goblet sacred to the Pylian kings\r\nFrom eldest times: emboss\xe2\x80\x99d with studs of gold,\r\nTwo feet support it, and four handles hold;\r\nOn each bright handle, bending o\xe2\x80\x99er the brink,\r\nIn sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink:\r\nA massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,\r\nWhen the brisk nectar overlook\xe2\x80\x99d the brim.\r\nTemper\xe2\x80\x99d in this, the nymph of form divine\r\nPours a large portion of the Pramnian wine;\r\nWith goat\xe2\x80\x99s-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows,\r\nAnd last with flour the smiling surface strows:\r\nThis for the wounded prince the dame prepares:\r\nThe cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares:\r\nSalubrious draughts the warriors\xe2\x80\x99 thirst allay,\r\nAnd pleasing conference beguiles the day.\r\n\r\nMeantime Patroclus, by Achilles sent,\r\nUnheard approached, and stood before the tent.\r\nOld Nestor, rising then, the hero led\r\nTo his high seat: the chief refused and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis now no season for these kind delays;\r\nThe great Achilles with impatience stays.\r\nTo great Achilles this respect I owe;\r\nWho asks, what hero, wounded by the foe,\r\nWas borne from combat by thy foaming steeds?\r\nWith grief I see the great Machaon bleeds.\r\nThis to report, my hasty course I bend;\r\nThou know\xe2\x80\x99st the fiery temper of my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan then the sons of Greece (the sage rejoin\xe2\x80\x99d)\r\nExcite compassion in Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 mind?\r\nSeeks he the sorrows of our host to know?\r\nThis is not half the story of our woe.\r\nTell him, not great Machaon bleeds alone,\r\nOur bravest heroes in the navy groan,\r\nUlysses, Agamemnon, Diomed,\r\nAnd stern Eurypylus, already bleed.\r\nBut, ah! what flattering hopes I entertain!\r\nAchilles heeds not, but derides our pain:\r\nEven till the flames consume our fleet he stays,\r\nAnd waits the rising of the fatal blaze.\r\nChief after chief the raging foe destroys;\r\nCalm he looks on, and every death enjoys.\r\nNow the slow course of all-impairing time\r\nUnstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime;\r\nOh! had I still that strength my youth possess\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhen this bold arm the Epeian powers oppress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe bulls of Elis in glad triumph led,\r\nAnd stretch\xe2\x80\x99d the great Itymonaeus dead!\r\nThen from my fury fled the trembling swains,\r\nAnd ours was all the plunder of the plains:\r\nFifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,\r\nAs many goats, as many lowing kine:\r\nAnd thrice the number of unrivall\xe2\x80\x99d steeds,\r\nAll teeming females, and of generous breeds.\r\nThese, as my first essay of arms, I won;\r\nOld Neleus gloried in his conquering son.\r\nThus Elis forced, her long arrears restored,\r\nAnd shares were parted to each Pylian lord.\r\nThe state of Pyle was sunk to last despair,\r\nWhen the proud Elians first commenced the war:\r\nFor Neleus\xe2\x80\x99 sons Alcides\xe2\x80\x99 rage had slain;\r\nOf twelve bold brothers, I alone remain!\r\nOppress\xe2\x80\x99d, we arm\xe2\x80\x99d; and now this conquest gain\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nMy sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n(That large reprisal he might justly claim,\r\nFor prize defrauded, and insulted fame,\r\nWhen Elis\xe2\x80\x99 monarch, at the public course,\r\nDetain\xe2\x80\x99d his chariot, and victorious horse.)\r\nThe rest the people shared; myself survey\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe just partition, and due victims paid.\r\nThree days were past, when Elis rose to war,\r\nWith many a courser, and with many a car;\r\nThe sons of Actor at their army\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\n(Young as they were) the vengeful squadrons led.\r\nHigh on the rock fair Thryoessa stands,\r\nOur utmost frontier on the Pylian lands:\r\nNot far the streams of famed Alphaeus flow:\r\nThe stream they pass\xe2\x80\x99d, and pitch\xe2\x80\x99d their tents below.\r\nPallas, descending in the shades of night,\r\nAlarms the Pylians and commands the fight.\r\nEach burns for fame, and swells with martial pride,\r\nMyself the foremost; but my sire denied;\r\nFear\xe2\x80\x99d for my youth, exposed to stern alarms;\r\nAnd stopp\xe2\x80\x99d my chariot, and detain\xe2\x80\x99d my arms.\r\nMy sire denied in vain: on foot I fled\r\nAmidst our chariots; for the goddess led.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlong fair Arene\xe2\x80\x99s delightful plain\r\nSoft Minyas rolls his waters to the main:\r\nThere, horse and foot, the Pylian troops unite,\r\nAnd sheathed in arms, expect the dawning light.\r\nThence, ere the sun advanced his noon-day flame,\r\nTo great Alphaeus\xe2\x80\x99 sacred source we came.\r\nThere first to Jove our solemn rites were paid;\r\nAn untamed heifer pleased the blue-eyed maid;\r\nA bull, Alphaeus; and a bull was slain\r\nTo the blue monarch of the watery main.\r\nIn arms we slept, beside the winding flood,\r\nWhile round the town the fierce Epeians stood.\r\nSoon as the sun, with all-revealing ray,\r\nFlamed in the front of Heaven, and gave the day.\r\nBright scenes of arms, and works of war appear;\r\nThe nations meet; there Pylos, Elis here.\r\nThe first who fell, beneath my javelin bled;\r\nKing Augias\xe2\x80\x99 son, and spouse of Agamede:\r\n(She that all simples\xe2\x80\x99 healing virtues knew,\r\nAnd every herb that drinks the morning dew:)\r\nI seized his car, the van of battle led;\r\nThe Epeians saw, they trembled, and they fled.\r\nThe foe dispersed, their bravest warrior kill\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nFierce as the whirlwind now I swept the field:\r\nFull fifty captive chariots graced my train;\r\nTwo chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain.\r\nThen Actor\xe2\x80\x99s sons had died, but Neptune shrouds\r\nThe youthful heroes in a veil of clouds.\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er heapy shields, and o\xe2\x80\x99er the prostrate throng,\r\nCollecting spoils, and slaughtering all along,\r\nThrough wide Buprasian fields we forced the foes,\r\nWhere o\xe2\x80\x99er the vales the Olenian rocks arose;\r\nTill Pallas stopp\xe2\x80\x99d us where Alisium flows.\r\nEven there the hindmost of the rear I slay,\r\nAnd the same arm that led concludes the day;\r\nThen back to Pyle triumphant take my way.\r\nThere to high Jove were public thanks assign\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAs first of gods; to Nestor, of mankind.\r\nSuch then I was, impell\xe2\x80\x99d by youthful blood;\r\nSo proved my valour for my country\xe2\x80\x99s good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAchilles with unactive fury glows,\r\nAnd gives to passion what to Greece he owes.\r\nHow shall he grieve, when to the eternal shade\r\nHer hosts shall sink, nor his the power to aid!\r\nO friend! my memory recalls the day,\r\nWhen, gathering aids along the Grecian sea,\r\nI, and Ulysses, touch\xe2\x80\x99d at Phthia\xe2\x80\x99s port,\r\nAnd entered Peleus\xe2\x80\x99 hospitable court.\r\nA bull to Jove he slew in sacrifice,\r\nAnd pour\xe2\x80\x99d libations on the flaming thighs.\r\nThyself, Achilles, and thy reverend sire\r\nMenoetius, turn\xe2\x80\x99d the fragments on the fire.\r\nAchilles sees us, to the feast invites;\r\nSocial we sit, and share the genial rites.\r\nWe then explained the cause on which we came,\r\nUrged you to arms, and found you fierce for fame.\r\nYour ancient fathers generous precepts gave;\r\nPeleus said only this:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98My son! be brave.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMenoetius thus: \xe2\x80\x98Though great Achilles shine\r\nIn strength superior, and of race divine,\r\nYet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend;\r\nLet thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThus spoke your father at Thessalia\xe2\x80\x99s court:\r\nWords now forgot, though now of vast import.\r\nAh! try the utmost that a friend can say:\r\nSuch gentle force the fiercest minds obey;\r\nSome favouring god Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 heart may move;\r\nThough deaf to glory, he may yield to love.\r\nIf some dire oracle his breast alarm,\r\nIf aught from Heaven withhold his saving arm,\r\nSome beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,\r\nIf thou but lead the Myrmidonian line;\r\nClad in Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 arms, if thou appear,\r\nProud Troy may tremble, and desist from war;\r\nPress\xe2\x80\x99d by fresh forces, her o\xe2\x80\x99er-labour\xe2\x80\x99d train\r\nShall seek their walls, and Greece respire again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis touch\xe2\x80\x99d his generous heart, and from the tent\r\nAlong the shore with hasty strides he went;\r\nSoon as he came, where, on the crowded strand,\r\nThe public mart and courts of justice stand,\r\nWhere the tall fleet of great Ulysses lies,\r\nAnd altars to the guardian gods arise;\r\nThere, sad, he met the brave Euaemon\xe2\x80\x99s son,\r\nLarge painful drops from all his members run;\r\nAn arrow\xe2\x80\x99s head yet rooted in his wound,\r\nThe sable blood in circles mark\xe2\x80\x99d the ground.\r\nAs faintly reeling he confess\xe2\x80\x99d the smart,\r\nWeak was his pace, but dauntless was his heart.\r\nDivine compassion touch\xe2\x80\x99d Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 breast,\r\nWho, sighing, thus his bleeding friend address\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, hapless leaders of the Grecian host!\r\nThus must ye perish on a barbarous coast?\r\nIs this your fate, to glut the dogs with gore,\r\nFar from your friends, and from your native shore?\r\nSay, great Eurypylus! shall Greece yet stand?\r\nResists she yet the raging Hector\xe2\x80\x99s hand?\r\nOr are her heroes doom\xe2\x80\x99d to die with shame,\r\nAnd this the period of our wars and fame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEurypylus replies: \xe2\x80\x9cNo more, my friend;\r\nGreece is no more! this day her glories end;\r\nEven to the ships victorious Troy pursues,\r\nHer force increasing as her toil renews.\r\nThose chiefs, that used her utmost rage to meet,\r\nLie pierced with wounds, and bleeding in the fleet.\r\nBut, thou, Patroclus! act a friendly part,\r\nLead to my ships, and draw this deadly dart;\r\nWith lukewarm water wash the gore away;\r\nWith healing balms the raging smart allay,\r\nSuch as sage Chiron, sire of pharmacy,\r\nOnce taught Achilles, and Achilles thee.\r\nOf two famed surgeons, Podalirius stands\r\nThis hour surrounded by the Trojan bands;\r\nAnd great Machaon, wounded in his tent,\r\nNow wants that succour which so oft he lent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo him the chief: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then remains to do?\r\nThe event of things the gods alone can view.\r\nCharged by Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 great command I fly,\r\nAnd bear with haste the Pylian king\xe2\x80\x99s reply:\r\nBut thy distress this instant claims relief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe said, and in his arms upheld the chief.\r\nThe slaves their master\xe2\x80\x99s slow approach survey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd hides of oxen on the floor display\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nThere stretch\xe2\x80\x99d at length the wounded hero lay;\r\nPatroclus cut the forky steel away:\r\nThen in his hands a bitter root he bruised;\r\nThe wound he wash\xe2\x80\x99d, the styptic juice infused.\r\nThe closing flesh that instant ceased to glow,\r\nThe wound to torture, and the blood to flow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERCULES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XII.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE AT THE GRECIAN WALL.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks having retired into their intrenchments, Hector attempts to\r\nforce them; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch, Polydamas\r\nadvises to quit their chariots, and manage the attack on foot. The\r\nTrojans follow his counsel; and having divided their army into five\r\nbodies of foot, begin the assault. But upon the signal of an eagle with\r\na serpent in his talons, which appeared on the left hand of the\r\nTrojans, Polydamas endeavours to withdraw them again. This Hector\r\nopposes, and continues the attack; in which, after many actions,\r\nSarpedon makes the first breach in the wall. Hector also, casting a\r\nstone of vast size, forces open one of the gates, and enters at the\r\nhead of his troops, who victoriously pursue the Grecians even to their\r\nships.\r\n\r\nWhile thus the hero\xe2\x80\x99s pious cares attend\r\nThe cure and safety of his wounded friend,\r\nTrojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage,\r\nAnd mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.\r\nNor long the trench or lofty walls oppose;\r\nWith gods averse the ill-fated works arose;\r\nTheir powers neglected, and no victim slain,\r\nThe walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.\r\n\r\nWithout the gods, how short a period stands\r\nThe proudest monument of mortal hands!\r\nThis stood while Hector and Achilles raged,\r\nWhile sacred Troy the warring hosts engaged;\r\nBut when her sons were slain, her city burn\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd what survived of Greece to Greece return\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThen Neptune and Apollo shook the shore,\r\nThen Ida\xe2\x80\x99s summits pour\xe2\x80\x99d their watery store;\r\nRhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills,\r\nCaresus roaring down the stony hills,\r\n\xc3\x86sepus, Granicus, with mingled force,\r\nAnd Xanthus foaming from his fruitful source;\r\nAnd gulfy Simois, rolling to the main224\r\nHelmets, and shields, and godlike heroes slain:\r\nThese, turn\xe2\x80\x99d by Phoebus from their wonted ways,\r\nDeluged the rampire nine continual days;\r\nThe weight of waters saps the yielding wall,\r\nAnd to the sea the floating bulwarks fall.\r\nIncessant cataracts the Thunderer pours,\r\nAnd half the skies descend in sluicy showers.\r\nThe god of ocean, marching stern before,\r\nWith his huge trident wounds the trembling shore,\r\nVast stones and piles from their foundation heaves,\r\nAnd whelms the smoky ruin in the waves.\r\nNow smooth\xe2\x80\x99d with sand, and levell\xe2\x80\x99d by the flood,\r\nNo fragment tells where once the wonder stood;\r\nIn their old bounds the rivers roll again,\r\nShine \xe2\x80\x99twixt the hills, or wander o\xe2\x80\x99er the plain.225\r\n\r\nBut this the gods in later times perform;\r\nAs yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm;\r\nThe strokes yet echoed of contending powers;\r\nWar thunder\xe2\x80\x99d at the gates, and blood distain\xe2\x80\x99d the towers.\r\nSmote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay,\r\nClose by their hollow ships the Grecians lay:\r\nHector\xe2\x80\x99s approach in every wind they hear,\r\nAnd Hector\xe2\x80\x99s fury every moment fear.\r\nHe, like a whirlwind, toss\xe2\x80\x99d the scattering throng,\r\nMingled the troops, and drove the field along.\r\nSo \xe2\x80\x99midst the dogs and hunters\xe2\x80\x99 daring bands,\r\nFierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;\r\nArm\xe2\x80\x99d foes around a dreadful circle form,\r\nAnd hissing javelins rain an iron storm:\r\nHis powers untamed, their bold assault defy,\r\nAnd where he turns the rout disperse or die:\r\nHe foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,\r\nAnd if he falls, his courage makes him fall.\r\nWith equal rage encompass\xe2\x80\x99d Hector glows;\r\nExhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.\r\nThe panting steeds impatient fury breathe,\r\nAnd snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;\r\nJust at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,\r\nAnd the turf trembles, and the skies resound.\r\nEager they view\xe2\x80\x99d the prospect dark and deep,\r\nVast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep;\r\nThe bottom bare, (a formidable show!)\r\nAnd bristled thick with sharpen\xe2\x80\x99d stakes below.\r\nThe foot alone this strong defence could force,\r\nAnd try the pass impervious to the horse.\r\nThis saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,\r\nRestrain\xe2\x80\x99d great Hector, and this counsel gave:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!\r\nAnd you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!\r\nWhat entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,\r\nThe stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?\r\nNo pass through those, without a thousand wounds,\r\nNo space for combat in yon narrow bounds.\r\nProud of the favours mighty Jove has shown,\r\nOn certain dangers we too rashly run:\r\nIf \xe2\x80\x99tis his will our haughty foes to tame,\r\nOh may this instant end the Grecian name!\r\nHere, far from Argos, let their heroes fall,\r\nAnd one great day destroy and bury all!\r\nBut should they turn, and here oppress our train,\r\nWhat hopes, what methods of retreat remain?\r\nWedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,\r\nIn one promiscuous carnage crush\xe2\x80\x99d and bruised,\r\nAll Troy must perish, if their arms prevail,\r\nNor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.\r\nHear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed;\r\nBack from the trenches let your steeds be led;\r\nThen all alighting, wedged in firm array,\r\nProceed on foot, and Hector lead the way.\r\nSo Greece shall stoop before our conquering power,\r\nAnd this (if Jove consent) her fatal hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POLYDAMAS ADVISING HECTOR.]\r\n\r\nThis counsel pleased: the godlike Hector sprung\r\nSwift from his seat; his clanging armour rung.\r\nThe chief\xe2\x80\x99s example follow\xe2\x80\x99d by his train,\r\nEach quits his car, and issues on the plain,\r\nBy orders strict the charioteers enjoin\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nCompel the coursers to their ranks behind.\r\nThe forces part in five distinguish\xe2\x80\x99d bands,\r\nAnd all obey their several chiefs\xe2\x80\x99 commands.\r\nThe best and bravest in the first conspire,\r\nPant for the fight, and threat the fleet with fire:\r\nGreat Hector glorious in the van of these,\r\nPolydamas, and brave Cebriones.\r\nBefore the next the graceful Paris shines,\r\nAnd bold Alcathous, and Agenor joins.\r\nThe sons of Priam with the third appear,\r\nDeiphobus, and Helenas the seer;\r\nIn arms with these the mighty Asius stood,\r\nWho drew from Hyrtacus his noble blood,\r\nAnd whom Arisba\xe2\x80\x99s yellow coursers bore,\r\nThe coursers fed on Selle\xe2\x80\x99s winding shore.\r\nAntenor\xe2\x80\x99s sons the fourth battalion guide,\r\nAnd great \xc3\x86neas, born on fountful Ide.\r\nDivine Sarpedon the last band obey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhom Glaucus and Asteropaeus aid.\r\nNext him, the bravest, at their army\xe2\x80\x99s head,\r\nBut he more brave than all the hosts he led.\r\n\r\nNow with compacted shields in close array,\r\nThe moving legions speed their headlong way:\r\nAlready in their hopes they fire the fleet,\r\nAnd see the Grecians gasping at their feet.\r\n\r\nWhile every Trojan thus, and every aid,\r\nThe advice of wise Polydamas obey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAsius alone, confiding in his car,\r\nHis vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.\r\nUnhappy hero! and advised in vain;\r\nThose wheels returning ne\xe2\x80\x99er shall mark the plain;\r\nNo more those coursers with triumphant joy\r\nRestore their master to the gates of Troy!\r\nBlack death attends behind the Grecian wall,\r\nAnd great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall!\r\nFierce to the left he drives, where from the plain\r\nThe flying Grecians strove their ships to gain;\r\nSwift through the wall their horse and chariots pass\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe gates half-open\xe2\x80\x99d to receive the last.\r\nThither, exulting in his force, he flies:\r\nHis following host with clamours rend the skies:\r\nTo plunge the Grecians headlong in the main,\r\nSuch their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!\r\n\r\nTo guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,\r\nWho from the Lapiths\xe2\x80\x99 warlike race descend;\r\nThis Polypoetes, great Perithous\xe2\x80\x99 heir,\r\nAnd that Leonteus, like the god of war.\r\nAs two tall oaks, before the wall they rise;\r\nTheir roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies:\r\nWhose spreading arms with leafy honours crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nForbid the tempest, and protect the ground;\r\nHigh on the hills appears their stately form,\r\nAnd their deep roots for ever brave the storm.\r\nSo graceful these, and so the shock they stand\r\nOf raging Asius, and his furious band.\r\nOrestes, Acamas, in front appear,\r\nAnd OEnomaus and Thoon close the rear:\r\nIn vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,\r\nIn vain around them beat their hollow shields;\r\nThe fearless brothers on the Grecians call,\r\nTo guard their navies, and defend the wall.\r\nEven when they saw Troy\xe2\x80\x99s sable troops impend,\r\nAnd Greece tumultuous from her towers descend,\r\nForth from the portals rush\xe2\x80\x99d the intrepid pair,\r\nOpposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.\r\nSo two wild boars spring furious from their den,\r\nRoused with the cries of dogs and voice of men;\r\nOn every side the crackling trees they tear,\r\nAnd root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare;\r\nThey gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll,\r\nTill some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.\r\nAround their heads the whistling javelins sung,\r\nWith sounding strokes their brazen targets rung;\r\nFierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers\r\nMaintain\xe2\x80\x99d the walls, and mann\xe2\x80\x99d the lofty towers:\r\nTo save their fleet their last efforts they try,\r\nAnd stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.\r\n\r\nAs when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings\r\nThe dreary winter on his frozen wings;\r\nBeneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow\r\nDescend, and whiten all the fields below:\r\nSo fast the darts on either army pour,\r\nSo down the rampires rolls the rocky shower:\r\nHeavy, and thick, resound the batter\xe2\x80\x99d shields,\r\nAnd the deaf echo rattles round the fields.\r\n\r\nWith shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,\r\nThe frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn powers immortal who shall now believe?\r\nCan those too flatter, and can Jove deceive?\r\nWhat man could doubt but Troy\xe2\x80\x99s victorious power\r\nShould humble Greece, and this her fatal hour?\r\nBut like when wasps from hollow crannies drive,\r\nTo guard the entrance of their common hive,\r\nDarkening the rock, while with unwearied wings\r\nThey strike the assailants, and infix their stings;\r\nA race determined, that to death contend:\r\nSo fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend.\r\nGods!

your wings extend,\r\nOr where the suns arise, or where descend;\r\nTo right, to left, unheeded take your way,\r\nWhile I the dictates of high heaven obey.\r\nWithout a sign his sword the brave man draws,\r\nAnd asks no omen but his country\xe2\x80\x99s cause.\r\nBut why should\xe2\x80\x99st thou suspect the war\xe2\x80\x99s success?\r\nNone fears it more, as none promotes it less:\r\nThough all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,\r\nTrust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.\r\nTroy and her sons may find a general grave,\r\nBut thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.\r\nYet should the fears that wary mind suggests\r\nSpread their cold poison through our soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 breasts,\r\nMy javelin can revenge so base a part,\r\nAnd free the soul that quivers in thy heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFurious he spoke, and, rushing to the wall,\r\nCalls on his host; his host obey the call;\r\nWith ardour follow where their leader flies:\r\nRedoubling clamours thunder in the skies.\r\nJove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide,\r\nAnd drifts of dust the clouded navy hide;\r\nHe fills the Greeks with terror and dismay,\r\nAnd gives great Hector the predestined day.\r\nStrong in themselves, but stronger in his aid,\r\nClose to the works their rigid siege they laid.\r\nIn vain the mounds and massy beams defend,\r\nWhile these they undermine, and those they rend;\r\nUpheaved the piles that prop the solid wall;\r\nAnd heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.\r\nGreece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms;\r\nThe crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms,\r\nShield touching shield, a long refulgent row;\r\nWhence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.\r\nThe bold Ajaces fly from tower to tower,\r\nAnd rouse, with flame divine, the Grecian power.\r\nThe generous impulse every Greek obeys;\r\nThreats urge the fearful; and the valiant, praise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFellows in arms! whose deeds are known to fame,\r\nAnd you, whose ardour hopes an equal name!\r\nSince not alike endued with force or art;\r\nBehold a day when each may act his part!\r\nA day to fire the brave, and warm the cold,\r\nTo gain new glories, or augment the old.\r\nUrge those who stand, and those who faint, excite;\r\nDrown Hector\xe2\x80\x99s vaunts in loud exhorts of fight;\r\nConquest, not safety, fill the thoughts of all;\r\nSeek not your fleet, but sally from the wall;\r\nSo Jove once more may drive their routed train,\r\nAnd Troy lie trembling in her walls again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir ardour kindles all the Grecian powers;\r\nAnd now the stones descend in heavier showers.\r\nAs when high Jove his sharp artillery forms,\r\nAnd opes his cloudy magazine of storms;\r\nIn winter\xe2\x80\x99s bleak uncomfortable reign,\r\nA snowy inundation hides the plain;\r\nHe stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep;\r\nThen pours the silent tempest thick and deep;\r\nAnd first the mountain-tops are cover\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er,\r\nThen the green fields, and then the sandy shore;\r\nBent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen,\r\nAnd one bright waste hides all the works of men:\r\nThe circling seas, alone absorbing all,\r\nDrink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:\r\nSo from each side increased the stony rain,\r\nAnd the white ruin rises o\xe2\x80\x99er the plain.\r\n\r\nThus godlike Hector and his troops contend\r\nTo force the ramparts, and the gates to rend:\r\nNor Troy could conquer, nor the Greeks would yield,\r\nTill great Sarpedon tower\xe2\x80\x99d amid the field;\r\nFor mighty Jove inspired with martial flame\r\nHis matchless son, and urged him on to fame.\r\nIn arms he shines, conspicuous from afar,\r\nAnd bears aloft his ample shield in air;\r\nWithin whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nPonderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold:\r\nAnd while two pointed javelins arm his hands,\r\nMajestic moves along, and leads his Lycian bands.\r\n\r\nSo press\xe2\x80\x99d with hunger, from the mountain\xe2\x80\x99s brow\r\nDescends a lion on the flocks below;\r\nSo stalks the lordly savage o\xe2\x80\x99er the plain,\r\nIn sullen majesty, and stern disdain:\r\nIn vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,\r\nAnd shepherds gall him with an iron war;\r\nRegardless, furious, he pursues his way;\r\nHe foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.\r\n\r\nResolved alike, divine Sarpedon glows\r\nWith generous rage that drives him on the foes.\r\nHe views the towers, and meditates their fall,\r\nTo sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall;\r\nThen casting on his friend an ardent look,\r\nFired with the thirst of glory, thus he spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy boast we, Glaucus! our extended reign,226\r\nWhere Xanthus\xe2\x80\x99 streams enrich the Lycian plain,\r\nOur numerous herds that range the fruitful field,\r\nAnd hills where vines their purple harvest yield,\r\nOur foaming bowls with purer nectar crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nOur feasts enhanced with music\xe2\x80\x99s sprightly sound?\r\nWhy on those shores are we with joy survey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAdmired as heroes, and as gods obey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nUnless great acts superior merit prove,\r\nAnd vindicate the bounteous powers above?\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;\r\nThe first in valour, as the first in place;\r\nThat when with wondering eyes our martial bands\r\nBehold our deeds transcending our commands,\r\nSuch, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,\r\nWhom those that envy dare not imitate!\r\nCould all our care elude the gloomy grave,\r\nWhich claims no less the fearful and the brave,\r\nFor lust of fame I should not vainly dare\r\nIn fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.\r\nBut since, alas! ignoble age must come,\r\nDisease, and death\xe2\x80\x99s inexorable doom,\r\nThe life, which others pay, let us bestow,\r\nAnd give to fame what we to nature owe;\r\nBrave though we fall, and honour\xe2\x80\x99d if we live,\r\nOr let us glory gain, or glory give!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said; his words the listening chief inspire\r\nWith equal warmth, and rouse the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s fire;\r\nThe troops pursue their leaders with delight,\r\nRush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.\r\nMenestheus from on high the storm beheld\r\nThreatening the fort, and blackening in the field:\r\nAround the walls he gazed, to view from far\r\nWhat aid appear\xe2\x80\x99d to avert the approaching war,\r\nAnd saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood,\r\nOf fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.\r\nIn vain he calls; the din of helms and shields\r\nRings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,\r\nThe brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,\r\nHeaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground.\r\nThen thus to Thoos: \xe2\x80\x9cHence with speed (he said),\r\nAnd urge the bold Ajaces to our aid;\r\nTheir strength, united, best may help to bear\r\nThe bloody labours of the doubtful war:\r\nHither the Lycian princes bend their course,\r\nThe best and bravest of the hostile force.\r\nBut if too fiercely there the foes contend,\r\nLet Telamon, at least, our towers defend,\r\nAnd Teucer haste with his unerring bow\r\nTo share the danger, and repel the foe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSwift, at the word, the herald speeds along\r\nThe lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,\r\nAnd finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,\r\nOpposed in combat on the dusty shore.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe valiant leaders of our warlike bands!\r\nYour aid (said Thoos) Peteus\xe2\x80\x99 son demands;\r\nYour strength, united, best may help to bear\r\nThe bloody labours of the doubtful war:\r\nThither the Lycian princes bend their course,\r\nThe best and bravest of the hostile force.\r\nBut if too fiercely, here, the foes contend,\r\nAt least, let Telamon those towers defend,\r\nAnd Teucer haste with his unerring bow\r\nTo share the danger, and repel the foe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStraight to the fort great Ajax turn\xe2\x80\x99d his care,\r\nAnd thus bespoke his brothers of the war:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, valiant Lycomede! exert your might,\r\nAnd, brave Oileus, prove your force in fight;\r\nTo you I trust the fortune of the field,\r\nTill by this arm the foe shall be repell\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nThat done, expect me to complete the day.\r\nThen with his sevenfold shield he strode away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWith equal steps bold Teucer press\xe2\x80\x99d the shore,\r\nWhose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore.\r\n\r\nHigh on the walls appear\xe2\x80\x99d the Lycian powers,\r\nLike some black tempest gathering round the towers:\r\nThe Greeks, oppress\xe2\x80\x99d, their utmost force unite,\r\nPrepared to labour in the unequal fight:\r\nThe war renews, mix\xe2\x80\x99d shouts and groans arise;\r\nTumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.\r\nFierce Ajax first the advancing host invades,\r\nAnd sends the brave Epicles to the shades,\r\nSarpedon\xe2\x80\x99s friend. Across the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s way,\r\nRent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;\r\nIn modern ages not the strongest swain\r\nCould heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:\r\nHe poised, and swung it round; then toss\xe2\x80\x99d on high,\r\nIt flew with force, and labour\xe2\x80\x99d up the sky;\r\nFull on the Lycian\xe2\x80\x99s helmet thundering down,\r\nThe ponderous ruin crush\xe2\x80\x99d his batter\xe2\x80\x99d crown.\r\nAs skilful divers from some airy steep\r\nHeadlong descend, and shoot into the deep,\r\nSo falls Epicles; then in groans expires,\r\nAnd murmuring to the shades the soul retires.\r\n\r\nWhile to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew,\r\nFrom Teucer\xe2\x80\x99s hand a winged arrow flew;\r\nThe bearded shaft the destined passage found,\r\nAnd on his naked arm inflicts a wound.\r\nThe chief, who fear\xe2\x80\x99d some foe\xe2\x80\x99s insulting boast\r\nMight stop the progress of his warlike host,\r\nConceal\xe2\x80\x99d the wound, and, leaping from his height\r\nRetired reluctant from the unfinish\xe2\x80\x99d fight.\r\nDivine Sarpedon with regret beheld\r\nDisabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;\r\nHis beating breast with generous ardour glows,\r\nHe springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.\r\nAlcmaon first was doom\xe2\x80\x99d his force to feel;\r\nDeep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;\r\nThen from the yawning wound with fury tore\r\nThe spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:\r\nDown sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,\r\nHis brazen armour rings against the ground.\r\n\r\nSwift to the battlement the victor flies,\r\nTugs with full force, and every nerve applies:\r\nIt shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;\r\nThe rolling ruins smoke along the field.\r\nA mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;\r\nAnd, like a deluge, rushes in the war.\r\nAt once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow,\r\nAnd Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d in his belt the feather\xe2\x80\x99d weapon stood,\r\nAnd through his buckler drove the trembling wood;\r\nBut Jove was present in the dire debate,\r\nTo shield his offspring, and avert his fate.\r\nThe prince gave back, not meditating flight,\r\nBut urging vengeance, and severer fight;\r\nThen raised with hope, and fired with glory\xe2\x80\x99s charms,\r\nHis fainting squadrons to new fury warms.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast?\r\nYour former fame and ancient virtue lost!\r\nThe breach lies open, but your chief in vain\r\nAttempts alone the guarded pass to gain:\r\nUnite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:\r\nThe force of powerful union conquers all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;\r\nThey join, they thicken, and the assault renew:\r\nUnmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare,\r\nAnd fix\xe2\x80\x99d support the weight of all the war;\r\nNor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,\r\nNor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.\r\nAs on the confines of adjoining grounds,\r\nTwo stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;\r\nThey tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,\r\nOne foot, one inch, of the contended field;\r\nThus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;\r\nNor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.\r\nTheir manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,\r\nLoud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;\r\nThe copious slaughter covers all the shore,\r\nAnd the high ramparts drip with human gore.\r\n\r\nAs when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,\r\nFrom side to side the trembling balance nods,\r\n(While some laborious matron, just and poor,\r\nWith nice exactness weighs her woolly store,)\r\nTill poised aloft, the resting beam suspends\r\nEach equal weight; nor this, nor that, descends:227\r\nSo stood the war, till Hector\xe2\x80\x99s matchless might,\r\nWith fates prevailing, turn\xe2\x80\x99d the scale of fight.\r\nFierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,\r\nAnd fires his host with loud repeated cries.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdvance, ye Trojans! lend your valiant hands,\r\nHaste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThey hear, they run; and, gathering at his call,\r\nRaise scaling engines, and ascend the wall:\r\nAround the works a wood of glittering spears\r\nShoots up, and all the rising host appears.\r\nA ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw,\r\nPointed above, and rough and gross below:\r\nNot two strong men the enormous weight could raise,\r\nSuch men as live in these degenerate days:\r\nYet this, as easy as a swain could bear\r\nThe snowy fleece, he toss\xe2\x80\x99d, and shook in air;\r\nFor Jove upheld, and lighten\xe2\x80\x99d of its load\r\nThe unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.\r\nThus arm\xe2\x80\x99d, before the folded gates he came,\r\nOf massy substance, and stupendous frame;\r\nWith iron bars and brazen hinges strong,\r\nOn lofty beams of solid timber hung:\r\nThen thundering through the planks with forceful sway,\r\nDrives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way,\r\nThe folds are shatter\xe2\x80\x99d; from the crackling door\r\nLeap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.\r\nNow rushing in, the furious chief appears,\r\nGloomy as night! and shakes two shining spears:228\r\nA dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,\r\nAnd from his eye-balls flash\xe2\x80\x99d the living flame.\r\nHe moves a god, resistless in his course,\r\nAnd seems a match for more than mortal force.\r\nThen pouring after, through the gaping space,\r\nA tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place;\r\nThe Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly;\r\nThe shore is heap\xe2\x80\x99d with death, and tumult rends the sky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREEK ALTAR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XIII.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH BATTLE CONTINUED, IN WHICH NEPTUNE ASSISTS THE GREEKS: THE\r\nACTS OF IDOMENEUS.\r\n\r\nNeptune, concerned for the loss of the Grecians, upon seeing the\r\nfortification forced by Hector, (who had entered the gate near the\r\nstation of the Ajaces,) assumes the shape of Calchas, and inspires\r\nthose heroes to oppose him: then, in the form of one of the generals,\r\nencourages the other Greeks who had retired to their vessels. The\r\nAjaces form their troops in a close phalanx, and put a stop to Hector\r\nand the Trojans. Several deeds of valour are performed; Meriones,\r\nlosing his spear in the encounter, repairs to seek another at the tent\r\nof Idomeneus: this occasions a conversation between those two warriors,\r\nwho return together to the battle. Idomeneus signalizes his courage\r\nabove the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and Alcathous: Deiphobus\r\nand \xc3\x86neas march against him, and at length Idomeneus retires. Menelaus\r\nwounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The Trojans are repulsed on the\r\nleft wing; Hector still keeps his ground against the Ajaces, till,\r\nbeing galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas advises to\r\ncall a council of war: Hector approves of his advice, but goes first to\r\nrally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax again,\r\nand renews the attack.\r\n\r\nThe eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the\r\nGrecian wall and the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nWhen now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coast\r\nHad fix\xe2\x80\x99d great Hector and his conquering host,\r\nHe left them to the fates, in bloody fray\r\nTo toil and struggle through the well-fought day.\r\nThen turn\xe2\x80\x99d to Thracia from the field of fight\r\nThose eyes that shed insufferable light,\r\nTo where the Mysians prove their martial force,\r\nAnd hardy Thracians tame the savage horse;\r\nAnd where the far-famed Hippomolgian strays,\r\nRenown\xe2\x80\x99d for justice and for length of days;229\r\nThrice happy race! that, innocent of blood,\r\nFrom milk, innoxious, seek their simple food:\r\nJove sees delighted; and avoids the scene\r\nOf guilty Troy, of arms, and dying men:\r\nNo aid, he deems, to either host is given,\r\nWhile his high law suspends the powers of Heaven.\r\n\r\nMeantime the monarch of the watery main\r\nObserved the Thunderer, nor observed in vain.\r\nIn Samothracia, on a mountain\xe2\x80\x99s brow,\r\nWhose waving woods o\xe2\x80\x99erhung the deeps below,\r\nHe sat; and round him cast his azure eyes\r\nWhere Ida\xe2\x80\x99s misty tops confusedly rise;\r\nBelow, fair Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s glittering spires were seen;\r\nThe crowded ships and sable seas between.\r\nThere, from the crystal chambers of the main\r\nEmerged, he sat, and mourn\xe2\x80\x99d his Argives slain.\r\nAt Jove incensed, with grief and fury stung,\r\nProne down the rocky steep he rush\xe2\x80\x99d along;\r\nFierce as he pass\xe2\x80\x99d, the lofty mountains nod,\r\nThe forest shakes; earth trembled as he trod,\r\nAnd felt the footsteps of the immortal god.\r\nFrom realm to realm three ample strides he took,\r\nAnd, at the fourth, the distant \xc3\x86gae shook.\r\n\r\nFar in the bay his shining palace stands,\r\nEternal frame! not raised by mortal hands:\r\nThis having reach\xe2\x80\x99d, his brass-hoof\xe2\x80\x99d steeds he reins,\r\nFleet as the winds, and deck\xe2\x80\x99d with golden manes.\r\nRefulgent arms his mighty limbs infold,\r\nImmortal arms of adamant and gold.\r\nHe mounts the car, the golden scourge applies,\r\nHe sits superior, and the chariot flies:\r\nHis whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep;\r\nThe enormous monsters rolling o\xe2\x80\x99er the deep\r\nGambol around him on the watery way,\r\nAnd heavy whales in awkward measures play;\r\nThe sea subsiding spreads a level plain,\r\nExults, and owns the monarch of the main;\r\nThe parting waves before his coursers fly;\r\nThe wondering waters leave his axle dry.\r\n\r\nDeep in the liquid regions lies a cave,\r\nBetween where Tenedos the surges lave,\r\nAnd rocky Imbrus breaks the rolling wave:\r\nThere the great ruler of the azure round\r\nStopp\xe2\x80\x99d his swift chariot, and his steeds unbound,\r\nFed with ambrosial herbage from his hand,\r\nAnd link\xe2\x80\x99d their fetlocks with a golden band,\r\nInfrangible, immortal: there they stay:\r\nThe father of the floods pursues his way:\r\nWhere, like a tempest, darkening heaven around,\r\nOr fiery deluge that devours the ground,\r\nThe impatient Trojans, in a gloomy throng,\r\nEmbattled roll\xe2\x80\x99d, as Hector rush\xe2\x80\x99d along:\r\nTo the loud tumult and the barbarous cry\r\nThe heavens re-echo, and the shores reply:\r\nThey vow destruction to the Grecian name,\r\nAnd in their hopes the fleets already flame.\r\n\r\nBut Neptune, rising from the seas profound,\r\nThe god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground,\r\nNow wears a mortal form; like Calchas seen,\r\nSuch his loud voice, and such his manly mien;\r\nHis shouts incessant every Greek inspire,\r\nBut most the Ajaces, adding fire to fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEPTUNE RISING FROM THE SEA.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis yours, O warriors, all our hopes to raise:\r\nOh recollect your ancient worth and praise!\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis yours to save us, if you cease to fear;\r\nFlight, more than shameful, is destructive here.\r\nOn other works though Troy with fury fall,\r\nAnd pour her armies o\xe2\x80\x99er our batter\xe2\x80\x99d wall:\r\nThere Greece has strength: but this, this part o\xe2\x80\x99erthrown,\r\nHer strength were vain; I dread for you alone:\r\nHere Hector rages like the force of fire,\r\nVaunts of his gods, and calls high Jove his sire:\r\nIf yet some heavenly power your breast excite,\r\nBreathe in your hearts, and string your arms to fight,\r\nGreece yet may live, her threaten\xe2\x80\x99d fleet maintain:\r\nAnd Hector\xe2\x80\x99s force, and Jove\xe2\x80\x99s own aid, be vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen with his sceptre, that the deep controls,\r\nHe touch\xe2\x80\x99d the chiefs, and steel\xe2\x80\x99d their manly souls:\r\nStrength, not their own, the touch divine imparts,\r\nPrompts their light limbs, and swells their daring hearts.\r\nThen, as a falcon from the rocky height,\r\nHer quarry seen, impetuous at the sight,\r\nForth-springing instant, darts herself from high,\r\nShoots on the wing, and skims along the sky:\r\nSuch, and so swift, the power of ocean flew;\r\nThe wide horizon shut him from their view.\r\n\r\nThe inspiring god Oileus\xe2\x80\x99 active son\r\nPerceived the first, and thus to Telamon:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome god, my friend, some god in human form\r\nFavouring descends, and wills to stand the storm.\r\nNot Calchas this, the venerable seer;\r\nShort as he turned, I saw the power appear:\r\nI mark\xe2\x80\x99d his parting, and the steps he trod;\r\nHis own bright evidence reveals a god.\r\nEven now some energy divine I share,\r\nAnd seem to walk on wings, and tread in air!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith equal ardour (Telamon returns)\r\nMy soul is kindled, and my bosom burns;\r\nNew rising spirits all my force alarm,\r\nLift each impatient limb, and brace my arm.\r\nThis ready arm, unthinking, shakes the dart;\r\nThe blood pours back, and fortifies my heart:\r\nSingly, methinks, yon towering chief I meet,\r\nAnd stretch the dreadful Hector at my feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFull of the god that urged their burning breast,\r\nThe heroes thus their mutual warmth express\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nNeptune meanwhile the routed Greeks inspired;\r\nWho, breathless, pale, with length of labours tired,\r\nPant in the ships; while Troy to conquest calls,\r\nAnd swarms victorious o\xe2\x80\x99er their yielding walls:\r\nTrembling before the impending storm they lie,\r\nWhile tears of rage stand burning in their eye.\r\nGreece sunk they thought, and this their fatal hour;\r\nBut breathe new courage as they feel the power.\r\nTeucer and Leitus first his words excite;\r\nThen stern Peneleus rises to the fight;\r\nThoas, Deipyrus, in arms renown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd Merion next, the impulsive fury found;\r\nLast Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s son the same bold ardour takes,\r\nWhile thus the god the martial fire awakes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh lasting infamy, oh dire disgrace\r\nTo chiefs of vigorous youth, and manly race!\r\nI trusted in the gods, and you, to see\r\nBrave Greece victorious, and her navy free:\r\nAh, no\xe2\x80\x94the glorious combat you disclaim,\r\nAnd one black day clouds all her former fame.\r\nHeavens! what a prodigy these eyes survey,\r\nUnseen, unthought, till this amazing day!\r\nFly we at length from Troy\xe2\x80\x99s oft-conquer\xe2\x80\x99d bands?\r\nAnd falls our fleet by such inglorious hands?\r\nA rout undisciplined, a straggling train,\r\nNot born to glories of the dusty plain;\r\nLike frighted fawns from hill to hill pursued,\r\nA prey to every savage of the wood:\r\nShall these, so late who trembled at your name,\r\nInvade your camps, involve your ships in flame?\r\nA change so shameful, say, what cause has wrought?\r\nThe soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 baseness, or the general\xe2\x80\x99s fault?\r\nFools! will ye perish for your leader\xe2\x80\x99s vice;\r\nThe purchase infamy, and life the price?\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis not your cause, Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 injured fame:\r\nAnother\xe2\x80\x99s is the crime, but yours the shame.\r\nGrant that our chief offend through rage or lust,\r\nMust you be cowards, if your king\xe2\x80\x99s unjust?\r\nPrevent this evil, and your country save:\r\nSmall thought retrieves the spirits of the brave.\r\nThink, and subdue! on dastards dead to fame\r\nI waste no anger, for they feel no shame:\r\nBut you, the pride, the flower of all our host,\r\nMy heart weeps blood to see your glory lost!\r\nNor deem this day, this battle, all you lose;\r\nA day more black, a fate more vile, ensues.\r\nLet each reflect, who prizes fame or breath,\r\nOn endless infamy, on instant death:\r\nFor, lo! the fated time, the appointed shore:\r\nHark! the gates burst, the brazen barriers roar!\r\nImpetuous Hector thunders at the wall;\r\nThe hour, the spot, to conquer, or to fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words the Grecians\xe2\x80\x99 fainting hearts inspire,\r\nAnd listening armies catch the godlike fire.\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d at his post was each bold Ajax found,\r\nWith well-ranged squadrons strongly circled round:\r\nSo close their order, so disposed their fight,\r\nAs Pallas\xe2\x80\x99 self might view with fix\xe2\x80\x99d delight;\r\nOr had the god of war inclined his eyes,\r\nThe god of war had own\xe2\x80\x99d a just surprise.\r\nA chosen phalanx, firm, resolved as fate,\r\nDescending Hector and his battle wait.\r\nAn iron scene gleams dreadful o\xe2\x80\x99er the fields,\r\nArmour in armour lock\xe2\x80\x99d, and shields in shields,\r\nSpears lean on spears, on targets targets throng,\r\nHelms stuck to helms, and man drove man along.\r\nThe floating plumes unnumber\xe2\x80\x99d wave above,\r\nAs when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove;\r\nAnd levell\xe2\x80\x99d at the skies with pointing rays,\r\nTheir brandish\xe2\x80\x99d lances at each motion blaze.\r\n\r\nThus breathing death, in terrible array,\r\nThe close compacted legions urged their way:\r\nFierce they drove on, impatient to destroy;\r\nTroy charged the first, and Hector first of Troy.\r\nAs from some mountain\xe2\x80\x99s craggy forehead torn,\r\nA rock\xe2\x80\x99s round fragment flies, with fury borne,\r\n(Which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends,)\r\nPrecipitate the ponderous mass descends:\r\nFrom steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds;\r\nAt every shock the crackling wood resounds;\r\nStill gathering force, it smokes; and urged amain,\r\nWhirls, leaps, and thunders down, impetuous to the plain:\r\nThere stops\xe2\x80\x94so Hector. Their whole force he proved,230\r\nResistless when he raged, and, when he stopp\xe2\x80\x99d, unmoved.\r\n\r\nOn him the war is bent, the darts are shed,\r\nAnd all their falchions wave around his head:\r\nRepulsed he stands, nor from his stand retires;\r\nBut with repeated shouts his army fires.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrojans! be firm; this arm shall make your way\r\nThrough yon square body, and that black array:\r\nStand, and my spear shall rout their scattering power,\r\nStrong as they seem, embattled like a tower;\r\nFor he that Juno\xe2\x80\x99s heavenly bosom warms,\r\nThe first of gods, this day inspires our arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said; and roused the soul in every breast:\r\nUrged with desire of fame, beyond the rest,\r\nForth march\xe2\x80\x99d Deiphobus; but, marching, held\r\nBefore his wary steps his ample shield.\r\nBold Merion aim\xe2\x80\x99d a stroke (nor aim\xe2\x80\x99d it wide);\r\nThe glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide;\r\nBut pierced not through: unfaithful to his hand,\r\nThe point broke short, and sparkled in the sand.\r\nThe Trojan warrior, touch\xe2\x80\x99d with timely fear,\r\nOn the raised orb to distance bore the spear.\r\nThe Greek, retreating, mourn\xe2\x80\x99d his frustrate blow,\r\nAnd cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe;\r\nThen to the ships with surly speed he went,\r\nTo seek a surer javelin in his tent.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile with rising rage the battle glows,\r\nThe tumult thickens, and the clamour grows.\r\nBy Teucer\xe2\x80\x99s arm the warlike Imbrius bleeds,\r\nThe son of Mentor, rich in generous steeds.\r\nEre yet to Troy the sons of Greece were led,\r\nIn fair Pedaeus\xe2\x80\x99 verdant pastures bred,\r\nThe youth had dwelt, remote from war\xe2\x80\x99s alarms,\r\nAnd blest in bright Medesicaste\xe2\x80\x99s arms:\r\n(This nymph, the fruit of Priam\xe2\x80\x99s ravish\xe2\x80\x99d joy,\r\nAllied the warrior to the house of Troy:)\r\nTo Troy, when glory call\xe2\x80\x99d his arms, he came,\r\nAnd match\xe2\x80\x99d the bravest of her chiefs in fame:\r\nWith Priam\xe2\x80\x99s sons, a guardian of the throne,\r\nHe lived, beloved and honour\xe2\x80\x99d as his own.\r\nHim Teucer pierced between the throat and ear:\r\nHe groans beneath the Telamonian spear.\r\nAs from some far-seen mountain\xe2\x80\x99s airy crown,\r\nSubdued by steel, a tall ash tumbles down,\r\nAnd soils its verdant tresses on the ground;\r\nSo falls the youth; his arms the fall resound.\r\nThen Teucer rushing to despoil the dead,\r\nFrom Hector\xe2\x80\x99s hand a shining javelin fled:\r\nHe saw, and shunn\xe2\x80\x99d the death; the forceful dart\r\nSung on, and pierced Amphimachus\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\nCteatus\xe2\x80\x99 son, of Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s forceful line;\r\nVain was his courage, and his race divine!\r\nProstrate he falls; his clanging arms resound,\r\nAnd his broad buckler thunders on the ground.\r\nTo seize his beamy helm the victor flies,\r\nAnd just had fastened on the dazzling prize,\r\nWhen Ajax\xe2\x80\x99 manly arm a javelin flung;\r\nFull on the shield\xe2\x80\x99s round boss the weapon rung;\r\nHe felt the shock, nor more was doom\xe2\x80\x99d to feel,\r\nSecure in mail, and sheath\xe2\x80\x99d in shining steel.\r\nRepulsed he yields; the victor Greeks obtain\r\nThe spoils contested, and bear off the slain.\r\nBetween the leaders of the Athenian line,\r\n(Stichius the brave, Menestheus the divine,)\r\nDeplored Amphimachus, sad object! lies;\r\nImbrius remains the fierce Ajaces\xe2\x80\x99 prize.\r\nAs two grim lions bear across the lawn,\r\nSnatch\xe2\x80\x99d from devouring hounds, a slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d fawn.\r\nIn their fell jaws high-lifting through the wood,\r\nAnd sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood;\r\nSo these, the chief: great Ajax from the dead\r\nStrips his bright arms; Oileus lops his head:\r\nToss\xe2\x80\x99d like a ball, and whirl\xe2\x80\x99d in air away,\r\nAt Hector\xe2\x80\x99s feet the gory visage lay.\r\n\r\nThe god of ocean, fired with stern disdain,\r\nAnd pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain,\r\nInspires the Grecian hearts, confirms their hands,\r\nAnd breathes destruction on the Trojan bands.\r\nSwift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet,\r\nHe finds the lance-famed Idomen of Crete,\r\nHis pensive brow the generous care express\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nWith which a wounded soldier touch\xe2\x80\x99d his breast,\r\nWhom in the chance of war a javelin tore,\r\nAnd his sad comrades from the battle bore;\r\nHim to the surgeons of the camp he sent:\r\nThat office paid, he issued from his tent\r\nFierce for the fight: to whom the god begun,\r\nIn Thoas\xe2\x80\x99 voice, Andraemon\xe2\x80\x99s valiant son,\r\nWho ruled where Calydon\xe2\x80\x99s white rocks arise,\r\nAnd Pleuron\xe2\x80\x99s chalky cliffs emblaze the skies:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s now the imperious vaunt, the daring boast,\r\nOf Greece victorious, and proud Ilion lost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo whom the king: \xe2\x80\x9cOn Greece no blame be thrown;\r\nArms are her trade, and war is all her own.\r\nHer hardy heroes from the well-fought plains\r\nNor fear withholds, nor shameful sloth detains:\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis heaven, alas! and Jove\xe2\x80\x99s all-powerful doom,\r\nThat far, far distant from our native home\r\nWills us to fall inglorious! Oh, my friend!\r\nOnce foremost in the fight, still prone to lend\r\nOr arms or counsels, now perform thy best,\r\nAnd what thou canst not singly, urge the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus he: and thus the god whose force can make\r\nThe solid globe\xe2\x80\x99s eternal basis shake:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! never may he see his native land,\r\nBut feed the vultures on this hateful strand,\r\nWho seeks ignobly in his ships to stay,\r\nNor dares to combat on this signal day!\r\nFor this, behold! in horrid arms I shine,\r\nAnd urge thy soul to rival acts with mine.\r\nTogether let us battle on the plain;\r\nTwo, not the worst; nor even this succour vain:\r\nNot vain the weakest, if their force unite;\r\nBut ours, the bravest have confess\xe2\x80\x99d in fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis said, he rushes where the combat burns;\r\nSwift to his tent the Cretan king returns:\r\nFrom thence, two javelins glittering in his hand,\r\nAnd clad in arms that lighten\xe2\x80\x99d all the strand,\r\nFierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove,\r\nLike lightning bursting from the arm of Jove,\r\nWhich to pale man the wrath of heaven declares,\r\nOr terrifies the offending world with wars;\r\nIn streamy sparkles, kindling all the skies,\r\nFrom pole to pole the trail of glory flies:\r\nThus his bright armour o\xe2\x80\x99er the dazzled throng\r\nGleam\xe2\x80\x99d dreadful, as the monarch flash\xe2\x80\x99d along.\r\n\r\nHim, near his tent, Meriones attends;\r\nWhom thus he questions: \xe2\x80\x9cEver best of friends!\r\nO say, in every art of battle skill\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhat holds thy courage from so brave a field?\r\nOn some important message art thou bound,\r\nOr bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound?\r\nInglorious here, my soul abhors to stay,\r\nAnd glows with prospects of th\xe2\x80\x99 approaching day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO prince! (Meriones replies) whose care\r\nLeads forth the embattled sons of Crete to war;\r\nThis speaks my grief: this headless lance I wield;\r\nThe rest lies rooted in a Trojan shield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo whom the Cretan: \xe2\x80\x9cEnter, and receive\r\nThe wonted weapons; those my tent can give;\r\nSpears I have store, (and Trojan lances all,)\r\nThat shed a lustre round the illumined wall,\r\nThough I, disdainful of the distant war,\r\nNor trust the dart, nor aim the uncertain spear,\r\nYet hand to hand I fight, and spoil the slain;\r\nAnd thence these trophies, and these arms I gain.\r\nEnter, and see on heaps the helmets roll\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd high-hung spears, and shields that flame with gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor vain (said Merion) are our martial toils;\r\nWe too can boast of no ignoble spoils:\r\nBut those my ship contains; whence distant far,\r\nI fight conspicuous in the van of war,\r\nWhat need I more? If any Greek there be\r\nWho knows not Merion, I appeal to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this, Idomeneus: \xe2\x80\x9cThe fields of fight\r\nHave proved thy valour, and unconquer\xe2\x80\x99d might:\r\nAnd were some ambush for the foes design\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nEven there thy courage would not lag behind:\r\nIn that sharp service, singled from the rest,\r\nThe fear of each, or valour, stands confess\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nNo force, no firmness, the pale coward shows;\r\nHe shifts his place: his colour comes and goes:\r\nA dropping sweat creeps cold on every part;\r\nAgainst his bosom beats his quivering heart;\r\nTerror and death in his wild eye-balls stare;\r\nWith chattering teeth he stands, and stiffening hair,\r\nAnd looks a bloodless image of despair!\r\nNot so the brave\xe2\x80\x94still dauntless, still the same,\r\nUnchanged his colour, and unmoved his frame:\r\nComposed his thought, determined is his eye,\r\nAnd fix\xe2\x80\x99d his soul, to conquer or to die:\r\nIf aught disturb the tenour of his breast,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis but the wish to strike before the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn such assays thy blameless worth is known,\r\nAnd every art of dangerous war thy own.\r\nBy chance of fight whatever wounds you bore,\r\nThose wounds were glorious all, and all before;\r\nSuch as may teach, \xe2\x80\x99twas still thy brave delight\r\nT\xe2\x80\x99oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight.\r\nBut why, like infants, cold to honour\xe2\x80\x99s charms,\r\nStand we to talk, when glory calls to arms?\r\nGo\xe2\x80\x94from my conquer\xe2\x80\x99d spears the choicest take,\r\nAnd to their owners send them nobly back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSwift at the word bold Merion snatch\xe2\x80\x99d a spear\r\nAnd, breathing slaughter, follow\xe2\x80\x99d to the war.\r\nSo Mars armipotent invades the plain,\r\n(The wide destroyer of the race of man,)\r\nTerror, his best-beloved son, attends his course,\r\nArm\xe2\x80\x99d with stern boldness, and enormous force;\r\nThe pride of haughty warriors to confound,\r\nAnd lay the strength of tyrants on the ground:\r\nFrom Thrace they fly, call\xe2\x80\x99d to the dire alarms\r\nOf warring Phlegyans, and Ephyrian arms;\r\nInvoked by both, relentless they dispose,\r\nTo these glad conquest, murderous rout to those.\r\nSo march\xe2\x80\x99d the leaders of the Cretan train,\r\nAnd their bright arms shot horror o\xe2\x80\x99er the plain.\r\n\r\nThen first spake Merion: \xe2\x80\x9cShall we join the right,\r\nOr combat in the centre of the fight?\r\nOr to the left our wonted succour lend?\r\nHazard and fame all parts alike attend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the centre (Idomen replied:)\r\nOur ablest chieftains the main battle guide;\r\nEach godlike Ajax makes that post his care,\r\nAnd gallant Teucer deals destruction there,\r\nSkill\xe2\x80\x99d or with shafts to gall the distant field,\r\nOr bear close battle on the sounding shield.\r\nThese can the rage of haughty Hector tame:\r\nSafe in their arms, the navy fears no flame,\r\nTill Jove himself descends, his bolts to shed,\r\nAnd hurl the blazing ruin at our head.\r\nGreat must he be, of more than human birth,\r\nNor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth.\r\nHim neither rocks can crush, nor steel can wound,\r\nWhom Ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground.\r\nIn standing fight he mates Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 force,\r\nExcell\xe2\x80\x99d alone in swiftness in the course.\r\nThen to the left our ready arms apply,\r\nAnd live with glory, or with glory die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: and Merion to th\xe2\x80\x99 appointed place,\r\nFierce as the god of battles, urged his pace.\r\nSoon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld\r\nRush like a fiery torrent o\xe2\x80\x99er the field,\r\nTheir force embodied in a tide they pour;\r\nThe rising combat sounds along the shore.\r\nAs warring winds, in Sirius\xe2\x80\x99 sultry reign,\r\nFrom different quarters sweep the sandy plain;\r\nOn every side the dusty whirlwinds rise,\r\nAnd the dry fields are lifted to the skies:\r\nThus by despair, hope, rage, together driven,\r\nMet the black hosts, and, meeting, darken\xe2\x80\x99d heaven.\r\nAll dreadful glared the iron face of war,\r\nBristled with upright spears, that flash\xe2\x80\x99d afar;\r\nDire was the gleam of breastplates, helms, and shields,\r\nAnd polish\xe2\x80\x99d arms emblazed the flaming fields:\r\nTremendous scene! that general horror gave,\r\nBut touch\xe2\x80\x99d with joy the bosoms of the brave.\r\n\r\nSaturn\xe2\x80\x99s great sons in fierce contention vied,\r\nAnd crowds of heroes in their anger died.\r\nThe sire of earth and heaven, by Thetis won\r\nTo crown with glory Peleus\xe2\x80\x99 godlike son,\r\nWill\xe2\x80\x99d not destruction to the Grecian powers,\r\nBut spared awhile the destined Trojan towers;\r\nWhile Neptune, rising from his azure main,\r\nWarr\xe2\x80\x99d on the king of heaven with stern disdain,\r\nAnd breathed revenge, and fired the Grecian train.\r\nGods of one source, of one ethereal race,\r\nAlike divine, and heaven their native place;\r\nBut Jove the greater; first-born of the skies,\r\nAnd more than men, or gods, supremely wise.\r\nFor this, of Jove\xe2\x80\x99s superior might afraid,\r\nNeptune in human form conceal\xe2\x80\x99d his aid.\r\nThese powers enfold the Greek and Trojan train\r\nIn war and discord\xe2\x80\x99s adamantine chain,\r\nIndissolubly strong: the fatal tie\r\nIs stretch\xe2\x80\x99d on both, and close compell\xe2\x80\x99d they die.\r\n\r\nDreadful in arms, and grown in combats grey,\r\nThe bold Idomeneus controls the day.\r\nFirst by his hand Othryoneus was slain,\r\nSwell\xe2\x80\x99d with false hopes, with mad ambition vain;\r\nCall\xe2\x80\x99d by the voice of war to martial fame,\r\nFrom high Cabesus\xe2\x80\x99 distant walls he came;\r\nCassandra\xe2\x80\x99s love he sought, with boasts of power,\r\nAnd promised conquest was the proffer\xe2\x80\x99d dower.\r\nThe king consented, by his vaunts abused;\r\nThe king consented, but the fates refused.\r\nProud of himself, and of the imagined bride,\r\nThe field he measured with a larger stride.\r\nHim as he stalk\xe2\x80\x99d, the Cretan javelin found;\r\nVain was his breastplate to repel the wound:\r\nHis dream of glory lost, he plunged to hell;\r\nHis arms resounded as the boaster fell.\r\nThe great Idomeneus bestrides the dead;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thus (he cries) behold thy promise sped!\r\nSuch is the help thy arms to Ilion bring,\r\nAnd such the contract of the Phrygian king!\r\nOur offers now, illustrious prince! receive;\r\nFor such an aid what will not Argos give?\r\nTo conquer Troy, with ours thy forces join,\r\nAnd count Atrides\xe2\x80\x99 fairest daughter thine.\r\nMeantime, on further methods to advise,\r\nCome, follow to the fleet thy new allies;\r\nThere hear what Greece has on her part to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe spoke, and dragg\xe2\x80\x99d the gory corse away.\r\nThis Asius view\xe2\x80\x99d, unable to contain,\r\nBefore his chariot warring on the plain:\r\n(His crowded coursers, to his squire consign\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nImpatient panted on his neck behind:)\r\nTo vengeance rising with a sudden spring,\r\nHe hoped the conquest of the Cretan king.\r\nThe wary Cretan, as his foe drew near,\r\nFull on his throat discharged the forceful spear:\r\nBeneath the chin the point was seen to glide,\r\nAnd glitter\xe2\x80\x99d, extant at the further side.\r\nAs when the mountain-oak, or poplar tall,\r\nOr pine, fit mast for some great admiral,\r\nGroans to the oft-heaved axe, with many a wound,\r\nThen spreads a length of ruin o\xe2\x80\x99er the ground:\r\nSo sunk proud Asius in that dreadful day,\r\nAnd stretch\xe2\x80\x99d before his much-loved coursers lay.\r\nHe grinds the dust distain\xe2\x80\x99d with streaming gore,\r\nAnd, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore.\r\nDeprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear,\r\nStands all aghast his trembling charioteer,\r\nNor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away,\r\nBut falls transfix\xe2\x80\x99d, an unresisting prey:\r\nPierced by Antilochus, he pants beneath\r\nThe stately car, and labours out his breath.\r\nThus Asius\xe2\x80\x99 steeds (their mighty master gone)\r\nRemain the prize of Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s youthful son.\r\n\r\nStabb\xe2\x80\x99d at the sight, Deiphobus drew nigh,\r\nAnd made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.\r\nThe Cretan saw; and, stooping, caused to glance\r\nFrom his slope shield the disappointed lance.\r\nBeneath the spacious targe, (a blazing round,\r\nThick with bull-hides and brazen orbits bound,\r\nOn his raised arm by two strong braces stay\xe2\x80\x99d,)\r\nHe lay collected in defensive shade.\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er his safe head the javelin idly sung,\r\nAnd on the tinkling verge more faintly rung.\r\nEven then the spear the vigorous arm confess\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd pierced, obliquely, king Hypsenor\xe2\x80\x99s breast:\r\nWarm\xe2\x80\x99d in his liver, to the ground it bore\r\nThe chief, his people\xe2\x80\x99s guardian now no more!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot unattended (the proud Trojan cries)\r\nNor unrevenged, lamented Asius lies:\r\nFor thee, through hell\xe2\x80\x99s black portals stand display\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThis mate shall joy thy melancholy shade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeart-piercing anguish, at the haughty boast,\r\nTouch\xe2\x80\x99d every Greek, but Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s son the most.\r\nGrieved as he was, his pious arms attend,\r\nAnd his broad buckler shields his slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d friend:\r\nTill sad Mecistheus and Alastor bore\r\nHis honour\xe2\x80\x99d body to the tented shore.\r\n\r\nNor yet from fight Idomeneus withdraws;\r\nResolved to perish in his country\xe2\x80\x99s cause,\r\nOr find some foe, whom heaven and he shall doom\r\nTo wail his fate in death\xe2\x80\x99s eternal gloom.\r\nHe sees Alcathous in the front aspire:\r\nGreat \xc3\x86syetes was the hero\xe2\x80\x99s sire;\r\nHis spouse Hippodame, divinely fair,\r\nAnchises\xe2\x80\x99 eldest hope, and darling care:\r\nWho charm\xe2\x80\x99d her parents\xe2\x80\x99 and her husband\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nWith beauty, sense, and every work of art:\r\nHe once of Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s youth the loveliest boy,\r\nThe fairest she of all the fair of Troy.\r\nBy Neptune now the hapless hero dies,\r\nWho covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes,\r\nAnd fetters every limb: yet bent to meet\r\nHis fate he stands; nor shuns the lance of Crete.\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d as some column, or deep-rooted oak,\r\nWhile the winds sleep; his breast received the stroke.\r\nBefore the ponderous stroke his corslet yields,\r\nLong used to ward the death in fighting fields.\r\nThe riven armour sends a jarring sound;\r\nHis labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound,\r\nThe long lance shakes, and vibrates in the wound;\r\nFast flowing from its source, as prone he lay,\r\nLife\xe2\x80\x99s purple tide impetuous gush\xe2\x80\x99d away.\r\n\r\nThen Idomen, insulting o\xe2\x80\x99er the slain:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold, Deiphobus! nor vaunt in vain:\r\nSee! on one Greek three Trojan ghosts attend;\r\nThis, my third victim, to the shades I send.\r\nApproaching now thy boasted might approve,\r\nAnd try the prowess of the seed of Jove.\r\nFrom Jove, enamour\xe2\x80\x99d of a mortal dame,\r\nGreat Minos, guardian of his country, came:\r\nDeucalion, blameless prince, was Minos\xe2\x80\x99 heir;\r\nHis first-born I, the third from Jupiter:\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er spacious Crete, and her bold sons, I reign,\r\nAnd thence my ships transport me through the main:\r\nLord of a host, o\xe2\x80\x99er all my host I shine,\r\nA scourge to thee, thy father, and thy line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Trojan heard; uncertain or to meet,\r\nAlone, with venturous arms the king of Crete,\r\nOr seek auxiliar force; at length decreed\r\nTo call some hero to partake the deed,\r\nForthwith \xc3\x86neas rises to his thought:\r\nFor him in Troy\xe2\x80\x99s remotest lines he sought,\r\nWhere he, incensed at partial Priam, stands,\r\nAnd sees superior posts in meaner hands.\r\nTo him, ambitious of so great an aid,\r\nThe bold Deiphobus approach\xe2\x80\x99d, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Trojan prince, employ thy pious arms,\r\nIf e\xe2\x80\x99er thy bosom felt fair honour\xe2\x80\x99s charms.\r\nAlcathous dies, thy brother and thy friend;\r\nCome, and the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s loved remains defend.\r\nBeneath his cares thy early youth was train\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nOne table fed you, and one roof contain\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nThis deed to fierce Idomeneus we owe;\r\nHaste, and revenge it on th\xe2\x80\x99 insulting foe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc3\x86neas heard, and for a space resign\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nTo tender pity all his manly mind;\r\nThen rising in his rage, he burns to fight:\r\nThe Greek awaits him with collected might.\r\nAs the fell boar, on some rough mountain\xe2\x80\x99s head,\r\nArm\xe2\x80\x99d with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,\r\nWhen the loud rustics rise, and shout from far,\r\nAttends the tumult, and expects the war;\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er his bent back the bristly horrors rise;\r\nFires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes,\r\nHis foaming tusks both dogs and men engage;\r\nBut most his hunters rouse his mighty rage:\r\nSo stood Idomeneus, his javelin shook,\r\nAnd met the Trojan with a lowering look.\r\nAntilochus, Deipyrus, were near,\r\nThe youthful offspring of the god of war,\r\nMerion, and Aphareus, in field renown\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nTo these the warrior sent his voice around.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFellows in arms! your timely aid unite;\r\nLo, great \xc3\x86neas rushes to the fight:\r\nSprung from a god, and more than mortal bold;\r\nHe fresh in youth, and I in arms grown old.\r\nElse should this hand, this hour decide the strife,\r\nThe great dispute, of glory, or of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nTheir lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade\r\nAround the chief. \xc3\x86neas too demands\r\nTh\xe2\x80\x99 assisting forces of his native bands;\r\nParis, Deiphobus, Agenor, join;\r\n(Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)\r\nIn order follow all th\xe2\x80\x99 embodied train,\r\nLike Ida\xe2\x80\x99s flocks proceeding o\xe2\x80\x99er the plain;\r\nBefore his fleecy care, erect and bold,\r\nStalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.\r\nWith joy the swain surveys them, as he leads\r\nTo the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:\r\nSo joys \xc3\x86neas, as his native band\r\nMoves on in rank, and stretches o\xe2\x80\x99er the land.\r\n\r\nRound dread Alcathous now the battle rose;\r\nOn every side the steely circle grows;\r\nNow batter\xe2\x80\x99d breast-plates and hack\xe2\x80\x99d helmets ring,\r\nAnd o\xe2\x80\x99er their heads unheeded javelins sing.\r\nAbove the rest, two towering chiefs appear,\r\nThere great Idomeneus, \xc3\x86neas here.\r\nLike gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,\r\nAnd burn\xe2\x80\x99d to drench the ground with mutual blood.\r\nThe Trojan weapon whizz\xe2\x80\x99d along in air;\r\nThe Cretan saw, and shunn\xe2\x80\x99d the brazen spear:\r\nSent from an arm so strong, the missive wood\r\nStuck deep in earth, and quiver\xe2\x80\x99d where it stood.\r\nBut OEnomas received the Cretan\xe2\x80\x99s stroke;\r\nThe forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,\r\nIt ripp\xe2\x80\x99d his belly with a ghastly wound,\r\nAnd roll\xe2\x80\x99d the smoking entrails on the ground.\r\nStretch\xe2\x80\x99d on the plain, he sobs away his breath,\r\nAnd, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.\r\nThe victor from his breast the weapon tears;\r\nHis spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.\r\nThough now unfit an active war to wage,\r\nHeavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,\r\nHis listless limbs unable for the course,\r\nIn standing fight he yet maintains his force;\r\nTill faint with labour, and by foes repell\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nHis tired slow steps he drags from off the field.\r\nDeiphobus beheld him as he pass\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:\r\nThe javelin err\xe2\x80\x99d, but held its course along,\r\nAnd pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:\r\nThe son of Mars fell gasping on the ground,\r\nAnd gnash\xe2\x80\x99d the dust, all bloody with his wound.\r\n\r\nNor knew the furious father of his fall;\r\nHigh-throned amidst the great Olympian hall,\r\nOn golden clouds th\xe2\x80\x99 immortal synod sate;\r\nDetain\xe2\x80\x99d from bloody war by Jove and Fate.\r\n\r\nNow, where in dust the breathless hero lay,\r\nFor slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray,\r\nDeiphobus to seize his helmet flies,\r\nAnd from his temples rends the glittering prize;\r\nValiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,\r\nAnd on his loaded arm discharged his spear:\r\nHe drops the weight, disabled with the pain;\r\nThe hollow helmet rings against the plain.\r\nSwift as a vulture leaping on his prey,\r\nFrom his torn arm the Grecian rent away\r\nThe reeking javelin, and rejoin\xe2\x80\x99d his friends.\r\nHis wounded brother good Polites tends;\r\nAround his waist his pious arms he threw,\r\nAnd from the rage of battle gently drew:\r\nHim his swift coursers, on his splendid car,\r\nRapt from the lessening thunder of the war;\r\nTo Troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,\r\nAnd sprinkling, as he pass\xe2\x80\x99d, the sands with gore.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,\r\nHeaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.\r\nBold Aphareus by great \xc3\x86neas bled;\r\nAs toward the chief he turn\xe2\x80\x99d his daring head,\r\nHe pierced his throat; the bending head, depress\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nBeneath his helmet, nods upon his breast;\r\nHis shield reversed o\xe2\x80\x99er the fallen warrior lies,\r\nAnd everlasting slumber seals his eyes.\r\nAntilochus, as Thoon turn\xe2\x80\x99d him round,\r\nTranspierced his back with a dishonest wound:\r\nThe hollow vein, that to the neck extends\r\nAlong the chine, his eager javelin rends:\r\nSupine he falls, and to his social train\r\nSpreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.\r\nThv exulting victor, leaping where he lay,\r\nFrom his broad shoulders tore the spoils away;\r\nHis time observed; for closed by foes around,\r\nOn all sides thick the peals of arms resound.\r\nHis shield emboss\xe2\x80\x99d the ringing storm sustains,\r\nBut he impervious and untouch\xe2\x80\x99d remains.\r\n(Great Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s care preserved from hostile rage\r\nThis youth, the joy of Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s glorious age.)\r\nIn arms intrepid, with the first he fought,\r\nFaced every foe, and every danger sought;\r\nHis winged lance, resistless as the wind,\r\nObeys each motion of the master\xe2\x80\x99s mind!\r\nRestless it flies, impatient to be free,\r\nAnd meditates the distant enemy.\r\nThe son of Asius, Adamas, drew near,\r\nAnd struck his target with the brazen spear\r\nFierce in his front: but Neptune wards the blow,\r\nAnd blunts the javelin of th\xe2\x80\x99 eluded foe:\r\nIn the broad buckler half the weapon stood,\r\nSplinter\xe2\x80\x99d on earth flew half the broken wood.\r\nDisarm\xe2\x80\x99d, he mingled in the Trojan crew;\r\nBut Merion\xe2\x80\x99s spear o\xe2\x80\x99ertook him as he flew,\r\nDeep in the belly\xe2\x80\x99s rim an entrance found,\r\nWhere sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.\r\nBending he fell, and doubled to the ground,\r\nLay panting. Thus an ox in fetters tied,\r\nWhile death\xe2\x80\x99s strong pangs distend his labouring side,\r\nHis bulk enormous on the field displays;\r\nHis heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.\r\nThe spear the conqueror from his body drew,\r\nAnd death\xe2\x80\x99s dim shadows swarm before his view.\r\nNext brave Deipyrus in dust was laid:\r\nKing Helenus waved high the Thracian blade,\r\nAnd smote his temples with an arm so strong,\r\nThe helm fell off, and roll\xe2\x80\x99d amid the throng:\r\nThere for some luckier Greek it rests a prize;\r\nFor dark in death the godlike owner lies!\r\nRaging with grief, great Menelaus burns,\r\nAnd fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns:\r\nThat shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw;\r\nAnd this stood adverse with the bended bow:\r\nFull on his breast the Trojan arrow fell,\r\nBut harmless bounded from the plated steel.\r\nAs on some ample barn\xe2\x80\x99s well harden\xe2\x80\x99d floor,\r\n(The winds collected at each open door,)\r\nWhile the broad fan with force is whirl\xe2\x80\x99d around,\r\nLight leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground:\r\nSo from the steel that guards Atrides\xe2\x80\x99 heart,\r\nRepell\xe2\x80\x99d to distance flies the bounding dart.\r\nAtrides, watchful of the unwary foe,\r\nPierced with his lance the hand that grasp\xe2\x80\x99d the bow.\r\nAnd nailed it to the yew: the wounded hand\r\nTrail\xe2\x80\x99d the long lance that mark\xe2\x80\x99d with blood the sand:\r\nBut good Agenor gently from the wound\r\nThe spear solicits, and the bandage bound;\r\nA sling\xe2\x80\x99s soft wool, snatch\xe2\x80\x99d from a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s side,\r\nAt once the tent and ligature supplied.\r\n\r\nBehold! Pisander, urged by fate\xe2\x80\x99s decree,\r\nSprings through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee,\r\nGreat Menelaus! to enchance thy fame:\r\nHigh-towering in the front, the warrior came.\r\nFirst the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown;\r\nThe lance far distant by the winds was blown.\r\nNor pierced Pisander through Atrides\xe2\x80\x99 shield:\r\nPisander\xe2\x80\x99s spear fell shiver\xe2\x80\x99d on the field.\r\nNot so discouraged, to the future blind,\r\nVain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind;\r\nDauntless he rushes where the Spartan lord\r\nLike lightning brandish\xe2\x80\x99d his far beaming sword.\r\nHis left arm high opposed the shining shield:\r\nHis right beneath, the cover\xe2\x80\x99d pole-axe held;\r\n(An olive\xe2\x80\x99s cloudy grain the handle made,\r\nDistinct with studs, and brazen was the blade;)\r\nThis on the helm discharged a noble blow;\r\nThe plume dropp\xe2\x80\x99d nodding to the plain below,\r\nShorn from the crest. Atrides waved his steel:\r\nDeep through his front the weighty falchion fell;\r\nThe crashing bones before its force gave way;\r\nIn dust and blood the groaning hero lay:\r\nForced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,\r\nThe clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore.\r\nAnd fierce Atrides spurn\xe2\x80\x99d him as he bled,\r\nTore off his arms, and, loud-exulting, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus, Trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear;\r\nO race perfidious, who delight in war!\r\nAlready noble deeds ye have perform\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nA princess raped transcends a navy storm\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nIn such bold feats your impious might approve,\r\nWithout th\xe2\x80\x99 assistance, or the fear of Jove.\r\nThe violated rites, the ravish\xe2\x80\x99d dame;\r\nOur heroes slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d and our ships on flame,\r\nCrimes heap\xe2\x80\x99d on crimes, shall bend your glory down,\r\nAnd whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.\r\nO thou, great father! lord of earth and skies,\r\nAbove the thought of man, supremely wise!\r\nIf from thy hand the fates of mortals flow,\r\nFrom whence this favour to an impious foe?\r\nA godless crew, abandon\xe2\x80\x99d and unjust,\r\nStill breathing rapine, violence, and lust?\r\nThe best of things, beyond their measure, cloy;\r\nSleep\xe2\x80\x99s balmy blessing, love\xe2\x80\x99s endearing joy;\r\nThe feast, the dance; whate\xe2\x80\x99er mankind desire,\r\nEven the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.\r\nBut Troy for ever reaps a dire delight\r\nIn thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis said, he seized (while yet the carcase heaved)\r\nThe bloody armour, which his train received:\r\nThen sudden mix\xe2\x80\x99d among the warring crew,\r\nAnd the bold son of Pylaemenes slew.\r\nHarpalion had through Asia travell\xe2\x80\x99d far,\r\nFollowing his martial father to the war:\r\nThrough filial love he left his native shore,\r\nNever, ah, never to behold it more!\r\nHis unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling\r\nAgainst the target of the Spartan king;\r\nThus of his lance disarm\xe2\x80\x99d, from death he flies,\r\nAnd turns around his apprehensive eyes.\r\nHim, through the hip transpiercing as he fled,\r\nThe shaft of Merion mingled with the dead.\r\nBeneath the bone the glancing point descends,\r\nAnd, driving down, the swelling bladder rends:\r\nSunk in his sad companions\xe2\x80\x99 arms he lay,\r\nAnd in short pantings sobb\xe2\x80\x99d his soul away;\r\n(Like some vile worm extended on the ground;)\r\nWhile life\xe2\x80\x99s red torrent gush\xe2\x80\x99d from out the wound.\r\n\r\nHim on his car the Paphlagonian train\r\nIn slow procession bore from off the plain.\r\nThe pensive father, father now no more!\r\nAttends the mournful pomp along the shore;\r\nAnd unavailing tears profusely shed;\r\nAnd, unrevenged, deplored his offspring dead.\r\n\r\nParis from far the moving sight beheld,\r\nWith pity soften\xe2\x80\x99d and with fury swell\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nHis honour\xe2\x80\x99d host, a youth of matchless grace,\r\nAnd loved of all the Paphlagonian race!\r\nWith his full strength he bent his angry bow,\r\nAnd wing\xe2\x80\x99d the feather\xe2\x80\x99d vengeance at the foe.\r\nA chief there was, the brave Euchenor named,\r\nFor riches much, and more for virtue famed.\r\nWho held his seat in Corinth\xe2\x80\x99s stately town;\r\nPolydus\xe2\x80\x99 son, a seer of old renown.\r\nOft had the father told his early doom,\r\nBy arms abroad, or slow disease at home:\r\nHe climb\xe2\x80\x99d his vessel, prodigal of breath,\r\nAnd chose the certain glorious path to death.\r\nBeneath his ear the pointed arrow went;\r\nThe soul came issuing at the narrow vent:\r\nHis limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground,\r\nAnd everlasting darkness shades him round.\r\n\r\nNor knew great Hector how his legions yield,\r\n(Wrapp\xe2\x80\x99d in the cloud and tumult of the field:)\r\nWide on the left the force of Greece commands,\r\nAnd conquest hovers o\xe2\x80\x99er th\xe2\x80\x99 Achaian bands;\r\nWith such a tide superior virtue sway\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd he that shakes the solid earth gave aid.\r\nBut in the centre Hector fix\xe2\x80\x99d remain\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhere first the gates were forced, and bulwarks gain\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThere, on the margin of the hoary deep,\r\n(Their naval station where the Ajaces keep.\r\nAnd where low walls confine the beating tides,\r\nWhose humble barrier scarce the foe divides;\r\nWhere late in fight both foot and horse engaged,\r\nAnd all the thunder of the battle raged,)\r\nThere join\xe2\x80\x99d, the whole Boeotian strength remains,\r\nThe proud Iaonians with their sweeping trains,\r\nLocrians and Phthians, and th\xe2\x80\x99 Epaean force;\r\nBut join\xe2\x80\x99d, repel not Hector\xe2\x80\x99s fiery course.\r\nThe flower of Athens, Stichius, Phidas, led;\r\nBias and great Menestheus at their head:\r\nMeges the strong the Epaean bands controll\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd Dracius prudent, and Amphion bold:\r\nThe Phthians, Medon, famed for martial might,\r\nAnd brave Podarces, active in the fight.\r\nThis drew from Phylacus his noble line;\r\nIphiclus\xe2\x80\x99 son: and that (Oileus) thine:\r\n(Young Ajax\xe2\x80\x99 brother, by a stolen embrace;\r\nHe dwelt far distant from his native place,\r\nBy his fierce step-dame from his father\xe2\x80\x99s reign\r\nExpell\xe2\x80\x99d and exiled for her brother slain:)\r\nThese rule the Phthians, and their arms employ,\r\nMix\xe2\x80\x99d with Boeotians, on the shores of Troy.\r\n\r\nNow side by side, with like unwearied care,\r\nEach Ajax laboured through the field of war:\r\nSo when two lordly bulls, with equal toil,\r\nForce the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil,\r\nJoin\xe2\x80\x99d to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear,\r\nAnd trace large furrows with the shining share;\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow,\r\nAnd streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.\r\nA train of heroes followed through the field,\r\nWho bore by turns great Ajax\xe2\x80\x99 sevenfold shield;\r\nWhene\xe2\x80\x99er he breathed, remissive of his might,\r\nTired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.\r\nNo following troops his brave associate grace:\r\nIn close engagement an unpractised race,\r\nThe Locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield,\r\nNor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield;\r\nBut skill\xe2\x80\x99d from far the flying shaft to wing,\r\nOr whirl the sounding pebble from the sling,\r\nDexterous with these they aim a certain wound,\r\nOr fell the distant warrior to the ground.\r\nThus in the van the Telamonian train,\r\nThrong\xe2\x80\x99d in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain:\r\nFar in the rear the Locrian archers lie,\r\nWhose stones and arrows intercept the sky,\r\nThe mingled tempest on the foes they pour;\r\nTroy\xe2\x80\x99s scattering orders open to the shower.\r\n\r\nNow had the Greeks eternal fame acquired,\r\nAnd the gall\xe2\x80\x99d Ilians to their walls retired;\r\nBut sage Polydamas, discreetly brave,\r\nAddress\xe2\x80\x99d great Hector, and this counsel gave:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough great in all, thou seem\xe2\x80\x99st averse to lend\r\nImpartial audience to a faithful friend;\r\nTo gods and men thy matchless worth is known,\r\nAnd every art of glorious war thy own;\r\nBut in cool thought and counsel to excel,\r\nHow widely differs this from warring well!\r\nContent with what the bounteous gods have given,\r\nSeek not alone to engross the gifts of Heaven.\r\nTo some the powers of bloody war belong,\r\nTo some sweet music and the charm of song;\r\nTo few, and wondrous few, has Jove assign\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nA wise, extensive, all-considering mind;\r\nTheir guardians these, the nations round confess,\r\nAnd towns and empires for their safety bless.\r\nIf Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,\r\nAttend, O Hector! what I judge the best,\r\nSee, as thou mov\xe2\x80\x99st, on dangers dangers spread,\r\nAnd war\xe2\x80\x99s whole fury burns around thy head.\r\nBehold! distress\xe2\x80\x99d within yon hostile wall,\r\nHow many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall!\r\nWhat troops, out-number\xe2\x80\x99d, scarce the war maintain!\r\nAnd what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!\r\nHere cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings\r\nConvoked to council, weigh the sum of things.\r\nWhether (the gods succeeding our desires)\r\nTo yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires;\r\nOr quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,\r\nContented with the conquest of the day.\r\nI fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone,\r\nPay the large debt of last revolving sun;\r\nAchilles, great Achilles, yet remains\r\nOn yonder decks, and yet o\xe2\x80\x99erlooks the plains!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe counsel pleased; and Hector, with a bound,\r\nLeap\xe2\x80\x99d from his chariot on the trembling ground;\r\nSwift as he leap\xe2\x80\x99d his clanging arms resound.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo guard this post (he cried) thy art employ,\r\nAnd here detain the scatter\xe2\x80\x99d youth of Troy;\r\nWhere yonder heroes faint, I bend my way,\r\nAnd hasten back to end the doubtful day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis said, the towering chief prepares to go,\r\nShakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow,\r\nAnd seems a moving mountain topp\xe2\x80\x99d with snow.\r\nThrough all his host, inspiring force, he flies,\r\nAnd bids anew the martial thunder rise.\r\nTo Panthus\xe2\x80\x99 son, at Hector\xe2\x80\x99s high command\r\nHaste the bold leaders of the Trojan band:\r\nBut round the battlements, and round the plain,\r\nFor many a chief he look\xe2\x80\x99d, but look\xe2\x80\x99d in vain;\r\nDeiphobus, nor Helenus the seer,\r\nNor Asius\xe2\x80\x99 son, nor Asius\xe2\x80\x99 self appear:\r\nFor these were pierced with many a ghastly wound,\r\nSome cold in death, some groaning on the ground;\r\nSome low in dust, (a mournful object) lay;\r\nHigh on the wall some breathed their souls away.\r\n\r\nFar on the left, amid the throng he found\r\n(Cheering the troops, and dealing deaths around)\r\nThe graceful Paris; whom, with fury moved,\r\nOpprobrious thus, th\xe2\x80\x99 impatient chief reproved:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIll-fated Paris! slave to womankind,\r\nAs smooth of face as fraudulent of mind!\r\nWhere is Deiphobus, where Asius gone?\r\nThe godlike father, and th\xe2\x80\x99 intrepid son?\r\nThe force of Helenus, dispensing fate;\r\nAnd great Othryoneus, so fear\xe2\x80\x99d of late?\r\nBlack fate hang\xe2\x80\x99s o\xe2\x80\x99er thee from th\xe2\x80\x99 avenging gods,\r\nImperial Troy from her foundations nods;\r\nWhelm\xe2\x80\x99d in thy country\xe2\x80\x99s ruin shalt thou fall,\r\nAnd one devouring vengeance swallow all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Paris thus: \xe2\x80\x9cMy brother and my friend,\r\nThy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend,\r\nIn other battles I deserved thy blame,\r\nThough then not deedless, nor unknown to fame:\r\nBut since yon rampart by thy arms lay low,\r\nI scatter\xe2\x80\x99d slaughter from my fatal bow.\r\nThe chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain;\r\nOf all those heroes, two alone remain;\r\nDeiphobus, and Helenus the seer,\r\nEach now disabled by a hostile spear.\r\nGo then, successful, where thy soul inspires:\r\nThis heart and hand shall second all thy fires:\r\nWhat with this arm I can, prepare to know,\r\nTill death for death be paid, and blow for blow.\r\nBut \xe2\x80\x99tis not ours, with forces not our own\r\nTo combat: strength is of the gods alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThese words the hero\xe2\x80\x99s angry mind assuage:\r\nThen fierce they mingle where the thickest rage.\r\nAround Polydamas, distain\xe2\x80\x99d with blood,\r\nCebrion, Phalces, stern Orthaeus stood,\r\nPalmus, with Polypoetes the divine,\r\nAnd two bold brothers of Hippotion\xe2\x80\x99s line\r\n(Who reach\xe2\x80\x99d fair Ilion, from Ascania far,\r\nThe former day; the next engaged in war).\r\nAs when from gloomy clouds a whirlwind springs,\r\nThat bears Jove\xe2\x80\x99s thunder on its dreadful wings,\r\nWide o\xe2\x80\x99er the blasted fields the tempest sweeps;\r\nThen, gather\xe2\x80\x99d, settles on the hoary deeps;\r\nThe afflicted deeps tumultuous mix and roar;\r\nThe waves behind impel the waves before,\r\nWide rolling, foaming high, and tumbling to the shore:\r\nThus rank on rank, the thick battalions throng,\r\nChief urged on chief, and man drove man along.\r\nFar o\xe2\x80\x99er the plains, in dreadful order bright,\r\nThe brazen arms reflect a beamy light:\r\nFull in the blazing van great Hector shined,\r\nLike Mars commission\xe2\x80\x99d to confound mankind.\r\nBefore him flaming his enormous shield,\r\nLike the broad sun, illumined all the field;\r\nHis nodding helm emits a streamy ray;\r\nHis piercing eyes through all the battle stray,\r\nAnd, while beneath his targe he flash\xe2\x80\x99d along,\r\nShot terrors round, that wither\xe2\x80\x99d e\xe2\x80\x99en the strong.\r\n\r\nThus stalk\xe2\x80\x99d he, dreadful; death was in his look:\r\nWhole nations fear\xe2\x80\x99d; but not an Argive shook.\r\nThe towering Ajax, with an ample stride,\r\nAdvanced the first, and thus the chief defied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHector! come on; thy empty threats forbear;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis not thy arm, \xe2\x80\x99tis thundering Jove we fear:\r\nThe skill of war to us not idly given,\r\nLo! Greece is humbled, not by Troy, but Heaven.\r\nVain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts,\r\nTo force our fleet: the Greeks have hands and hearts.\r\nLong ere in flames our lofty navy fall,\r\nYour boasted city, and your god-built wall,\r\nShall sink beneath us, smoking on the ground;\r\nAnd spread a long unmeasured ruin round.\r\nThe time shall come, when, chased along the plain,\r\nEven thou shalt call on Jove, and call in vain;\r\nEven thou shalt wish, to aid thy desperate course,\r\nThe wings of falcons for thy flying horse;\r\nShalt run, forgetful of a warrior\xe2\x80\x99s fame,\r\nWhile clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs thus he spoke, behold, in open view,\r\nOn sounding wings a dexter eagle flew.\r\nTo Jove\xe2\x80\x99s glad omen all the Grecians rise,\r\nAnd hail, with shouts, his progress through the skies:\r\nFar-echoing clamours bound from side to side;\r\nThey ceased; and thus the chief of Troy replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom whence this menace, this insulting strain?\r\nEnormous boaster! doom\xe2\x80\x99d to vaunt in vain.\r\nSo may the gods on Hector life bestow,\r\n(Not that short life which mortals lead below,\r\nBut such as those of Jove\xe2\x80\x99s high lineage born,\r\nThe blue-eyed maid, or he that gilds the morn,)\r\nAs this decisive day shall end the fame\r\nOf Greece, and Argos be no more a name.\r\nAnd thou, imperious! if thy madness wait\r\nThe lance of Hector, thou shalt meet thy fate:\r\nThat giant-corse, extended on the shore,\r\nShall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said; and like a lion stalk\xe2\x80\x99d along:\r\nWith shouts incessant earth and ocean rung,\r\nSent from his following host: the Grecian train\r\nWith answering thunders fill\xe2\x80\x99d the echoing plain;\r\nA shout that tore heaven\xe2\x80\x99s concave, and, above,\r\nShook the fix\xe2\x80\x99d splendours of the throne of Jove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREEK EARRINGS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XIV.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.231\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNO DECEIVES JUPITER BY THE GIRDLE OF VENUS.\r\n\r\nNestor, sitting at the table with Machaon, is alarmed with the\r\nincreasing clamour of war, and hastens to Agamemnon; on his way he\r\nmeets that prince with Diomed and Ulysses, whom he informs of the\r\nextremity of the danger. Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by\r\nnight, which Ulysses withstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, that,\r\nwounded as they were, they should go forth and encourage the army with\r\ntheir presence, which advice is pursued. Juno, seeing the partiality of\r\nJupiter to the Trojans, forms a design to over-reach him: she sets off\r\nher charms with the utmost care, and (the more surely to enchant him)\r\nobtains the magic girdle of Venus. She then applies herself to the god\r\nof sleep, and, with some difficulty, persuades him to seal the eyes of\r\nJupiter: this done, she goes to mount Ida, where the god, at first\r\nsight, is ravished with her beauty, sinks in her embraces, and is laid\r\nasleep. Neptune takes advantage of his slumber, and succours the\r\nGreeks: Hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by Ajax,\r\nand carried off from the battle: several actions succeed, till the\r\nTrojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way: the lesser Ajax\r\nsignalizes himself in a particular manner.\r\n\r\nBut not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl,\r\nCould charm the cares of Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s watchful soul;\r\nHis startled ears the increasing cries attend;\r\nThen thus, impatient, to his wounded friend:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat new alarm, divine Machaon, say,\r\nWhat mix\xe2\x80\x99d events attend this mighty day?\r\nHark! how the shouts divide, and how they meet,\r\nAnd now come full, and thicken to the fleet!\r\nHere with the cordial draught dispel thy care,\r\nLet Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare,\r\nRefresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore;\r\nWhile I the adventures of the day explore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: and, seizing Thrasymedes\xe2\x80\x99 shield,\r\n(His valiant offspring,) hasten\xe2\x80\x99d to the field;\r\n(That day the son his father\xe2\x80\x99s buckler bore;)\r\nThen snatch\xe2\x80\x99d a lance, and issued from the door.\r\nSoon as the prospect open\xe2\x80\x99d to his view,\r\nHis wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew;\r\nDire disarray! the tumult of the fight,\r\nThe wall in ruins, and the Greeks in flight.\r\nAs when old ocean\xe2\x80\x99s silent surface sleeps,\r\nThe waves just heaving on the purple deeps:\r\nWhile yet the expected tempest hangs on high,\r\nWeighs down the cloud, and blackens in the sky,\r\nThe mass of waters will no wind obey;\r\nJove sends one gust, and bids them roll away.\r\nWhile wavering counsels thus his mind engage,\r\nFluctuates in doubtful thought the Pylian sage,\r\nTo join the host, or to the general haste;\r\nDebating long, he fixes on the last:\r\nYet, as he moves, the sight his bosom warms,\r\nThe field rings dreadful with the clang of arms,\r\nThe gleaming falchions flash, the javelins fly;\r\nBlows echo blows, and all or kill or die.\r\n\r\nHim, in his march, the wounded princes meet,\r\nBy tardy steps ascending from the fleet:\r\nThe king of men, Ulysses the divine,\r\nAnd who to Tydeus owes his noble line.232\r\n(Their ships at distance from the battle stand,\r\nIn lines advanced along the shelving strand:\r\nWhose bay, the fleet unable to contain\r\nAt length; beside the margin of the main,\r\nRank above rank, the crowded ships they moor:\r\nWho landed first, lay highest on the shore.)\r\nSupported on the spears, they took their way,\r\nUnfit to fight, but anxious for the day.\r\nNestor\xe2\x80\x99s approach alarm\xe2\x80\x99d each Grecian breast,\r\nWhom thus the general of the host address\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO grace and glory of the Achaian name;\r\nWhat drives thee, Nestor, from the field of fame?\r\nShall then proud Hector see his boast fulfill\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nOur fleets in ashes, and our heroes kill\xe2\x80\x99d?\r\nSuch was his threat, ah! now too soon made good,\r\nOn many a Grecian bosom writ in blood.\r\nIs every heart inflamed with equal rage\r\nAgainst your king, nor will one chief engage?\r\nAnd have I lived to see with mournful eyes\r\nIn every Greek a new Achilles rise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGerenian Nestor then: \xe2\x80\x9cSo fate has will\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nAnd all-confirming time has fate fulfill\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nNot he that thunders from the aerial bower,\r\nNot Jove himself, upon the past has power.\r\nThe wall, our late inviolable bound,\r\nAnd best defence, lies smoking on the ground:\r\nEven to the ships their conquering arms extend,\r\nAnd groans of slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d Greeks to heaven ascend.\r\nOn speedy measures then employ your thought\r\nIn such distress! if counsel profit aught:\r\nArms cannot much: though Mars our souls incite,\r\nThese gaping wounds withhold us from the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo him the monarch: \xe2\x80\x9cThat our army bends,\r\nThat Troy triumphant our high fleet ascends,\r\nAnd that the rampart, late our surest trust\r\nAnd best defence, lies smoking in the dust;\r\nAll this from Jove\xe2\x80\x99s afflictive hand we bear,\r\nWho, far from Argos, wills our ruin here.\r\nPast are the days when happier Greece was blest,\r\nAnd all his favour, all his aid confess\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nNow heaven averse, our hands from battle ties,\r\nAnd lifts the Trojan glory to the skies.\r\nCease we at length to waste our blood in vain,\r\nAnd launch what ships lie nearest to the main;\r\nLeave these at anchor, till the coming night:\r\nThen, if impetuous Troy forbear the fight,\r\nBring all to sea, and hoist each sail for flight.\r\nBetter from evils, well foreseen, to run,\r\nThan perish in the danger we may shun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus he. The sage Ulysses thus replies,\r\nWhile anger flash\xe2\x80\x99d from his disdainful eyes:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shameful words (unkingly as thou art)\r\nFall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart?\r\nOh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers,\r\nAnd thou the shame of any host but ours!\r\nA host, by Jove endued with martial might,\r\nAnd taught to conquer, or to fall in fight:\r\nAdventurous combats and bold wars to wage,\r\nEmploy\xe2\x80\x99d our youth, and yet employs our age.\r\nAnd wilt thou thus desert the Trojan plain?\r\nAnd have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?\r\nIn such base sentence if thou couch thy fear,\r\nSpeak it in whispers, lest a Greek should hear.\r\nLives there a man so dead to fame, who dares\r\nTo think such meanness, or the thought declares?\r\nAnd comes it even from him whose sovereign sway\r\nThe banded legions of all Greece obey?\r\nIs this a general\xe2\x80\x99s voice that calls to flight,\r\nWhile war hangs doubtful, while his soldiers fight?\r\nWhat more could Troy? What yet their fate denies\r\nThou givest the foe: all Greece becomes their prize.\r\nNo more the troops (our hoisted sails in view,\r\nThemselves abandon\xe2\x80\x99d) shall the fight pursue;\r\nBut thy ships flying, with despair shall see;\r\nAnd owe destruction to a prince like thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy just reproofs (Atrides calm replies)\r\nLike arrows pierce me, for thy words are wise.\r\nUnwilling as I am to lose the host,\r\nI force not Greece to quit this hateful coast;\r\nGlad I submit, whoe\xe2\x80\x99er, or young, or old,\r\nAught, more conducive to our weal, unfold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTydides cut him short, and thus began:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch counsel if you seek, behold the man\r\nWho boldly gives it, and what he shall say,\r\nYoung though he be, disdain not to obey:\r\nA youth, who from the mighty Tydeus springs,\r\nMay speak to councils and assembled kings.\r\nHear then in me the great OEnides\xe2\x80\x99 son,\r\nWhose honoured dust (his race of glory run)\r\nLies whelm\xe2\x80\x99d in ruins of the Theban wall;\r\nBrave in his life, and glorious in his fall.\r\nWith three bold sons was generous Prothous bless\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWho Pleuron\xe2\x80\x99s walls and Calydon possess\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nMelas and Agrius, but (who far surpass\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe rest in courage) OEneus was the last.\r\nFrom him, my sire. From Calydon expell\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nHe pass\xe2\x80\x99d to Argos, and in exile dwell\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThe monarch\xe2\x80\x99s daughter there (so Jove ordain\xe2\x80\x99d)\r\nHe won, and flourish\xe2\x80\x99d where Adrastus reign\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThere, rich in fortune\xe2\x80\x99s gifts, his acres till\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nBeheld his vines their liquid harvest yield,\r\nAnd numerous flocks that whiten\xe2\x80\x99d all the field.\r\nSuch Tydeus was, the foremost once in fame!\r\nNor lives in Greece a stranger to his name.\r\nThen, what for common good my thoughts inspire,\r\nAttend, and in the son respect the sire.\r\nThough sore of battle, though with wounds oppress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nLet each go forth, and animate the rest,\r\nAdvance the glory which he cannot share,\r\nThough not partaker, witness of the war.\r\nBut lest new wounds on wounds o\xe2\x80\x99erpower us quite,\r\nBeyond the missile javelin\xe2\x80\x99s sounding flight,\r\nSafe let us stand; and, from the tumult far,\r\nInspire the ranks, and rule the distant war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe added not: the listening kings obey,\r\nSlow moving on; Atrides leads the way.\r\nThe god of ocean (to inflame their rage)\r\nAppears a warrior furrowed o\xe2\x80\x99er with age;\r\nPress\xe2\x80\x99d in his own, the general\xe2\x80\x99s hand he took,\r\nAnd thus the venerable hero spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAtrides! lo! with what disdainful eye\r\nAchilles sees his country\xe2\x80\x99s forces fly;\r\nBlind, impious man! whose anger is his guide,\r\nWho glories in unutterable pride.\r\nSo may he perish, so may Jove disclaim\r\nThe wretch relentless, and o\xe2\x80\x99erwhelm with shame!\r\nBut Heaven forsakes not thee: o\xe2\x80\x99er yonder sands\r\nSoon shall thou view the scattered Trojan bands\r\nFly diverse; while proud kings, and chiefs renown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nDriven heaps on heaps, with clouds involved around\r\nOf rolling dust, their winged wheels employ\r\nTo hide their ignominious heads in Troy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke, then rush\xe2\x80\x99d amid the warrior crew,\r\nAnd sent his voice before him as he flew,\r\nLoud, as the shout encountering armies yield\r\nWhen twice ten thousand shake the labouring field;\r\nSuch was the voice, and such the thundering sound\r\nOf him whose trident rends the solid ground.\r\nEach Argive bosom beats to meet the fight,\r\nAnd grisly war appears a pleasing sight.\r\n\r\nMeantime Saturnia from Olympus\xe2\x80\x99 brow,\r\nHigh-throned in gold, beheld the fields below;\r\nWith joy the glorious conflict she survey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhere her great brother gave the Grecians aid.\r\nBut placed aloft, on Ida\xe2\x80\x99s shady height\r\nShe sees her Jove, and trembles at the sight.\r\nJove to deceive, what methods shall she try,\r\nWhat arts, to blind his all-beholding eye?\r\nAt length she trusts her power; resolved to prove\r\nThe old, yet still successful, cheat of love;\r\nAgainst his wisdom to oppose her charms,\r\nAnd lull the lord of thunders in her arms.\r\n\r\nSwift to her bright apartment she repairs,\r\nSacred to dress and beauty\xe2\x80\x99s pleasing cares:\r\nWith skill divine had Vulcan form\xe2\x80\x99d the bower,\r\nSafe from access of each intruding power.\r\nTouch\xe2\x80\x99d with her secret key, the doors unfold:\r\nSelf-closed, behind her shut the valves of gold.\r\nHere first she bathes; and round her body pours\r\nSoft oils of fragrance, and ambrosial showers:\r\nThe winds, perfumed, the balmy gale convey\r\nThrough heaven, through earth, and all the aerial way:\r\nSpirit divine! whose exhalation greets\r\nThe sense of gods with more than mortal sweets.\r\nThus while she breathed of heaven, with decent pride\r\nHer artful hands the radiant tresses tied;\r\nPart on her head in shining ringlets roll\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nPart o\xe2\x80\x99er her shoulders waved like melted gold.\r\nAround her next a heavenly mantle flow\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThat rich with Pallas\xe2\x80\x99 labour\xe2\x80\x99d colours glow\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nLarge clasps of gold the foldings gather\xe2\x80\x99d round,\r\nA golden zone her swelling bosom bound.\r\nFar-beaming pendants tremble in her ear,\r\nEach gem illumined with a triple star.\r\nThen o\xe2\x80\x99er her head she cast a veil more white\r\nThan new-fallen snow, and dazzling as the light.\r\nLast her fair feet celestial sandals grace.\r\nThus issuing radiant with majestic pace,\r\nForth from the dome the imperial goddess moves,\r\nAnd calls the mother of the smiles and loves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long (to Venus thus apart she cried)\r\nShall human strife celestial minds divide?\r\nAh yet, will Venus aid Saturnia\xe2\x80\x99s joy,\r\nAnd set aside the cause of Greece and Troy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet heaven\xe2\x80\x99s dread empress (Cytheraea said)\r\nSpeak her request, and deem her will obey\xe2\x80\x99d.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen grant me (said the queen) those conquering charms,\r\nThat power, which mortals and immortals warms,\r\nThat love, which melts mankind in fierce desires,\r\nAnd burns the sons of heaven with sacred fires!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor lo! I haste to those remote abodes,\r\nWhere the great parents, (sacred source of gods!)\r\nOcean and Tethys their old empire keep,\r\nOn the last limits of the land and deep.\r\nIn their kind arms my tender years were past;\r\nWhat time old Saturn, from Olympus cast,\r\nOf upper heaven to Jove resign\xe2\x80\x99d the reign,\r\nWhelm\xe2\x80\x99d under the huge mass of earth and main.\r\nFor strife, I hear, has made the union cease,\r\nWhich held so long that ancient pair in peace.\r\nWhat honour, and what love, shall I obtain,\r\nIf I compose those fatal feuds again;\r\nOnce more their minds in mutual ties engage,\r\nAnd, what my youth has owed, repay their age!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said. With awe divine, the queen of love\r\nObey\xe2\x80\x99d the sister and the wife of Jove;\r\nAnd from her fragrant breast the zone embraced,233\r\nWith various skill and high embroidery graced.\r\nIn this was every art, and every charm,\r\nTo win the wisest, and the coldest warm:\r\nFond love, the gentle vow, the gay desire,\r\nThe kind deceit, the still-reviving fire,\r\nPersuasive speech, and the more persuasive sighs,\r\nSilence that spoke, and eloquence of eyes.\r\nThis on her hand the Cyprian Goddess laid:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this, and with it all thy wish;\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\nWith smiles she took the charm; and smiling press\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe powerful cestus to her snowy breast.\r\n\r\nThen Venus to the courts of Jove withdrew;\r\nWhilst from Olympus pleased Saturnia flew.\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er high Pieria thence her course she bore,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er fair Emathia\xe2\x80\x99s ever-pleasing shore,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er Hemus\xe2\x80\x99 hills with snows eternal crown\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nNor once her flying foot approach\xe2\x80\x99d the ground.\r\nThen taking wing from Athos\xe2\x80\x99 lofty steep,\r\nShe speeds to Lemnos o\xe2\x80\x99er the rolling deep,\r\nAnd seeks the cave of Death\xe2\x80\x99s half-brother, Sleep.234\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSweet pleasing Sleep!

AND THE ACTS OF AJAX.\r\n\r\nJupiter, awaking, sees the Trojans repulsed from the trenches, Hector\r\nin a swoon, and Neptune at the head of the Greeks: he is highly\r\nincensed at the artifice of Juno, who appeases him by her submissions;\r\nshe is then sent to Iris and Apollo. Juno, repairing to the assembly of\r\nthe gods, attempts, with extraordinary address, to incense them against\r\nJupiter; in particular she touches Mars with a violent resentment; he\r\nis ready to take arms, but is prevented by Minerva. Iris and Apollo\r\nobey the orders of Jupiter; Iris commands Neptune to leave the battle,\r\nto which, after much reluctance and passion, he consents. Apollo\r\nreinspires Hector with vigour, brings him back to the battle, marches\r\nbefore him with his aegis, and turns the fortune of the fight. He\r\nbreaks down great part of the Grecian wall: the Trojans rush in, and\r\nattempt to fire the first line of the fleet, but are, as yet, repelled\r\nby the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.\r\n\r\nNow in swift flight they pass the trench profound,\r\nAnd many a chief lay gasping on the ground:\r\nThen stopp\xe2\x80\x99d and panted, where the chariots lie\r\nFear on their cheek, and horror in their eye.\r\nMeanwhile, awaken\xe2\x80\x99d from his dream of love,\r\nOn Ida\xe2\x80\x99s summit sat imperial Jove:\r\nRound the wide fields he cast a careful view,\r\nThere saw the Trojans fly, the Greeks pursue;\r\nThese proud in arms, those scatter\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er the plain\r\nAnd, \xe2\x80\x99midst the war, the monarch of the main.\r\nNot far, great Hector on the dust he spies,\r\n(His sad associates round with weeping eyes,)\r\nEjecting blood, and panting yet for breath,\r\nHis senses wandering to the verge of death.\r\nThe god beheld him with a pitying look,\r\nAnd thus, incensed, to fraudful Juno spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO thou, still adverse to the eternal will,\r\nFor ever studious in promoting ill!\r\nThy arts have made the godlike Hector yield,\r\nAnd driven his conquering squadrons from the field.\r\nCanst thou, unhappy in thy wiles, withstand\r\nOur power immense, and brave the almighty hand?\r\nHast thou forgot, when, bound and fix\xe2\x80\x99d on high,\r\nFrom the vast concave of the spangled sky,\r\nI hung thee trembling in a golden chain,\r\nAnd all the raging gods opposed in vain?\r\nHeadlong I hurl\xe2\x80\x99d them from the Olympian hall,\r\nStunn\xe2\x80\x99d in the whirl, and breathless with the fall.\r\nFor godlike Hercules these deeds were done,\r\nNor seem\xe2\x80\x99d the vengeance worthy such a son:\r\nWhen, by thy wiles induced, fierce Boreas toss\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe shipwreck\xe2\x80\x99d hero on the Coan coast,\r\nHim through a thousand forms of death I bore,\r\nAnd sent to Argos, and his native shore.\r\nHear this, remember, and our fury dread,\r\nNor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head;\r\nLest arts and blandishments successless prove,\r\nThy soft deceits, and well-dissembled love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Thunderer spoke: imperial Juno mourn\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd, trembling, these submissive words return\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy every oath that powers immortal ties,\r\nThe foodful earth and all-infolding skies;\r\nBy thy black waves, tremendous Styx! that flow\r\nThrough the drear realms of gliding ghosts below;\r\nBy the dread honours of thy sacred head,\r\nAnd that unbroken vow, our virgin bed!\r\nNot by my arts the ruler of the main\r\nSteeps Troy in blood, and ranges round the plain:\r\nBy his own ardour, his own pity sway\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nTo help his Greeks, he fought and disobey\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nElse had thy Juno better counsels given,\r\nAnd taught submission to the sire of heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink\xe2\x80\x99st thou with me? fair empress of the skies!\r\n(The immortal father with a smile replies;)\r\nThen soon the haughty sea-god shall obey,\r\nNor dare to act but when we point the way.\r\nIf truth inspires thy tongue, proclaim our will\r\nTo yon bright synod on the Olympian hill;\r\nOur high decree let various Iris know,\r\nAnd call the god that bears the silver bow.\r\nLet her descend, and from the embattled plain\r\nCommand the sea-god to his watery reign:\r\nWhile Phoebus hastes great Hector to prepare\r\nTo rise afresh, and once more wake the war:\r\nHis labouring bosom re-inspires with breath,\r\nAnd calls his senses from the verge of death.\r\nGreece chased by Troy, even to Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 fleet,\r\nShall fall by thousands at the hero\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\nHe, not untouch\xe2\x80\x99d with pity, to the plain\r\nShall send Patroclus, but shall send in vain.\r\nWhat youths he slaughters under Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s walls!\r\nEven my loved son, divine Sarpedon, falls!\r\nVanquish\xe2\x80\x99d at last by Hector\xe2\x80\x99s lance he lies.\r\nThen, nor till then, shall great Achilles rise:\r\nAnd lo! that instant, godlike Hector dies.\r\nFrom that great hour the war\xe2\x80\x99s whole fortune turns,\r\nPallas assists, and lofty Ilion burns.\r\nNot till that day shall Jove relax his rage,\r\nNor one of all the heavenly host engage\r\nIn aid of Greece. The promise of a god\r\nI gave, and seal\xe2\x80\x99d it with the almighty nod,\r\nAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 glory to the stars to raise;\r\nSuch was our word, and fate the word obeys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trembling queen (the almighty order given)\r\nSwift from the Idaean summit shot to heaven.\r\nAs some wayfaring man, who wanders o\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nIn thought a length of lands he trod before,\r\nSends forth his active mind from place to place,\r\nJoins hill to dale, and measures space with space:\r\nSo swift flew Juno to the bless\xe2\x80\x99d abodes,\r\nIf thought of man can match the speed of gods.\r\nThere sat the powers in awful synod placed;\r\nThey bow\xe2\x80\x99d, and made obeisance as she pass\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThrough all the brazen dome: with goblets crown\xe2\x80\x99d239\r\nThey hail her queen; the nectar streams around.\r\nFair Themis first presents the golden bowl,\r\nAnd anxious asks what cares disturb her soul?\r\n\r\nTo whom the white-arm\xe2\x80\x99d goddess thus replies:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough thou know\xe2\x80\x99st the tyrant of the skies,\r\nSeverely bent his purpose to fulfil,\r\nUnmoved his mind, and unrestrain\xe2\x80\x99d his will.\r\nGo thou, the feasts of heaven attend thy call;\r\nBid the crown\xe2\x80\x99d nectar circle round the hall:\r\nBut Jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome\r\nSuch stern decrees, such threaten\xe2\x80\x99d woes to come,\r\nAs soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise,\r\nAnd damp the eternal banquets of the skies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe goddess said, and sullen took her place;\r\nBlack horror sadden\xe2\x80\x99d each celestial face.\r\nTo see the gathering grudge in every breast,\r\nSmiles on her lips a spleenful joy express\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nWhile on her wrinkled front, and eyebrow bent,\r\nSat stedfast care, and lowering discontent.\r\nThus she proceeds\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAttend, ye powers above!\r\nBut know, \xe2\x80\x99tis madness to contest with Jove:\r\nSupreme he sits; and sees, in pride of sway.\r\nYour vassal godheads grudgingly obey:\r\nFierce in the majesty of power controls;\r\nShakes all the thrones of heaven, and bends the poles.\r\nSubmiss, immortals! all he wills, obey:\r\nAnd thou, great Mars, begin and show the way.\r\nBehold Ascalaphus! behold him die,\r\nBut dare not murmur, dare not vent a sigh;\r\nThy own loved boasted offspring lies o\xe2\x80\x99erthrown,\r\nIf that loved boasted offspring be thy own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStern Mars, with anguish for his slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d son,\r\nSmote his rebelling breast, and fierce begun:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus then, immortals! thus shall Mars obey;\r\nForgive me, gods, and yield my vengeance way:\r\nDescending first to yon forbidden plain,\r\nThe god of battles dares avenge the slain;\r\nDares, though the thunder bursting o\xe2\x80\x99er my head\r\nShould hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he gives command to Fear and Flight\r\nTo join his rapid coursers for the fight:\r\nThen grim in arms, with hasty vengeance flies;\r\nArms that reflect a radiance through the skies.\r\nAnd now had Jove, by bold rebellion driven,\r\nDischarged his wrath on half the host of heaven;\r\nBut Pallas, springing through the bright abode,\r\nStarts from her azure throne to calm the god.\r\nStruck for the immortal race with timely fear,\r\nFrom frantic Mars she snatch\xe2\x80\x99d the shield and spear;\r\nThen the huge helmet lifting from his head,\r\nThus to the impetuous homicide she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy what wild passion, furious! art thou toss\xe2\x80\x99d?\r\nStriv\xe2\x80\x99st thou with Jove? thou art already lost.\r\nShall not the Thunderer\xe2\x80\x99s dread command restrain,\r\nAnd was imperial Juno heard in vain?\r\nBack to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven,\r\nAnd in thy guilt involve the host of heaven?\r\nIlion and Greece no more should Jove engage,\r\nThe skies would yield an ampler scene of rage;\r\nGuilty and guiltless find an equal fate\r\nAnd one vast ruin whelm the Olympian state.\r\nCease then thy offspring\xe2\x80\x99s death unjust to call;\r\nHeroes as great have died, and yet shall fall.\r\nWhy should heaven\xe2\x80\x99s law with foolish man comply\r\nExempted from the race ordain\xe2\x80\x99d to die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis menace fix\xe2\x80\x99d the warrior to his throne;\r\nSullen he sat, and curb\xe2\x80\x99d the rising groan.\r\nThen Juno call\xe2\x80\x99d (Jove\xe2\x80\x99s orders to obey)\r\nThe winged Iris, and the god of day.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo wait the Thunderer\xe2\x80\x99s will (Saturnia cried)\r\nOn yon tall summit of the fountful Ide:\r\nThere in the father\xe2\x80\x99s awful presence stand,\r\nReceive, and execute his dread command.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said, and sat; the god that gilds the day,\r\nAnd various Iris, wing their airy way.\r\nSwift as the wind, to Ida\xe2\x80\x99s hills they came,\r\n(Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game)\r\nThere sat the eternal; he whose nod controls\r\nThe trembling world, and shakes the steady poles.\r\nVeil\xe2\x80\x99d in a mist of fragrance him they found,\r\nWith clouds of gold and purple circled round.\r\nWell-pleased the Thunderer saw their earnest care,\r\nAnd prompt obedience to the queen of air;\r\nThen (while a smile serenes his awful brow)\r\nCommands the goddess of the showery bow:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIris! descend, and what we here ordain,\r\nReport to yon mad tyrant of the main.\r\nBid him from fight to his own deeps repair,\r\nOr breathe from slaughter in the fields of air.\r\nIf he refuse, then let him timely weigh\r\nOur elder birthright, and superior sway.\r\nHow shall his rashness stand the dire alarms,\r\nIf heaven\xe2\x80\x99s omnipotence descend in arms?\r\nStrives he with me, by whom his power was given,\r\nAnd is there equal to the lord of heaven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe all-mighty spoke; the goddess wing\xe2\x80\x99d her flight\r\nTo sacred Ilion from the Idaean height.\r\nSwift as the rattling hail, or fleecy snows,\r\nDrive through the skies, when Boreas fiercely blows;\r\nSo from the clouds descending Iris falls,\r\nAnd to blue Neptune thus the goddess calls:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttend the mandate of the sire above!\r\nIn me behold the messenger of Jove:\r\nHe bids thee from forbidden wars repair\r\nTo thine own deeps, or to the fields of air.\r\nThis if refused, he bids thee timely weigh\r\nHis elder birthright, and superior sway.\r\nHow shall thy rashness stand the dire alarms\r\nIf heaven\xe2\x80\x99s omnipotence descend in arms?\r\nStriv\xe2\x80\x99st thou with him by whom all power is given?\r\nAnd art thou equal to the lord of heaven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat means the haughty sovereign of the skies?\r\n(The king of ocean thus, incensed, replies;)\r\nRule as he will his portion\xe2\x80\x99d realms on high;\r\nNo vassal god, nor of his train, am I.\r\nThree brother deities from Saturn came,\r\nAnd ancient Rhea, earth\xe2\x80\x99s immortal dame:\r\nAssign\xe2\x80\x99d by lot, our triple rule we know;\r\nInfernal Pluto sways the shades below;\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er the wide clouds, and o\xe2\x80\x99er the starry plain,\r\nEthereal Jove extends his high domain;\r\nMy court beneath the hoary waves I keep,\r\nAnd hush the roarings of the sacred deep;\r\nOlympus, and this earth, in common lie:\r\nWhat claim has here the tyrant of the sky?\r\nFar in the distant clouds let him control,\r\nAnd awe the younger brothers of the pole;\r\nThere to his children his commands be given,\r\nThe trembling, servile, second race of heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd must I then (said she), O sire of floods!\r\nBear this fierce answer to the king of gods?\r\nCorrect it yet, and change thy rash intent;\r\nA noble mind disdains not to repent.\r\nTo elder brothers guardian fiends are given,\r\nTo scourge the wretch insulting them and heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat is the profit (thus the god rejoin\xe2\x80\x99d)\r\nWhen ministers are blest with prudent mind:\r\nWarn\xe2\x80\x99d by thy words, to powerful Jove I yield,\r\nAnd quit, though angry, the contended field:\r\nNot but his threats with justice I disclaim,\r\nThe same our honours, and our birth the same.\r\nIf yet, forgetful of his promise given\r\nTo Hermes, Pallas, and the queen of heaven,\r\nTo favour Ilion, that perfidious place,\r\nHe breaks his faith with half the ethereal race;\r\nGive him to know, unless the Grecian train\r\nLay yon proud structures level with the plain,\r\nHowe\xe2\x80\x99er the offence by other gods be pass\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe wrath of Neptune shall for ever last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus speaking, furious from the field he strode,\r\nAnd plunged into the bosom of the flood.\r\nThe lord of thunders, from his lofty height\r\nBeheld, and thus bespoke the source of light:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold! the god whose liquid arms are hurl\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nAround the globe, whose earthquakes rock the world,\r\nDesists at length his rebel-war to wage,\r\nSeeks his own seas, and trembles at our rage;\r\nElse had my wrath, heaven\xe2\x80\x99s thrones all shaking round,\r\nBurn\xe2\x80\x99d to the bottom of his seas profound;\r\nAnd all the gods that round old Saturn dwell\r\nHad heard the thunders to the deeps of hell.\r\nWell was the crime, and well the vengeance spared;\r\nEven power immense had found such battle hard.\r\nGo thou, my son! the trembling Greeks alarm,\r\nShake my broad aegis on thy active arm,\r\nBe godlike Hector thy peculiar care,\r\nSwell his bold heart, and urge his strength to war:\r\nLet Ilion conquer, till the Achaian train\r\nFly to their ships and Hellespont again:\r\nThen Greece shall breathe from toils.\xe2\x80\x9d The godhead said;\r\nHis will divine the son of Jove obey\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nNot half so swift the sailing falcon flies,\r\nThat drives a turtle through the liquid skies,\r\nAs Phoebus, shooting from the Idaean brow,\r\nGlides down the mountain to the plain below.\r\nThere Hector seated by the stream he sees,\r\nHis sense returning with the coming breeze;\r\nAgain his pulses beat, his spirits rise;\r\nAgain his loved companions meet his eyes;\r\nJove thinking of his pains, they pass\xe2\x80\x99d away,\r\nTo whom the god who gives the golden day:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy sits great Hector from the field so far?\r\nWhat grief, what wound, withholds thee from the war?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fainting hero, as the vision bright\r\nStood shining o\xe2\x80\x99er him, half unseal\xe2\x80\x99d his sight:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat blest immortal, with commanding breath,\r\nThus wakens Hector from the sleep of death?\r\nHas fame not told, how, while my trusty sword\r\nBathed Greece in slaughter, and her battle gored,\r\nThe mighty Ajax with a deadly blow\r\nHad almost sunk me to the shades below?\r\nEven yet, methinks, the gliding ghosts I spy,\r\nAnd hell\xe2\x80\x99s black horrors swim before my eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo him Apollo: \xe2\x80\x9cBe no more dismay\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nSee, and be strong! the Thunderer sends thee aid.\r\nBehold! thy Phoebus shall his arms employ,\r\nPhoebus, propitious still to thee and Troy.\r\nInspire thy warriors then with manly force,\r\nAnd to the ships impel thy rapid horse:\r\nEven I will make thy fiery coursers way,\r\nAnd drive the Grecians headlong to the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus to bold Hector spoke the son of Jove,\r\nAnd breathed immortal ardour from above.\r\nAs when the pamper\xe2\x80\x99d steed, with reins unbound,\r\nBreaks from his stall, and pours along the ground;\r\nWith ample strokes he rushes to the flood,\r\nTo bathe his sides, and cool his fiery blood;\r\nHis head, now freed, he tosses to the skies;\r\nHis mane dishevell\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er his shoulders flies:\r\nHe snuffs the females in the well-known plain,\r\nAnd springs, exulting, to his fields again:\r\nUrged by the voice divine, thus Hector flew,\r\nFull of the god; and all his hosts pursue.\r\nAs when the force of men and dogs combined\r\nInvade the mountain goat, or branching hind;\r\nFar from the hunter\xe2\x80\x99s rage secure they lie\r\nClose in the rock, (not fated yet to die)\r\nWhen lo! a lion shoots across the way!\r\nThey fly: at once the chasers and the prey.\r\nSo Greece, that late in conquering troops pursued,\r\nAnd mark\xe2\x80\x99d their progress through the ranks in blood,\r\nSoon as they see the furious chief appear,\r\nForget to vanquish, and consent to fear.\r\n\r\nThoas with grief observed his dreadful course,\r\nThoas, the bravest of the \xc3\x86tolian force;\r\nSkill\xe2\x80\x99d to direct the javelin\xe2\x80\x99s distant flight,\r\nAnd bold to combat in the standing fight,\r\nNot more in councils famed for solid sense,\r\nThan winning words and heavenly eloquence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGods! what portent (he cried) these eyes invades?\r\nLo! Hector rises from the Stygian shades!\r\nWe saw him, late, by thundering Ajax kill\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nWhat god restores him to the frighted field;\r\nAnd not content that half of Greece lie slain,\r\nPours new destruction on her sons again?\r\nHe comes not, Jove! without thy powerful will;\r\nLo! still he lives, pursues, and conquers still!\r\nYet hear my counsel, and his worst withstand:\r\nThe Greeks\xe2\x80\x99 main body to the fleet command;\r\nBut let the few whom brisker spirits warm,\r\nStand the first onset, and provoke the storm.\r\nThus point your arms; and when such foes appear,\r\nFierce as he is, let Hector learn to fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe warrior spoke; the listening Greeks obey,\r\nThickening their ranks, and form a deep array.\r\n\r\nEach Ajax, Teucer, Merion gave command,\r\nThe valiant leader of the Cretan band;\r\nAnd Mars-like Meges: these the chiefs excite,\r\nApproach the foe, and meet the coming fight.\r\nBehind, unnumber\xe2\x80\x99d multitudes attend,\r\nTo flank the navy, and the shores defend.\r\nFull on the front the pressing Trojans bear,\r\nAnd Hector first came towering to the war.\r\nPhoebus himself the rushing battle led;\r\nA veil of clouds involved his radiant head:\r\nHigh held before him, Jove\xe2\x80\x99s enormous shield\r\nPortentous shone, and shaded all the field;\r\nVulcan to Jove the immortal gift consign\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nTo scatter hosts and terrify mankind,\r\nThe Greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise\r\nFrom different parts, and mingle in the skies.\r\nDire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung,\r\nAnd arrows leaping from the bow-string sung;\r\nThese drink the life of generous warriors slain:\r\nThose guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.\r\nAs long as Phoebus bore unmoved the shield,\r\nSat doubtful conquest hovering o\xe2\x80\x99er the field;\r\nBut when aloft he shakes it in the skies,\r\nShouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes,\r\nDeep horror seizes every Grecian breast,\r\nTheir force is humbled, and their fear confess\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nSo flies a herd of oxen, scatter\xe2\x80\x99d wide,\r\nNo swain to guard them, and no day to guide,\r\nWhen two fell lions from the mountain come,\r\nAnd spread the carnage through the shady gloom.\r\nImpending Phoebus pours around them fear,\r\nAnd Troy and Hector thunder in the rear.\r\nHeaps fall on heaps: the slaughter Hector leads,\r\nFirst great Arcesilas, then Stichius bleeds;\r\nOne to the bold Boeotians ever dear,\r\nAnd one Menestheus\xe2\x80\x99 friend and famed compeer.\r\nMedon and Iasus, \xc3\x86neas sped;\r\nThis sprang from Phelus, and the Athenians led;\r\nBut hapless Medon from Oileus came;\r\nHim Ajax honour\xe2\x80\x99d with a brother\xe2\x80\x99s name,\r\nThough born of lawless love: from home expell\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nA banish\xe2\x80\x99d man, in Phylace he dwell\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nPress\xe2\x80\x99d by the vengeance of an angry wife;\r\nTroy ends at last his labours and his life.\r\nMecystes next Polydamas o\xe2\x80\x99erthrew;\r\nAnd thee, brave Clonius, great Agenor slew.\r\nBy Paris, Deiochus inglorious dies,\r\nPierced through the shoulder as he basely flies.\r\nPolites\xe2\x80\x99 arm laid Echius on the plain;\r\nStretch\xe2\x80\x99d on one heap, the victors spoil the slain.\r\nThe Greeks dismay\xe2\x80\x99d, confused, disperse or fall,\r\nSome seek the trench, some skulk behind the wall.\r\nWhile these fly trembling, others pant for breath,\r\nAnd o\xe2\x80\x99er the slaughter stalks gigantic death.\r\nOn rush\xe2\x80\x99d bold Hector, gloomy as the night;\r\nForbids to plunder, animates the fight,\r\nPoints to the fleet: \xe2\x80\x9cFor, by the gods! who flies,240\r\nWho dares but linger, by this hand he dies;\r\nNo weeping sister his cold eye shall close,\r\nNo friendly hand his funeral pyre compose.\r\nWho stops to plunder at this signal hour,\r\nThe birds shall tear him, and the dogs devour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFurious he said; the smarting scourge resounds;\r\nThe coursers fly; the smoking chariot bounds;\r\nThe hosts rush on; loud clamours shake the shore;\r\nThe horses thunder, earth and ocean roar!\r\nApollo, planted at the trench\xe2\x80\x99s bound,\r\nPush\xe2\x80\x99d at the bank: down sank the enormous mound:\r\nRoll\xe2\x80\x99d in the ditch the heapy ruin lay;\r\nA sudden road!

had renown\xe2\x80\x99d that day.\r\nBut Hector was not doom\xe2\x80\x99d to perish then:\r\nThe all-wise disposer of the fates of men\r\n(Imperial Jove) his present death withstands;\r\nNor was such glory due to Teucer\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\nAt its full stretch as the tough string he drew,\r\nStruck by an arm unseen, it burst in two;\r\nDown dropp\xe2\x80\x99d the bow: the shaft with brazen head\r\nFell innocent, and on the dust lay dead.\r\nThe astonish\xe2\x80\x99d archer to great Ajax cries;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome god prevents our destined enterprise:\r\nSome god, propitious to the Trojan foe,\r\nHas, from my arm unfailing, struck the bow,\r\nAnd broke the nerve my hands had twined with art,\r\nStrong to impel the flight of many a dart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince heaven commands it (Ajax made reply)\r\nDismiss the bow, and lay thy arrows by:\r\nThy arms no less suffice the lance to wield,\r\nAnd quit the quiver for the ponderous shield.\r\nIn the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame,\r\nThy brave example shall the rest inflame.\r\nFierce as they are, by long successes vain;\r\nTo force our fleet, or even a ship to gain,\r\nAsks toil, and sweat, and blood: their utmost might\r\nShall find its match\xe2\x80\x94No more: \xe2\x80\x99tis ours to fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Teucer laid his faithless bow aside;\r\nThe fourfold buckler o\xe2\x80\x99er his shoulder tied;\r\nOn his brave head a crested helm he placed,\r\nWith nodding horse-hair formidably graced;\r\nA dart, whose point with brass refulgent shines,\r\nThe warrior wields; and his great brother joins.\r\n\r\nThis Hector saw, and thus express\xe2\x80\x99d his joy:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe troops of Lycia, Dardanus, and Troy!\r\nBe mindful of yourselves, your ancient fame,\r\nAnd spread your glory with the navy\xe2\x80\x99s flame.\r\nJove is with us; I saw his hand, but now,\r\nFrom the proud archer strike his vaunted bow:\r\nIndulgent Jove! how plain thy favours shine,\r\nWhen happy nations bear the marks divine!\r\nHow easy then, to see the sinking state\r\nOf realms accursed, deserted, reprobate!\r\nSuch is the fate of Greece, and such is ours:\r\nBehold, ye warriors, and exert your powers.\r\nDeath is the worst; a fate which all must try;\r\nAnd for our country, \xe2\x80\x99tis a bliss to die.\r\nThe gallant man, though slain in fight he be,\r\nYet leaves his nation safe, his children free;\r\nEntails a debt on all the grateful state;\r\nHis own brave friends shall glory in his fate;\r\nHis wife live honour\xe2\x80\x99d, all his race succeed,\r\nAnd late posterity enjoy the deed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis roused the soul in every Trojan breast:\r\nThe godlike Ajax next his Greeks address\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long, ye warriors of the Argive race,\r\n(To generous Argos what a dire disgrace!)\r\nHow long on these cursed confines will ye lie,\r\nYet undetermined, or to live or die?\r\nWhat hopes remain, what methods to retire,\r\nIf once your vessels catch the Trojan fire?\r\nMark how the flames approach, how near they fall,\r\nHow Hector calls, and Troy obeys his call!\r\nNot to the dance that dreadful voice invites,\r\nIt calls to death, and all the rage of fights.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis now no time for wisdom or debates;\r\nTo your own hands are trusted all your fates;\r\nAnd better far in one decisive strife,\r\nOne day should end our labour or our life,\r\nThan keep this hard-got inch of barren sands,\r\nStill press\xe2\x80\x99d, and press\xe2\x80\x99d by such inglorious hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe listening Grecians feel their leader\xe2\x80\x99s flame,\r\nAnd every kindling bosom pants for fame.\r\nThen mutual slaughters spread on either side;\r\nBy Hector here the Phocian Schedius died;\r\nThere, pierced by Ajax, sunk Laodamas,\r\nChief of the foot, of old Antenor\xe2\x80\x99s race.\r\nPolydamas laid Otus on the sand,\r\nThe fierce commander of the Epeian band.\r\nHis lance bold Meges at the victor threw;\r\nThe victor, stooping, from the death withdrew;\r\n(That valued life, O Phoebus! was thy care)\r\nBut Croesmus\xe2\x80\x99 bosom took the flying spear:\r\nHis corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore;\r\nHis radiant arms triumphant Meges bore.\r\nDolops, the son of Lampus, rushes on,\r\nSprung from the race of old Laomedon,\r\nAnd famed for prowess in a well-fought field,\r\nHe pierced the centre of his sounding shield:\r\nBut Meges, Phyleus\xe2\x80\x99 ample breastplate wore,\r\n(Well-known in fight on Selle\xe2\x80\x99s winding shore;\r\nFor king Euphetes gave the golden mail,\r\nCompact, and firm with many a jointed scale)\r\nWhich oft, in cities storm\xe2\x80\x99d, and battles won,\r\nHad saved the father, and now saves the son.\r\nFull at the Trojan\xe2\x80\x99s head he urged his lance,\r\nWhere the high plumes above the helmet dance,\r\nNew ting\xe2\x80\x99d with Tyrian dye: in dust below,\r\nShorn from the crest, the purple honours glow.\r\nMeantime their fight the Spartan king survey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd stood by Meges\xe2\x80\x99 side a sudden aid.\r\nThrough Dolops\xe2\x80\x99 shoulder urged his forceful dart,\r\nWhich held its passage through the panting heart,\r\nAnd issued at his breast. With thundering sound\r\nThe warrior falls, extended on the ground.\r\nIn rush the conquering Greeks to spoil the slain:\r\nBut Hector\xe2\x80\x99s voice excites his kindred train;\r\nThe hero most, from Hicetaon sprung,\r\nFierce Melanippus, gallant, brave, and young.\r\nHe (ere to Troy the Grecians cross\xe2\x80\x99d the main)\r\nFed his large oxen on Percote\xe2\x80\x99s plain;\r\nBut when oppress\xe2\x80\x99d, his country claim\xe2\x80\x99d his care,\r\nReturn\xe2\x80\x99d to Ilion, and excell\xe2\x80\x99d in war;\r\nFor this, in Priam\xe2\x80\x99s court, he held his place,\r\nBeloved no less than Priam\xe2\x80\x99s royal race.\r\nHim Hector singled, as his troops he led,\r\nAnd thus inflamed him, pointing to the dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLo, Melanippus!

respect your fame,\r\nRespect yourselves, and learn an honest shame:\r\nLet mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire,\r\nAnd catch from breast to breast the noble fire,\r\nOn valour\xe2\x80\x99s side the odds of combat lie;\r\nThe brave live glorious, or lamented die;\r\nThe wretch that trembles in the field of fame,\r\nMeets death, and worse than death, eternal shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis generous sense he not in vain imparts;\r\nIt sunk, and rooted in the Grecian hearts:\r\nThey join, they throng, they thicken at his call,\r\nAnd flank the navy with a brazen wall;\r\nShields touching shields, in order blaze above,\r\nAnd stop the Trojans, though impell\xe2\x80\x99d by Jove.\r\nThe fiery Spartan first, with loud applause.\r\nWarms the bold son of Nestor in his cause.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there (he said) in arms a youth like you,\r\nSo strong to fight, so active to pursue?\r\nWhy stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?\r\nLift the bold lance, and make some Trojan bleed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said; and backward to the lines retired;\r\nForth rush\xe2\x80\x99d the youth with martial fury fired,\r\nBeyond the foremost ranks; his lance he threw,\r\nAnd round the black battalions cast his view.\r\nThe troops of Troy recede with sudden fear,\r\nWhile the swift javelin hiss\xe2\x80\x99d along in air.\r\nAdvancing Melanippus met the dart\r\nWith his bold breast, and felt it in his heart:\r\nThundering he falls; his falling arms resound,\r\nAnd his broad buckler rings against the ground.\r\nThe victor leaps upon his prostrate prize:\r\nThus on a roe the well-breath\xe2\x80\x99d beagle flies,\r\nAnd rends his side, fresh-bleeding with the dart\r\nThe distant hunter sent into his heart.\r\nObserving Hector to the rescue flew;\r\nBold as he was, Antilochus withdrew.\r\nSo when a savage, ranging o\xe2\x80\x99er the plain,\r\nHas torn the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s dog, or shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s swain,\r\nWhile conscious of the deed, he glares around,\r\nAnd hears the gathering multitude resound,\r\nTimely he flies the yet-untasted food,\r\nAnd gains the friendly shelter of the wood:\r\nSo fears the youth; all Troy with shouts pursue,\r\nWhile stones and darts in mingled tempest flew;\r\nBut enter\xe2\x80\x99d in the Grecian ranks, he turns\r\nHis manly breast, and with new fury burns.\r\n\r\nNow on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove,\r\nFierce to fulfil the stern decrees of Jove:\r\nThe sire of gods, confirming Thetis\xe2\x80\x99 prayer,\r\nThe Grecian ardour quench\xe2\x80\x99d in deep despair;\r\nBut lifts to glory Troy\xe2\x80\x99s prevailing bands,\r\nSwells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.\r\nOn Ida\xe2\x80\x99s top he waits with longing eyes,\r\nTo view the navy blazing to the skies;\r\nThen, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,\r\nThe Trojans fly, and conquer\xe2\x80\x99d Ilion burn.\r\nThese fates revolved in his almighty mind,\r\nHe raises Hector to the work design\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nBids him with more than mortal fury glow,\r\nAnd drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.\r\nSo Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,\r\nShakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.\r\nNot with more rage a conflagration rolls,\r\nWraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.\r\nHe foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow\r\nLike fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow:\r\nThe radiant helmet on his temple burns,\r\nWaves when he nods, and lightens as he turns:\r\nFor Jove his splendour round the chief had thrown,\r\nAnd cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.\r\nUnhappy glories! for his fate was near,\r\nDue to stern Pallas, and Pelides\xe2\x80\x99 spear:\r\nYet Jove deferr\xe2\x80\x99d the death he was to pay,\r\nAnd gave what fate allow\xe2\x80\x99d, the honours of a day!\r\n\r\nNow all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes\r\nBurn at each foe, and single every prize;\r\nStill at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,\r\nHe points his ardour, and exerts his might.\r\nThe Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,\r\nOn all sides batter\xe2\x80\x99d, yet resists his power:\r\nSo some tall rock o\xe2\x80\x99erhangs the hoary main,241\r\nBy winds assail\xe2\x80\x99d, by billows beat in vain,\r\nUnmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow,\r\nAnd sees the watery mountains break below.\r\nGirt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall\r\nLike fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all:\r\nBursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,\r\nAnd, swell\xe2\x80\x99d with tempests, on the ship descends;\r\nWhite are the decks with foam; the winds aloud\r\nHowl o\xe2\x80\x99er the masts, and sing through every shroud:\r\nPale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears;\r\nAnd instant death on every wave appears.\r\nSo pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet,\r\nThe chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.\r\n\r\nAs when a lion, rushing from his den,\r\nAmidst the plain of some wide-water\xe2\x80\x99d fen,\r\n(Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,\r\nAt large expatiate o\xe2\x80\x99er the ranker mead)\r\nLeaps on the herds before the herdsman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes;\r\nThe trembling herdsman far to distance flies;\r\nSome lordly bull (the rest dispersed and fled)\r\nHe singles out; arrests, and lays him dead.\r\nThus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew\r\nAll Greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew:\r\nMycenian Periphes, a mighty name,\r\nIn wisdom great, in arms well known to fame;\r\nThe minister of stern Eurystheus\xe2\x80\x99 ire\r\nAgainst Alcides, Copreus was his sire:\r\nThe son redeem\xe2\x80\x99d the honours of the race,\r\nA son as generous as the sire was base;\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er all his country\xe2\x80\x99s youth conspicuous far\r\nIn every virtue, or of peace or war:\r\nBut doom\xe2\x80\x99d to Hector\xe2\x80\x99s stronger force to yield!\r\nAgainst the margin of his ample shield\r\nHe struck his hasty foot: his heels up-sprung;\r\nSupine he fell; his brazen helmet rung.\r\nOn the fallen chief the invading Trojan press\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd plunged the pointed javelin in his breast.\r\nHis circling friends, who strove to guard too late\r\nThe unhappy hero, fled, or shared his fate.\r\n\r\nChased from the foremost line, the Grecian train\r\nNow man the next, receding toward the main:\r\nWedged in one body at the tents they stand,\r\nWall\xe2\x80\x99d round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band.\r\nNow manly shame forbids the inglorious flight;\r\nNow fear itself confines them to the fight:\r\nMan courage breathes in man; but Nestor most\r\n(The sage preserver of the Grecian host)\r\nExhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores;\r\nAnd by their parents, by themselves implores.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh friends!

He agrees to it, but at the same time\r\ncharges him to content himself with rescuing the fleet, without further\r\npursuit of the enemy. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers are\r\ndescribed. Achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend,\r\nafter which Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The Trojans, at\r\nthe sight of Patroclus in Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 armour, taking him for that hero,\r\nare cast into the uttermost consternation; he beats them off from the\r\nvessels, Hector himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter was\r\naverse to his fate. Several other particulars of the battle are\r\ndescribed; in the heat of which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of\r\nAchilles, pursues the foe to the walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses\r\nand disarms him, Euphorbus wounds him, and Hector kills him, which\r\nconcludes the book.\r\n\r\nSo warr\xe2\x80\x99d both armies on the ensanguined shore,\r\nWhile the black vessels smoked with human gore.\r\nMeantime Patroclus to Achilles flies;\r\nThe streaming tears fall copious from his eyes.\r\nNot faster, trickling to the plains below,\r\nFrom the tall rock the sable waters flow.\r\nDivine Pelides, with compassion moved.\r\nThus spoke, indulgent, to his best beloved:243\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatroclus, say, what grief thy bosom bears,\r\nThat flows so fast in these unmanly tears?\r\nNo girl, no infant whom the mother keeps\r\nFrom her loved breast, with fonder passion weeps;\r\nNot more the mother\xe2\x80\x99s soul, that infant warms,\r\nClung to her knees, and reaching at her arms,\r\nThan thou hast mine! Oh tell me, to what end\r\nThy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGriev\xe2\x80\x99st thou for me, or for my martial band?\r\nOr come sad tidings from our native land?\r\nOur fathers live (our first, most tender care),\r\nThy good Menoetius breathes the vital air,\r\nAnd hoary Peleus yet extends his days;\r\nPleased in their age to hear their children\xe2\x80\x99s praise.\r\nOr may some meaner cause thy pity claim?\r\nPerhaps yon relics of the Grecian name,\r\nDoom\xe2\x80\x99d in their ships to sink by fire and sword,\r\nAnd pay the forfeit of their haughty lord?\r\nWhate\xe2\x80\x99er the cause, reveal thy secret care,\r\nAnd speak those sorrows which a friend would share.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nA sigh that instant from his bosom broke,\r\nAnother follow\xe2\x80\x99d, and Patroclus spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet Greece at length with pity touch thy breast,\r\nThyself a Greek; and, once, of Greeks the best!\r\nLo! every chief that might her fate prevent,\r\nLies pierced with wounds, and bleeding in his tent:\r\nEurypylus, Tydides, Atreus\xe2\x80\x99 son,\r\nAnd wise Ulysses, at the navy groan,\r\nMore for their country\xe2\x80\x99s wounds than for their own.\r\nTheir pain soft arts of pharmacy can ease,\r\nThy breast alone no lenitives appease.\r\nMay never rage like thine my soul enslave,\r\nO great in vain! unprofitably brave!\r\nThy country slighted in her last distress,\r\nWhat friend, what man, from thee shall hope redress?\r\nNo\xe2\x80\x94men unborn, and ages yet behind,\r\nShall curse that fierce, that unforgiving mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO man unpitying! if of man thy race;\r\nBut sure thou spring\xe2\x80\x99st not from a soft embrace,\r\nNor ever amorous hero caused thy birth,\r\nNor ever tender goddess brought thee forth:\r\nSome rugged rock\xe2\x80\x99s hard entrails gave thee form,\r\nAnd raging seas produced thee in a storm,\r\nA soul well suiting that tempestuous kind,\r\nSo rough thy manners, so untamed thy mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf some dire oracle thy breast alarm,\r\nIf aught from Jove, or Thetis, stop thy arm,\r\nSome beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,\r\nIf I but lead the Myrmidonian line:\r\nClad in thy dreadful arms if I appear,\r\nProud Troy shall tremble, and desert the war;\r\nWithout thy person Greece shall win the day,\r\nAnd thy mere image chase her foes away.\r\nPress\xe2\x80\x99d by fresh forces, her o\xe2\x80\x99erlabour\xe2\x80\x99d train\r\nShall quit the ships, and Greece respire again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThus, blind to fate! with supplicating breath,\r\nThou begg\xe2\x80\x99st his arms, and in his arms thy death.\r\nUnfortunately good! a boding sigh\r\nThy friend return\xe2\x80\x99d; and with it, this reply:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatroclus! thy Achilles knows no fears;\r\nNor words from Jove nor oracles he hears;\r\nNor aught a mother\xe2\x80\x99s caution can suggest;\r\nThe tyrant\xe2\x80\x99s pride lies rooted in my breast.\r\nMy wrongs, my wrongs, my constant thought engage,\r\nThose, my sole oracles, inspire my rage:\r\nI made him tyrant: gave him power to wrong\r\nEven me: I felt it; and shall feel it long.\r\nThe maid, my black-eyed maid, he forced away,\r\nDue to the toils of many a well-fought day;\r\nDue to my conquest of her father\xe2\x80\x99s reign;\r\nDue to the votes of all the Grecian train.\r\nFrom me he forced her; me, the bold and brave,\r\nDisgraced, dishonour\xe2\x80\x99d, like the meanest slave.\r\nBut bear we this\xe2\x80\x94the wrongs I grieve are past;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis time our fury should relent at last:\r\nI fix\xe2\x80\x99d its date; the day I wish\xe2\x80\x99d appears:\r\nHow Hector to my ships his battle bears,\r\nThe flames my eyes, the shouts invade my ears.\r\nGo then, Patroclus!

Lo, the blaze aspires!\r\nThe glowing ocean reddens with the fires.\r\nArm, ere our vessels catch the spreading flame;\r\nArm, ere the Grecians be no more a name;\r\nI haste to bring the troops.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94The hero said;\r\nThe friend with ardour and with joy obey\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n\r\nHe cased his limbs in brass; and first around\r\nHis manly legs, with silver buckles bound\r\nThe clasping greaves; then to his breast applies\r\nThe flaming cuirass of a thousand dyes;\r\nEmblazed with studs of gold his falchion shone\r\nIn the rich belt, as in a starry zone:\r\nAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 shield his ample shoulders spread,\r\nAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 helmet nodded o\xe2\x80\x99er his head:\r\nAdorn\xe2\x80\x99d in all his terrible array,\r\nHe flash\xe2\x80\x99d around intolerable day.\r\nAlone untouch\xe2\x80\x99d, Pelides\xe2\x80\x99 javelin stands,\r\nNot to be poised but by Pelides\xe2\x80\x99 hands:\r\nFrom Pelion\xe2\x80\x99s shady brow the plant entire\r\nOld Chiron rent, and shaped it for his sire;\r\nWhose son\xe2\x80\x99s great arm alone the weapon wields,\r\nThe death of heroes, and the dread of fields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buckles.]\r\n\r\nThe brave Automedon (an honour\xe2\x80\x99d name,\r\nThe second to his lord in love and fame,\r\nIn peace his friend, and partner of the war)\r\nThe winged coursers harness\xe2\x80\x99d to the car;\r\nXanthus and Balius, of immortal breed,\r\nSprung from the wind, and like the wind in speed.\r\nWhom the wing\xe2\x80\x99d harpy, swift Podarge, bore,\r\nBy Zephyr pregnant on the breezy shore:\r\nSwift Pedasus was added to their side,\r\n(Once great Aetion\xe2\x80\x99s, now Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 pride)\r\nWho, like in strength, in swiftness, and in grace,\r\nA mortal courser match\xe2\x80\x99d the immortal race.\r\n\r\nAchilles speeds from tent to tent, and warms\r\nHis hardy Myrmidons to blood and arms.\r\nAll breathing death, around the chief they stand,\r\nA grim, terrific, formidable band:\r\nGrim as voracious wolves, that seek the springs244\r\nWhen scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings;\r\nWhen some tall stag, fresh-slaughtered in the wood,\r\nHas drench\xe2\x80\x99d their wide insatiate throats with blood,\r\nTo the black fount they rush, a hideous throng,\r\nWith paunch distended, and with lolling tongue,\r\nFire fills their eye, their black jaws belch the gore,\r\nAnd gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more.\r\nLike furious, rush\xe2\x80\x99d the Myrmidonian crew,\r\nSuch their dread strength, and such their deathful view.\r\n\r\nHigh in the midst the great Achilles stands,\r\nDirects their order, and the war commands.\r\nHe, loved of Jove, had launch\xe2\x80\x99d for Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s shores\r\nFull fifty vessels, mann\xe2\x80\x99d with fifty oars:\r\nFive chosen leaders the fierce bands obey,\r\nHimself supreme in valour, as in sway.\r\n\r\nFirst march\xe2\x80\x99d Menestheus, of celestial birth,\r\nDerived from thee, whose waters wash the earth,\r\nDivine Sperchius!

through heads of disarray\r\nThe fiery coursers forced their lord away:\r\nWhile far behind his Trojans fall confused;\r\nWedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised:\r\nChariots on chariots roll: the clashing spokes\r\nShock; while the madding steeds break short their yokes.\r\nIn vain they labour up the steepy mound;\r\nTheir charioteers lie foaming on the ground.\r\nFierce on the rear, with shouts Patroclus flies;\r\nTumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies;\r\nThick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight;\r\nClouds rise on clouds, and heaven is snatch\xe2\x80\x99d from sight.\r\nThe affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down,\r\nScour o\xe2\x80\x99er the fields, and stretch to reach the town.\r\nLoud o\xe2\x80\x99er the rout was heard the victor\xe2\x80\x99s cry,\r\nWhere the war bleeds, and where the thickest die,\r\nWhere horse and arms, and chariots lie o\xe2\x80\x99erthrown,\r\nAnd bleeding heroes under axles groan.\r\nNo stop, no check, the steeds of Peleus knew:\r\nFrom bank to bank the immortal coursers flew.\r\nHigh-bounding o\xe2\x80\x99er the fosse, the whirling car\r\nSmokes through the ranks, o\xe2\x80\x99ertakes the flying war,\r\nAnd thunders after Hector; Hector flies,\r\nPatroclus shakes his lance; but fate denies.\r\nNot with less noise, with less impetuous force,\r\nThe tide of Trojans urge their desperate course,\r\nThan when in autumn Jove his fury pours,\r\nAnd earth is loaden with incessant showers;\r\n(When guilty mortals break the eternal laws,\r\nOr judges, bribed, betray the righteous cause;)\r\nFrom their deep beds he bids the rivers rise,\r\nAnd opens all the flood-gates of the skies:\r\nThe impetuous torrents from their hills obey,\r\nWhole fields are drown\xe2\x80\x99d, and mountains swept away;\r\nLoud roars the deluge till it meets the main;\r\nAnd trembling man sees all his labours vain!\r\n\r\nAnd now the chief (the foremost troops repell\xe2\x80\x99d)\r\nBack to the ships his destined progress held,\r\nBore down half Troy in his resistless way,\r\nAnd forced the routed ranks to stand the day.\r\nBetween the space where silver Simois flows,\r\nWhere lay the fleets, and where the rampires rose,\r\nAll grim in dust and blood Patroclus stands,\r\nAnd turns the slaughter on the conquering bands.\r\nFirst Pronous died beneath his fiery dart,\r\nWhich pierced below the shield his valiant heart.\r\nThestor was next, who saw the chief appear,\r\nAnd fell the victim of his coward fear;\r\nShrunk up he sat, with wild and haggard eye,\r\nNor stood to combat, nor had force to fly;\r\nPatroclus mark\xe2\x80\x99d him as he shunn\xe2\x80\x99d the war,\r\nAnd with unmanly tremblings shook the car,\r\nAnd dropp\xe2\x80\x99d the flowing reins. Him \xe2\x80\x99twixt the jaws,\r\nThe javelin sticks, and from the chariot draws.\r\nAs on a rock that overhangs the main,\r\nAn angler, studious of the line and cane,\r\nSome mighty fish draws panting to the shore:\r\nNot with less ease the barbed javelin bore\r\nThe gaping dastard; as the spear was shook,\r\nHe fell, and life his heartless breast forsook.\r\n\r\nNext on Eryalus he flies; a stone,\r\nLarge as a rock, was by his fury thrown:\r\nFull on his crown the ponderous fragment flew,\r\nAnd burst the helm, and cleft the head in two:\r\nProne to the ground the breathless warrior fell,\r\nAnd death involved him with the shades of hell.\r\nThen low in dust Epaltes, Echius, lie;\r\nIpheas, Evippus, Polymelus, die;\r\nAmphoterus and Erymas succeed;\r\nAnd last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed.\r\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99er he moves, the growing slaughters spread\r\nIn heaps on heaps a monument of dead.\r\n\r\nWhen now Sarpedon his brave friends beheld\r\nGrovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,\r\nWith this reproach his flying host he warms:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms!\r\nForsake, inglorious, the contended plain;\r\nThis hand unaided shall the war sustain:\r\nThe task be mine this hero\xe2\x80\x99s strength to try,\r\nWho mows whole troops, and makes an army fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car:\r\nPatroclus lights, and sternly waits the war.\r\nAs when two vultures on the mountain\xe2\x80\x99s height\r\nStoop with resounding pinions to the fight;\r\nThey cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry;\r\nThe desert echoes, and the rocks reply:\r\nThe warriors thus opposed in arms, engage\r\nWith equal clamours, and with equal rage.\r\n\r\nJove view\xe2\x80\x99d the combat: whose event foreseen,\r\nHe thus bespoke his sister and his queen:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hour draws on; the destinies ordain,245\r\nMy godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain:\r\nAlready on the verge of death he stands,\r\nHis life is owed to fierce Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 hands,\r\nWhat passions in a parent\xe2\x80\x99s breast debate!\r\nSay, shall I snatch him from impending fate,\r\nAnd send him safe to Lycia, distant far\r\nFrom all the dangers and the toils of war;\r\nOr to his doom my bravest offspring yield,\r\nAnd fatten, with celestial blood, the field?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen thus the goddess with the radiant eyes:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat words are these, O sovereign of the skies!\r\nShort is the date prescribed to mortal man;\r\nShall Jove for one extend the narrow span,\r\nWhose bounds were fix\xe2\x80\x99d before his race began?\r\nHow many sons of gods, foredoom\xe2\x80\x99d to death,\r\nBefore proud Ilion must resign their breath!\r\nWere thine exempt, debate would rise above,\r\nAnd murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove.\r\nGive the bold chief a glorious fate in fight;\r\nAnd when the ascending soul has wing\xe2\x80\x99d her flight,\r\nLet Sleep and Death convey, by thy command,\r\nThe breathless body to his native land.\r\nHis friends and people, to his future praise,\r\nA marble tomb and pyramid shall raise,\r\nAnd lasting honours to his ashes give;\r\nHis fame (\xe2\x80\x99tis all the dead can have) shall live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said: the cloud-compeller, overcome,\r\nAssents to fate, and ratifies the doom.\r\nThen touch\xe2\x80\x99d with grief, the weeping heavens distill\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nA shower of blood o\xe2\x80\x99er all the fatal field:\r\nThe god, his eyes averting from the plain,\r\nLaments his son, predestined to be slain,\r\nFar from the Lycian shores, his happy native reign.\r\nNow met in arms, the combatants appear;\r\nEach heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear;\r\nFrom strong Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 hand the javelin fled,\r\nAnd pass\xe2\x80\x99d the groin of valiant Thrasymed;\r\nThe nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain,\r\nHe falls, and falling bites the bloody plain.\r\nTwo sounding darts the Lycian leader threw:\r\nThe first aloof with erring fury flew,\r\nThe next transpierced Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 mortal steed,\r\nThe generous Pedasus of Theban breed:\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d in the shoulder\xe2\x80\x99s joint, he reel\xe2\x80\x99d around,\r\nRoll\xe2\x80\x99d in the bloody dust, and paw\xe2\x80\x99d the slippery ground.\r\nHis sudden fall the entangled harness broke;\r\nEach axle crackled, and the chariot shook:\r\nWhen bold Automedon, to disengage\r\nThe starting coursers, and restrain their rage,\r\nDivides the traces with his sword, and freed\r\nThe encumbered chariot from the dying steed:\r\nThe rest move on, obedient to the rein:\r\nThe car rolls slowly o\xe2\x80\x99er the dusty plain.\r\n\r\nThe towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:\r\nAnd first Sarpedon whirl\xe2\x80\x99d his weighty lance,\r\nWhich o\xe2\x80\x99er the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder took its course,\r\nAnd spent in empty air its dying force.\r\nNot so Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 never-erring dart;\r\nAim\xe2\x80\x99d at his breast it pierced a mortal part,\r\nWhere the strong fibres bind the solid heart.\r\nThen as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,\r\nOr pine (fit mast for some great admiral)\r\nNods to the axe, till with a groaning sound\r\nIt sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,\r\nThus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,\r\nBefore his chariot stretch\xe2\x80\x99d his form divine:\r\nHe grasp\xe2\x80\x99d the dust distain\xe2\x80\x99d with streaming gore,\r\nAnd, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.\r\nSo lies a bull beneath the lion\xe2\x80\x99s paws,\r\nWhile the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws\r\nThe trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood;\r\nDeep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.\r\n\r\nThen to the leader of the Lycian band\r\nThe dying chief address\xe2\x80\x99d his last command;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare\r\nThe glorious dangers of destructive war,\r\nTo lead my troops, to combat at their head,\r\nIncite the living, and supply the dead.\r\nTell them, I charged them with my latest breath\r\nNot unrevenged to bear Sarpedon\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\nWhat grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo,\r\nIf these spoil\xe2\x80\x99d arms adorn a Grecian foe!\r\nThen as a friend, and as a warrior fight;\r\nDefend my body, conquer in my right:\r\nThat, taught by great examples, all may try\r\nLike thee to vanquish, or like me to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe ceased; the Fates suppress\xe2\x80\x99d his labouring breath,\r\nAnd his eyes darken\xe2\x80\x99d with the shades of death.\r\nThe insulting victor with disdain bestrode\r\nThe prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;\r\nThen drew the weapon from his panting heart,\r\nThe reeking fibres clinging to the dart;\r\nFrom the wide wound gush\xe2\x80\x99d out a stream of blood,\r\nAnd the soul issued in the purple flood.\r\nHis flying steeds the Myrmidons detain,\r\nUnguided now, their mighty master slain.\r\nAll-impotent of aid, transfix\xe2\x80\x99d with grief,\r\nUnhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief:\r\nHis painful arm, yet useless with the smart\r\nInflicted late by Teucer\xe2\x80\x99s deadly dart,\r\nSupported on his better hand he stay\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nTo Phoebus then (\xe2\x80\x99twas all he could) he pray\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll-seeing monarch! whether Lycia\xe2\x80\x99s coast,\r\nOr sacred Ilion, thy bright presence boast,\r\nPowerful alike to ease the wretch\xe2\x80\x99s smart;\r\nO hear me! god of every healing art!\r\nLo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,\r\nThat thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,\r\nI stand unable to sustain the spear,\r\nAnd sigh, at distance from the glorious war.\r\nLow in the dust is great Sarpedon laid,\r\nNor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid;\r\nBut thou, O god of health! thy succour lend,\r\nTo guard the relics of my slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d friend:\r\nFor thou, though distant, canst restore my might,\r\nTo head my Lycians, and support the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood,\r\nHis heavenly hand restrain\xe2\x80\x99d the flux of blood;\r\nHe drew the dolours from the wounded part,\r\nAnd breathed a spirit in his rising heart.\r\nRenew\xe2\x80\x99d by art divine, the hero stands,\r\nAnd owns the assistance of immortal hands.\r\nFirst to the fight his native troops he warms,\r\nThen loudly calls on Troy\xe2\x80\x99s vindictive arms;\r\nWith ample strides he stalks from place to place;\r\nNow fires Agenor, now Polydamas:\r\n\xc3\x86neas next, and Hector he accosts;\r\nInflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?\r\nOh too forgetful of the friends of Troy!\r\nThose generous friends, who, from their country far,\r\nBreathe their brave souls out in another\xe2\x80\x99s war.\r\nSee! where in dust the great Sarpedon lies,\r\nIn action valiant, and in council wise,\r\nWho guarded right, and kept his people free;\r\nTo all his Lycians lost, and lost to thee!\r\nStretch\xe2\x80\x99d by Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 arm on yonder plains,\r\nO save from hostile rage his loved remains!\r\nAh let not Greece his conquer\xe2\x80\x99d trophies boast,\r\nNor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke: each leader in his grief partook:\r\nTroy, at the loss, through all her legions shook.\r\nTransfix\xe2\x80\x99d with deep regret, they view o\xe2\x80\x99erthrown\r\nAt once his country\xe2\x80\x99s pillar, and their own;\r\nA chief, who led to Troy\xe2\x80\x99s beleaguer\xe2\x80\x99d wall\r\nA host of heroes, and outshined them all.\r\nFired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes,\r\nAnd with superior vengeance greatly glows.\r\n\r\nBut o\xe2\x80\x99er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands,\r\nAnd rousing Ajax, roused the listening bands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeroes, be men; be what you were before;\r\nOr weigh the great occasion, and be more.\r\nThe chief who taught our lofty walls to yield,\r\nLies pale in death, extended on the field.\r\nTo guard his body Troy in numbers flies;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis half the glory to maintain our prize.\r\nHaste, strip his arms, the slaughter round him spread,\r\nAnd send the living Lycians to the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe heroes kindle at his fierce command;\r\nThe martial squadrons close on either hand:\r\nHere Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarms,\r\nThessalia there, and Greece, oppose their arms.\r\nWith horrid shouts they circle round the slain;\r\nThe clash of armour rings o\xe2\x80\x99er all the plain.\r\nGreat Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er the fierce armies pours pernicious night,\r\nAnd round his son confounds the warring hosts,\r\nHis fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.\r\n\r\nNow Greece gives way, and great Epigeus falls;\r\nAgacleus\xe2\x80\x99 son, from Budium\xe2\x80\x99s lofty walls;\r\nWho chased for murder thence a suppliant came\r\nTo Peleus, and the silver-footed dame;\r\nNow sent to Troy, Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 arms to aid,\r\nHe pays due vengeance to his kinsman\xe2\x80\x99s shade.\r\nSoon as his luckless hand had touch\xe2\x80\x99d the dead,\r\nA rock\xe2\x80\x99s large fragment thunder\xe2\x80\x99d on his head;\r\nHurl\xe2\x80\x99d by Hectorean force it cleft in twain\r\nHis shatter\xe2\x80\x99d helm, and stretch\xe2\x80\x99d him o\xe2\x80\x99er the slain.\r\n\r\nFierce to the van of fight Patroclus came,\r\nAnd, like an eagle darting at his game,\r\nSprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band.\r\nWhat grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand,\r\nO generous Greek! when with full vigour thrown,\r\nAt Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone,\r\nWhich sunk him to the dead: when Troy, too near\r\nThat arm, drew back; and Hector learn\xe2\x80\x99d to fear.\r\nFar as an able hand a lance can throw,\r\nOr at the lists, or at the fighting foe;\r\nSo far the Trojans from their lines retired;\r\nTill Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.\r\nThen Bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage,\r\nThe only hope of Chalcon\xe2\x80\x99s trembling age;\r\nWide o\xe2\x80\x99er the land was stretch\xe2\x80\x99d his large domain,\r\nWith stately seats, and riches blest in vain:\r\nHim, bold with youth, and eager to pursue\r\nThe flying Lycians, Glaucus met and slew;\r\nPierced through the bosom with a sudden wound,\r\nHe fell, and falling made the fields resound.\r\nThe Achaians sorrow for their heroes slain;\r\nWith conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain,\r\nAnd crowd to spoil the dead: the Greeks oppose;\r\nAn iron circle round the carcase grows.\r\n\r\nThen brave Laogonus resign\xe2\x80\x99d his breath,\r\nDespatch\xe2\x80\x99d by Merion to the shades of death:\r\nOn Ida\xe2\x80\x99s holy hill he made abode,\r\nThe priest of Jove, and honour\xe2\x80\x99d like his god.\r\nBetween the jaw and ear the javelin went;\r\nThe soul, exhaling, issued at the vent.\r\nHis spear \xc3\x86neas at the victor threw,\r\nWho stooping forward from the death withdrew;\r\nThe lance hiss\xe2\x80\x99d harmless o\xe2\x80\x99er his covering shield,\r\nAnd trembling struck, and rooted in the field;\r\nThere yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain,\r\nSent by the great \xc3\x86neas\xe2\x80\x99 arm in vain.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwift as thou art (the raging hero cries)\r\nAnd skill\xe2\x80\x99d in dancing to dispute the prize,\r\nMy spear, the destined passage had it found,\r\nHad fix\xe2\x80\x99d thy active vigour to the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO valiant leader of the Dardan host!\r\n(Insulted Merion thus retorts the boast)\r\nStrong as you are, \xe2\x80\x99tis mortal force you trust,\r\nAn arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust.\r\nAnd if to this my lance thy fate be given,\r\nVain are thy vaunts; success is still from heaven:\r\nThis, instant, sends thee down to Pluto\xe2\x80\x99s coast;\r\nMine is the glory, his thy parting ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO friend (Menoetius\xe2\x80\x99 son this answer gave)\r\nWith words to combat, ill befits the brave;\r\nNot empty boasts the sons of Troy repel,\r\nYour swords must plunge them to the shades of hell.\r\nTo speak, beseems the council; but to dare\r\nIn glorious action, is the task of war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis said, Patroclus to the battle flies;\r\nGreat Merion follows, and new shouts arise:\r\nShields, helmets rattle, as the warriors close;\r\nAnd thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows.\r\nAs through the shrilling vale, or mountain ground,\r\nThe labours of the woodman\xe2\x80\x99s axe resound;\r\nBlows following blows are heard re-echoing wide,\r\nWhile crackling forests fall on every side:\r\nThus echoed all the fields with loud alarms,\r\nSo fell the warriors, and so rung their arms.\r\n\r\nNow great Sarpedon on the sandy shore,\r\nHis heavenly form defaced with dust and gore,\r\nAnd stuck with darts by warring heroes shed,\r\nLies undistinguish\xe2\x80\x99d from the vulgar dead.\r\nHis long-disputed corse the chiefs enclose,\r\nOn every side the busy combat grows;\r\nThick as beneath some shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s thatch\xe2\x80\x99d abode\r\n(The pails high foaming with a milky flood)\r\nThe buzzing flies, a persevering train,\r\nIncessant swarm, and chased return again.\r\n\r\nJove view\xe2\x80\x99d the combat with a stern survey,\r\nAnd eyes that flash\xe2\x80\x99d intolerable day.\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d on the field his sight, his breast debates\r\nThe vengeance due, and meditates the fates:\r\nWhether to urge their prompt effect, and call\r\nThe force of Hector to Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 fall,\r\nThis instant see his short-lived trophies won,\r\nAnd stretch him breathless on his slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d son;\r\nOr yet, with many a soul\xe2\x80\x99s untimely flight,\r\nAugment the fame and horror of the fight.\r\nTo crown Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 valiant friend with praise\r\nAt length he dooms; and, that his last of days\r\nShall set in glory, bids him drive the foe;\r\nNor unattended see the shades below.\r\nThen Hector\xe2\x80\x99s mind he fills with dire dismay;\r\nHe mounts his car, and calls his hosts away;\r\nSunk with Troy\xe2\x80\x99s heavy fates, he sees decline\r\nThe scales of Jove, and pants with awe divine.\r\n\r\nThen, nor before, the hardy Lycians fled,\r\nAnd left their monarch with the common dead:\r\nAround, in heaps on heaps, a dreadful wall\r\nOf carnage rises, as the heroes fall.\r\n(So Jove decreed!) At length the Greeks obtain\r\nThe prize contested, and despoil the slain.\r\nThe radiant arms are by Patroclus borne;\r\nPatroclus\xe2\x80\x99 ships the glorious spoils adorn.\r\n\r\nThen thus to Phoebus, in the realms above,\r\nSpoke from his throne the cloud-compelling Jove:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDescend, my Phoebus! on the Phrygian plain,\r\nAnd from the fight convey Sarpedon slain;\r\nThen bathe his body in the crystal flood,\r\nWith dust dishonour\xe2\x80\x99d, and deform\xe2\x80\x99d with blood;\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed,\r\nAnd with celestial robes adorn the dead.\r\nThose rites discharged, his sacred corse bequeath\r\nTo the soft arms of silent Sleep and Death.\r\nThey to his friends the immortal charge shall bear;\r\nHis friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear:\r\nWhat honour mortals after death receive,\r\nThose unavailing honours we may give!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLEEP AND DEATH CONVEYING THE BODY OF SARPEDON TO\r\nLYCIA.]\r\n\r\nApollo bows, and from mount Ida\xe2\x80\x99s height,\r\nSwift to the field precipitates his flight;\r\nThence from the war the breathless hero bore,\r\nVeil\xe2\x80\x99d in a cloud, to silver Simois\xe2\x80\x99 shore;\r\nThere bathed his honourable wounds, and dress\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nHis manly members in the immortal vest;\r\nAnd with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews\r\nRestores his freshness, and his form renews.\r\nThen Sleep and Death, two twins of winged race,\r\nOf matchless swiftness, but of silent pace,\r\nReceived Sarpedon, at the god\xe2\x80\x99s command,\r\nAnd in a moment reach\xe2\x80\x99d the Lycian land;\r\nThe corse amidst his weeping friends they laid,\r\nWhere endless honours wait the sacred shade.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Patroclus pours along the plains,\r\nWith foaming coursers, and with loosen\xe2\x80\x99d reins.\r\nFierce on the Trojan and the Lycian crew,\r\nAh blind to fate! thy headlong fury flew:\r\nAgainst what fate and powerful Jove ordain,\r\nVain was thy friend\xe2\x80\x99s command, thy courage vain.\r\nFor he, the god, whose counsels uncontroll\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nDismay the mighty, and confound the bold;\r\nThe god who gives, resumes, and orders all,\r\nHe urged thee on, and urged thee on to fall.\r\n\r\nWho first, brave hero! by that arm was slain,\r\nWho last beneath thy vengeance press\xe2\x80\x99d the plain;\r\nWhen heaven itself thy fatal fury led,\r\nAnd call\xe2\x80\x99d to fill the number of the dead?\r\nAdrestus first; Autonous then succeeds;\r\nEcheclus follows; next young Megas bleeds,\r\nEpistor, Melanippus, bite the ground;\r\nThe slaughter, Elasus and Mulius crown\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nThen sunk Pylartes to eternal night;\r\nThe rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight.\r\n\r\nNow Troy had stoop\xe2\x80\x99d beneath his matchless power,\r\nBut flaming Phoebus kept the sacred tower.\r\nThrice at the battlements Patroclus strook;246\r\nHis blazing aegis thrice Apollo shook;\r\nHe tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud,\r\nA more than mortal voice was heard aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wall\r\nDefies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;\r\nThy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,\r\nTroy shall not stoop even to Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spoke the god who darts celestial fires;\r\nThe Greek obeys him, and with awe retires.\r\nWhile Hector, checking at the Scaean gates\r\nHis panting coursers, in his breast debates,\r\nOr in the field his forces to employ,\r\nOr draw the troops within the walls of Troy.\r\nThus while he thought, beside him Phoebus stood,\r\nIn Asius\xe2\x80\x99 shape, who reigned by Sangar\xe2\x80\x99s flood;\r\n(Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung,\r\nA valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;)\r\nThus he accosts him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a shameful sight!\r\nGod! is it Hector that forbears the fight?\r\nWere thine my vigour this successful spear\r\nShould soon convince thee of so false a fear.\r\nTurn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,\r\nAnd in Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 blood efface thy shame.\r\nPerhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed,\r\nAnd heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight,\r\nAnd plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.\r\nHe bids Cebrion drive the rapid car;\r\nThe lash resounds, the coursers rush to war.\r\nThe god the Grecians\xe2\x80\x99 sinking souls depress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd pour\xe2\x80\x99d swift spirits through each Trojan breast.\r\nPatroclus lights, impatient for the fight;\r\nA spear his left, a stone employs his right:\r\nWith all his nerves he drives it at the foe.\r\nPointed above, and rough and gross below:\r\nThe falling ruin crush\xe2\x80\x99d Cebrion\xe2\x80\x99s head,\r\nThe lawless offspring of king Priam\xe2\x80\x99s bed;\r\nHis front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish\xe2\x80\x99d wound:\r\nThe bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.\r\nThe charioteer, while yet he held the rein,\r\nStruck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.\r\nTo the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,\r\nWhile the proud victor thus his fall derides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!\r\nWhat skilful divers are our Phrygian foes!\r\nMark with what ease they sink into the sand!\r\nPity that all their practice is by land!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,\r\nTo spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies:\r\nSwift as a lion, terrible and bold,\r\nThat sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;\r\nPierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,\r\nAnd from his fatal courage finds his bane.\r\nAt once bold Hector leaping from his car,\r\nDefends the body, and provokes the war.\r\nThus for some slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d hind, with equal rage,\r\nTwo lordly rulers of the wood engage;\r\nStung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,\r\nAnd echoing roars rebellow through the shades.\r\nStern Hector fastens on the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s head,\r\nAnd by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:\r\nWhile all around, confusion, rage, and fright,\r\nMix the contending hosts in mortal fight.\r\nSo pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud\r\nIn the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;\r\nLeaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,\r\nThe broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;\r\nThis way and that, the rattling thicket bends,\r\nAnd the whole forest in one crash descends.\r\nNot with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,\r\nIn dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.\r\nDarts shower\xe2\x80\x99d on darts, now round the carcase ring;\r\nNow flights of arrows bounding from the string:\r\nStones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,\r\nSome hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.\r\nBut where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,\r\nSunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,\r\nAnd, stretch\xe2\x80\x99d in death, forgets the guiding reins!\r\n\r\nNow flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven\r\nHis fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;\r\nWhile on each host with equal tempests fell\r\nThe showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.\r\nBut when his evening wheels o\xe2\x80\x99erhung the main,\r\nGlad conquest rested on the Grecian train.\r\nThen from amidst the tumult and alarms,\r\nThey draw the conquer\xe2\x80\x99d corse and radiant arms.\r\nThen rash Patroclus with new fury glows,\r\nAnd breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.\r\nThrice on the press like Mars himself he flew,\r\nAnd thrice three heroes at each onset slew.\r\nThere ends thy glory! there the Fates untwine\r\nThe last, black remnant of so bright a line:\r\nApollo dreadful stops thy middle way;\r\nDeath calls, and heaven allows no longer day!\r\n\r\nFor lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined,\r\nApproaching dealt a staggering blow behind.\r\nThe weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;\r\nHis eyes flash sparkles, his stunn\xe2\x80\x99d senses reel\r\nIn giddy darkness; far to distance flung,\r\nHis bounding helmet on the champaign rung.\r\nAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 plume is stain\xe2\x80\x99d with dust and gore;\r\nThat plume which never stoop\xe2\x80\x99d to earth before;\r\nLong used, untouch\xe2\x80\x99d, in fighting fields to shine,\r\nAnd shade the temples of the mad divine.\r\nJove dooms it now on Hector\xe2\x80\x99s helm to nod;\r\nNot long\xe2\x80\x94for fate pursues him, and the god.\r\n\r\nHis spear in shivers falls; his ample shield\r\nDrops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:\r\nThe corslet his astonish\xe2\x80\x99d breast forsakes:\r\nLoose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;\r\nStupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:\r\nSuch is the force of more than mortal hands!\r\n\r\nA Dardan youth there was, well known to fame,\r\nFrom Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name;\r\nFamed for the manage of the foaming horse,\r\nSkill\xe2\x80\x99d in the dart, and matchless in the course:\r\nFull twenty knights he tumbled from the car,\r\nWhile yet he learn\xe2\x80\x99d his rudiments of war.\r\nHis venturous spear first drew the hero\xe2\x80\x99s gore;\r\nHe struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.\r\nNor, though disarm\xe2\x80\x99d, Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 fury stood:\r\nBut swift withdrew the long-protended wood.\r\nAnd turn\xe2\x80\x99d him short, and herded in the crowd.\r\nThus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,\r\nWounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear,\r\nRetires for succour to his social train,\r\nAnd flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.\r\nStern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views,\r\nBreaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:\r\nThe lance arrests him with a mortal wound;\r\nHe falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.\r\nWith him all Greece was sunk; that moment all\r\nHer yet-surviving heroes seem\xe2\x80\x99d to fall.\r\nSo, scorch\xe2\x80\x99d with heat, along the desert score,\r\nThe roaming lion meets a bristly boar,\r\nFast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,\r\nWith flaming eyes, and jaws besmear\xe2\x80\x99d with blood;\r\nAt length the sovereign savage wins the strife;\r\nAnd the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.\r\nPatroclus thus, so many chiefs o\xe2\x80\x99erthrown,\r\nSo many lives effused, expires his own.\r\nAs dying now at Hector\xe2\x80\x99s feet he lies,\r\nHe sternly views him, and triumphant cries:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLie there, Patroclus!

This, Glaucus\r\nobjects to Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had\r\nwon from Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till\r\nAjax rallies them: \xc3\x86neas sustains the Trojans. \xc3\x86neas and Hector\r\nattempt the chariot of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The\r\nhorses of Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his\r\nbody with a thick darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion.\r\nMenelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndeath: then returns to the fight, where, though attacked with the\r\nutmost fury, he and Meriones, assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body\r\nto the ships.\r\n\r\nThe time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene lies\r\nin the fields before Troy.\r\n\r\nOn the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,\r\nLies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.\r\nGreat Menelaus, touch\xe2\x80\x99d with generous woe,\r\nSprings to the front, and guards him from the foe.\r\nThus round her new-fallen young the heifer moves,\r\nFruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves;\r\nAnd anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare)\r\nTurns, and re-turns her, with a mother\xe2\x80\x99s care,\r\nOpposed to each that near the carcase came,\r\nHis broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame.\r\n\r\nThe son of Panthus, skill\xe2\x80\x99d the dart to send,\r\nEyes the dead hero, and insults the friend.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low;\r\nWarrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow:\r\nTo me the spoils my prowess won, resign:\r\nDepart with life, and leave the glory mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nWith generous anguish, and in scorn return\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaugh\xe2\x80\x99st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne,\r\nWhen mortals boast of prowess not their own?\r\nNot thus the lion glories in his might,\r\nNor panther braves his spotted foe in fight,\r\nNor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;)\r\nMan only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain.\r\nBut far the vainest of the boastful kind,\r\nThese sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind.\r\nYet \xe2\x80\x99twas but late, beneath my conquering steel\r\nThis boaster\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Hyperenor, fell;\r\nAgainst our arm which rashly he defied,\r\nVain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.\r\nThese eyes beheld him on the dust expire,\r\nNo more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire.\r\nPresumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom,\r\nGo, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;\r\nOr, while thou may\xe2\x80\x99st, avoid the threaten\xe2\x80\x99d fate;\r\nFools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnmoved, Euphorbus thus: \xe2\x80\x9cThat action known,\r\nCome, for my brother\xe2\x80\x99s blood repay thy own.\r\nHis weeping father claims thy destined head,\r\nAnd spouse, a widow in her bridal bed.\r\nOn these thy conquer\xe2\x80\x99d spoils I shall bestow,\r\nTo soothe a consort\xe2\x80\x99s and a parent\xe2\x80\x99s woe.\r\nNo longer then defer the glorious strife,\r\nLet heaven decide our fortune, fame, and life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSwift as the word the missile lance he flings;\r\nThe well-aim\xe2\x80\x99d weapon on the buckler rings,\r\nBut blunted by the brass, innoxious falls.\r\nOn Jove the father great Atrides calls,\r\nNor flies the javelin from his arm in vain,\r\nIt pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain;\r\nWide through the neck appears the grisly wound,\r\nProne sinks the warrior, and his arms resound.\r\nThe shining circlets of his golden hair,\r\nWhich even the Graces might be proud to wear,\r\nInstarr\xe2\x80\x99d with gems and gold, bestrow the shore,\r\nWith dust dishonour\xe2\x80\x99d, and deform\xe2\x80\x99d with gore.\r\n\r\nAs the young olive, in some sylvan scene,\r\nCrown\xe2\x80\x99d by fresh fountains with eternal green,\r\nLifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,\r\nAnd plays and dances to the gentle air;\r\nWhen lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades\r\nThe tender plant, and withers all its shades;\r\nIt lies uprooted from its genial bed,\r\nA lovely ruin now defaced and dead:\r\nThus young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay,\r\nWhile the fierce Spartan tore his arms away.\r\nProud of his deed, and glorious in the prize,\r\nAffrighted Troy the towering victor flies:\r\nFlies, as before some mountain lion\xe2\x80\x99s ire\r\nThe village curs and trembling swains retire,\r\nWhen o\xe2\x80\x99er the slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d bull they hear him roar,\r\nAnd see his jaws distil with smoking gore:\r\nAll pale with fear, at distance scatter\xe2\x80\x99d round,\r\nThey shout incessant, and the vales resound.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Apollo view\xe2\x80\x99d with envious eyes,\r\nAnd urged great Hector to dispute the prize;\r\n(In Mentes\xe2\x80\x99 shape, beneath whose martial care\r\nThe rough Ciconians learn\xe2\x80\x99d the trade of war;)247\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chase\r\nAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 coursers, of ethereal race;\r\nThey stoop not, these, to mortal man\xe2\x80\x99s command,\r\nOr stoop to none but great Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 hand.\r\nToo long amused with a pursuit so vain,\r\nTurn, and behold the brave Euphorbus slain;\r\nBy Sparta slain! for ever now suppress\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe fire which burn\xe2\x80\x99d in that undaunted breast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus having spoke, Apollo wing\xe2\x80\x99d his flight,\r\nAnd mix\xe2\x80\x99d with mortals in the toils of fight:\r\nHis words infix\xe2\x80\x99d unutterable care\r\nDeep in great Hector\xe2\x80\x99s soul: through all the war\r\nHe darts his anxious eye; and, instant, view\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe breathless hero in his blood imbued,\r\n(Forth welling from the wound, as prone he lay)\r\nAnd in the victor\xe2\x80\x99s hands the shining prey.\r\nSheath\xe2\x80\x99d in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies,\r\nAnd sends his voice in thunder to the skies:\r\nFierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sent,\r\nIt flew, and fired the nations as it went.\r\nAtrides from the voice the storm divined,\r\nAnd thus explored his own unconquer\xe2\x80\x99d mind:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen shall I quit Patroclus on the plain,\r\nSlain in my cause, and for my honour slain!\r\nDesert the arms, the relics, of my friend?\r\nOr singly, Hector and his troops attend?\r\nSure where such partial favour heaven bestow\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nTo brave the hero were to brave the god:\r\nForgive me, Greece, if once I quit the field;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis not to Hector, but to heaven I yield.\r\nYet, nor the god, nor heaven, should give me fear,\r\nDid but the voice of Ajax reach my ear:\r\nStill would we turn, still battle on the plains,\r\nAnd give Achilles all that yet remains\r\nOf his and our Patroclus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d This, no more\r\nThe time allow\xe2\x80\x99d: Troy thicken\xe2\x80\x99d on the shore.\r\nA sable scene! The terrors Hector led.\r\nSlow he recedes, and sighing quits the dead.\r\n\r\nSo from the fold the unwilling lion parts,\r\nForced by loud clamours, and a storm of darts;\r\nHe flies indeed, but threatens as he flies,\r\nWith heart indignant and retorted eyes.\r\nNow enter\xe2\x80\x99d in the Spartan ranks, he turn\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nHis manly breast, and with new fury burn\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er all the black battalions sent his view,\r\nAnd through the cloud the godlike Ajax knew;\r\nWhere labouring on the left the warrior stood,\r\nAll grim in arms, and cover\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er with blood;\r\nThere breathing courage, where the god of day\r\nHad sunk each heart with terror and dismay.\r\n\r\nTo him the king: \xe2\x80\x9cOh Ajax, oh my friend!\r\nHaste, and Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 loved remains defend:\r\nThe body to Achilles to restore\r\nDemands our care; alas, we can no more!\r\nFor naked now, despoiled of arms, he lies;\r\nAnd Hector glories in the dazzling prize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe said, and touch\xe2\x80\x99d his heart. The raging pair\r\nPierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.\r\nAlready had stern Hector seized his head,\r\nAnd doom\xe2\x80\x99d to Trojan gods the unhappy dead;\r\nBut soon as Ajax rear\xe2\x80\x99d his tower-like shield,\r\nSprung to his car, and measured back the field,\r\nHis train to Troy the radiant armour bear,\r\nTo stand a trophy of his fame in war.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile great Ajax (his broad shield display\xe2\x80\x99d)\r\nGuards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;\r\nAnd now before, and now behind he stood:\r\nThus in the centre of some gloomy wood,\r\nWith many a step, the lioness surrounds\r\nHer tawny young, beset by men and hounds;\r\nElate her heart, and rousing all her powers,\r\nDark o\xe2\x80\x99er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.\r\nFast by his side the generous Spartan glows\r\nWith great revenge, and feeds his inward woes.\r\n\r\nBut Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids,\r\nOn Hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere now in Hector shall we Hector find?\r\nA manly form, without a manly mind.\r\nIs this, O chief! a hero\xe2\x80\x99s boasted fame?\r\nHow vain, without the merit, is the name!\r\nSince battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ\r\nWhat other methods may preserve thy Troy:\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis time to try if Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s state can stand\r\nBy thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand:\r\nMean, empty boast! but shall the Lycians stake\r\nTheir lives for you? those Lycians you forsake?\r\nWhat from thy thankless arms can we expect?\r\nThy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect;\r\nSay, shall our slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d bodies guard your walls,\r\nWhile unreveng\xe2\x80\x99d the great Sarpedon falls?\r\nEven where he died for Troy, you left him there,\r\nA feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.\r\nOn my command if any Lycian wait,\r\nHence let him march, and give up Troy to fate.\r\nDid such a spirit as the gods impart\r\nImpel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart,\r\n(Such as should burn in every soul that draws\r\nThe sword for glory, and his country\xe2\x80\x99s cause)\r\nEven yet our mutual arms we might employ,\r\nAnd drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy.\r\nOh! were Patroclus ours, we might obtain\r\nSarpedon\xe2\x80\x99s arms and honour\xe2\x80\x99d corse again!\r\nGreece with Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 friend should be repaid,\r\nAnd thus due honours purchased to his shade.\r\nBut words are vain\xe2\x80\x94Let Ajax once appear,\r\nAnd Hector trembles and recedes with fear;\r\nThou dar\xe2\x80\x99st not meet the terrors of his eye;\r\nAnd lo! already thou prepar\xe2\x80\x99st to fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Trojan chief with fix\xe2\x80\x99d resentment eyed\r\nThe Lycian leader, and sedate replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, is it just, my friend, that Hector\xe2\x80\x99s ear\r\nFrom such a warrior such a speech should hear?\r\nI deem\xe2\x80\x99d thee once the wisest of thy kind,\r\nBut ill this insult suits a prudent mind.\r\nI shun great Ajax? I desert my train?\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain;\r\nI joy to mingle where the battle bleeds,\r\nAnd hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.\r\nBut Jove\xe2\x80\x99s high will is ever uncontroll\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe strong he withers, and confounds the bold;\r\nNow crowns with fame the mighty man, and now\r\nStrikes the fresh garland from the victor\xe2\x80\x99s brow!\r\nCome, through yon squadrons let us hew the way,\r\nAnd thou be witness, if I fear to-day;\r\nIf yet a Greek the sight of Hector dread,\r\nOr yet their hero dare defend the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen turning to the martial hosts, he cries:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, and allies!\r\nBe men, my friends, in action as in name,\r\nAnd yet be mindful of your ancient fame.\r\nHector in proud Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 arms shall shine,\r\nTorn from his friend, by right of conquest mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe strode along the field, as thus he said:\r\n(The sable plumage nodded o\xe2\x80\x99er his head:)\r\nSwift through the spacious plain he sent a look;\r\nOne instant saw, one instant overtook\r\nThe distant band, that on the sandy shore\r\nThe radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore.\r\nThere his own mail unbraced the field bestrow\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nHis train to Troy convey\xe2\x80\x99d the massy load.\r\nNow blazing in the immortal arms he stands;\r\nThe work and present of celestial hands;\r\nBy aged Peleus to Achilles given,\r\nAs first to Peleus by the court of heaven:\r\nHis father\xe2\x80\x99s arms not long Achilles wears,\r\nForbid by fate to reach his father\xe2\x80\x99s years.\r\n\r\nHim, proud in triumph, glittering from afar,\r\nThe god whose thunder rends the troubled air\r\nBeheld with pity; as apart he sat,\r\nAnd, conscious, look\xe2\x80\x99d through all the scene of fate.\r\nHe shook the sacred honours of his head;\r\nOlympus trembled, and the godhead said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, wretched man! unmindful of thy end!\r\nA moment\xe2\x80\x99s glory; and what fates attend!\r\nIn heavenly panoply divinely bright\r\nThou stand\xe2\x80\x99st, and armies tremble at thy sight,\r\nAs at Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 self! beneath thy dart\r\nLies slain the great Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 dearer part.\r\nThou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn,\r\nWhich once the greatest of mankind had worn.\r\nYet live! I give thee one illustrious day,\r\nA blaze of glory ere thou fad\xe2\x80\x99st away.\r\nFor ah! no more Andromache shall come\r\nWith joyful tears to welcome Hector home;\r\nNo more officious, with endearing charms,\r\nFrom thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides\xe2\x80\x99 arms!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen with his sable brow he gave the nod\r\nThat seals his word; the sanction of the god.\r\nThe stubborn arms (by Jove\xe2\x80\x99s command disposed)\r\nConform\xe2\x80\x99d spontaneous, and around him closed:\r\nFill\xe2\x80\x99d with the god, enlarged his members grew,\r\nThrough all his veins a sudden vigour flew,\r\nThe blood in brisker tides began to roll,\r\nAnd Mars himself came rushing on his soul.\r\nExhorting loud through all the field he strode,\r\nAnd look\xe2\x80\x99d, and moved, Achilles, or a god.\r\nNow Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, he inspires,\r\nNow Phorcys, Chromius, and Hippothous fires;\r\nThe great Thersilochus like fury found,\r\nAsteropaeus kindled at the sound,\r\nAnd Ennomus, in augury renown\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, all ye hosts, and hear, unnumber\xe2\x80\x99d bands\r\nOf neighbouring nations, or of distant lands!\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas not for state we summon\xe2\x80\x99d you so far,\r\nTo boast our numbers, and the pomp of war:\r\nYe came to fight; a valiant foe to chase,\r\nTo save our present, and our future race.\r\nFor this, our wealth, our products, you enjoy,\r\nAnd glean the relics of exhausted Troy.\r\nNow then, to conquer or to die prepare;\r\nTo die or conquer are the terms of war.\r\nWhatever hand shall win Patroclus slain,\r\nWhoe\xe2\x80\x99er shall drag him to the Trojan train,\r\nWith Hector\xe2\x80\x99s self shall equal honours claim;\r\nWith Hector part the spoil, and share the fame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears,\r\nThey join, they thicken, they protend their spears;\r\nFull on the Greeks they drive in firm array,\r\nAnd each from Ajax hopes the glorious prey:\r\nVain hope! what numbers shall the field o\xe2\x80\x99erspread,\r\nWhat victims perish round the mighty dead!\r\n\r\nGreat Ajax mark\xe2\x80\x99d the growing storm from far,\r\nAnd thus bespoke his brother of the war:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur fatal day, alas! is come, my friend;\r\nAnd all our wars and glories at an end!\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis not this corse alone we guard in vain,\r\nCondemn\xe2\x80\x99d to vultures on the Trojan plain;\r\nWe too must yield: the same sad fate must fall\r\nOn thee, on me, perhaps, my friend, on all.\r\nSee what a tempest direful Hector spreads,\r\nAnd lo! it bursts, it thunders on our heads!\r\nCall on our Greeks, if any hear the call,\r\nThe bravest Greeks: this hour demands them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe warrior raised his voice, and wide around\r\nThe field re-echoed the distressful sound.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO chiefs!

in life\xe2\x80\x99s first bloom he fell,\r\nSent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.\r\n\r\nOnce more at Ajax Hector\xe2\x80\x99s javelin flies;\r\nThe Grecian marking, as it cut the skies,\r\nShunn\xe2\x80\x99d the descending death; which hissing on,\r\nStretch\xe2\x80\x99d in the dust the great Iphytus\xe2\x80\x99 son,\r\nSchedius the brave, of all the Phocian kind\r\nThe boldest warrior and the noblest mind:\r\nIn little Panope, for strength renown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nHe held his seat, and ruled the realms around.\r\nPlunged in his throat, the weapon drank his blood,\r\nAnd deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood;\r\nIn clanging arms the hero fell and all\r\nThe fields resounded with his weighty fall.\r\n\r\nPhorcys, as slain Hippothous he defends,\r\nThe Telamonian lance his belly rends;\r\nThe hollow armour burst before the stroke,\r\nAnd through the wound the rushing entrails broke:\r\nIn strong convulsions panting on the sands\r\nHe lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.\r\n\r\nStruck at the sight, recede the Trojan train:\r\nThe shouting Argives strip the heroes slain.\r\nAnd now had Troy, by Greece compell\xe2\x80\x99d to yield,\r\nFled to her ramparts, and resign\xe2\x80\x99d the field;\r\nGreece, in her native fortitude elate,\r\nWith Jove averse, had turn\xe2\x80\x99d the scale of fate:\r\nBut Phoebus urged \xc3\x86neas to the fight;\r\nHe seem\xe2\x80\x99d like aged Periphas to sight:\r\n(A herald in Anchises\xe2\x80\x99 love grown old,\r\nRevered for prudence, and with prudence bold.)\r\n\r\nThus he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat methods yet, O chief! remain,\r\nTo save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain?\r\nThere have been heroes, who, by virtuous care,\r\nBy valour, numbers, and by arts of war,\r\nHave forced the powers to spare a sinking state,\r\nAnd gain\xe2\x80\x99d at length the glorious odds of fate:\r\nBut you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares\r\nHis partial favour, and assists your wars,\r\nYour shameful efforts \xe2\x80\x99gainst yourselves employ,\r\nAnd force the unwilling god to ruin Troy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc3\x86neas through the form assumed descries\r\nThe power conceal\xe2\x80\x99d, and thus to Hector cries:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh lasting shame! to our own fears a prey,\r\nWe seek our ramparts, and desert the day.\r\nA god, nor is he less, my bosom warms,\r\nAnd tells me, Jove asserts the Trojan arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke, and foremost to the combat flew:\r\nThe bold example all his hosts pursue.\r\nThen, first, Leocritus beneath him bled,\r\nIn vain beloved by valiant Lycomede;\r\nWho view\xe2\x80\x99d his fall, and, grieving at the chance,\r\nSwift to revenge it sent his angry lance;\r\nThe whirling lance, with vigorous force address\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nDescends, and pants in Apisaon\xe2\x80\x99s breast;\r\nFrom rich Paeonia\xe2\x80\x99s vales the warrior came,\r\nNext thee, Asteropeus! in place and fame.\r\nAsteropeus with grief beheld the slain,\r\nAnd rush\xe2\x80\x99d to combat, but he rush\xe2\x80\x99d in vain:\r\nIndissolubly firm, around the dead,\r\nRank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,\r\nAnd hemm\xe2\x80\x99d with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,\r\nA brazen bulwark, and an iron wood.\r\nGreat Ajax eyes them with incessant care,\r\nAnd in an orb contracts the crowded war,\r\nClose in their ranks commands to fight or fall,\r\nAnd stands the centre and the soul of all:\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d on the spot they war, and wounded, wound;\r\nA sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:\r\nOn heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled,\r\nAnd, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.\r\n\r\nGreece, in close order, and collected might,\r\nYet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;\r\nFierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,\r\nAnd now it rises, now it sinks by turns.\r\nIn one thick darkness all the fight was lost;\r\nThe sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host\r\nSeem\xe2\x80\x99d as extinct: day ravish\xe2\x80\x99d from their eyes,\r\nAnd all heaven\xe2\x80\x99s splendours blotted from the skies.\r\nSuch o\xe2\x80\x99er Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 body hung the night,\r\nThe rest in sunshine fought, and open light;\r\nUnclouded there, the aerial azure spread,\r\nNo vapour rested on the mountain\xe2\x80\x99s head,\r\nThe golden sun pour\xe2\x80\x99d forth a stronger ray,\r\nAnd all the broad expansion flamed with day.\r\nDispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,\r\nAnd here and there their scatter\xe2\x80\x99d arrows light:\r\nBut death and darkness o\xe2\x80\x99er the carcase spread,\r\nThere burn\xe2\x80\x99d the war, and there the mighty bled.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear,\r\n(Their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear,\r\nAnd skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command,\r\nWhen from the ships he sent the Pylian band.\r\nThe youthful brothers thus for fame contend,\r\nNor knew the fortune of Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 friend;\r\nIn thought they view\xe2\x80\x99d him still, with martial joy,\r\nGlorious in arms, and dealing death to Troy.\r\n\r\nBut round the corse the heroes pant for breath,\r\nAnd thick and heavy grows the work of death:\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99erlabour\xe2\x80\x99d now, with dust, and sweat, and gore,\r\nTheir knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o\xe2\x80\x99er;\r\nDrops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,\r\nAnd carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.\r\nAs when a slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d bull\xe2\x80\x99s yet reeking hide,\r\nStrain\xe2\x80\x99d with full force, and tugg\xe2\x80\x99d from side to side,\r\nThe brawny curriers stretch; and labour o\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nThe extended surface, drunk with fat and gore:\r\nSo tugging round the corse both armies stood;\r\nThe mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;\r\nWhile Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ,\r\nNow to the ships to force it, now to Troy.\r\nNot Pallas\xe2\x80\x99 self, her breast when fury warms,\r\nNor he whose anger sets the world in arms,\r\nCould blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nSuch, Jove to honour the great dead ordain\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n\r\nAchilles in his ships at distance lay,\r\nNor knew the fatal fortune of the day;\r\nHe, yet unconscious of Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 fall,\r\nIn dust extended under Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s wall,\r\nExpects him glorious from the conquered plain,\r\nAnd for his wish\xe2\x80\x99d return prepares in vain;\r\nThough well he knew, to make proud Ilion bend\r\nWas more than heaven had destined to his friend.\r\nPerhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThe rest, in pity to her son, conceal\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n\r\nStill raged the conflict round the hero dead,\r\nAnd heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCursed be the man (even private Greeks would say)\r\nWho dares desert this well-disputed day!\r\nFirst may the cleaving earth before our eyes\r\nGape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice;\r\nFirst perish all, ere haughty Troy shall boast\r\nWe lost Patroclus, and our glory lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus they: while with one voice the Trojans said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrant this day, Jove! or heap us on the dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen clash their sounding arms; the clangours rise,\r\nAnd shake the brazen concave of the skies.\r\n\r\nMeantime, at distance from the scene of blood,\r\nThe pensive steeds of great Achilles stood:\r\nTheir godlike master slain before their eyes,\r\nThey wept, and shared in human miseries.248\r\nIn vain Automedon now shakes the rein,\r\nNow plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain;\r\nNor to the fight nor Hellespont they go,\r\nRestive they stood, and obstinate in woe:\r\nStill as a tombstone, never to be moved,\r\nOn some good man or woman unreproved\r\nLays its eternal weight; or fix\xe2\x80\x99d, as stands\r\nA marble courser by the sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s hands,\r\nPlaced on the hero\xe2\x80\x99s grave. Along their face\r\nThe big round drops coursed down with silent pace,\r\nConglobing on the dust. Their manes, that late\r\nCircled their arched necks, and waved in state,\r\nTrail\xe2\x80\x99d on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,\r\nAnd prone to earth was hung their languid head:\r\nNor Jove disdain\xe2\x80\x99d to cast a pitying look,\r\nWhile thus relenting to the steeds he spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy coursers of immortal strain,\r\nExempt from age, and deathless, now in vain;\r\nDid we your race on mortal man bestow,\r\nOnly, alas! to share in mortal woe?\r\nFor ah! what is there of inferior birth,\r\nThat breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth;\r\nWhat wretched creature of what wretched kind,\r\nThan man more weak, calamitous, and blind?\r\nA miserable race! but cease to mourn:\r\nFor not by you shall Priam\xe2\x80\x99s son be borne\r\nHigh on the splendid car: one glorious prize\r\nHe rashly boasts: the rest our will denies.\r\nOurself will swiftness to your nerves impart,\r\nOurself with rising spirits swell your heart.\r\nAutomedon your rapid flight shall bear\r\nSafe to the navy through the storm of war.\r\nFor yet \xe2\x80\x99tis given to Troy to ravage o\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nThe field, and spread her slaughters to the shore;\r\nThe sun shall see her conquer, till his fall\r\nWith sacred darkness shades the face of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said; and breathing in the immortal horse\r\nExcessive spirit, urged them to the course;\r\nFrom their high manes they shake the dust, and bear\r\nThe kindling chariot through the parted war:\r\nSo flies a vulture through the clamorous train\r\nOf geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain.\r\nFrom danger now with swiftest speed they flew,\r\nAnd now to conquest with like speed pursue;\r\nSole in the seat the charioteer remains,\r\nNow plies the javelin, now directs the reins:\r\nHim brave Alcimedon beheld distress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nApproach\xe2\x80\x99d the chariot, and the chief address\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat god provokes thee rashly thus to dare,\r\nAlone, unaided, in the thickest war?\r\nAlas! thy friend is slain, and Hector wields\r\nAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 arms triumphant in the fields.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn happy time (the charioteer replies)\r\nThe bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes;\r\nNo Greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains,\r\nOr holds their fury in suspended reins:\r\nPatroclus, while he lived, their rage could tame,\r\nBut now Patroclus is an empty name!\r\nTo thee I yield the seat, to thee resign\r\nThe ruling charge: the task of fight be mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said. Alcimedon, with active heat,\r\nSnatches the reins, and vaults into the seat.\r\nHis friend descends. The chief of Troy descried,\r\nAnd call\xe2\x80\x99d \xc3\x86neas fighting near his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLo, to my sight, beyond our hope restored,\r\nAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 car, deserted of its lord!\r\nThe glorious steeds our ready arms invite,\r\nScarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.\r\nCan such opponents stand when we assail?\r\nUnite thy force, my friend, and we prevail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe son of Venus to the counsel yields;\r\nThen o\xe2\x80\x99er their backs they spread their solid shields:\r\nWith brass refulgent the broad surface shined,\r\nAnd thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.\r\nThem Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds;\r\nEach hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds:\r\nIn vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn,\r\nIn vain advance! not fated to return.\r\n\r\nUnmov\xe2\x80\x99d, Automedon attends the fight,\r\nImplores the Eternal, and collects his might.\r\nThen turning to his friend, with dauntless mind:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh keep the foaming coursers close behind!\r\nFull on my shoulders let their nostrils blow,\r\nFor hard the fight, determined is the foe;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis Hector comes: and when he seeks the prize,\r\nWar knows no mean; he wins it or he dies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen through the field he sends his voice aloud,\r\nAnd calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd,\r\nWith great Atrides. \xe2\x80\x9cHither turn, (he said,)\r\nTurn where distress demands immediate aid;\r\nThe dead, encircled by his friends, forego,\r\nAnd save the living from a fiercer foe.\r\nUnhelp\xe2\x80\x99d we stand, unequal to engage\r\nThe force of Hector, and \xc3\x86neas\xe2\x80\x99 rage:\r\nYet mighty as they are, my force to prove\r\nIs only mine: the event belongs to Jove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung,\r\nWhich pass\xe2\x80\x99d the shield of Aretus the young:\r\nIt pierced his belt, emboss\xe2\x80\x99d with curious art,\r\nThen in the lower belly struck the dart.\r\nAs when a ponderous axe, descending full,\r\nCleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:249\r\nStruck \xe2\x80\x99twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,\r\nThen tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:\r\nThus fell the youth; the air his soul received,\r\nAnd the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.\r\n\r\nNow at Automedon the Trojan foe\r\nDischarged his lance; the meditated blow,\r\nStooping, he shunn\xe2\x80\x99d; the javelin idly fled,\r\nAnd hiss\xe2\x80\x99d innoxious o\xe2\x80\x99er the hero\xe2\x80\x99s head;\r\nDeep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear\r\nIn long vibrations spent its fury there.\r\nWith clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,\r\nBut each brave Ajax heard, and interposed;\r\nNor longer Hector with his Trojans stood,\r\nBut left their slain companion in his blood:\r\nHis arms Automedon divests, and cries,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccept, Patroclus, this mean sacrifice:\r\nThus have I soothed my griefs, and thus have paid,\r\nPoor as it is, some offering to thy shade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo looks the lion o\xe2\x80\x99er a mangled boar,\r\nAll grim with rage, and horrible with gore;\r\nHigh on the chariot at one bound he sprung,\r\nAnd o\xe2\x80\x99er his seat the bloody trophies hung.\r\n\r\nAnd now Minerva from the realms of air\r\nDescends impetuous, and renews the war;\r\nFor, pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid,\r\nThe lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid.\r\nAs when high Jove denouncing future woe,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,\r\n(In sign of tempests from the troubled air,\r\nOr from the rage of man, destructive war,)\r\nThe drooping cattle dread the impending skies,\r\nAnd from his half-till\xe2\x80\x99d field the labourer flies:\r\nIn such a form the goddess round her drew\r\nA livid cloud, and to the battle flew.\r\nAssuming Phoenix\xe2\x80\x99 shape on earth she falls,\r\nAnd in his well-known voice to Sparta calls:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd lies Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 friend, beloved by all,\r\nA prey to dogs beneath the Trojan wall?\r\nWhat shame \'o Greece for future times to tell,\r\nTo thee the greatest in whose cause he fell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO chief, O father! (Atreus\xe2\x80\x99 son replies)\r\nO full of days! by long experience wise!\r\nWhat more desires my soul, than here unmoved\r\nTo guard the body of the man I loved?\r\nAh, would Minerva send me strength to rear\r\nThis wearied arm, and ward the storm of war!\r\nBut Hector, like the rage of fire, we dread,\r\nAnd Jove\xe2\x80\x99s own glories blaze around his head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPleased to be first of all the powers address\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nShe breathes new vigour in her hero\xe2\x80\x99s breast,\r\nAnd fills with keen revenge, with fell despite,\r\nDesire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight.\r\nSo burns the vengeful hornet (soul all o\xe2\x80\x99er),\r\nRepulsed in vain, and thirsty still of gore;\r\n(Bold son of air and heat) on angry wings\r\nUntamed, untired, he turns, attacks, and stings.\r\nFired with like ardour fierce Atrides flew,\r\nAnd sent his soul with every lance he threw.\r\n\r\nThere stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame,\r\nAetion\xe2\x80\x99s son, and Podes was his name:\r\nWith riches honour\xe2\x80\x99d, and with courage bless\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nBy Hector loved, his comrade, and his guest;\r\nThrough his broad belt the spear a passage found,\r\nAnd, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound.\r\nSudden at Hector\xe2\x80\x99s side Apollo stood,\r\nLike Phaenops, Asius\xe2\x80\x99 son, appear\xe2\x80\x99d the god;\r\n(Asius the great, who held his wealthy reign\r\nIn fair Abydos, by the rolling main.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh prince! (he cried) Oh foremost once in fame!\r\nWhat Grecian now shall tremble at thy name?\r\nDost thou at length to Menelaus yield,\r\nA chief once thought no terror of the field?\r\nYet singly, now, the long-disputed prize\r\nHe bears victorious, while our army flies:\r\nBy the same arm illustrious Podes bled;\r\nThe friend of Hector, unrevenged, is dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThis heard, o\xe2\x80\x99er Hector spreads a cloud of woe,\r\nRage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.\r\n\r\nBut now the Eternal shook his sable shield,\r\nThat shaded Ide and all the subject field\r\nBeneath its ample verge. A rolling cloud\r\nInvolved the mount; the thunder roar\xe2\x80\x99d aloud;\r\nThe affrighted hills from their foundations nod,\r\nAnd blaze beneath the lightnings of the god:\r\nAt one regard of his all-seeing eye\r\nThe vanquish\xe2\x80\x99d triumph, and the victors fly.\r\n\r\nThen trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led;\r\nFor as the brave Boeotian turn\xe2\x80\x99d his head\r\nTo face the foe, Polydamas drew near,\r\nAnd razed his shoulder with a shorten\xe2\x80\x99d spear:\r\nBy Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain,\r\nPierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain,\r\nGrasps his once formidable lance in vain.\r\n\r\nAs Hector follow\xe2\x80\x99d, Idomen address\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe flaming javelin to his manly breast;\r\nThe brittle point before his corslet yields;\r\nExulting Troy with clamour fills the fields:\r\nHigh on his chariots the Cretan stood,\r\nThe son of Priam whirl\xe2\x80\x99d the massive wood.\r\nBut erring from its aim, the impetuous spear\r\nStruck to the dust the squire and charioteer\r\nOf martial Merion: Coeranus his name,\r\nWho left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame.\r\nOn foot bold Merion fought; and now laid low,\r\nHad graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe,\r\nBut the brave squire the ready coursers brought,\r\nAnd with his life his master\xe2\x80\x99s safety bought.\r\nBetween his cheek and ear the weapon went,\r\nThe teeth it shatter\xe2\x80\x99d, and the tongue it rent.\r\nProne from the seat he tumbles to the plain;\r\nHis dying hand forgets the falling rein:\r\nThis Merion reaches, bending from the car,\r\nAnd urges to desert the hopeless war:\r\nIdomeneus consents; the lash applies;\r\nAnd the swift chariot to the navy flies.\r\n\r\nNot Ajax less the will of heaven descried,\r\nAnd conquest shifting to the Trojan side,\r\nTurn\xe2\x80\x99d by the hand of Jove. Then thus begun,\r\nTo Atreus\xe2\x80\x99s seed, the godlike Telamon:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! who sees not Jove\xe2\x80\x99s almighty hand\r\nTransfers the glory to the Trojan band?\r\nWhether the weak or strong discharge the dart,\r\nHe guides each arrow to a Grecian heart:\r\nNot so our spears; incessant though they rain,\r\nHe suffers every lance to fall in vain.\r\nDeserted of the god, yet let us try\r\nWhat human strength and prudence can supply;\r\nIf yet this honour\xe2\x80\x99d corse, in triumph borne,\r\nMay glad the fleets that hope not our return,\r\nWho tremble yet, scarce rescued from their fates,\r\nAnd still hear Hector thundering at their gates.\r\nSome hero too must be despatch\xe2\x80\x99d to bear\r\nThe mournful message to Pelides\xe2\x80\x99 ear;\r\nFor sure he knows not, distant on the shore,\r\nHis friend, his loved Patroclus, is no more.\r\nBut such a chief I spy not through the host:\r\nThe men, the steeds, the armies, all are lost\r\nIn general darkness\xe2\x80\x94Lord of earth and air!\r\nOh king! Oh father! hear my humble prayer:\r\nDispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore;\r\nGive me to see, and Ajax asks no more:\r\nIf Greece must perish, we thy will obey,\r\nBut let us perish in the face of day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer\r\nThe god relenting clear\xe2\x80\x99d the clouded air;\r\nForth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray;\r\nThe blaze of armour flash\xe2\x80\x99d against the day.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, now, Atrides! cast around thy sight;\r\nIf yet Antilochus survives the fight,\r\nLet him to great Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 ear convey\r\nThe fatal news\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Atrides hastes away.\r\n\r\nSo turns the lion from the nightly fold,\r\nThough high in courage, and with hunger bold,\r\nLong gall\xe2\x80\x99d by herdsmen, and long vex\xe2\x80\x99d by hounds,\r\nStiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds;\r\nThe darts fly round him from a hundred hands,\r\nAnd the red terrors of the blazing brands:\r\nTill late, reluctant, at the dawn of day\r\nSour he departs, and quits the untasted prey,\r\nSo moved Atrides from his dangerous place\r\nWith weary limbs, but with unwilling pace;\r\nThe foe, he fear\xe2\x80\x99d, might yet Patroclus gain,\r\nAnd much admonish\xe2\x80\x99d, much adjured his train:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO guard these relics to your charge consign\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd bear the merits of the dead in mind;\r\nHow skill\xe2\x80\x99d he was in each obliging art;\r\nThe mildest manners, and the gentlest heart:\r\nHe was, alas! but fate decreed his end,\r\nIn death a hero, as in life a friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo parts the chief; from rank to rank he flew,\r\nAnd round on all sides sent his piercing view.\r\nAs the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye\r\nOf all that wings the mid a\xc3\xabrial sky,\r\nThe sacred eagle, from his walks above\r\nLooks down, and sees the distant thicket move;\r\nThen stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare,\r\nSnatches his life amid the clouds of air.\r\nNot with less quickness, his exerted sight\r\nPass\xe2\x80\x99d this and that way, through the ranks of fight:\r\nTill on the left the chief he sought, he found,\r\nCheering his men, and spreading deaths around:\r\n\r\nTo him the king: \xe2\x80\x9cBeloved of Jove! draw near,\r\nFor sadder tidings never touch\xe2\x80\x99d thy ear;\r\nThy eyes have witness\xe2\x80\x99d what a fatal turn!\r\nHow Ilion triumphs, and the Achaians mourn.\r\nThis is not all: Patroclus, on the shore\r\nNow pale and dead, shall succour Greece no more.\r\nFly to the fleet, this instant fly, and tell\r\nThe sad Achilles, how his loved-one fell:\r\nHe too may haste the naked corse to gain:\r\nThe arms are Hector\xe2\x80\x99s, who despoil\xe2\x80\x99d the slain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youthful warrior heard with silent woe,\r\nFrom his fair eyes the tears began to flow:\r\nBig with the mighty grief, he strove to say\r\nWhat sorrow dictates, but no word found way.\r\nTo brave Laodocus his arms he flung,\r\nWho, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along;\r\nThen ran the mournful message to impart,\r\nWith tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.\r\n\r\nSwift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands\r\n(Though sore distress\xe2\x80\x99d) to aid the Pylian bands;\r\nBut bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain;\r\nHimself returns to his Patroclus slain.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone is Antilochus (the hero said);\r\nBut hope not, warriors, for Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 aid:\r\nThough fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe,\r\nUnarm\xe2\x80\x99d, he fights not with the Trojan foe.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis our own vigour must the dead regain,\r\nAnd save ourselves, while with impetuous hate\r\nTroy pours along, and this way rolls our fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis well (said Ajax), be it then thy care,\r\nWith Merion\xe2\x80\x99s aid, the weighty corse to rear;\r\nMyself, and my bold brother will sustain\r\nThe shock of Hector and his charging train:\r\nNor fear we armies, fighting side by side;\r\nWhat Troy can dare, we have already tried,\r\nHave tried it, and have stood.\xe2\x80\x9d The hero said.\r\nHigh from the ground the warriors heave the dead.\r\nA general clamour rises at the sight:\r\nLoud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight.\r\nNot fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,\r\nWith rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,\r\nVoracious hounds, that many a length before\r\nTheir furious hunters, drive the wounded boar;\r\nBut if the savage turns his glaring eye,\r\nThey howl aloof, and round the forest fly.\r\nThus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour,\r\nWave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower:\r\nBut Ajax turning, to their fears they yield,\r\nAll pale they tremble and forsake the field.\r\n\r\nWhile thus aloft the hero\xe2\x80\x99s corse they bear,\r\nBehind them rages all the storm of war:\r\nConfusion, tumult, horror, o\xe2\x80\x99er the throng\r\nOf men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along:\r\nLess fierce the winds with rising flames conspire\r\nTo whelm some city under waves of fire;\r\nNow sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes,\r\nNow crack the blazing temples of the gods;\r\nThe rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,\r\nAnd sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.\r\nThe heroes sweat beneath their honour\xe2\x80\x99d load:\r\nAs when two mules, along the rugged road,\r\nFrom the steep mountain with exerted strength\r\nDrag some vast beam, or mast\xe2\x80\x99s unwieldy length;\r\nInly they groan, big drops of sweat distil,\r\nThe enormous timber lumbering down the hill:\r\nSo these\xe2\x80\x94Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands,\r\nAnd breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.\r\nThus when a river swell\xe2\x80\x99d with sudden rains\r\nSpreads his broad waters o\xe2\x80\x99er the level plains,\r\nSome interposing hill the stream divides,\r\nAnd breaks its force, and turns the winding tides.\r\nStill close they follow, close the rear engage;\r\n\xc3\x86neas storms, and Hector foams with rage:\r\nWhile Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,\r\nWedged in one body, like a flight of cranes,\r\nThat shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung\r\nHigh on poised pinions, threats their callow young.\r\nSo from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly,\r\nSuch the wild terror, and the mingled cry:\r\nWithin, without the trench, and all the way,\r\nStrow\xe2\x80\x99d in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;\r\nSuch horror Jove impress\xe2\x80\x99d! yet still proceeds\r\nThe work of death, and still the battle bleeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VULCAN FROM AN ANTIQUE GEM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XVIII.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nTHE GRIEF OF ACHILLES, AND NEW ARMOUR MADE HIM BY VULCAN.\r\n\r\nThe news of the death of Patroclus is brought to Achilles by\r\nAntilochus. Thetis, hearing his lamentations, comes with all her sea-\r\nnymphs to comfort him. The speeches of the mother and son on this\r\noccasion. Iris appears to Achilles by the command of Juno, and orders\r\nhim to show himself at the head of the intrenchments. The sight of him\r\nturns the fortunes of the day, and the body of Patroclus is carried off\r\nby the Greeks. The Trojans call a council, where Hector and Polydamas\r\ndisagree in their opinions: but the advice of the former prevails, to\r\nremain encamped in the field. The grief of Achilles over the body of\r\nPatroclus.\r\n\r\nThetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son. The\r\ndescription of the wonderful works of Vulcan: and, lastly, that noble\r\none of the shield of Achilles.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day, and the night ensuing,\r\ntake up this book: the scene is at Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 tent on the sea-shore,\r\nfrom whence it changes to the palace of Vulcan.\r\n\r\nThus like the rage of fire the combat burns,250\r\nAnd now it rises, now it sinks by turns.\r\nMeanwhile, where Hellespont\xe2\x80\x99s broad waters flow,\r\nStood Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s son, the messenger of woe:\r\nThere sat Achilles, shaded by his sails,\r\nOn hoisted yards extended to the gales;\r\nPensive he sat; for all that fate design\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nRose in sad prospect to his boding mind.\r\nThus to his soul he said: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! what constrains\r\nThe Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains?\r\nIs this the day, which heaven so long ago\r\nOrdain\xe2\x80\x99d, to sink me with the weight of woe?\r\n(So Thetis warn\xe2\x80\x99d;) when by a Trojan hand\r\nThe bravest of the Myrmidonian band\r\nShould lose the light! Fulfilled is that decree;\r\nFallen is the warrior, and Patroclus he!\r\nIn vain I charged him soon to quit the plain,\r\nAnd warn\xe2\x80\x99d to shun Hectorean force in vain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus while he thinks, Antilochus appears,\r\nAnd tells the melancholy tale with tears.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSad tidings, son of Peleus! thou must hear;\r\nAnd wretched I, the unwilling messenger!\r\nDead is Patroclus! For his corse they fight;\r\nHis naked corse: his arms are Hector\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sudden horror shot through all the chief,\r\nAnd wrapp\xe2\x80\x99d his senses in the cloud of grief;\r\nCast on the ground, with furious hands he spread\r\nThe scorching ashes o\xe2\x80\x99er his graceful head;\r\nHis purple garments, and his golden hairs,\r\nThose he deforms with dust, and these he tears;\r\nOn the hard soil his groaning breast he threw,\r\nAnd roll\xe2\x80\x99d and grovell\xe2\x80\x99d, as to earth he grew.\r\nThe virgin captives, with disorder\xe2\x80\x99d charms,\r\n(Won by his own, or by Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 arms,)\r\nRush\xe2\x80\x99d from their tents with cries; and gathering round,\r\nBeat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground:\r\nWhile Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s son sustains a manlier part,\r\nAnd mourns the warrior with a warrior\xe2\x80\x99s heart;\r\nHangs on his arms, amidst his frantic woe,\r\nAnd oft prevents the meditated blow.\r\n\r\nFar in the deep abysses of the main,251\r\nWith hoary Nereus, and the watery train,\r\nThe mother-goddess from her crystal throne\r\nHeard his loud cries, and answer\xe2\x80\x99d groan for groan.\r\nThe circling Nereids with their mistress weep,\r\nAnd all the sea-green sisters of the deep.\r\nThalia, Glauce (every watery name),\r\nNesaea mild, and silver Spio came:\r\nCymothoe and Cymodoce were nigh,\r\nAnd the blue languish of soft Alia\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\nTheir locks Actaea and Limnoria rear,\r\nThen Proto, Doris, Panope appear,\r\nThoa, Pherusa, Doto, Melita;\r\nAgave gentle, and Amphithoe gay:\r\nNext Callianira, Callianassa show\r\nTheir sister looks; Dexamene the slow,\r\nAnd swift Dynamene, now cut the tides:\r\nIaera now the verdant wave divides:\r\nNemertes with Apseudes lifts the head,\r\nBright Galatea quits her pearly bed;\r\nThese Orythia, Clymene, attend,\r\nMaera, Amphinome, the train extend;\r\nAnd black Janira, and Janassa fair,\r\nAnd Amatheia with her amber hair.\r\nAll these, and all that deep in ocean held\r\nTheir sacred seats, the glimmering grotto fill\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nEach beat her ivory breast with silent woe,\r\nTill Thetis\xe2\x80\x99 sorrows thus began to flow:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me, and judge, ye sisters of the main!\r\nHow just a cause has Thetis to complain!\r\nHow wretched, were I mortal, were my fate!\r\nHow more than wretched in the immortal state!\r\nSprung from my bed a godlike hero came,\r\nThe bravest far that ever bore the name;\r\nLike some fair olive, by my careful hand\r\nHe grew, he flourish\xe2\x80\x99d and adorn\xe2\x80\x99d the land!\r\nTo Troy I sent him: but the fates ordain\r\nHe never, never must return again.\r\nSo short a space the light of heaven to view,\r\nSo short, alas! and fill\xe2\x80\x99d with anguish too!\r\nHear how his sorrows echo through the shore!\r\nI cannot ease them, but I must deplore;\r\nI go at least to bear a tender part,\r\nAnd mourn my loved-one with a mother\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said, and left the caverns of the main,\r\nAll bathed in tears; the melancholy train\r\nAttend her way. Wide-opening part the tides,\r\nWhile the long pomp the silver wave divides.\r\nApproaching now, they touch\xe2\x80\x99d the Trojan land;\r\nThen, two by two, ascended up the strand.\r\nThe immortal mother, standing close beside\r\nHer mournful offspring, to his sighs replied;\r\nAlong the coast their mingled clamours ran,\r\nAnd thus the silver-footed dame began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy mourns my son? thy late preferr\xe2\x80\x99d request\r\nThe god has granted, and the Greeks distress\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nWhy mourns my son? thy anguish let me share,\r\nReveal the cause, and trust a parent\xe2\x80\x99s care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe, deeply groaning\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTo this cureless grief,\r\nNot even the Thunderer\xe2\x80\x99s favour brings relief.\r\nPatroclus\xe2\x80\x94Ah!\xe2\x80\x94say, goddess, can I boast\r\nA pleasure now? revenge itself is lost;\r\nPatroclus, loved of all my martial train,\r\nBeyond mankind, beyond myself is slain!\r\nLost are those arms the gods themselves bestow\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nOn Peleus; Hector bears the glorious load.\r\nCursed be that day, when all the powers above\r\nThy charms submitted to a mortal love:\r\nO hadst thou still, a sister of the main,\r\nPursued the pleasures of the watery reign:\r\nAnd happier Peleus, less ambitious, led\r\nA mortal beauty to his equal bed!\r\nEre the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb\r\nHad caused such sorrows past, and woes to come.\r\nFor soon, alas! that wretched offspring slain,\r\nNew woes, new sorrows, shall create again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis not in fate the alternate now to give;\r\nPatroclus dead, Achilles hates to live.\r\nLet me revenge it on proud Hector\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\nLet his last spirit smoke upon my dart;\r\nOn these conditions will I breathe: till then,\r\nI blush to walk among the race of men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA flood of tears, at this, the goddess shed:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then, I see thee dying, see thee dead!\r\nWhen Hector falls, thou diest.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLet Hector die,\r\nAnd let me fall!

by Pallas and by Mars made bold:\r\nGold were the gods, their radiant garments gold,\r\nAnd gold their armour: these the squadron led,\r\nAugust, divine, superior by the head!\r\nA place for ambush fit they found, and stood,\r\nCover\xe2\x80\x99d with shields, beside a silver flood.\r\nTwo spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem\r\nIf sheep or oxen seek the winding stream.\r\nSoon the white flocks proceeded o\xe2\x80\x99er the plains,\r\nAnd steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains;\r\nBehind them piping on their reeds they go,\r\nNor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe.\r\nIn arms the glittering squadron rising round\r\nRush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground;\r\nWhole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains,\r\nAnd, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains!\r\nThe bellowing oxen the besiegers hear;\r\nThey rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war,\r\nThey fight, they fall, beside the silver flood;\r\nThe waving silver seem\xe2\x80\x99d to blush with blood.\r\nThere Tumult, there Contention stood confess\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nOne rear\xe2\x80\x99d a dagger at a captive\xe2\x80\x99s breast;\r\nOne held a living foe, that freshly bled\r\nWith new-made wounds; another dragg\xe2\x80\x99d a dead;\r\nNow here, now there, the carcases they tore:\r\nFate stalk\xe2\x80\x99d amidst them, grim with human gore.\r\nAnd the whole war came out, and met the eye;\r\nAnd each bold figure seem\xe2\x80\x99d to live or die.\r\n\r\nA field deep furrow\xe2\x80\x99d next the god design\xe2\x80\x99d,256\r\nThe third time labour\xe2\x80\x99d by the sweating hind;\r\nThe shining shares full many ploughmen guide,\r\nAnd turn their crooked yokes on every side.\r\nStill as at either end they wheel around,\r\nThe master meets them with his goblet crown\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThe hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,\r\nThen back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:\r\nBehind, the rising earth in ridges roll\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nAnd sable look\xe2\x80\x99d, though form\xe2\x80\x99d of molten gold.\r\n\r\nAnother field rose high with waving grain;\r\nWith bended sickles stand the reaper train:\r\nHere stretched in ranks the levell\xe2\x80\x99d swarths are found,\r\nSheaves heap\xe2\x80\x99d on sheaves here thicken up the ground.\r\nWith sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;\r\nThe gatherers follow, and collect in bands;\r\nAnd last the children, in whose arms are borne\r\n(Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.\r\nThe rustic monarch of the field descries,\r\nWith silent glee, the heaps around him rise.\r\nA ready banquet on the turf is laid,\r\nBeneath an ample oak\xe2\x80\x99s expanded shade.\r\nThe victim ox the sturdy youth prepare;\r\nThe reaper\xe2\x80\x99s due repast, the woman\xe2\x80\x99s care.\r\n\r\nNext, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines,\r\nBent with the ponderous harvest of its vines;\r\nA deeper dye the dangling clusters show,\r\nAnd curl\xe2\x80\x99d on silver props, in order glow:\r\nA darker metal mix\xe2\x80\x99d intrench\xe2\x80\x99d the place;\r\nAnd pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.\r\nTo this, one pathway gently winding leads,\r\nWhere march a train with baskets on their heads,\r\n(Fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear\r\nThe purple product of the autumnal year.\r\nTo these a youth awakes the warbling strings,\r\nWhose tender lay the fate of Linus sings;\r\nIn measured dance behind him move the train,\r\nTune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.\r\n\r\nHere herds of oxen march, erect and bold,\r\nRear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,\r\nAnd speed to meadows on whose sounding shores\r\nA rapid torrent through the rushes roars:\r\nFour golden herdsmen as their guardians stand,\r\nAnd nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.\r\nTwo lions rushing from the wood appear\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nAnd seized a bull, the master of the herd:\r\nHe roar\xe2\x80\x99d: in vain the dogs, the men withstood;\r\nThey tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood.\r\nThe dogs (oft cheer\xe2\x80\x99d in vain) desert the prey,\r\nDread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.\r\n\r\nNext this, the eye the art of Vulcan leads\r\nDeep through fair forests, and a length of meads,\r\nAnd stalls, and folds, and scatter\xe2\x80\x99d cots between;\r\nAnd fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.\r\n\r\nA figured dance succeeds; such once was seen\r\nIn lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen,\r\nForm\xe2\x80\x99d by Daedalean art; a comely band\r\nOf youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.\r\nThe maids in soft simars of linen dress\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThe youths all graceful in the glossy vest:\r\nOf those the locks with flowery wreath inroll\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nOf these the sides adorn\xe2\x80\x99d with swords of gold,\r\nThat glittering gay, from silver belts depend.\r\nNow all at once they rise, at once descend,\r\nWith well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,\r\nConfusedly regular, the moving maze:\r\nNow forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,\r\nAnd undistinguish\xe2\x80\x99d blend the flying ring:\r\nSo whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.\r\nThe gazing multitudes admire around:\r\nTwo active tumblers in the centre bound;\r\nNow high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend:\r\nAnd general songs the sprightly revel end.\r\n\r\nThus the broad shield complete the artist crown\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nWith his last hand, and pour\xe2\x80\x99d the ocean round:\r\nIn living silver seem\xe2\x80\x99d the waves to roll,\r\nAnd beat the buckler\xe2\x80\x99s verge, and bound the whole.\r\n\r\nThis done, whate\xe2\x80\x99er a warrior\xe2\x80\x99s use requires\r\nHe forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires,\r\nThe greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nWith various sculpture, and the golden crest.\r\nAt Thetis\xe2\x80\x99 feet the finished labour lay:\r\nShe, as a falcon cuts the aerial way,\r\nSwift from Olympus\xe2\x80\x99 snowy summit flies,\r\nAnd bears the blazing present through the skies.257\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XIX.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.\r\n\r\nThetis brings to her son the armour made by Vulcan. She preserves the\r\nbody of his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the\r\narmy, to declare his resentment at an end. Agamemnon and Achilles are\r\nsolemnly reconciled: the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that\r\noccasion. Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from\r\nthe battle till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of\r\nUlysses. The presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles, where\r\nBriseis laments over the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately\r\nrefuses all repast, and gives himself up to lamentations for his\r\nfriend. Minerva descends to strengthen him, by the order of Jupiter. He\r\narms for the fight: his appearance described. He addresses himself to\r\nhis horses, and reproaches them with the death of Patroclus. One of\r\nthem is miraculously endued with voice, and inspired to prophesy his\r\nfate: but the hero, not astonished by that prodigy, rushes with fury to\r\nthe combat.\r\n\r\nThe thirtieth day. The scene is on the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nSoon as Aurora heaved her Orient head\r\nAbove the waves, that blush\xe2\x80\x99d with early red,\r\n(With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,\r\nAnd gild the courts of heaven with sacred light,)\r\nThe immortal arms the goddess-mother bears\r\nSwift to her son: her son she finds in tears\r\nStretch\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 corse; while all the rest\r\nTheir sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s sorrows in their own express\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nA ray divine her heavenly presence shed,\r\nAnd thus, his hand soft touching, Thetis said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know\r\nIt was not man, but heaven, that gave the blow;\r\nBehold what arms by Vulcan are bestow\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nArms worthy thee, or fit to grace a god.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen drops the radiant burden on the ground;\r\nClang the strong arms, and ring the shores around;\r\nBack shrink the Myrmidons with dread surprise,\r\nAnd from the broad effulgence turn their eyes.\r\nUnmoved the hero kindles at the show,\r\nAnd feels with rage divine his bosom glow;\r\nFrom his fierce eyeballs living flames expire,\r\nAnd flash incessant like a stream of fire:\r\nHe turns the radiant gift: and feeds his mind\r\nOn all the immortal artist had design\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoddess! (he cried,) these glorious arms, that shine\r\nWith matchless art, confess the hand divine.\r\nNow to the bloody battle let me bend:\r\nBut ah! the relics of my slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d friend!\r\nIn those wide wounds through which his spirit fled,\r\nShall flies, and worms obscene, pollute the dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat unavailing care be laid aside,\r\n(The azure goddess to her son replied,)\r\nWhole years untouch\xe2\x80\x99d, uninjured shall remain,\r\nFresh as in life, the carcase of the slain.\r\nBut go, Achilles, as affairs require,\r\nBefore the Grecian peers renounce thine ire:\r\nThen uncontroll\xe2\x80\x99d in boundless war engage,\r\nAnd heaven with strength supply the mighty rage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THETIS BRINGING THE ARMOUR TO ACHILLES.]\r\n\r\nThen in the nostrils of the slain she pour\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nNectareous drops, and rich ambrosia shower\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er all the corse. The flies forbid their prey,\r\nUntouch\xe2\x80\x99d it rests, and sacred from decay.\r\nAchilles to the strand obedient went:\r\nThe shores resounded with the voice he sent.\r\nThe heroes heard, and all the naval train\r\nThat tend the ships, or guide them o\xe2\x80\x99er the main,\r\nAlarm\xe2\x80\x99d, transported, at the well-known sound,\r\nFrequent and full, the great assembly crown\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nStudious to see the terror of the plain,\r\nLong lost to battle, shine in arms again.\r\nTydides and Ulysses first appear,\r\nLame with their wounds, and leaning on the spear;\r\nThese on the sacred seats of council placed,\r\nThe king of men, Atrides, came the last:\r\nHe too sore wounded by Agenor\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\nAchilles (rising in the midst) begun:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO monarch! better far had been the fate\r\nOf thee, of me, of all the Grecian state,\r\nIf (ere the day when by mad passion sway\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nRash we contended for the black-eyed maid)\r\nPreventing Dian had despatch\xe2\x80\x99d her dart,\r\nAnd shot the shining mischief to the heart!\r\nThen many a hero had not press\xe2\x80\x99d the shore,\r\nNor Troy\xe2\x80\x99s glad fields been fatten\xe2\x80\x99d with our gore.\r\nLong, long shall Greece the woes we caused bewail,\r\nAnd sad posterity repeat the tale.\r\nBut this, no more the subject of debate,\r\nIs past, forgotten, and resign\xe2\x80\x99d to fate.\r\nWhy should, alas, a mortal man, as I,\r\nBurn with a fury that can never die?\r\nHere then my anger ends: let war succeed,\r\nAnd even as Greece has bled, let Ilion bleed.\r\nNow call the hosts, and try if in our sight\r\nTroy yet shall dare to camp a second night!\r\nI deem, their mightiest, when this arm he knows,\r\nShall \xe2\x80\x99scape with transport, and with joy repose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: his finish\xe2\x80\x99d wrath with loud acclaim\r\nThe Greeks accept, and shout Pelides\xe2\x80\x99 name.\r\nWhen thus, not rising from his lofty throne,\r\nIn state unmoved, the king of men begun:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me, ye sons of Greece! with silence hear!\r\nAnd grant your monarch an impartial ear:\r\nAwhile your loud, untimely joy suspend,\r\nAnd let your rash, injurious clamours end:\r\nUnruly murmurs, or ill-timed applause,\r\nWrong the best speaker, and the justest cause.\r\nNor charge on me, ye Greeks, the dire debate:\r\nKnow, angry Jove, and all-compelling Fate,\r\nWith fell Erinnys, urged my wrath that day\r\nWhen from Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 arms I forced the prey.\r\nWhat then could I against the will of heaven?\r\nNot by myself, but vengeful Ate driven;\r\nShe, Jove\xe2\x80\x99s dread daughter, fated to infest\r\nThe race of mortals, enter\xe2\x80\x99d in my breast.\r\nNot on the ground that haughty fury treads,\r\nBut prints her lofty footsteps on the heads\r\nOf mighty men; inflicting as she goes\r\nLong-festering wounds, inextricable woes!\r\nOf old, she stalk\xe2\x80\x99d amid the bright abodes;\r\nAnd Jove himself, the sire of men and gods,\r\nThe world\xe2\x80\x99s great ruler, felt her venom\xe2\x80\x99d dart;\r\nDeceived by Juno\xe2\x80\x99s wiles, and female art:\r\nFor when Alcmena\xe2\x80\x99s nine long months were run,\r\nAnd Jove expected his immortal son,\r\nTo gods and goddesses the unruly joy\r\nHe show\xe2\x80\x99d, and vaunted of his matchless boy:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From us, (he said) this day an infant springs,\r\nFated to rule, and born a king of kings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSaturnia ask\xe2\x80\x99d an oath, to vouch the truth,\r\nAnd fix dominion on the favour\xe2\x80\x99d youth.\r\nThe Thunderer, unsuspicious of the fraud,\r\nPronounced those solemn words that bind a god.\r\nThe joyful goddess, from Olympus\xe2\x80\x99 height,\r\nSwift to Achaian Argos bent her flight:\r\nScarce seven moons gone, lay Sthenelus\xe2\x80\x99s wife;\r\nShe push\xe2\x80\x99d her lingering infant into life:\r\nHer charms Alcmena\xe2\x80\x99s coming labours stay,\r\nAnd stop the babe, just issuing to the day.\r\nThen bids Saturnius bear his oath in mind;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A youth (said she) of Jove\xe2\x80\x99s immortal kind\r\nIs this day born: from Sthenelus he springs,\r\nAnd claims thy promise to be king of kings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nGrief seized the Thunderer, by his oath engaged;\r\nStung to the soul, he sorrow\xe2\x80\x99d, and he raged.\r\nFrom his ambrosial head, where perch\xe2\x80\x99d she sate,\r\nHe snatch\xe2\x80\x99d the fury-goddess of debate,\r\nThe dread, the irrevocable oath he swore,\r\nThe immortal seats should ne\xe2\x80\x99er behold her more;\r\nAnd whirl\xe2\x80\x99d her headlong down, for ever driven\r\nFrom bright Olympus and the starry heaven:\r\nThence on the nether world the fury fell;\r\nOrdain\xe2\x80\x99d with man\xe2\x80\x99s contentious race to dwell.\r\nFull oft the god his son\xe2\x80\x99s hard toils bemoan\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nCursed the dire fury, and in secret groan\xe2\x80\x99d.258\r\nEven thus, like Jove himself, was I misled,\r\nWhile raging Hector heap\xe2\x80\x99d our camps with dead.\r\nWhat can the errors of my rage atone?\r\nMy martial troops, my treasures are thy own:\r\nThis instant from the navy shall be sent\r\nWhate\xe2\x80\x99er Ulysses promised at thy tent:\r\nBut thou! appeased, propitious to our prayer,\r\nResume thy arms, and shine again in war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO king of nations! whose superior sway\r\n(Returns Achilles) all our hosts obey!\r\nTo keep or send the presents, be thy care;\r\nTo us, \xe2\x80\x99tis equal: all we ask is war.\r\nWhile yet we talk, or but an instant shun\r\nThe fight, our glorious work remains undone.\r\nLet every Greek, who sees my spear confound\r\nThe Trojan ranks, and deal destruction round,\r\nWith emulation, what I act survey,\r\nAnd learn from thence the business of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe son of Peleus thus; and thus replies\r\nThe great in councils, Ithacus the wise:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough, godlike, thou art by no toils oppress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAt least our armies claim repast and rest:\r\nLong and laborious must the combat be,\r\nWhen by the gods inspired, and led by thee.\r\nStrength is derived from spirits and from blood,\r\nAnd those augment by generous wine and food:\r\nWhat boastful son of war, without that stay,\r\nCan last a hero through a single day?\r\nCourage may prompt; but, ebbing out his strength,\r\nMere unsupported man must yield at length;\r\nShrunk with dry famine, and with toils declined,\r\nThe drooping body will desert the mind:\r\nBut built anew with strength-conferring fare,\r\nWith limbs and soul untamed, he tires a war.\r\nDismiss the people, then, and give command,\r\nWith strong repast to hearten every band;\r\nBut let the presents to Achilles made,\r\nIn full assembly of all Greece be laid.\r\nThe king of men shall rise in public sight,\r\nAnd solemn swear (observant of the rite)\r\nThat, spotless, as she came, the maid removes,\r\nPure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.\r\nThat done, a sumptuous banquet shall be made,\r\nAnd the full price of injured honour paid.\r\nStretch not henceforth, O prince! thy sovereign might\r\nBeyond the bounds of reason and of right;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis the chief praise that e\xe2\x80\x99er to kings belong\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nTo right with justice whom with power they wrong\xe2\x80\x99d.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo him the monarch: \xe2\x80\x9cJust is thy decree,\r\nThy words give joy, and wisdom breathes in thee.\r\nEach due atonement gladly I prepare;\r\nAnd heaven regard me as I justly swear!\r\nHere then awhile let Greece assembled stay,\r\nNor great Achilles grudge this short delay.\r\nTill from the fleet our presents be convey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd Jove attesting, the firm compact made.\r\nA train of noble youths the charge shall bear;\r\nThese to select, Ulysses, be thy care:\r\nIn order rank\xe2\x80\x99d let all our gifts appear,\r\nAnd the fair train of captives close the rear:\r\nTalthybius shall the victim boar convey,\r\nSacred to Jove, and yon bright orb of day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor this (the stern \xc3\x86acides replies)\r\nSome less important season may suffice,\r\nWhen the stern fury of the war is o\xe2\x80\x99er,\r\nAnd wrath, extinguish\xe2\x80\x99d, burns my breast no more.\r\nBy Hector slain, their faces to the sky,\r\nAll grim with gaping wounds, our heroes lie:\r\nThose call to war! and might my voice incite,\r\nNow, now, this instant, shall commence the fight:\r\nThen, when the day\xe2\x80\x99s complete, let generous bowls,\r\nAnd copious banquets, glad your weary souls.\r\nLet not my palate know the taste of food,\r\nTill my insatiate rage be cloy\xe2\x80\x99d with blood:\r\nPale lies my friend, with wounds disfigured o\xe2\x80\x99er,\r\nAnd his cold feet are pointed to the door.\r\nRevenge is all my soul! no meaner care,\r\nInterest, or thought, has room to harbour there;\r\nDestruction be my feast, and mortal wounds,\r\nAnd scenes of blood, and agonizing sounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO first of Greeks, (Ulysses thus rejoin\xe2\x80\x99d,)\r\nThe best and bravest of the warrior kind!\r\nThy praise it is in dreadful camps to shine,\r\nBut old experience and calm wisdom mine.\r\nThen hear my counsel, and to reason yield,\r\nThe bravest soon are satiate of the field;\r\nThough vast the heaps that strow the crimson plain,\r\nThe bloody harvest brings but little gain:\r\nThe scale of conquest ever wavering lies,\r\nGreat Jove but turns it, and the victor dies!\r\nThe great, the bold, by thousands daily fall,\r\nAnd endless were the grief, to weep for all.\r\nEternal sorrows what avails to shed?\r\nGreece honours not with solemn fasts the dead:\r\nEnough, when death demands the brave, to pay\r\nThe tribute of a melancholy day.\r\nOne chief with patience to the grave resign\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nOur care devolves on others left behind.\r\nLet generous food supplies of strength produce,\r\nLet rising spirits flow from sprightly juice,\r\nLet their warm heads with scenes of battle glow,\r\nAnd pour new furies on the feebler foe.\r\nYet a short interval, and none shall dare\r\nExpect a second summons to the war;\r\nWho waits for that, the dire effects shall find,\r\nIf trembling in the ships he lags behind.\r\nEmbodied, to the battle let us bend,\r\nAnd all at once on haughty Troy descend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now the delegates Ulysses sent,\r\nTo bear the presents from the royal tent:\r\nThe sons of Nestor, Phyleus\xe2\x80\x99 valiant heir,\r\nThias and Merion, thunderbolts of war,\r\nWith Lycomedes of Creiontian strain,\r\nAnd Melanippus, form\xe2\x80\x99d the chosen train.\r\nSwift as the word was given, the youths obey\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nTwice ten bright vases in the midst they laid;\r\nA row of six fair tripods then succeeds;\r\nAnd twice the number of high-bounding steeds:\r\nSeven captives next a lovely line compose;\r\nThe eighth Briseis, like the blooming rose,\r\nClosed the bright band: great Ithacus, before,\r\nFirst of the train, the golden talents bore:\r\nThe rest in public view the chiefs dispose,\r\nA splendid scene! then Agamemnon rose:\r\nThe boar Talthybius held: the Grecian lord\r\nDrew the broad cutlass sheath\xe2\x80\x99d beside his sword:\r\nThe stubborn bristles from the victim\xe2\x80\x99s brow\r\nHe crops, and offering meditates his vow.\r\nHis hands uplifted to the attesting skies,\r\nOn heaven\xe2\x80\x99s broad marble roof were fixed his eyes.\r\nThe solemn words a deep attention draw,\r\nAnd Greece around sat thrill\xe2\x80\x99d with sacred awe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWitness thou first! thou greatest power above,\r\nAll-good, all-wise, and all-surveying Jove!\r\nAnd mother-earth, and heaven\xe2\x80\x99s revolving light,\r\nAnd ye, fell furies of the realms of night,\r\nWho rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare\r\nFor perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!\r\nThe black-eyed maid inviolate removes,\r\nPure and unconscious of my manly loves.\r\nIf this be false, heaven all its vengeance shed,\r\nAnd levell\xe2\x80\x99d thunder strike my guilty head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, his weapon deep inflicts the wound;\r\nThe bleeding savage tumbles to the ground;\r\nThe sacred herald rolls the victim slain\r\n(A feast for fish) into the foaming main.\r\n\r\nThen thus Achilles: \xe2\x80\x9cHear, ye Greeks! and know\r\nWhate\xe2\x80\x99er we feel, \xe2\x80\x99tis Jove inflicts the woe;\r\nNot else Atrides could our rage inflame,\r\nNor from my arms, unwilling, force the dame.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas Jove\xe2\x80\x99s high will alone, o\xe2\x80\x99erruling all,\r\nThat doom\xe2\x80\x99d our strife, and doom\xe2\x80\x99d the Greeks to fall.\r\nGo then, ye chiefs! indulge the genial rite;\r\nAchilles waits ye, and expects the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speedy council at his word adjourn\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nTo their black vessels all the Greeks return\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nAchilles sought his tent. His train before\r\nMarch\xe2\x80\x99d onward, bending with the gifts they bore.\r\nThose in the tents the squires industrious spread:\r\nThe foaming coursers to the stalls they led;\r\nTo their new seats the female captives move.\r\nBriseis, radiant as the queen of love,\r\nSlow as she pass\xe2\x80\x99d, beheld with sad survey\r\nWhere, gash\xe2\x80\x99d with cruel wounds, Patroclus lay.\r\nProne on the body fell the heavenly fair,\r\nBeat her sad breast, and tore her golden hair;\r\nAll beautiful in grief, her humid eyes\r\nShining with tears she lifts, and thus she cries:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, youth for ever dear, for ever kind,\r\nOnce tender friend of my distracted mind!\r\nI left thee fresh in life, in beauty gay;\r\nNow find thee cold, inanimated clay!\r\nWhat woes my wretched race of life attend!\r\nSorrows on sorrows, never doom\xe2\x80\x99d to end!\r\nThe first loved consort of my virgin bed\r\nBefore these eyes in fatal battle bled:\r\nMy three brave brothers in one mournful day\r\nAll trod the dark, irremeable way:\r\nThy friendly hand uprear\xe2\x80\x99d me from the plain,\r\nAnd dried my sorrows for a husband slain;\r\nAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 care you promised I should prove,\r\nThe first, the dearest partner of his love;\r\nThat rites divine should ratify the band,\r\nAnd make me empress in his native land.\r\nAccept these grateful tears! for thee they flow,\r\nFor thee, that ever felt another\xe2\x80\x99s woe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer sister captives echoed groan for groan,\r\nNor mourn\xe2\x80\x99d Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 fortunes, but their own.\r\nThe leaders press\xe2\x80\x99d the chief on every side;\r\nUnmoved he heard them, and with sighs denied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf yet Achilles have a friend, whose care\r\nIs bent to please him, this request forbear;\r\nTill yonder sun descend, ah, let me pay\r\nTo grief and anguish one abstemious day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke, and from the warriors turn\xe2\x80\x99d his face:\r\nYet still the brother-kings of Atreus\xe2\x80\x99 race.\r\nNestor, Idomeneus, Ulysses sage,\r\nAnd Phoenix, strive to calm his grief and rage:\r\nHis rage they calm not, nor his grief control;\r\nHe groans, he raves, he sorrows from his soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou too, Patroclus! (thus his heart he vents)\r\nOnce spread the inviting banquet in our tents:\r\nThy sweet society, thy winning care,\r\nOnce stay\xe2\x80\x99d Achilles, rushing to the war.\r\nBut now, alas! to death\xe2\x80\x99s cold arms resign\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhat banquet but revenge can glad my mind?\r\nWhat greater sorrow could afflict my breast,\r\nWhat more if hoary Peleus were deceased?\r\nWho now, perhaps, in Phthia dreads to hear\r\nHis son\xe2\x80\x99s sad fate, and drops a tender tear.\r\nWhat more, should Neoptolemus the brave,\r\nMy only offspring, sink into the grave?\r\nIf yet that offspring lives; (I distant far,\r\nOf all neglectful, wage a hateful war.)\r\nI could not this, this cruel stroke attend;\r\nFate claim\xe2\x80\x99d Achilles, but might spare his friend.\r\nI hoped Patroclus might survive, to rear\r\nMy tender orphan with a parent\xe2\x80\x99s care,\r\nFrom Scyros\xe2\x80\x99 isle conduct him o\xe2\x80\x99er the main,\r\nAnd glad his eyes with his paternal reign,\r\nThe lofty palace, and the large domain.\r\nFor Peleus breathes no more the vital air;\r\nOr drags a wretched life of age and care,\r\nBut till the news of my sad fate invades\r\nHis hastening soul, and sinks him to the shades.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSighing he said: his grief the heroes join\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nEach stole a tear for what he left behind.\r\nTheir mingled grief the sire of heaven survey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd thus with pity to his blue-eyed maid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs then Achilles now no more thy care,\r\nAnd dost thou thus desert the great in war?\r\nLo, where yon sails their canvas wings extend,\r\nAll comfortless he sits, and wails his friend:\r\nEre thirst and want his forces have oppress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nHaste and infuse ambrosia in his breast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke; and sudden, at the word of Jove,\r\nShot the descending goddess from above.\r\nSo swift through ether the shrill harpy springs,\r\nThe wide air floating to her ample wings,\r\nTo great Achilles she her flight address\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd pour\xe2\x80\x99d divine ambrosia in his breast,259\r\nWith nectar sweet, (refection of the gods!)\r\nThen, swift ascending, sought the bright abodes.\r\n\r\nNow issued from the ships the warrior-train,\r\nAnd like a deluge pour\xe2\x80\x99d upon the plain.\r\nAs when the piercing blasts of Boreas blow,\r\nAnd scatter o\xe2\x80\x99er the fields the driving snow;\r\nFrom dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies,\r\nWhose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies:\r\nSo helms succeeding helms, so shields from shields,\r\nCatch the quick beams, and brighten all the fields;\r\nBroad glittering breastplates, spears with pointed rays,\r\nMix in one stream, reflecting blaze on blaze;\r\nThick beats the centre as the coursers bound;\r\nWith splendour flame the skies, and laugh the fields around,\r\n\r\nFull in the midst, high-towering o\xe2\x80\x99er the rest,\r\nHis limbs in arms divine Achilles dress\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nArms which the father of the fire bestow\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nForged on the eternal anvils of the god.\r\nGrief and revenge his furious heart inspire,\r\nHis glowing eyeballs roll with living fire;\r\nHe grinds his teeth, and furious with delay\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.\r\n\r\nThe silver cuishes first his thighs infold;\r\nThen o\xe2\x80\x99er his breast was braced the hollow gold;\r\nThe brazen sword a various baldric tied,\r\nThat, starr\xe2\x80\x99d with gems, hung glittering at his side;\r\nAnd, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield\r\nBlazed with long rays, and gleam\xe2\x80\x99d athwart the field.\r\n\r\nSo to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears,\r\nWide o\xe2\x80\x99er the watery waste, a light appears,\r\nWhich on the far-seen mountain blazing high,\r\nStreams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky:\r\nWith mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again;\r\nLoud howls the storm, and drives them o\xe2\x80\x99er the main.\r\n\r\nNext, his high head the helmet graced; behind\r\nThe sweepy crest hung floating in the wind:\r\nLike the red star, that from his flaming hair\r\nShakes down diseases, pestilence, and war;\r\nSo stream\xe2\x80\x99d the golden honours from his head,\r\nTrembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed.\r\nThe chief beholds himself with wondering eyes;\r\nHis arms he poises, and his motions tries;\r\nBuoy\xe2\x80\x99d by some inward force, he seems to swim,\r\nAnd feels a pinion lifting every limb.\r\n\r\nAnd now he shakes his great paternal spear,\r\nPonderous and huge, which not a Greek could rear,\r\nFrom Pelion\xe2\x80\x99s cloudy top an ash entire\r\nOld Chiron fell\xe2\x80\x99d, and shaped it for his sire;\r\nA spear which stern Achilles only wields,\r\nThe death of heroes, and the dread of fields.\r\n\r\nAutomedon and Alcimus prepare\r\nThe immortal coursers, and the radiant car;\r\n(The silver traces sweeping at their side;)\r\nTheir fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied;\r\nThe ivory-studded reins, return\xe2\x80\x99d behind,\r\nWaved o\xe2\x80\x99er their backs, and to the chariot join\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nThe charioteer then whirl\xe2\x80\x99d the lash around,\r\nAnd swift ascended at one active bound.\r\nAll bright in heavenly arms, above his squire\r\nAchilles mounts, and sets the field on fire;\r\nNot brighter Phoebus in the ethereal way\r\nFlames from his chariot, and restores the day.\r\nHigh o\xe2\x80\x99er the host, all terrible he stands,\r\nAnd thunders to his steeds these dread commands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cXanthus and Balius! of Podarges\xe2\x80\x99 strain,\r\n(Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,)\r\nBe swift, be mindful of the load ye bear,\r\nAnd learn to make your master more your care:\r\nThrough falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword,\r\nNor, as ye left Patroclus, leave your lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe generous Xanthus, as the words he said,\r\nSeem\xe2\x80\x99d sensible of woe, and droop\xe2\x80\x99d his head:\r\nTrembling he stood before the golden wain,\r\nAnd bow\xe2\x80\x99d to dust the honours of his mane.\r\nWhen, strange to tell! (so Juno will\xe2\x80\x99d) he broke\r\nEternal silence, and portentous spoke.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAchilles! yes! this day at least we bear\r\nThy rage in safety through the files of war:\r\nBut come it will, the fatal time must come,\r\nNot ours the fault, but God decrees thy doom.\r\nNot through our crime, or slowness in the course,\r\nFell thy Patroclus, but by heavenly force;\r\nThe bright far-shooting god who gilds the day\r\n(Confess\xe2\x80\x99d we saw him) tore his arms away.\r\nNo\xe2\x80\x94could our swiftness o\xe2\x80\x99er the winds prevail,\r\nOr beat the pinions of the western gale,\r\nAll were in vain\xe2\x80\x94the Fates thy death demand,\r\nDue to a mortal and immortal hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen ceased for ever, by the Furies tied,\r\nHis fateful voice. The intrepid chief replied\r\nWith unabated rage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSo let it be!\r\nPortents and prodigies are lost on me.\r\nI know my fate: to die, to see no more\r\nMy much-loved parents, and my native shore\xe2\x80\x94\r\nEnough\xe2\x80\x94when heaven ordains, I sink in night:\r\nNow perish Troy!\xe2\x80\x9d He said, and rush\xe2\x80\x99d to fight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERCULES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XX.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE GODS, AND THE ACTS OF ACHILLES.\r\n\r\nJupiter, upon Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 return to the battle, calls a council of the\r\ngods, and permits them to assist either party.

The scene is in the field before Troy.\r\n\r\nThus round Pelides breathing war and blood\r\nGreece, sheathed in arms, beside her vessels stood;\r\nWhile near impending from a neighbouring height,\r\nTroy\xe2\x80\x99s black battalions wait the shock of fight.\r\nThen Jove to Themis gives command, to call\r\nThe gods to council in the starry hall:\r\nSwift o\xe2\x80\x99er Olympus\xe2\x80\x99 hundred hills she flies,\r\nAnd summons all the senate of the skies.\r\nThese shining on, in long procession come\r\nTo Jove\xe2\x80\x99s eternal adamantine dome.\r\nNot one was absent, not a rural power\r\nThat haunts the verdant gloom, or rosy bower;\r\nEach fair-hair\xe2\x80\x99d dryad of the shady wood,\r\nEach azure sister of the silver flood;\r\nAll but old Ocean, hoary sire! who keeps\r\nHis ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps.\r\nOn marble thrones, with lucid columns crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\n(The work of Vulcan,) sat the powers around.\r\nEven he whose trident sways the watery reign\r\nHeard the loud summons, and forsook the main,\r\nAssumed his throne amid the bright abodes,\r\nAnd question\xe2\x80\x99d thus the sire of men and gods:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat moves the god who heaven and earth commands,\r\nAnd grasps the thunder in his awful hands,\r\nThus to convene the whole ethereal state?\r\nIs Greece and Troy the subject in debate?\r\nAlready met, the louring hosts appear,\r\nAnd death stands ardent on the edge of war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis true (the cloud-compelling power replies)\r\nThis day we call the council of the skies\r\nIn care of human race; even Jove\xe2\x80\x99s own eye\r\nSees with regret unhappy mortals die.\r\nFar on Olympus\xe2\x80\x99 top in secret state\r\nOurself will sit, and see the hand of fate\r\nWork out our will. Celestial powers! descend,\r\nAnd as your minds direct, your succour lend\r\nTo either host. Troy soon must lie o\xe2\x80\x99erthrown,\r\nIf uncontroll\xe2\x80\x99d Achilles fights alone:\r\nTheir troops but lately durst not meet his eyes;\r\nWhat can they now, if in his rage he rise?\r\nAssist them, gods! or Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s sacred wall\r\nMay fall this day, though fate forbids the fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe said, and fired their heavenly breasts with rage.\r\n\r\nOn adverse parts the warring gods engage:\r\nHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s awful queen; and he whose azure round\r\nGirds the vast globe; the maid in arms renown\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nHermes, of profitable arts the sire;\r\nAnd Vulcan, the black sovereign of the fire:\r\nThese to the fleet repair with instant flight;\r\nThe vessels tremble as the gods alight.\r\nIn aid of Troy, Latona, Phoebus came,\r\nMars fiery-helm\xe2\x80\x99d, the laughter-loving dame,\r\nXanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow,\r\nAnd the chaste huntress of the silver bow.\r\nEre yet the gods their various aid employ,\r\nEach Argive bosom swell\xe2\x80\x99d with manly joy,\r\nWhile great Achilles (terror of the plain),\r\nLong lost to battle, shone in arms again.\r\nDreadful he stood in front of all his host;\r\nPale Troy beheld, and seem\xe2\x80\x99d already lost;\r\nHer bravest heroes pant with inward fear,\r\nAnd trembling see another god of war.\r\n\r\nBut when the powers descending swell\xe2\x80\x99d the fight,\r\nThen tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affright\r\nVaried each face: then Discord sounds alarms,\r\nEarth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.\r\nNow through the trembling shores Minerva calls,\r\nAnd now she thunders from the Grecian walls.\r\nMars hovering o\xe2\x80\x99er his Troy, his terror shrouds\r\nIn gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds:\r\nNow through each Trojan heart he fury pours\r\nWith voice divine, from Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s topmost towers:\r\nNow shouts to Simois, from her beauteous hill;\r\nThe mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still.\r\n\r\nAbove, the sire of gods his thunder rolls,\r\nAnd peals on peals redoubled rend the poles.\r\nBeneath, stern Neptune shakes the solid ground;\r\nThe forests wave, the mountains nod around;\r\nThrough all their summits tremble Ida\xe2\x80\x99s woods,\r\nAnd from their sources boil her hundred floods.\r\nTroy\xe2\x80\x99s turrets totter on the rocking plain,\r\nAnd the toss\xe2\x80\x99d navies beat the heaving main.\r\nDeep in the dismal regions of the dead,260\r\nThe infernal monarch rear\xe2\x80\x99d his horrid head,\r\nLeap\xe2\x80\x99d from his throne, lest Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s arm should lay\r\nHis dark dominions open to the day,\r\nAnd pour in light on Pluto\xe2\x80\x99s drear abodes,\r\nAbhorr\xe2\x80\x99d by men, and dreadful even to gods.261\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GODS DESCENDING TO BATTLE.]\r\n\r\nSuch war the immortals wage; such horrors rend\r\nThe world\xe2\x80\x99s vast concave, when the gods contend.\r\nFirst silver-shafted Phoebus took the plain\r\nAgainst blue Neptune, monarch of the main.\r\nThe god of arms his giant bulk display\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nOpposed to Pallas, war\xe2\x80\x99s triumphant maid.\r\nAgainst Latona march\xe2\x80\x99d the son of May.\r\nThe quiver\xe2\x80\x99d Dian, sister of the day,\r\n(Her golden arrows sounding at her side,)\r\nSaturnia, majesty of heaven, defied.\r\nWith fiery Vulcan last in battle stands\r\nThe sacred flood that rolls on golden sands;\r\nXanthus his name with those of heavenly birth,\r\nBut called Scamander by the sons of earth.\r\n\r\nWhile thus the gods in various league engage,\r\nAchilles glow\xe2\x80\x99d with more than mortal rage:\r\nHector he sought; in search of Hector turn\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nHis eyes around, for Hector only burn\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nAnd burst like lightning through the ranks, and vow\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nTo glut the god of battles with his blood.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x86neas was the first who dared to stay;\r\nApollo wedged him in the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s way,\r\nBut swell\xe2\x80\x99d his bosom with undaunted might,\r\nHalf-forced and half-persuaded to the fight.\r\nLike young Lycaon, of the royal line,\r\nIn voice and aspect, seem\xe2\x80\x99d the power divine;\r\nAnd bade the chief reflect, how late with scorn\r\nIn distant threats he braved the goddess-born.\r\n\r\nThen thus the hero of Anchises\xe2\x80\x99 strain:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo meet Pelides you persuade in vain:\r\nAlready have I met, nor void of fear\r\nObserved the fury of his flying spear;\r\nFrom Ida\xe2\x80\x99s woods he chased us to the field,\r\nOur force he scattered, and our herds he kill\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nLyrnessus, Pedasus in ashes lay;\r\nBut (Jove assisting) I survived the day:\r\nElse had I sunk oppress\xe2\x80\x99d in fatal fight\r\nBy fierce Achilles and Minerva\xe2\x80\x99s might.\r\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99er he moved, the goddess shone before,\r\nAnd bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore.\r\nWhat mortal man Achilles can sustain?\r\nThe immortals guard him through the dreadful plain,\r\nAnd suffer not his dart to fall in vain.\r\nWere God my aid, this arm should check his power,\r\nThough strong in battle as a brazen tower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo whom the son of Jove: \xe2\x80\x9cThat god implore,\r\nAnd be what great Achilles was before.\r\nFrom heavenly Venus thou deriv\xe2\x80\x99st thy strain,\r\nAnd he but from a sister of the main;\r\nAn aged sea-god father of his line;\r\nBut Jove himself the sacred source of thine.\r\nThen lift thy weapon for a noble blow,\r\nNor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis said, and spirit breathed into his breast,\r\nThrough the thick troops the embolden\xe2\x80\x99d hero press\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nHis venturous act the white-arm\xe2\x80\x99d queen survey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd thus, assembling all the powers, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold an action, gods! that claims your care,\r\nLo great \xc3\x86neas rushing to the war!\r\nAgainst Pelides he directs his course,\r\nPhoebus impels, and Phoebus gives him force.\r\nRestrain his bold career; at least, to attend\r\nOur favour\xe2\x80\x99d hero, let some power descend.\r\nTo guard his life, and add to his renown,\r\nWe, the great armament of heaven, came down.\r\nHereafter let him fall, as Fates design,\r\nThat spun so short his life\xe2\x80\x99s illustrious line:262\r\nBut lest some adverse god now cross his way,\r\nGive him to know what powers assist this day:\r\nFor how shall mortal stand the dire alarms,\r\nWhen heaven\xe2\x80\x99s refulgent host appear in arms?\xe2\x80\x9d263\r\n\r\nThus she; and thus the god whose force can make\r\nThe solid globe\xe2\x80\x99s eternal basis shake:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgainst the might of man, so feeble known,\r\nWhy should celestial powers exert their own?\r\nSuffice from yonder mount to view the scene,\r\nAnd leave to war the fates of mortal men.\r\nBut if the armipotent, or god of light,\r\nObstruct Achilles, or commence the fight,\r\nThence on the gods of Troy we swift descend:\r\nFull soon, I doubt not, shall the conflict end;\r\nAnd these, in ruin and confusion hurl\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nYield to our conquering arms the lower world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus having said, the tyrant of the sea,\r\nCoerulean Neptune, rose, and led the way.\r\nAdvanced upon the field there stood a mound\r\nOf earth congested, wall\xe2\x80\x99d, and trench\xe2\x80\x99d around;\r\nIn elder times to guard Alcides made,\r\n(The work of Trojans, with Minerva\xe2\x80\x99s aid,)\r\nWhat time a vengeful monster of the main\r\nSwept the wide shore, and drove him to the plain.\r\n\r\nHere Neptune and the gods of Greece repair,\r\nWith clouds encompass\xe2\x80\x99d, and a veil of air:\r\nThe adverse powers, around Apollo laid,\r\nCrown the fair hills that silver Simois shade.\r\nIn circle close each heavenly party sat,\r\nIntent to form the future scheme of fate;\r\nBut mix not yet in fight, though Jove on high\r\nGives the loud signal, and the heavens reply.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground;\r\nThe trampled centre yields a hollow sound:\r\nSteeds cased in mail, and chiefs in armour bright,\r\nThe gleaming champaign glows with brazen light.\r\nAmid both hosts (a dreadful space) appear,\r\nThere great Achilles; bold \xc3\x86neas, here.\r\nWith towering strides \xc3\x86neas first advanced;\r\nThe nodding plumage on his helmet danced:\r\nSpread o\xe2\x80\x99er his breast the fencing shield he bore,\r\nAnd, so he moved, his javelin flamed before.\r\nNot so Pelides; furious to engage,\r\nHe rush\xe2\x80\x99d impetuous. Such the lion\xe2\x80\x99s rage,\r\nWho viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,\r\nThough all in arms the peopled city rise,\r\nStalks careless on, with unregarding pride;\r\nTill at the length, by some brave youth defied,\r\nTo his bold spear the savage turns alone,\r\nHe murmurs fury with a hollow groan;\r\nHe grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around,\r\nLash\xe2\x80\x99d by his tail his heaving sides resound;\r\nHe calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,\r\nResolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.\r\nSo fierce Achilles on \xc3\x86neas flies;\r\nSo stands \xc3\x86neas, and his force defies.\r\nEre yet the stern encounter join\xe2\x80\x99d, begun\r\nThe seed of Thetis thus to Venus\xe2\x80\x99 son:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy comes \xc3\x86neas through the ranks so far?\r\nSeeks he to meet Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 arm in war,\r\nIn hope the realms of Priam to enjoy,\r\nAnd prove his merits to the throne of Troy?\r\nGrant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies,\r\nThe partial monarch may refuse the prize;\r\nSons he has many; those thy pride may quell:\r\nAnd \xe2\x80\x99tis his fault to love those sons too well,\r\nOr, in reward of thy victorious hand,\r\nHas Troy proposed some spacious tract of land,\r\nAn ample forest, or a fair domain,\r\nOf hills for vines, and arable for grain?\r\nEven this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.\r\nBut can Achilles be so soon forgot?\r\nOnce (as I think) you saw this brandish\xe2\x80\x99d spear,\r\nAnd then the great \xc3\x86neas seem\xe2\x80\x99d to fear:\r\nWith hearty haste from Ida\xe2\x80\x99s mount he fled,\r\nNor, till he reach\xe2\x80\x99d Lyrnessus, turn\xe2\x80\x99d his head.\r\nHer lofty walls not long our progress stay\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThose, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid:\r\nIn Grecian chains her captive race were cast;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis true, the great \xc3\x86neas fled too fast.\r\nDefrauded of my conquest once before,\r\nWhat then I lost, the gods this day restore.\r\nGo; while thou may\xe2\x80\x99st, avoid the threaten\xe2\x80\x99d fate;\r\nFools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Anchises\xe2\x80\x99 son: \xe2\x80\x9cSuch words employ\r\nTo one that fears thee, some unwarlike boy;\r\nSuch we disdain; the best may be defied\r\nWith mean reproaches, and unmanly pride;\r\nUnworthy the high race from which we came\r\nProclaim\xe2\x80\x99d so loudly by the voice of fame:\r\nEach from illustrious fathers draws his line;\r\nEach goddess-born; half human, half divine.\r\nThetis\xe2\x80\x99 this day, or Venus\xe2\x80\x99 offspring dies,\r\nAnd tears shall trickle from celestial eyes:\r\nFor when two heroes, thus derived, contend,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis not in words the glorious strife can end.\r\nIf yet thou further seek to learn my birth\r\n(A tale resounded through the spacious earth)\r\nHear how the glorious origin we prove\r\nFrom ancient Dardanus, the first from Jove:\r\nDardania\xe2\x80\x99s walls he raised; for Ilion, then,\r\n(The city since of many-languaged men,)\r\nWas not. The natives were content to till\r\nThe shady foot of Ida\xe2\x80\x99s fountful hill.264\r\nFrom Dardanus great Erichthonius springs,\r\nThe richest, once, of Asia\xe2\x80\x99s wealthy kings;\r\nThree thousand mares his spacious pastures bred,\r\nThree thousand foals beside their mothers fed.\r\nBoreas, enamour\xe2\x80\x99d of the sprightly train,\r\nConceal\xe2\x80\x99d his godhead in a flowing mane,\r\nWith voice dissembled to his loves he neigh\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd coursed the dappled beauties o\xe2\x80\x99er the mead:\r\nHence sprung twelve others of unrivall\xe2\x80\x99d kind,\r\nSwift as their mother mares, and father wind.\r\nThese lightly skimming, when they swept the plain,\r\nNor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain;\r\nAnd when along the level seas they flew,265\r\nScarce on the surface curl\xe2\x80\x99d the briny dew.\r\nSuch Erichthonius was: from him there came\r\nThe sacred Tros, of whom the Trojan name.\r\nThree sons renown\xe2\x80\x99d adorn\xe2\x80\x99d his nuptial bed,\r\nIlus, Assaracus, and Ganymed:\r\nThe matchless Ganymed, divinely fair,\r\nWhom heaven, enamour\xe2\x80\x99d, snatch\xe2\x80\x99d to upper air,\r\nTo bear the cup of Jove (ethereal guest,\r\nThe grace and glory of the ambrosial feast).\r\nThe two remaining sons the line divide:\r\nFirst rose Laomedon from Ilus\xe2\x80\x99 side;\r\nFrom him Tithonus, now in cares grown old,\r\nAnd Priam, bless\xe2\x80\x99d with Hector, brave and bold;\r\nClytius and Lampus, ever-honour\xe2\x80\x99d pair;\r\nAnd Hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.\r\nFrom great Assaracus sprang Capys, he\r\nBegat Anchises, and Anchises me.\r\nSuch is our race: \xe2\x80\x99tis fortune gives us birth,\r\nBut Jove alone endues the soul with worth:\r\nHe, source of power and might! with boundless sway,\r\nAll human courage gives, or takes away.\r\nLong in the field of words we may contend,\r\nReproach is infinite, and knows no end,\r\nArm\xe2\x80\x99d or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong;\r\nSo voluble a weapon is the tongue;\r\nWounded, we wound; and neither side can fail,\r\nFor every man has equal strength to rail:\r\nWomen alone, when in the streets they jar,\r\nPerhaps excel us in this wordy war;\r\nLike us they stand, encompass\xe2\x80\x99d with the crowd,\r\nAnd vent their anger impotent and loud.\r\nCease then\xe2\x80\x94Our business in the field of fight\r\nIs not to question, but to prove our might.\r\nTo all those insults thou hast offer\xe2\x80\x99d here,\r\nReceive this answer: \xe2\x80\x99tis my flying spear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke. With all his force the javelin flung,\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.\r\nFar on his outstretch\xe2\x80\x99d arm, Pelides held\r\n(To meet the thundering lance) his dreadful shield,\r\nThat trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear\r\nSaw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.\r\nHis fears were vain; impenetrable charms\r\nSecured the temper of the ethereal arms.\r\nThrough two strong plates the point its passage held,\r\nBut stopp\xe2\x80\x99d, and rested, by the third repell\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nFive plates of various metal, various mould,\r\nComposed the shield; of brass each outward fold,\r\nOf tin each inward, and the middle gold:\r\nThere stuck the lance. Then rising ere he threw,\r\nThe forceful spear of great Achilles flew,\r\nAnd pierced the Dardan shield\xe2\x80\x99s extremest bound,\r\nWhere the shrill brass return\xe2\x80\x99d a sharper sound:\r\nThrough the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides,\r\nAnd the slight covering of expanded hides.\r\n\xc3\x86neas his contracted body bends,\r\nAnd o\xe2\x80\x99er him high the riven targe extends,\r\nSees, through its parting plates, the upper air,\r\nAnd at his back perceives the quivering spear:\r\nA fate so near him, chills his soul with fright;\r\nAnd swims before his eyes the many-colour\xe2\x80\x99d light.\r\nAchilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,\r\nDraws his broad blade, and at \xc3\x86neas flies:\r\n\xc3\x86neas rousing as the foe came on,\r\nWith force collected, heaves a mighty stone:\r\nA mass enormous! which in modern days\r\nNo two of earth\xe2\x80\x99s degenerate sons could raise.\r\nBut ocean\xe2\x80\x99s god, whose earthquakes rock the ground\r\nSaw the distress, and moved the powers around:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLo! on the brink of fate \xc3\x86neas stands,\r\nAn instant victim to Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 hands;\r\nBy Phoebus urged; but Phoebus has bestow\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nHis aid in vain: the man o\xe2\x80\x99erpowers the god.\r\nAnd can ye see this righteous chief atone\r\nWith guiltless blood for vices not his own?\r\nTo all the gods his constant vows were paid;\r\nSure, though he wars for Troy, he claims our aid.\r\nFate wills not this; nor thus can Jove resign\r\nThe future father of the Dardan line:266\r\nThe first great ancestor obtain\xe2\x80\x99d his grace,\r\nAnd still his love descends on all the race:\r\nFor Priam now, and Priam\xe2\x80\x99s faithless kind,\r\nAt length are odious to the all-seeing mind;\r\nOn great \xc3\x86neas shall devolve the reign,\r\nAnd sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great earth-shaker thus: to whom replies\r\nThe imperial goddess with the radiant eyes:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood as he is, to immolate or spare\r\nThe Dardan prince, O Neptune! be thy care;\r\nPallas and I, by all that gods can bind,\r\nHave sworn destruction to the Trojan kind;\r\nNot even an instant to protract their fate,\r\nOr save one member of the sinking state;\r\nTill her last flame be quench\xe2\x80\x99d with her last gore,\r\nAnd even her crumbling ruins are no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king of ocean to the fight descends,\r\nThrough all the whistling darts his course he bends,\r\nSwift interposed between the warrior flies,\r\nAnd casts thick darkness o\xe2\x80\x99er Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 eyes.267\r\nFrom great \xc3\x86neas\xe2\x80\x99 shield the spear he drew,\r\nAnd at his master\xe2\x80\x99s feet the weapon threw.\r\nThat done, with force divine he snatch\xe2\x80\x99d on high\r\nThe Dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,\r\nSmooth-gliding without step, above the heads\r\nOf warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:\r\nTill at the battle\xe2\x80\x99s utmost verge they light,\r\nWhere the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.\r\nThe godhead there (his heavenly form confess\xe2\x80\x99d)\r\nWith words like these the panting chief address\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat power, O prince! with force inferior far,\r\nUrged thee to meet Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 arm in war?\r\nHenceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,\r\nDefrauding fate of all thy fame to come.\r\nBut when the day decreed (for come it must)\r\nShall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,\r\nLet then the furies of that arm be known,\r\nSecure no Grecian force transcends thy own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, he left him wondering as he lay,\r\nThen from Achilles chased the mist away:\r\nSudden, returning with a stream of light,\r\nThe scene of war came rushing on his sight.\r\nThen thus, amazed; \xe2\x80\x9cWhat wonders strike my mind!\r\nMy spear, that parted on the wings of wind,\r\nLaid here before me! and the Dardan lord,\r\nThat fell this instant, vanish\xe2\x80\x99d from my sword!\r\nI thought alone with mortals to contend,\r\nBut powers celestial sure this foe defend.\r\nGreat as he is, our arms he scarce will try,\r\nContent for once, with all his gods, to fly.\r\nNow then let others bleed.\xe2\x80\x9d This said, aloud\r\nHe vents his fury and inflames the crowd:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Greeks!

Think, Hector leads you on;\r\nNor dread the vaunts of Peleus\xe2\x80\x99 haughty son.\r\nDeeds must decide our fate.

the Trojan earth\r\nReceives thee dead, though Gygae boast thy birth;\r\nThose beauteous fields where Hyllus\xe2\x80\x99 waves are roll\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd plenteous Hermus swells with tides of gold,\r\nAre thine no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94The insulting hero said,\r\nAnd left him sleeping in eternal shade.\r\nThe rolling wheels of Greece the body tore,\r\nAnd dash\xe2\x80\x99d their axles with no vulgar gore.\r\n\r\nDemoleon next, Antenor\xe2\x80\x99s offspring, laid\r\nBreathless in dust, the price of rashness paid.\r\nThe impatient steel with full-descending sway\r\nForced through his brazen helm its furious way,\r\nResistless drove the batter\xe2\x80\x99d skull before,\r\nAnd dash\xe2\x80\x99d and mingled all the brains with gore.\r\nThis sees Hippodamas, and seized with fright,\r\nDeserts his chariot for a swifter flight:\r\nThe lance arrests him: an ignoble wound\r\nThe panting Trojan rivets to the ground.\r\nHe groans away his soul: not louder roars,\r\nAt Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s shrine on Helice\xe2\x80\x99s high shores,\r\nThe victim bull; the rocks re-bellow round,\r\nAnd ocean listens to the grateful sound.\r\nThen fell on Polydore his vengeful rage,268\r\nThe youngest hope of Priam\xe2\x80\x99s stooping age:\r\n(Whose feet for swiftness in the race surpass\xe2\x80\x99d:)\r\nOf all his sons, the dearest, and the last.\r\nTo the forbidden field he takes his flight,\r\nIn the first folly of a youthful knight,\r\nTo vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain,\r\nBut vaunts not long, with all his swiftness slain:\r\nStruck where the crossing belts unite behind,\r\nAnd golden rings the double back-plate join\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nForth through the navel burst the thrilling steel;\r\nAnd on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell;\r\nThe rushing entrails pour\xe2\x80\x99d upon the ground\r\nHis hands collect; and darkness wraps him round.\r\nWhen Hector view\xe2\x80\x99d, all ghastly in his gore,\r\nThus sadly slain the unhappy Polydore,\r\nA cloud of sorrow overcast his sight,\r\nHis soul no longer brook\xe2\x80\x99d the distant fight:\r\nFull in Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 dreadful front he came,\r\nAnd shook his javelin like a waving flame.\r\nThe son of Peleus sees, with joy possess\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nHis heart high-bounding in his rising breast.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, lo!

Scamander attacks him with all his waves:\r\nNeptune and Pallas assist the hero: Simois joins Scamander: at length\r\nVulcan, by the instigation of Juno, almost dries up the river. This\r\ncombat ended, the other gods engage each other. Meanwhile Achilles\r\ncontinues the slaughter, drives the rest into Troy: Agenor only makes a\r\nstand, and is conveyed away in a cloud by Apollo; who (to delude\r\nAchilles) takes upon him Agenor\xe2\x80\x99s shape, and while he pursues him in\r\nthat disguise, gives the Trojans an opportunity of retiring into their\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe same day continues. The scene is on the banks and in the stream of\r\nScamander.\r\n\r\nAnd now to Xanthus\xe2\x80\x99 gliding stream they drove,\r\nXanthus, immortal progeny of Jove.\r\nThe river here divides the flying train,\r\nPart to the town fly diverse o\xe2\x80\x99er the plain,\r\nWhere late their troops triumphant bore the fight,\r\nNow chased, and trembling in ignoble flight:\r\n(These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds,\r\nAnd rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds:)\r\nPart plunge into the stream: old Xanthus roars,\r\nThe flashing billows beat the whiten\xe2\x80\x99d shores:\r\nWith cries promiscuous all the banks resound,\r\nAnd here, and there, in eddies whirling round,\r\nThe flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nAs the scorch\xe2\x80\x99d locusts from their fields retire,\r\nWhile fast behind them runs the blaze of fire;\r\nDriven from the land before the smoky cloud,\r\nThe clustering legions rush into the flood:\r\nSo, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 force,\r\nRoars the resounding surge with men and horse.\r\nHis bloody lance the hero casts aside,\r\n(Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)\r\nThen, like a god, the rapid billows braves,\r\nArm\xe2\x80\x99d with his sword, high brandish\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er the waves:\r\nNow down he plunges, now he whirls it round,\r\nDeep groan\xe2\x80\x99d the waters with the dying sound;\r\nRepeated wounds the reddening river dyed,\r\nAnd the warm purple circled on the tide.\r\nSwift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly,\r\nAnd close in rocks or winding caverns lie:\r\nSo the huge dolphin tempesting the main,\r\nIn shoals before him fly the scaly train,\r\nConfusedly heap\xe2\x80\x99d they seek their inmost caves,\r\nOr pant and heave beneath the floating waves.\r\nNow, tired with slaughter, from the Trojan band\r\nTwelve chosen youths he drags alive to land;\r\nWith their rich belts their captive arms restrains\r\n(Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains).\r\nThese his attendants to the ships convey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nSad victims destined to Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 shade;\r\n\r\nThen, as once more he plunged amid the flood,\r\nThe young Lycaon in his passage stood;\r\nThe son of Priam; whom the hero\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\nBut late made captive in his father\xe2\x80\x99s land\r\n(As from a sycamore, his sounding steel\r\nLopp\xe2\x80\x99d the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel)\r\nTo Lemnos\xe2\x80\x99 isle he sold the royal slave,\r\nWhere Jason\xe2\x80\x99s son the price demanded gave;\r\nBut kind Eetion, touching on the shore,\r\nThe ransom\xe2\x80\x99d prince to fair Arisbe bore.\r\nTen days were past, since in his father\xe2\x80\x99s reign\r\nHe felt the sweets of liberty again;\r\nThe next, that god whom men in vain withstand\r\nGives the same youth to the same conquering hand\r\nNow never to return! and doom\xe2\x80\x99d to go\r\nA sadder journey to the shades below.\r\nHis well-known face when great Achilles eyed,\r\n(The helm and visor he had cast aside\r\nWith wild affright, and dropp\xe2\x80\x99d upon the field\r\nHis useless lance and unavailing shield,)\r\nAs trembling, panting, from the stream he fled,\r\nAnd knock\xe2\x80\x99d his faltering knees, the hero said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe mighty gods! what wonders strike my view!\r\nIs it in vain our conquering arms subdue?\r\nSure I shall see yon heaps of Trojans kill\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nRise from the shades, and brave me on the field;\r\nAs now the captive, whom so late I bound\r\nAnd sold to Lemnos, stalks on Trojan ground!\r\nNot him the sea\xe2\x80\x99s unmeasured deeps detain,\r\nThat bar such numbers from their native plain;\r\nLo! he returns. Try, then, my flying spear!\r\nTry, if the grave can hold the wanderer;\r\nIf earth, at length this active prince can seize,\r\nEarth, whose strong grasp has held down Hercules.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus while he spoke, the Trojan pale with fears\r\nApproach\xe2\x80\x99d, and sought his knees with suppliant tears\r\nLoth as he was to yield his youthful breath,\r\nAnd his soul shivering at the approach of death.\r\nAchilles raised the spear, prepared to wound;\r\nHe kiss\xe2\x80\x99d his feet, extended on the ground:\r\nAnd while, above, the spear suspended stood,\r\nLonging to dip its thirsty point in blood,\r\nOne hand embraced them close, one stopp\xe2\x80\x99d the dart,\r\nWhile thus these melting words attempt his heart:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy well-known captive, great Achilles! see,\r\nOnce more Lycaon trembles at thy knee.\r\nSome pity to a suppliant\xe2\x80\x99s name afford,\r\nWho shared the gifts of Ceres at thy board;\r\nWhom late thy conquering arm to Lemnos bore,\r\nFar from his father, friends, and native shore;\r\nA hundred oxen were his price that day,\r\nNow sums immense thy mercy shall repay.\r\nScarce respited from woes I yet appear,\r\nAnd scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here;\r\nLo! Jove again submits me to thy hands,\r\nAgain, her victim cruel Fate demands!\r\nI sprang from Priam, and Laothoe fair,\r\n(Old Altes\xe2\x80\x99 daughter, and Lelegia\xe2\x80\x99s heir;\r\nWho held in Pedasus his famed abode,\r\nAnd ruled the fields where silver Satnio flow\xe2\x80\x99d,)\r\nTwo sons (alas! unhappy sons) she bore;\r\nFor ah! one spear shall drink each brother\xe2\x80\x99s gore,\r\nAnd I succeed to slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d Polydore.\r\nHow from that arm of terror shall I fly?\r\nSome demon urges! \xe2\x80\x99tis my doom to die!\r\nIf ever yet soft pity touch\xe2\x80\x99d thy mind,\r\nAh! think not me too much of Hector\xe2\x80\x99s kind!\r\nNot the same mother gave thy suppliant breath,\r\nWith his, who wrought thy loved Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words, attended with a shower of tears,\r\nThe youth address\xe2\x80\x99d to unrelenting ears:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk not of life, or ransom (he replies):\r\nPatroclus dead, whoever meets me, dies:\r\nIn vain a single Trojan sues for grace;\r\nBut least, the sons of Priam\xe2\x80\x99s hateful race.\r\nDie then, my friend! what boots it to deplore?\r\nThe great, the good Patroclus is no more!\r\nHe, far thy better, was foredoom\xe2\x80\x99d to die,\r\nAnd thou, dost thou bewail mortality?\r\nSeest thou not me, whom nature\xe2\x80\x99s gifts adorn,\r\nSprung from a hero, from a goddess born?\r\nThe day shall come (which nothing can avert)\r\nWhen by the spear, the arrow, or the dart,\r\nBy night, or day, by force, or by design,\r\nImpending death and certain fate are mine!\r\nDie then,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94He said; and as the word he spoke,\r\nThe fainting stripling sank before the stroke:\r\nHis hand forgot its grasp, and left the spear,\r\nWhile all his trembling frame confess\xe2\x80\x99d his fear:\r\nSudden, Achilles his broad sword display\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd buried in his neck the reeking blade.\r\nProne fell the youth; and panting on the land,\r\nThe gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand.\r\nThe victor to the stream the carcase gave,\r\nAnd thus insults him, floating on the wave:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLie there, Lycaon! let the fish surround\r\nThy bloated corpse, and suck thy gory wound:\r\nThere no sad mother shall thy funerals weep,\r\nBut swift Scamander roll thee to the deep,\r\nWhose every wave some watery monster brings,\r\nTo feast unpunish\xe2\x80\x99d on the fat of kings.\r\nSo perish Troy, and all the Trojan line!\r\nSuch ruin theirs, and such compassion mine.\r\nWhat boots ye now Scamander\xe2\x80\x99s worshipp\xe2\x80\x99d stream,\r\nHis earthly honours, and immortal name?\r\nIn vain your immolated bulls are slain,\r\nYour living coursers glut his gulfs in vain!\r\nThus he rewards you, with this bitter fate;\r\nThus, till the Grecian vengeance is complete:\r\nThus is atoned Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 honour\xe2\x80\x99d shade,\r\nAnd the short absence of Achilles paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese boastful words provoked the raging god;\r\nWith fury swells the violated flood.\r\nWhat means divine may yet the power employ\r\nTo check Achilles, and to rescue Troy?\r\nMeanwhile the hero springs in arms, to dare\r\nThe great Asteropeus to mortal war;\r\nThe son of Pelagon, whose lofty line\r\nFlows from the source of Axius, stream divine!\r\n(Fair Peribaea\xe2\x80\x99s love the god had crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWith all his refluent waters circled round:)\r\nOn him Achilles rush\xe2\x80\x99d; he fearless stood,\r\nAnd shook two spears, advancing from the flood;\r\nThe flood impell\xe2\x80\x99d him, on Pelides\xe2\x80\x99 head\r\nTo avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead.\r\nNear as they drew, Achilles thus began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou, boldest of the race of man?\r\nWho, or from whence? Unhappy is the sire\r\nWhose son encounters our resistless ire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO son of Peleus! what avails to trace\r\n(Replied the warrior) our illustrious race?\r\nFrom rich Paeonia\xe2\x80\x99s valleys I command,\r\nArm\xe2\x80\x99d with protended spears, my native band;\r\nNow shines the tenth bright morning since I came\r\nIn aid of Ilion to the fields of fame:\r\nAxius, who swells with all the neighbouring rills,\r\nAnd wide around the floated region fills,\r\nBegot my sire, whose spear much glory won:\r\nNow lift thy arm, and try that hero\xe2\x80\x99s son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThreatening he said: the hostile chiefs advance;\r\nAt once Asteropeus discharged each lance,\r\n(For both his dexterous hands the lance could wield,)\r\nOne struck, but pierced not, the Vulcanian shield;\r\nOne razed Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 hand; the spouting blood\r\nSpun forth; in earth the fasten\xe2\x80\x99d weapon stood.\r\nLike lightning next the Pelean javelin flies:\r\nIts erring fury hiss\xe2\x80\x99d along the skies;\r\nDeep in the swelling bank was driven the spear,\r\nEven to the middle earth; and quiver\xe2\x80\x99d there.\r\nThen from his side the sword Pelides drew,\r\nAnd on his foe with double fury flew.\r\nThe foe thrice tugg\xe2\x80\x99d, and shook the rooted wood;\r\nRepulsive of his might the weapon stood:\r\nThe fourth, he tries to break the spear in vain;\r\nBent as he stands, he tumbles to the plain;\r\nHis belly open\xe2\x80\x99d with a ghastly wound,\r\nThe reeking entrails pour upon the ground.\r\nBeneath the hero\xe2\x80\x99s feet he panting lies,\r\nAnd his eye darkens, and his spirit flies;\r\nWhile the proud victor thus triumphing said,\r\nHis radiant armour tearing from the dead:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo ends thy glory! Such the fate they prove,\r\nWho strive presumptuous with the sons of Jove!\r\nSprung from a river, didst thou boast thy line?\r\nBut great Saturnius is the source of mine.\r\nHow durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny?\r\nOf Peleus, \xc3\x86acus, and Jove, am I.\r\nThe race of these superior far to those,\r\nAs he that thunders to the stream that flows.\r\nWhat rivers can, Scamander might have shown;\r\nBut Jove he dreads, nor wars against his son.\r\nEven Achelous might contend in vain,\r\nAnd all the roaring billows of the main.\r\nThe eternal ocean, from whose fountains flow\r\nThe seas, the rivers, and the springs below,\r\nThe thundering voice of Jove abhors to hear,\r\nAnd in his deep abysses shakes with fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: then from the bank his javelin tore,\r\nAnd left the breathless warrior in his gore.\r\nThe floating tides the bloody carcase lave,\r\nAnd beat against it, wave succeeding wave;\r\nTill, roll\xe2\x80\x99d between the banks, it lies the food\r\nOf curling eels, and fishes of the flood.\r\nAll scatter\xe2\x80\x99d round the stream (their mightiest slain)\r\nThe amazed Paeonians scour along the plain;\r\nHe vents his fury on the flying crew,\r\nThrasius, Astyplus, and Mnesus slew;\r\nMydon, Thersilochus, with \xc3\x86nius, fell;\r\nAnd numbers more his lance had plunged to hell,\r\nBut from the bottom of his gulfs profound\r\nScamander spoke; the shores return\xe2\x80\x99d the sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO first of mortals! (for the gods are thine)\r\nIn valour matchless, and in force divine!\r\nIf Jove have given thee every Trojan head,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.\r\nSee! my choked streams no more their course can keep,\r\nNor roll their wonted tribute to the deep.\r\nTurn then, impetuous! from our injured flood;\r\nContent, thy slaughters could amaze a god.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn human form, confess\xe2\x80\x99d before his eyes,\r\nThe river thus; and thus the chief replies:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO sacred stream! thy word we shall obey;\r\nBut not till Troy the destined vengeance pay,\r\nNot till within her towers the perjured train\r\nShall pant, and tremble at our arms again;\r\nNot till proud Hector, guardian of her wall,\r\nOr stain this lance, or see Achilles fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said; and drove with fury on the foe.\r\nThen to the godhead of the silver bow\r\nThe yellow flood began: \xe2\x80\x9cO son of Jove!\r\nWas not the mandate of the sire above\r\nFull and express, that Phoebus should employ\r\nHis sacred arrows in defence of Troy,\r\nAnd make her conquer, till Hyperion\xe2\x80\x99s fall\r\nIn awful darkness hide the face of all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke in vain\xe2\x80\x94The chief without dismay\r\nPloughs through the boiling surge his desperate way.\r\nThen rising in his rage above the shores,\r\nFrom all his deep the bellowing river roars,\r\nHuge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast,\r\nAnd round the banks the ghastly dead are toss\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nWhile all before, the billows ranged on high,\r\n(A watery bulwark,) screen the bands who fly.\r\nNow bursting on his head with thundering sound,\r\nThe falling deluge whelms the hero round:\r\nHis loaded shield bends to the rushing tide;\r\nHis feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide,\r\nSliddering, and staggering. On the border stood\r\nA spreading elm, that overhung the flood;\r\nHe seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;\r\nThe plant uprooted to his weight gave way.270\r\nHeaving the bank, and undermining all;\r\nLoud flash the waters to the rushing fall\r\nOf the thick foliage. The large trunk display\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nBridged the rough flood across: the hero stay\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nOn this his weight, and raised upon his hand,\r\nLeap\xe2\x80\x99d from the channel, and regain\xe2\x80\x99d the land.\r\nThen blacken\xe2\x80\x99d the wild waves: the murmur rose:\r\nThe god pursues, a huger billow throws,\r\nAnd bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy\r\nThe man whose fury is the fate of Troy.\r\nHe like the warlike eagle speeds his pace\r\n(Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race);\r\nFar as a spear can fly, Achilles springs;\r\nAt every bound his clanging armour rings:\r\nNow here, now there, he turns on every side,\r\nAnd winds his course before the following tide;\r\nThe waves flow after, wheresoe\xe2\x80\x99er he wheels,\r\nAnd gather fast, and murmur at his heels.\r\nSo when a peasant to his garden brings\r\nSoft rills of water from the bubbling springs,\r\nAnd calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,\r\nAnd feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:\r\nSoon as he clears whate\xe2\x80\x99er their passage stay\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd marks the future current with his spade,\r\nSwift o\xe2\x80\x99er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,\r\nLouder and louder purl the falling rills;\r\nBefore him scattering, they prevent his pains,\r\nAnd shine in mazy wanderings o\xe2\x80\x99er the plains.\r\n\r\nStill flies Achilles, but before his eyes\r\nStill swift Scamander rolls where\xe2\x80\x99er he flies:\r\nNot all his speed escapes the rapid floods;\r\nThe first of men, but not a match for gods.\r\nOft as he turn\xe2\x80\x99d the torrent to oppose,\r\nAnd bravely try if all the powers were foes;\r\nSo oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,\r\nBeats on his back, or bursts upon his head.\r\nYet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,\r\nAnd still indignant bounds above the waves.\r\nTired by the tides, his knees relax with toil;\r\nWash\xe2\x80\x99d from beneath him slides the slimy soil;\r\nWhen thus (his eyes on heaven\xe2\x80\x99s expansion thrown)\r\nForth bursts the hero with an angry groan:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no god Achilles to befriend,\r\nNo power to avert his miserable end?\r\nPrevent, O Jove! this ignominious date,271\r\nAnd make my future life the sport of fate.\r\nOf all heaven\xe2\x80\x99s oracles believed in vain,\r\nBut most of Thetis must her son complain;\r\nBy Phoebus\xe2\x80\x99 darts she prophesied my fall,\r\nIn glorious arms before the Trojan wall.\r\nOh! had I died in fields of battle warm,\r\nStretch\xe2\x80\x99d like a hero, by a hero\xe2\x80\x99s arm!\r\nMight Hector\xe2\x80\x99s spear this dauntless bosom rend,\r\nAnd my swift soul o\xe2\x80\x99ertake my slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d friend.\r\nAh no! Achilles meets a shameful fate,\r\nOh how unworthy of the brave and great!\r\nLike some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,\r\nCrossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,\r\nAn unregarded carcase to the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeptune and Pallas haste to his relief,\r\nAnd thus in human form address\xe2\x80\x99d the chief:\r\nThe power of ocean first: \xe2\x80\x9cForbear thy fear,\r\nO son of Peleus! Lo, thy gods appear!\r\nBehold! from Jove descending to thy aid,\r\nPropitious Neptune, and the blue-eyed maid.\r\nStay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.\r\nBut thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!\r\nNor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,\r\nTill Troy receive her flying sons, till all\r\nHer routed squadrons pant behind their wall:\r\nHector alone shall stand his fatal chance,\r\nAnd Hector\xe2\x80\x99s blood shall smoke upon thy lance.\r\nThine is the glory doom\xe2\x80\x99d.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus spake the gods:\r\nThen swift ascended to the bright abodes.\r\n\r\nStung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nHe springs impetuous, and invades the field:\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er all the expanded plain the waters spread;\r\nHeaved on the bounding billows danced the dead,\r\nFloating \xe2\x80\x99midst scatter\xe2\x80\x99d arms; while casques of gold\r\nAnd turn\xe2\x80\x99d-up bucklers glitter\xe2\x80\x99d as they roll\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nHigh o\xe2\x80\x99er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,\r\nHe wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds.\r\nNot a whole river stops the hero\xe2\x80\x99s course,\r\nWhile Pallas fills him with immortal force.\r\nWith equal rage, indignant Xanthus roars,\r\nAnd lifts his billows, and o\xe2\x80\x99erwhelms his shores.\r\n\r\nThen thus to Simois! \xe2\x80\x9cHaste, my brother flood;\r\nAnd check this mortal that controls a god;\r\nOur bravest heroes else shall quit the fight,\r\nAnd Ilion tumble from her towery height.\r\nCall then thy subject streams, and bid them roar,\r\nFrom all thy fountains swell thy watery store,\r\nWith broken rocks, and with a load of dead,\r\nCharge the black surge, and pour it on his head.\r\nMark how resistless through the floods he goes,\r\nAnd boldly bids the warring gods be foes!\r\nBut nor that force, nor form divine to sight,\r\nShall aught avail him, if our rage unite:\r\nWhelm\xe2\x80\x99d under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie,\r\nThat blaze so dreadful in each Trojan eye;\r\nAnd deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nImmersed remain this terror of the world.\r\nSuch ponderous ruin shall confound the place,\r\nNo Greeks shall e\xe2\x80\x99er his perish\xe2\x80\x99d relics grace,\r\nNo hand his bones shall gather, or inhume;\r\nThese his cold rites, and this his watery tomb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACHILLES CONTENDING WITH THE RIVERS.]\r\n\r\nHe said; and on the chief descends amain,\r\nIncreased with gore, and swelling with the slain.\r\nThen, murmuring from his beds, he boils, he raves,\r\nAnd a foam whitens on the purple waves:\r\nAt every step, before Achilles stood\r\nThe crimson surge, and deluged him with blood.\r\nFear touch\xe2\x80\x99d the queen of heaven: she saw dismay\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nShe call\xe2\x80\x99d aloud, and summon\xe2\x80\x99d Vulcan\xe2\x80\x99s aid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise to the war! the insulting flood requires\r\nThy wasteful arm! assemble all thy fires!\r\nWhile to their aid, by our command enjoin\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nRush the swift eastern and the western wind:\r\nThese from old ocean at my word shall blow,\r\nPour the red torrent on the watery foe,\r\nCorses and arms to one bright ruin turn,\r\nAnd hissing rivers to their bottoms burn.\r\nGo, mighty in thy rage! display thy power,\r\nDrink the whole flood, the crackling trees devour.\r\nScorch all the banks! and (till our voice reclaim)\r\nExert the unwearied furies of the flame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe power ignipotent her word obeys:\r\nWide o\xe2\x80\x99er the plain he pours the boundless blaze;\r\nAt once consumes the dead, and dries the soil\r\nAnd the shrunk waters in their channel boil.\r\nAs when autumnal Boreas sweeps the sky,\r\nAnd instant blows the water\xe2\x80\x99d gardens dry:\r\nSo look\xe2\x80\x99d the field, so whiten\xe2\x80\x99d was the ground,\r\nWhile Vulcan breathed the fiery blast around.\r\nSwift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys;\r\nAlong the margin winds the running blaze:\r\nThe trees in flaming rows to ashes turn,\r\nThe flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn,\r\nBroad elm, and cypress rising in a spire;\r\nThe watery willows hiss before the fire.\r\nNow glow the waves, the fishes pant for breath,\r\nThe eels lie twisting in the pangs of death:\r\nNow flounce aloft, now dive the scaly fry,\r\nOr, gasping, turn their bellies to the sky.\r\nAt length the river rear\xe2\x80\x99d his languid head,\r\nAnd thus, short-panting, to the god he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Vulcan! oh! what power resists thy might?\r\nI faint, I sink, unequal to the fight\xe2\x80\x94\r\nI yield\xe2\x80\x94Let Ilion fall; if fate decree\xe2\x80\x94\r\nAh\xe2\x80\x94bend no more thy fiery arms on me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ceased; wide conflagration blazing round;\r\nThe bubbling waters yield a hissing sound.\r\nAs when the flames beneath a cauldron rise,272\r\nTo melt the fat of some rich sacrifice,\r\nAmid the fierce embrace of circling fires\r\nThe waters foam, the heavy smoke aspires:\r\nSo boils the imprison\xe2\x80\x99d flood, forbid to flow,\r\nAnd choked with vapours feels his bottom glow.\r\nTo Juno then, imperial queen of air,\r\nThe burning river sends his earnest prayer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh why, Saturnia; must thy son engage\r\nMe, only me, with all his wasteful rage?\r\nOn other gods his dreadful arm employ,\r\nFor mightier gods assert the cause of Troy.\r\nSubmissive I desist, if thou command;\r\nBut ah! withdraw this all-destroying hand.\r\nHear then my solemn oath, to yield to fate\r\nUnaided Ilion, and her destined state,\r\nTill Greece shall gird her with destructive flame,\r\nAnd in one ruin sink the Trojan name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis warm entreaty touch\xe2\x80\x99d Saturnia\xe2\x80\x99s ear:\r\nShe bade the ignipotent his rage forbear,\r\nRecall the flame, nor in a mortal cause\r\nInfest a god: the obedient flame withdraws:\r\nAgain the branching streams begin to spread,\r\nAnd soft remurmur in their wonted bed.\r\n\r\nWhile these by Juno\xe2\x80\x99s will the strife resign,\r\nThe warring gods in fierce contention join:\r\nRekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms:\r\nWith horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms:\r\nHeaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound;\r\nAnd wide beneath them groans the rending ground.\r\nJove, as his sport, the dreadful scene descries,\r\nAnd views contending gods with careless eyes.\r\nThe power of battles lifts his brazen spear,\r\nAnd first assaults the radiant queen of war:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat moved thy madness, thus to disunite\r\nEthereal minds, and mix all heaven in fight?\r\nWhat wonder this, when in thy frantic mood\r\nThou drovest a mortal to insult a god?\r\nThy impious hand Tydides\xe2\x80\x99 javelin bore,\r\nAnd madly bathed it in celestial gore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke, and smote the long-resounding shield,\r\nWhich bears Jove\xe2\x80\x99s thunder on its dreadful field:\r\nThe adamantine aegis of her sire,\r\nThat turns the glancing bolt and forked fire.\r\n\r\nThen heaved the goddess in her mighty hand\r\nA stone, the limit of the neighbouring land,\r\nThere fix\xe2\x80\x99d from eldest times; black, craggy, vast;\r\nThis at the heavenly homicide she cast.\r\nThundering he falls, a mass of monstrous size:\r\nAnd seven broad acres covers as he lies.\r\nThe stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound:\r\nLoud o\xe2\x80\x99er the fields his ringing arms resound:\r\nThe scornful dame her conquest views with smiles,\r\nAnd, glorying, thus the prostrate god reviles:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast thou not yet, insatiate fury! known\r\nHow far Minerva\xe2\x80\x99s force transcends thy own?\r\nJuno, whom thou rebellious darest withstand,\r\nCorrects thy folly thus by Pallas\xe2\x80\x99 hand;\r\nThus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace,\r\nAnd partial aid to Troy\xe2\x80\x99s perfidious race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe goddess spoke, and turn\xe2\x80\x99d her eyes away,\r\nThat, beaming round, diffused celestial day.\r\nJove\xe2\x80\x99s Cyprian daughter, stooping on the land,\r\nLent to the wounded god her tender hand:\r\nSlowly he rises, scarcely breathes with pain,\r\nAnd, propp\xe2\x80\x99d on her fair arm, forsakes the plain.\r\nThis the bright empress of the heavens survey\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd, scoffing, thus to war\xe2\x80\x99s victorious maid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLo! what an aid on Mars\xe2\x80\x99s side is seen!\r\nThe smiles\xe2\x80\x99 and loves\xe2\x80\x99 unconquerable queen!\r\nMark with what insolence, in open view,\r\nShe moves: let Pallas, if she dares, pursue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMinerva smiling heard, the pair o\xe2\x80\x99ertook,\r\nAnd slightly on her breast the wanton strook:\r\nShe, unresisting, fell (her spirits fled);\r\nOn earth together lay the lovers spread.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd like these heroes be the fate of all\r\n(Minerva cries) who guard the Trojan wall!\r\nTo Grecian gods such let the Phrygian be,\r\nSo dread, so fierce, as Venus is to me;\r\nThen from the lowest stone shall Troy be moved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThus she, and Juno with a smile approved.\r\n\r\nMeantime, to mix in more than mortal fight,\r\nThe god of ocean dares the god of light.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sloth has seized us, when the fields around\r\nRing with conflicting powers, and heaven returns the sound:\r\nShall, ignominious, we with shame retire,\r\nNo deed perform\xe2\x80\x99d, to our Olympian sire?\r\nCome, prove thy arm! for first the war to wage,\r\nSuits not my greatness, or superior age:\r\nRash as thou art to prop the Trojan throne,\r\n(Forgetful of my wrongs, and of thy own,)\r\nAnd guard the race of proud Laomedon!\r\nHast thou forgot, how, at the monarch\xe2\x80\x99s prayer,\r\nWe shared the lengthen\xe2\x80\x99d labours of a year?\r\nTroy walls I raised (for such were Jove\xe2\x80\x99s commands),\r\nAnd yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hands:\r\nThy task it was to feed the bellowing droves\r\nAlong fair Ida\xe2\x80\x99s vales and pendant groves.\r\nBut when the circling seasons in their train\r\nBrought back the grateful day that crown\xe2\x80\x99d our pain,\r\nWith menace stern the fraudful king defied\r\nOur latent godhead, and the prize denied:\r\nMad as he was, he threaten\xe2\x80\x99d servile bands,\r\nAnd doom\xe2\x80\x99d us exiles far in barbarous lands.273\r\nIncensed, we heavenward fled with swiftest wing,\r\nAnd destined vengeance on the perjured king.\r\nDost thou, for this, afford proud Ilion grace,\r\nAnd not, like us, infest the faithless race;\r\nLike us, their present, future sons destroy,\r\nAnd from its deep foundations heave their Troy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApollo thus: \xe2\x80\x9cTo combat for mankind\r\nIll suits the wisdom of celestial mind;\r\nFor what is man? Calamitous by birth,\r\nThey owe their life and nourishment to earth;\r\nLike yearly leaves, that now, with beauty crown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nSmile on the sun; now, wither on the ground.\r\nTo their own hands commit the frantic scene,\r\nNor mix immortals in a cause so mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen turns his face, far-beaming heavenly fires,\r\nAnd from the senior power submiss retires:\r\nHim thus retreating, Artemis upbraids,\r\nThe quiver\xe2\x80\x99d huntress of the sylvan shades:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it thus the youthful Phoebus flies,\r\nAnd yields to ocean\xe2\x80\x99s hoary sire the prize?\r\nHow vain that martial pomp, and dreadful show\r\nOf pointed arrows and the silver bow!\r\nNow boast no more in yon celestial bower,\r\nThy force can match the great earth-shaking power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilent he heard the queen of woods upbraid:\r\nNot so Saturnia bore the vaunting maid:\r\nBut furious thus: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat insolence has driven\r\nThy pride to face the majesty of heaven?\r\nWhat though by Jove the female plague design\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nFierce to the feeble race of womankind,\r\nThe wretched matron feels thy piercing dart;\r\nThy sex\xe2\x80\x99s tyrant, with a tiger\xe2\x80\x99s heart?\r\nWhat though tremendous in the woodland chase\r\nThy certain arrows pierce the savage race?\r\nHow dares thy rashness on the powers divine\r\nEmploy those arms, or match thy force with mine?\r\nLearn hence, no more unequal war to wage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe said, and seized her wrists with eager rage;\r\nThese in her left hand lock\xe2\x80\x99d, her right untied\r\nThe bow, the quiver, and its plumy pride.\r\nAbout her temples flies the busy bow;\r\nNow here, now there, she winds her from the blow;\r\nThe scattering arrows, rattling from the case,\r\nDrop round, and idly mark the dusty place.\r\nSwift from the field the baffled huntress flies,\r\nAnd scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes:\r\nSo, when the falcon wings her way above,\r\nTo the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove;\r\n(Not fated yet to die;) there safe retreats,\r\nYet still her heart against the marble beats.\r\n\r\nTo her Latona hastes with tender care;\r\nWhom Hermes viewing, thus declines the war:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow shall I face the dame, who gives delight\r\nTo him whose thunders blacken heaven with night?\r\nGo, matchless goddess! triumph in the skies,\r\nAnd boast my conquest, while I yield the prize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke; and pass\xe2\x80\x99d: Latona, stooping low,\r\nCollects the scatter\xe2\x80\x99d shafts and fallen bow,\r\nThat, glittering on the dust, lay here and there\r\nDishonour\xe2\x80\x99d relics of Diana\xe2\x80\x99s war:\r\nThen swift pursued her to her blest abode,\r\nWhere, all confused, she sought the sovereign god;\r\nWeeping, she grasp\xe2\x80\x99d his knees: the ambrosial vest\r\nShook with her sighs, and panted on her breast.\r\n\r\nThe sire superior smiled, and bade her show\r\nWhat heavenly hand had caused his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s woe?\r\nAbash\xe2\x80\x99d, she names his own imperial spouse;\r\nAnd the pale crescent fades upon her brows.\r\n\r\nThus they above: while, swiftly gliding down,\r\nApollo enters Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s sacred town;\r\nThe guardian-god now trembled for her wall,\r\nAnd fear\xe2\x80\x99d the Greeks, though fate forbade her fall.\r\nBack to Olympus, from the war\xe2\x80\x99s alarms,\r\nReturn the shining bands of gods in arms;\r\nSome proud in triumph, some with rage on fire;\r\nAnd take their thrones around the ethereal sire.\r\n\r\nThrough blood, through death, Achilles still proceeds,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d heroes, and o\xe2\x80\x99er rolling steeds.\r\nAs when avenging flames with fury driven\r\nOn guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven;\r\nThe pale inhabitants, some fall, some fly;\r\nAnd the red vapours purple all the sky:\r\nSo raged Achilles: death and dire dismay,\r\nAnd toils, and terrors, fill\xe2\x80\x99d the dreadful day.\r\n\r\nHigh on a turret hoary Priam stands,\r\nAnd marks the waste of his destructive hands;\r\nViews, from his arm, the Trojans\xe2\x80\x99 scatter\xe2\x80\x99d flight,\r\nAnd the near hero rising on his sight!\r\nNo stop, no check, no aid! With feeble pace,\r\nAnd settled sorrow on his aged face,\r\nFast as he could, he sighing quits the walls;\r\nAnd thus descending, on the guards he calls:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou to whose care our city-gates belong,\r\nSet wide your portals to the flying throng:\r\nFor lo! he comes, with unresisted sway;\r\nHe comes, and desolation marks his way!\r\nBut when within the walls our troops take breath,\r\nLock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung\r\nThe opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.\r\nPhoebus rush\xe2\x80\x99d forth, the flying bands to meet;\r\nStruck slaughter back, and cover\xe2\x80\x99d the retreat,\r\nOn heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate,\r\nAnd gladsome see their last escape from fate.\r\nThither, all parch\xe2\x80\x99d with thirst, a heartless train,\r\nHoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:\r\nAnd gasping, panting, fainting, labour on\r\nWith heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.\r\nEnraged Achilles follows with his spear;\r\nWild with revenge, insatiable of war.\r\n\r\nThen had the Greeks eternal praise acquired,\r\nAnd Troy inglorious to her walls retired;\r\nBut he, the god who darts ethereal flame,\r\nShot down to save her, and redeem her fame:\r\nTo young Agenor force divine he gave;\r\n(Antenor\xe2\x80\x99s offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)\r\nIn aid of him, beside the beech he sate,\r\nAnd wrapt in clouds, restrain\xe2\x80\x99d the hand of fate.\r\nWhen now the generous youth Achilles spies,\r\nThick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.\r\n(So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)\r\nHe stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, shall I fly this terror of the plain!\r\nLike others fly, and be like others slain?\r\nVain hope! to shun him by the self-same road\r\nYon line of slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d Trojans lately trod.\r\nNo: with the common heap I scorn to fall\xe2\x80\x94\r\nWhat if they pass\xe2\x80\x99d me to the Trojan wall,\r\nWhile I decline to yonder path, that leads\r\nTo Ida\xe2\x80\x99s forests and surrounding shades?\r\nSo may I reach, conceal\xe2\x80\x99d, the cooling flood,\r\nFrom my tired body wash the dirt and blood,\r\nAs soon as night her dusky veil extends,\r\nReturn in safety to my Trojan friends.\r\nWhat if?\xe2\x80\x94But wherefore all this vain debate?\r\nStand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?\r\nEven now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,\r\nThe fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:\r\nSuch is his swiftness, \xe2\x80\x99tis in vain to fly,\r\nAnd such his valour, that who stands must die.\r\nHowe\xe2\x80\x99er \xe2\x80\x99tis better, fighting for the state,\r\nHere, and in public view, to meet my fate.\r\nYet sure he too is mortal; he may feel\r\n(Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.\r\nOne only soul informs that dreadful frame:\r\nAnd Jove\xe2\x80\x99s sole favour gives him all his fame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said, and stood, collected, in his might;\r\nAnd all his beating bosom claim\xe2\x80\x99d the fight.\r\nSo from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,\r\nRoused from his thicket by a storm of darts:\r\nUntaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds\r\nOf shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;\r\nThough struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;\r\nAnd the barb\xe2\x80\x99d javelin stings his breast in vain:\r\nOn their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;\r\nAnd tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.\r\nNot less resolved, Antenor\xe2\x80\x99s valiant heir\r\nConfronts Achilles, and awaits the war,\r\nDisdainful of retreat: high held before,\r\nHis shield (a broad circumference) he bore;\r\nThen graceful as he stood, in act to throw\r\nThe lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow proud Achilles glories in his fame!\r\nAnd hopes this day to sink the Trojan name\r\nBeneath her ruins! Know, that hope is vain;\r\nA thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.\r\nParents and children our just arms employ,\r\nAnd strong and many are the sons of Troy.\r\nGreat as thou art, even thou may\xe2\x80\x99st stain with gore\r\nThese Phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: with matchless force the javelin flung\r\nSmote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung\r\nBeneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms\r\nHe stands impassive in the ethereal arms.\r\nThen fiercely rushing on the daring foe,\r\nHis lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:\r\nBut, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds\r\nThe god-like Trojan in a veil of clouds.\r\nSafe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,\r\nDismiss\xe2\x80\x99d with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.\r\nMeanwhile the god, to cover their escape,\r\nAssumes Agenor\xe2\x80\x99s habit, voice and shape,\r\nFlies from the furious chief in this disguise;\r\nThe furious chief still follows where he flies.\r\nNow o\xe2\x80\x99er the fields they stretch with lengthen\xe2\x80\x99d strides,\r\nNow urge the course where swift Scamander glides:\r\nThe god, now distant scarce a stride before,\r\nTempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;\r\nWhile all the flying troops their speed employ,\r\nAnd pour on heaps into the walls of Troy:\r\nNo stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,\r\nWho \xe2\x80\x99scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;\r\nAnd sudden joy confused, and mix\xe2\x80\x99d affright.\r\nPale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:\r\nAnd nations breathe, deliver\xe2\x80\x99d from their fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XXII.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF HECTOR.\r\n\r\nThe Trojans being safe within the walls, Hector only stays to oppose\r\nAchilles. Priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his\r\nson to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain.\r\nHector consults within himself what measures to take; but at the\r\nadvance of Achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies. Achilles\r\npursues him thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning\r\nthe fate of Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles.\r\nShe deludes Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat, and\r\nis slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of\r\nPriam and Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their cries\r\nreach the ears of Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into\r\nthe inner part of the palace: she mounts up to the walls, and beholds\r\nher dead husband. She swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief and\r\nlamentation.\r\n\r\nThe thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls, and\r\non the battlements of Troy.\r\n\r\nThus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,\r\nThe herded Ilians rush like driven deer:\r\nThere safe they wipe the briny drops away,\r\nAnd drown in bowls the labours of the day.\r\nClose to the walls, advancing o\xe2\x80\x99er the fields\r\nBeneath one roof of well-compacted shields,\r\nMarch, bending on, the Greeks\xe2\x80\x99 embodied powers,\r\nFar stretching in the shade of Trojan towers.\r\nGreat Hector singly stay\xe2\x80\x99d: chain\xe2\x80\x99d down by fate\r\nThere fix\xe2\x80\x99d he stood before the Scaean gate;\r\nStill his bold arms determined to employ,\r\nThe guardian still of long-defended Troy.\r\n\r\nApollo now to tired Achilles turns:\r\n(The power confess\xe2\x80\x99d in all his glory burns:)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what (he cries) has Peleus\xe2\x80\x99 son in view,\r\nWith mortal speed a godhead to pursue?\r\nFor not to thee to know the gods is given,\r\nUnskill\xe2\x80\x99d to trace the latent marks of heaven.\r\nWhat boots thee now, that Troy forsook the plain?\r\nVain thy past labour, and thy present vain:\r\nSafe in their walls are now her troops bestow\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhile here thy frantic rage attacks a god.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chief incensed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cToo partial god of day!\r\nTo check my conquests in the middle way:\r\nHow few in Ilion else had refuge found!\r\nWhat gasping numbers now had bit the ground!\r\nThou robb\xe2\x80\x99st me of a glory justly mine,\r\nPowerful of godhead, and of fraud divine:\r\nMean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,\r\nTo cheat a mortal who repines in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen to the city, terrible and strong,\r\nWith high and haughty steps he tower\xe2\x80\x99d along,\r\nSo the proud courser, victor of the prize,\r\nTo the near goal with double ardour flies.\r\nHim, as he blazing shot across the field,\r\nThe careful eyes of Priam first beheld.\r\nNot half so dreadful rises to the sight,274\r\nThrough the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,\r\nOrion\xe2\x80\x99s dog (the year when autumn weighs),\r\nAnd o\xe2\x80\x99er the feebler stars exerts his rays;\r\nTerrific glory! for his burning breath\r\nTaints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.\r\nSo flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:\r\nHe strikes his reverend head, now white with age;\r\nHe lifts his wither\xe2\x80\x99d arms; obtests the skies;\r\nHe calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:\r\nThe son, resolved Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 force to dare,\r\nFull at the Scaean gates expects the war;\r\nWhile the sad father on the rampart stands,\r\nAnd thus adjures him with extended hands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;\r\nHector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!\r\nMethinks already I behold thee slain,\r\nAnd stretch\xe2\x80\x99d beneath that fury of the plain.\r\nImplacable Achilles! might\xe2\x80\x99st thou be\r\nTo all the gods no dearer than to me!\r\nThee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore,\r\nAnd bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.\r\nHow many valiant sons I late enjoy\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nValiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nOr, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles\r\nTo shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.\r\nTwo, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,\r\nTwo from one mother sprung, my Polydore,\r\nAnd loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!\r\nOh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,\r\nWhat heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!\r\n(Their grandsire\xe2\x80\x99s wealth, by right of birth their own,\r\nConsign\xe2\x80\x99d his daughter with Lelegia\xe2\x80\x99s throne:)\r\nBut if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,\r\nAll pale they wander on the Stygian coast;\r\nWhat sorrows then must their sad mother know,\r\nWhat anguish I? unutterable woe!\r\nYet less that anguish, less to her, to me,\r\nLess to all Troy, if not deprived of thee.\r\nYet shun Achilles! enter yet the wall;\r\nAnd spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!\r\nSave thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave\r\nNeglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.\r\nPity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;\r\nWhile yet thy father feels the woes he bears,\r\nYet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage\r\n(All trembling on the verge of helpless age)\r\nGreat Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!\r\nThe bitter dregs of fortune\xe2\x80\x99s cup to drain:\r\nTo fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,\r\nAnd number all his days by miseries!\r\nMy heroes slain, my bridal bed o\xe2\x80\x99erturn\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nMy daughters ravish\xe2\x80\x99d, and my city burn\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nMy bleeding infants dash\xe2\x80\x99d against the floor;\r\nThese I have yet to see, perhaps yet more!\r\nPerhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,\r\nThe last sad relic of my ruin\xe2\x80\x99d state,\r\n(Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,\r\nAnd stain the pavement of my regal hall;\r\nWhere famish\xe2\x80\x99d dogs, late guardians of my door,\r\nShall lick their mangled master\xe2\x80\x99s spatter\xe2\x80\x99d gore.\r\nYet for my sons I thank ye, gods! \xe2\x80\x99tis well;\r\nWell have they perish\xe2\x80\x99d, for in fight they fell.\r\nWho dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,\r\nStruck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.\r\nBut when the fates, in fulness of their rage,\r\nSpurn the hoar head of unresisting age,\r\nIn dust the reverend lineaments deform,\r\nAnd pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:\r\nThis, this is misery! the last, the worse,\r\nThat man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said, and acting what no words could say,\r\nRent from his head the silver locks away.\r\nWith him the mournful mother bears a part;\r\nYet all her sorrows turn not Hector\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\nThe zone unbraced, her bosom she display\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nAnd thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave mercy on me, O my son! revere\r\nThe words of age; attend a parent\xe2\x80\x99s prayer!\r\nIf ever thee in these fond arms I press\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nOr still\xe2\x80\x99d thy infant clamours at this breast;\r\nAh do not thus our helpless years forego,\r\nBut, by our walls secured, repel the foe.\r\nAgainst his rage if singly thou proceed,\r\nShould\xe2\x80\x99st thou, (but Heaven avert it!) should\xe2\x80\x99st thou bleed,\r\nNor must thy corse lie honour\xe2\x80\x99d on the bier,\r\nNor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!\r\nFar from our pious rites those dear remains\r\nMust feast the vultures on the naked plains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;\r\nBut fix\xe2\x80\x99d remains the purpose of his soul;\r\nResolved he stands, and with a fiery glance\r\nExpects the hero\xe2\x80\x99s terrible advance.\r\nSo, roll\xe2\x80\x99d up in his den, the swelling snake\r\nBeholds the traveller approach the brake;\r\nWhen fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins\r\nHave gather\xe2\x80\x99d half the poisons of the plains;\r\nHe burns, he stiffens with collected ire,\r\nAnd his red eyeballs glare with living fire.\r\nBeneath a turret, on his shield reclined,\r\nHe stood, and question\xe2\x80\x99d thus his mighty mind:275\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere lies my way? to enter in the wall?\r\nHonour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:\r\nShall proud Polydamas before the gate\r\nProclaim, his counsels are obey\xe2\x80\x99d too late,\r\nWhich timely follow\xe2\x80\x99d but the former night,\r\nWhat numbers had been saved by Hector\xe2\x80\x99s flight?\r\nThat wise advice rejected with disdain,\r\nI feel my folly in my people slain.\r\nMethinks my suffering country\xe2\x80\x99s voice I hear,\r\nBut most her worthless sons insult my ear,\r\nOn my rash courage charge the chance of war,\r\nAnd blame those virtues which they cannot share.\r\nNo\xe2\x80\x94if I e\xe2\x80\x99er return, return I must\r\nGlorious, my country\xe2\x80\x99s terror laid in dust:\r\nOr if I perish, let her see me fall\r\nIn field at least, and fighting for her wall.\r\nAnd yet suppose these measures I forego,\r\nApproach unarm\xe2\x80\x99d, and parley with the foe,\r\nThe warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down,\r\nAnd treat on terms of peace to save the town:\r\nThe wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n(Cause of the war, and grievance of the land)\r\nWith honourable justice to restore:\r\nAnd add half Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s yet remaining store,\r\nWhich Troy shall, sworn, produce; that injured Greece\r\nMay share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace.\r\nBut why this thought? Unarm\xe2\x80\x99d if I should go,\r\nWhat hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,\r\nBut woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?\r\nWe greet not here, as man conversing man,\r\nMet at an oak, or journeying o\xe2\x80\x99er a plain;\r\nNo season now for calm familiar talk,\r\nLike youths and maidens in an evening walk:\r\nWar is our business, but to whom is given\r\nTo die, or triumph, that, determine Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh;\r\nHis dreadful plumage nodded from on high;\r\nThe Pelian javelin, in his better hand,\r\nShot trembling rays that glitter\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er the land;\r\nAnd on his breast the beamy splendour shone,\r\nLike Jove\xe2\x80\x99s own lightning, or the rising sun.\r\nAs Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,\r\nStruck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.\r\nHe leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:\r\nAchilles follows like the winged wind.\r\nThus at the panting dove a falcon flies\r\n(The swiftest racer of the liquid skies),\r\nJust when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,\r\nObliquely wheeling through the aerial way,\r\nWith open beak and shrilling cries he springs,\r\nAnd aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings:\r\nNo less fore-right the rapid chase they held,\r\nOne urged by fury, one by fear impell\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nNow circling round the walls their course maintain,\r\nWhere the high watch-tower overlooks the plain;\r\nNow where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad,\r\n(A wider compass,) smoke along the road.\r\nNext by Scamander\xe2\x80\x99s double source they bound,\r\nWhere two famed fountains burst the parted ground;\r\nThis hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,\r\nWith exhalations steaming to the skies;\r\nThat the green banks in summer\xe2\x80\x99s heat o\xe2\x80\x99erflows,\r\nLike crystal clear, and cold as winter snows:\r\nEach gushing fount a marble cistern fills,\r\nWhose polish\xe2\x80\x99d bed receives the falling rills;\r\nWhere Trojan dames (ere yet alarm\xe2\x80\x99d by Greece)\r\nWash\xe2\x80\x99d their fair garments in the days of peace.276\r\nBy these they pass\xe2\x80\x99d, one chasing, one in flight:\r\n(The mighty fled, pursued by stronger might:)\r\nSwift was the course; no vulgar prize they play,\r\nNo vulgar victim must reward the day:\r\n(Such as in races crown the speedy strife:)\r\nThe prize contended was great Hector\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\nAs when some hero\xe2\x80\x99s funerals are decreed\r\nIn grateful honour of the mighty dead;\r\nWhere high rewards the vigorous youth inflame\r\n(Some golden tripod, or some lovely dame)\r\nThe panting coursers swiftly turn the goal,\r\nAnd with them turns the raised spectator\xe2\x80\x99s soul:\r\nThus three times round the Trojan wall they fly.\r\nThe gazing gods lean forward from the sky;\r\nTo whom, while eager on the chase they look,\r\nThe sire of mortals and immortals spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnworthy sight! the man beloved of heaven,\r\nBehold, inglorious round yon city driven!\r\nMy heart partakes the generous Hector\xe2\x80\x99s pain;\r\nHector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain,\r\nWhose grateful fumes the gods received with joy,\r\nFrom Ida\xe2\x80\x99s summits, and the towers of Troy:\r\nNow see him flying; to his fears resign\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd fate, and fierce Achilles, close behind.\r\nConsult, ye powers!

Troy has view\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nHer walls thrice circled, and her chief pursued.\r\nBut now some god within me bids me try\r\nThine, or my fate: I kill thee, or I die.\r\nYet on the verge of battle let us stay,\r\nAnd for a moment\xe2\x80\x99s space suspend the day;\r\nLet Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s high powers be call\xe2\x80\x99d to arbitrate\r\nThe just conditions of this stern debate,\r\n(Eternal witnesses of all below,\r\nAnd faithful guardians of the treasured vow!)\r\nTo them I swear; if, victor in the strife,\r\nJove by these hands shall shed thy noble life,\r\nNo vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue;\r\nStripp\xe2\x80\x99d of its arms alone (the conqueror\xe2\x80\x99s due)\r\nThe rest to Greece uninjured I\xe2\x80\x99ll restore:\r\nNow plight thy mutual oath, I ask no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk not of oaths (the dreadful chief replies,\r\nWhile anger flash\xe2\x80\x99d from his disdainful eyes),\r\nDetested as thou art, and ought to be,\r\nNor oath nor pact Achilles plights with thee:\r\nSuch pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine,\r\nSuch leagues as men and furious lions join,\r\nTo such I call the gods! one constant state\r\nOf lasting rancour and eternal hate:\r\nNo thought but rage, and never-ceasing strife,\r\nTill death extinguish rage, and thought, and life.\r\nRouse then thy forces this important hour,\r\nCollect thy soul, and call forth all thy power.\r\nNo further subterfuge, no further chance;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis Pallas, Pallas gives thee to my lance.\r\nEach Grecian ghost, by thee deprived of breath,\r\nNow hovers round, and calls thee to thy death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke, and launch\xe2\x80\x99d his javelin at the foe;\r\nBut Hector shunn\xe2\x80\x99d the meditated blow:\r\nHe stoop\xe2\x80\x99d, while o\xe2\x80\x99er his head the flying spear\r\nSang innocent, and spent its force in air.\r\nMinerva watch\xe2\x80\x99d it falling on the land,\r\nThen drew, and gave to great Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 hand,\r\nUnseen of Hector, who, elate with joy,\r\nNow shakes his lance, and braves the dread of Troy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe life you boasted to that javelin given,\r\nPrince! you have miss\xe2\x80\x99d. My fate depends on Heaven,\r\nTo thee, presumptuous as thou art, unknown,\r\nOr what must prove my fortune, or thy own.\r\nBoasting is but an art, our fears to blind,\r\nAnd with false terrors sink another\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\nBut know, whatever fate I am to try,\r\nBy no dishonest wound shall Hector die.\r\nI shall not fall a fugitive at least,\r\nMy soul shall bravely issue from my breast.\r\nBut first, try thou my arm; and may this dart\r\nEnd all my country\xe2\x80\x99s woes, deep buried in thy heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe weapon flew, its course unerring held,\r\nUnerring, but the heavenly shield repell\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe mortal dart; resulting with a bound\r\nFrom off the ringing orb, it struck the ground.\r\nHector beheld his javelin fall in vain,\r\nNor other lance, nor other hope remain;\r\nHe calls Deiphobus, demands a spear\xe2\x80\x94\r\nIn vain, for no Deiphobus was there.\r\nAll comfortless he stands: then, with a sigh;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis so\xe2\x80\x94Heaven wills it, and my hour is nigh!\r\nI deem\xe2\x80\x99d Deiphobus had heard my call,\r\nBut he secure lies guarded in the wall.\r\nA god deceived me; Pallas, \xe2\x80\x99twas thy deed,\r\nDeath and black fate approach! \xe2\x80\x99tis I must bleed.\r\nNo refuge now, no succour from above,\r\nGreat Jove deserts me, and the son of Jove,\r\nPropitious once, and kind!

After\r\nthe funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep,\r\nthe ghost of his friend appears to him, and demands the rites of\r\nburial; the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons\r\nto fetch wood for the pyre. The funeral procession, and the offering\r\ntheir hair to the dead. Achilles sacrifices several animals, and lastly\r\ntwelve Trojan captives, at the pile; then sets fire to it. He pays\r\nlibations to the Winds, which (at the instance of Iris) rise, and raise\r\nthe flames. When the pile has burned all night, they gather the bones,\r\nplace them in an urn of gold, and raise the tomb. Achilles institutes\r\nthe funeral games: the chariot-race, the fight of the caestus, the\r\nwrestling, the foot-race, the single combat, the discus, the shooting\r\nwith arrows, the darting the javelin: the various descriptions of\r\nwhich, and the various success of the several antagonists, make the\r\ngreatest part of the book.\r\n\r\nIn this book ends the thirtieth day. The night following, the ghost of\r\nPatroclus appears to Achilles: the one-and-thirtieth day is employed in\r\nfelling the timber for the pile: the two-and-thirtieth in burning it;\r\nand the three-and-thirtieth in the games. The scene is generally on the\r\nsea-shore.\r\n\r\nThus humbled in the dust, the pensive train\r\nThrough the sad city mourn\xe2\x80\x99d her hero slain.\r\nThe body soil\xe2\x80\x99d with dust, and black with gore,\r\nLies on broad Hellespont\xe2\x80\x99s resounding shore.\r\nThe Grecians seek their ships, and clear the strand,\r\nAll, but the martial Myrmidonian band:\r\nThese yet assembled great Achilles holds,\r\nAnd the stern purpose of his mind unfolds:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet, my brave companions of the war,\r\nRelease your smoking coursers from the car;\r\nBut, with his chariot each in order led,\r\nPerform due honours to Patroclus dead.\r\nEre yet from rest or food we seek relief,\r\nSome rites remain, to glut our rage of grief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe troops obey\xe2\x80\x99d; and thrice in order led281\r\n(Achilles first) their coursers round the dead;\r\nAnd thrice their sorrows and laments renew;\r\nTears bathe their arms, and tears the sands bedew.\r\nFor such a warrior Thetis aids their woe,\r\nMelts their strong hearts, and bids their eyes to flow.\r\nBut chief, Pelides: thick-succeeding sighs\r\nBurst from his heart, and torrents from his eyes:\r\nHis slaughtering hands, yet red with blood, he laid\r\nOn his dead friend\xe2\x80\x99s cold breast, and thus he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll hail, Patroclus! let thy honour\xe2\x80\x99d ghost\r\nHear, and rejoice on Pluto\xe2\x80\x99s dreary coast;\r\nBehold! Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 promise is complete;\r\nThe bloody Hector stretch\xe2\x80\x99d before thy feet.\r\nLo! to the dogs his carcase I resign;\r\nAnd twelve sad victims, of the Trojan line,\r\nSacred to vengeance, instant shall expire;\r\nTheir lives effused around thy funeral pyre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGloomy he said, and (horrible to view)\r\nBefore the bier the bleeding Hector threw,\r\nProne on the dust. The Myrmidons around\r\nUnbraced their armour, and the steeds unbound.\r\nAll to Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 sable ship repair,\r\nFrequent and full, the genial feast to share.\r\nNow from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire,\r\nThe bristly victims hissing o\xe2\x80\x99er the fire:\r\nThe huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler cries\r\nExpires the goat; the sheep in silence dies.\r\nAround the hero\xe2\x80\x99s prostrate body flow\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nIn one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood.\r\nAnd now a band of Argive monarchs brings\r\nThe glorious victor to the king of kings.\r\nFrom his dead friend the pensive warrior went,\r\nWith steps unwilling, to the regal tent.\r\nThe attending heralds, as by office bound,\r\nWith kindled flames the tripod-vase surround:\r\nTo cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore,\r\nThey urged in vain; the chief refused, and swore:282\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo drop shall touch me, by almighty Jove!\r\nThe first and greatest of the gods above!\r\nTill on the pyre I place thee; till I rear\r\nThe grassy mound, and clip thy sacred hair.\r\nSome ease at least those pious rites may give,\r\nAnd soothe my sorrows, while I bear to live.\r\nHowe\xe2\x80\x99er, reluctant as I am, I stay\r\nAnd share your feast; but with the dawn of day,\r\n(O king of men!) it claims thy royal care,\r\nThat Greece the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s funeral pile prepare,\r\nAnd bid the forests fall: (such rites are paid\r\nTo heroes slumbering in eternal shade:)\r\nThen, when his earthly part shall mount in fire,\r\nLet the leagued squadrons to their posts retire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke: they hear him, and the word obey;\r\nThe rage of hunger and of thirst allay,\r\nThen ease in sleep the labours of the day.\r\nBut great Pelides, stretch\xe2\x80\x99d along the shore,\r\nWhere, dash\xe2\x80\x99d on rocks, the broken billows roar,\r\nLies inly groaning; while on either hand\r\nThe martial Myrmidons confusedly stand.\r\nAlong the grass his languid members fall,\r\nTired with his chase around the Trojan wall;\r\nHush\xe2\x80\x99d by the murmurs of the rolling deep,\r\nAt length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep.\r\nWhen lo! the shade, before his closing eyes,\r\nOf sad Patroclus rose, or seem\xe2\x80\x99d to rise:\r\nIn the same robe he living wore, he came:\r\nIn stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same.\r\nThe form familiar hover\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er his head,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd sleeps Achilles? (thus the phantom said:)\r\nSleeps my Achilles, his Patroclus dead?\r\nLiving, I seem\xe2\x80\x99d his dearest, tenderest care,\r\nBut now forgot, I wander in the air.\r\nLet my pale corse the rites of burial know,\r\nAnd give me entrance in the realms below:\r\nTill then the spirit finds no resting-place,\r\nBut here and there the unbodied spectres chase\r\nThe vagrant dead around the dark abode,\r\nForbid to cross the irremeable flood.\r\nNow give thy hand; for to the farther shore\r\nWhen once we pass, the soul returns no more:\r\nWhen once the last funereal flames ascend,\r\nNo more shall meet Achilles and his friend;\r\nNo more our thoughts to those we loved make known;\r\nOr quit the dearest, to converse alone.\r\nMe fate has sever\xe2\x80\x99d from the sons of earth,\r\nThe fate fore-doom\xe2\x80\x99d that waited from my birth:\r\nThee too it waits; before the Trojan wall\r\nEven great and godlike thou art doom\xe2\x80\x99d to fall.\r\nHear then; and as in fate and love we join,\r\nAh suffer that my bones may rest with thine!\r\nTogether have we lived; together bred,\r\nOne house received us, and one table fed;\r\nThat golden urn, thy goddess-mother gave,\r\nMay mix our ashes in one common grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it thou? (he answers) To my sight283\r\nOnce more return\xe2\x80\x99st thou from the realms of night?\r\nO more than brother! Think each office paid,\r\nWhate\xe2\x80\x99er can rest a discontented shade;\r\nBut grant one last embrace, unhappy boy!\r\nAfford at least that melancholy joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said, and with his longing arms essay\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nIn vain to grasp the visionary shade!\r\nLike a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly,284\r\nAnd hears a feeble, lamentable cry.\r\nConfused he wakes; amazement breaks the bands\r\nOf golden sleep, and starting from the sands,\r\nPensive he muses with uplifted hands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis true, \xe2\x80\x99tis certain; man, though dead, retains\r\nPart of himself; the immortal mind remains:\r\nThe form subsists without the body\xe2\x80\x99s aid,\r\nAerial semblance, and an empty shade!\r\nThis night my friend, so late in battle lost,\r\nStood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost:\r\nEven now familiar, as in life, he came;\r\nAlas! how different! yet how like the same!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears:\r\nAnd now the rosy-finger\xe2\x80\x99d morn appears,\r\nShows every mournful face with tears o\xe2\x80\x99erspread,\r\nAnd glares on the pale visage of the dead.\r\nBut Agamemnon, as the rites demand,\r\nWith mules and waggons sends a chosen band\r\nTo load the timber, and the pile to rear;\r\nA charge consign\xe2\x80\x99d to Merion\xe2\x80\x99s faithful care.\r\nWith proper instruments they take the road,\r\nAxes to cut, and ropes to sling the load.\r\nFirst march the heavy mules, securely slow,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er hills, o\xe2\x80\x99er dales, o\xe2\x80\x99er crags, o\xe2\x80\x99er rocks they go:285\r\nJumping, high o\xe2\x80\x99er the shrubs of the rough ground,\r\nRattle the clattering cars, and the shock\xe2\x80\x99d axles bound.\r\nBut when arrived at Ida\xe2\x80\x99s spreading woods,286\r\n(Fair Ida, water\xe2\x80\x99d with descending floods,)\r\nLoud sounds the axe, redoubling strokes on strokes;\r\nOn all sides round the forest hurls her oaks\r\nHeadlong. Deep echoing groan the thickets brown;\r\nThen rustling, crackling, crashing, thunder down.\r\nThe wood the Grecians cleave, prepared to burn;\r\nAnd the slow mules the same rough road return.\r\nThe sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore\r\n(Such charge was given them) to the sandy shore;\r\nThere on the spot which great Achilles show\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThey eased their shoulders, and disposed the load;\r\nCircling around the place, where times to come\r\nShall view Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 and Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 tomb.\r\nThe hero bids his martial troops appear\r\nHigh on their cars in all the pomp of war;\r\nEach in refulgent arms his limbs attires,\r\nAll mount their chariots, combatants and squires.\r\nThe chariots first proceed, a shining train;\r\nThen clouds of foot that smoke along the plain;\r\nNext these the melancholy band appear;\r\nAmidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier;\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er all the corse their scattered locks they throw;\r\nAchilles next, oppress\xe2\x80\x99d with mighty woe,\r\nSupporting with his hands the hero\xe2\x80\x99s head,\r\nBends o\xe2\x80\x99er the extended body of the dead.\r\nPatroclus decent on the appointed ground\r\nThey place, and heap the sylvan pile around.\r\nBut great Achilles stands apart in prayer,\r\nAnd from his head divides the yellow hair;\r\nThose curling locks which from his youth he vow\xe2\x80\x99d,287\r\nAnd sacred grew, to Sperchius\xe2\x80\x99 honour\xe2\x80\x99d flood:\r\nThen sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,\r\nAnd roll\xe2\x80\x99d his eyes around the watery waste:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost\r\nDelightful roll along my native coast!\r\nTo whom we vainly vow\xe2\x80\x99d, at our return,\r\nThese locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn:\r\nFull fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,\r\nWhere to the day thy silver fountains rise,\r\nAnd where in shade of consecrated bowers\r\nThy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!\r\nSo vow\xe2\x80\x99d my father, but he vow\xe2\x80\x99d in vain;\r\nNo more Achilles sees his native plain;\r\nIn that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,\r\nPatroclus bears them to the shades below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus o\xe2\x80\x99er Patroclus while the hero pray\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nOn his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.\r\nOnce more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:\r\nAnd now the sun had set upon their woe;\r\nBut to the king of men thus spoke the chief:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, Atrides! give the troops relief:\r\nPermit the mourning legions to retire,\r\nAnd let the chiefs alone attend the pyre;\r\nThe pious care be ours, the dead to burn\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe said: the people to their ships return:\r\nWhile those deputed to inter the slain\r\nHeap with a rising pyramid the plain.288\r\nA hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,\r\nThe growing structure spreads on every side;\r\nHigh on the top the manly corse they lay,\r\nAnd well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:\r\nAchilles covered with their fat the dead,\r\nAnd the piled victims round the body spread;\r\nThen jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,\r\nSuspends around, low-bending o\xe2\x80\x99er the pile.\r\nFour sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan\r\nPour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown.\r\nOf nine large dogs, domestic at his board,\r\nFall two, selected to attend their lord,\r\nThen last of all, and horrible to tell,\r\nSad sacrifice! twelve Trojan captives fell.289\r\nOn these the rage of fire victorious preys,\r\nInvolves and joins them in one common blaze.\r\nSmear\xe2\x80\x99d with the bloody rites, he stands on high,\r\nAnd calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:290\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll hail, Patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost\r\nHear, and exult, on Pluto\xe2\x80\x99s dreary coast.\r\nBehold Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 promise fully paid,\r\nTwelve Trojan heroes offer\xe2\x80\x99d to thy shade;\r\nBut heavier fates on Hector\xe2\x80\x99s corse attend,\r\nSaved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spake he, threatening: but the gods made vain\r\nHis threat, and guard inviolate the slain:\r\nCelestial Venus hover\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er his head,\r\nAnd roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed:\r\nShe watch\xe2\x80\x99d him all the night and all the day,\r\nAnd drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.\r\nNor sacred Phoebus less employ\xe2\x80\x99d his care;\r\nHe pour\xe2\x80\x99d around a veil of gather\xe2\x80\x99d air,\r\nAnd kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,\r\nAgainst the solar beam and Sirian fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FUNERAL PILE OF PATROCLUS.]\r\n\r\nNor yet the pile, where dead Patroclus lies,\r\nSmokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise;\r\nBut, fast beside, Achilles stood in prayer,\r\nInvoked the gods whose spirit moves the air,\r\nAnd victims promised, and libations cast,\r\nTo gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast:\r\nHe call\xe2\x80\x99d the aerial powers, along the skies\r\nTo breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise.\r\nThe winged Iris heard the hero\xe2\x80\x99s call,\r\nAnd instant hasten\xe2\x80\x99d to their airy hall,\r\nWhere in old Zephyr\xe2\x80\x99s open courts on high,\r\nSat all the blustering brethren of the sky.\r\nShe shone amidst them, on her painted bow;\r\nThe rocky pavement glitter\xe2\x80\x99d with the show.\r\nAll from the banquet rise, and each invites\r\nThe various goddess to partake the rites.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so (the dame replied), I haste to go\r\nTo sacred Ocean, and the floods below:\r\nEven now our solemn hecatombs attend,\r\nAnd heaven is feasting on the world\xe2\x80\x99s green end\r\nWith righteous Ethiops (uncorrupted train!)\r\nFar on the extremest limits of the main.\r\nBut Peleus\xe2\x80\x99 son entreats, with sacrifice,\r\nThe western spirit, and the north, to rise!\r\nLet on Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 pile your blast be driven,\r\nAnd bear the blazing honours high to heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSwift as the word she vanish\xe2\x80\x99d from their view;\r\nSwift as the word the winds tumultuous flew;\r\nForth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,\r\nAnd heaps on heaps the clouds are toss\xe2\x80\x99d before.\r\nTo the wide main then stooping from the skies,\r\nThe heaving deeps in watery mountains rise:\r\nTroy feels the blast along her shaking walls,\r\nTill on the pile the gather\xe2\x80\x99d tempest falls.\r\nThe structure crackles in the roaring fires,\r\nAnd all the night the plenteous flame aspires.\r\nAll night Achilles hails Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 soul,\r\nWith large libations from the golden bowl.\r\nAs a poor father, helpless and undone,\r\nMourns o\xe2\x80\x99er the ashes of an only son,\r\nTakes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,\r\nAnd pours in tears, ere yet they close the urn:\r\nSo stay\xe2\x80\x99d Achilles, circling round the shore,\r\nSo watch\xe2\x80\x99d the flames, till now they flame no more.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas when, emerging through the shades of night,\r\nThe morning planet told the approach of light;\r\nAnd, fast behind, Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s warmer ray\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er the broad ocean pour\xe2\x80\x99d the golden day:\r\nThen sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd to their caves the whistling winds return\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nAcross the Thracian seas their course they bore;\r\nThe ruffled seas beneath their passage roar.\r\n\r\nThen parting from the pile he ceased to weep,\r\nAnd sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep,\r\nExhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowd\r\nOf thronging Grecians round Achilles stood;\r\nThe tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook\r\nUnwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe kings and princes of the Achaian name!\r\nFirst let us quench the yet remaining flame\r\nWith sable wine; then, as the rites direct,\r\nThe hero\xe2\x80\x99s bones with careful view select:\r\n(Apart, and easy to be known they lie\r\nAmidst the heap, and obvious to the eye:\r\nThe rest around the margin will be seen\r\nPromiscuous, steeds and immolated men:)\r\nThese wrapp\xe2\x80\x99d in double cauls of fat, prepare;\r\nAnd in the golden vase dispose with care;\r\nThere let them rest with decent honour laid,\r\nTill I shall follow to the infernal shade.\r\nMeantime erect the tomb with pious hands,\r\nA common structure on the humble sands:\r\nHereafter Greece some nobler work may raise,\r\nAnd late posterity record our praise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Greeks obey; where yet the embers glow,\r\nWide o\xe2\x80\x99er the pile the sable wine they throw,\r\nAnd deep subsides the ashy heap below.\r\nNext the white bones his sad companions place,\r\nWith tears collected, in the golden vase.\r\nThe sacred relics to the tent they bore;\r\nThe urn a veil of linen covered o\xe2\x80\x99er.\r\nThat done, they bid the sepulchre aspire,\r\nAnd cast the deep foundations round the pyre;\r\nHigh in the midst they heap the swelling bed\r\nOf rising earth, memorial of the dead.\r\n\r\nThe swarming populace the chief detains,\r\nAnd leads amidst a wide extent of plains;\r\nThere placed them round: then from the ships proceeds\r\nA train of oxen, mules, and stately steeds,\r\nVases and tripods (for the funeral games),\r\nResplendent brass, and more resplendent dames.\r\nFirst stood the prizes to reward the force\r\nOf rapid racers in the dusty course:\r\nA woman for the first, in beauty\xe2\x80\x99s bloom,\r\nSkill\xe2\x80\x99d in the needle, and the labouring loom;\r\nAnd a large vase, where two bright handles rise,\r\nOf twenty measures its capacious size.\r\nThe second victor claims a mare unbroke,\r\nBig with a mule, unknowing of the yoke:\r\nThe third, a charger yet untouch\xe2\x80\x99d by flame;\r\nFour ample measures held the shining frame:\r\nTwo golden talents for the fourth were placed:\r\nAn ample double bowl contents the last.\r\nThese in fair order ranged upon the plain,\r\nThe hero, rising, thus address\xe2\x80\x99d the train:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold the prizes, valiant Greeks! decreed\r\nTo the brave rulers of the racing steed;\r\nPrizes which none beside ourself could gain,\r\nShould our immortal coursers take the plain;\r\n(A race unrivall\xe2\x80\x99d, which from ocean\xe2\x80\x99s god\r\nPeleus received, and on his son bestow\xe2\x80\x99d.)\r\nBut this no time our vigour to display;\r\nNor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:\r\nLost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck\r\nTheir flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.\r\nSad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,\r\nAnd trail those graceful honours on the sand!\r\nLet others for the noble task prepare,\r\nWho trust the courser and the flying car.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFired at his word the rival racers rise;\r\nBut far the first Eumelus hopes the prize,\r\nFamed though Pieria for the fleetest breed,\r\nAnd skill\xe2\x80\x99d to manage the high-bounding steed.\r\nWith equal ardour bold Tydides swell\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe steeds of Tros beneath his yoke compell\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n(Which late obey\xe2\x80\x99d the Dardan chief\xe2\x80\x99s command,\r\nWhen scarce a god redeem\xe2\x80\x99d him from his hand).\r\nThen Menelaus his Podargus brings,\r\nAnd the famed courser of the king of kings:\r\nWhom rich Echepolus (more rich than brave),\r\nTo \xe2\x80\x99scape the wars, to Agamemnon gave,\r\n(\xc3\x86the her name) at home to end his days;\r\nBase wealth preferring to eternal praise.\r\nNext him Antilochus demands the course\r\nWith beating heart, and cheers his Pylian horse.\r\nExperienced Nestor gives his son the reins,\r\nDirects his judgment, and his heat restrains;\r\nNor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears\r\nThe prudent son with unattending ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,\r\nThe gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nNeptune and Jove on thee conferr\xe2\x80\x99d the skill\r\nSwift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.\r\nTo guide thy conduct little precept needs;\r\nBut slow, and past their vigour, are my steeds.\r\nFear not thy rivals, though for swiftness known;\r\nCompare those rivals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment and thy own:\r\nIt is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,\r\nAnd to be swift is less than to be wise.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis more by art than force of numerous strokes\r\nThe dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks;\r\nBy art the pilot, through the boiling deep\r\nAnd howling tempest, steers the fearless ship;\r\nAnd \xe2\x80\x99tis the artist wins the glorious course;\r\nNot those who trust in chariots and in horse.\r\nIn vain, unskilful to the goal they strive,\r\nAnd short, or wide, the ungovern\xe2\x80\x99d courser drive:\r\nWhile with sure skill, though with inferior steeds,\r\nThe knowing racer to his end proceeds;\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d on the goal his eye foreruns the course,\r\nHis hand unerring steers the steady horse,\r\nAnd now contracts, or now extends the rein,\r\nObserving still the foremost on the plain.\r\nMark then the goal, \xe2\x80\x99tis easy to be found;\r\nYon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground;\r\nOf some once stately oak the last remains,\r\nOr hardy fir, unperish\xe2\x80\x99d with the rains:\r\nInclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar;\r\nAnd round, a circle for the wheeling car.\r\n(Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;\r\nOr then, as now, the limit of a race.)\r\nBear close to this, and warily proceed,\r\nA little bending to the left-hand steed;\r\nBut urge the right, and give him all the reins;\r\nWhile thy strict hand his fellow\xe2\x80\x99s head restrains,\r\nAnd turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,\r\nThe wheel\xe2\x80\x99s round naves appear to brush the goal.\r\nYet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)\r\nClear of the stony heap direct the course;\r\nLest through incaution failing, thou mayst be\r\nA joy to others, a reproach to me.\r\nSo shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,\r\nAnd leave unskilful swiftness far behind:\r\nThough thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed\r\nWhich bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;\r\nOr the famed race, through all the regions known,\r\nThat whirl\xe2\x80\x99d the car of proud Laomedon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage\r\nConcludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.\r\nNext bold Meriones was seen to rise,\r\nThe last, but not least ardent for the prize.\r\nThey mount their seats; the lots their place dispose\r\n(Roll\xe2\x80\x99d in his helmet, these Achilles throws).\r\nYoung Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then;\r\nAnd next the brother of the king of men:\r\nThy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;\r\nAnd, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.\r\nThey stand in order, an impatient train:\r\nPelides points the barrier on the plain,\r\nAnd sends before old Phoenix to the place,\r\nTo mark the racers, and to judge the race.\r\nAt once the coursers from the barrier bound;\r\nThe lifted scourges all at once resound;\r\nTheir heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;\r\nAnd up the champaign thunder from the shore:\r\nThick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,\r\nAnd the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;\r\nLoose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,\r\nFloat in their speed, and dance upon the wind:\r\nThe smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,\r\nNow seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.\r\nWhile hot for fame, and conquest all their care,\r\n(Each o\xe2\x80\x99er his flying courser hung in air,)\r\nErect with ardour, poised upon the rein,\r\nThey pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.\r\nNow (the last compass fetch\xe2\x80\x99d around the goal)\r\nAt the near prize each gathers all his soul,\r\nEach burns with double hope, with double pain,\r\nTears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.\r\nFirst flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;\r\nWith those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:\r\nClose on Eumelus\xe2\x80\x99 back they puff the wind,\r\nAnd seem just mounting on his car behind;\r\nFull on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,\r\nAnd, hovering o\xe2\x80\x99er, their stretching shadows sees.\r\nThen had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;\r\nBut angry Phoebus to Tydides flies,\r\nStrikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain\r\nHis matchless horses\xe2\x80\x99 labour on the plain.\r\nRage fills his eye with anguish, to survey\r\nSnatch\xe2\x80\x99d from his hope the glories of the day.\r\nThe fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,\r\nSprings to her knight, and gives the scourge again,\r\nAnd fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke\r\nShe breaks his rival\xe2\x80\x99s chariot from the yoke:\r\nNo more their way the startled horses held;\r\nThe car reversed came rattling on the field;\r\nShot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,\r\nProne on the dust the unhappy master fell;\r\nHis batter\xe2\x80\x99d face and elbows strike the ground;\r\nNose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish\xe2\x80\x99d wound:\r\nGrief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:\r\nBefore him far the glad Tydides flies;\r\nMinerva\xe2\x80\x99s spirit drives his matchless pace,\r\nAnd crowns him victor of the labour\xe2\x80\x99d race.\r\n\r\nThe next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;\r\nWhile thus young Nestor animates his steeds:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, now, my generous pair, exert your force;\r\nNot that we hope to match Tydides\xe2\x80\x99 horse,\r\nSince great Minerva wings their rapid way,\r\nAnd gives their lord the honours of the day;\r\nBut reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo\r\nYour swiftness? vanquish\xe2\x80\x99d by a female foe?\r\nThrough your neglect, if lagging on the plain\r\nThe last ignoble gift be all we gain,\r\nNo more shall Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s hand your food supply,\r\nThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s fury rises, and ye die.\r\nHaste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,\r\nPresents the occasion, could we use it right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus he. The coursers at their master\xe2\x80\x99s threat\r\nWith quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.\r\nAnd now Antilochus with nice survey\r\nObserves the compass of the hollow way.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,\r\nFast by the road a precipice was worn:\r\nHere, where but one could pass, to shun the throng\r\nThe Spartan hero\xe2\x80\x99s chariot smoked along.\r\nClose up the venturous youth resolves to keep,\r\nStill edging near, and bears him toward the steep.\r\nAtrides, trembling, casts his eye below,\r\nAnd wonders at the rashness of his foe.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, stay your steeds\xe2\x80\x94What madness thus to ride\r\nThis narrow way! take larger field (he cried),\r\nOr both must fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Atrides cried in vain;\r\nHe flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.\r\nFar as an able arm the disk can send,\r\nWhen youthful rivals their full force extend,\r\nSo far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew\r\nBefore the king: he, cautious, backward drew\r\nHis horse compell\xe2\x80\x99d; foreboding in his fears\r\nThe rattling ruin of the clashing cars,\r\nThe floundering coursers rolling on the plain,\r\nAnd conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.\r\nBut thus upbraids his rival as he flies:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!\r\nGo, but expect not I\xe2\x80\x99ll the prize resign;\r\nAdd perjury to fraud, and make it thine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen to his steeds with all his force he cries,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!\r\nYour rivals, destitute of youthful force,\r\nWith fainting knees shall labour in the course,\r\nAnd yield the glory yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94The steeds obey;\r\nAlready at their heels they wing their way,\r\nAnd seem already to retrieve the day.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Grecians in a ring beheld\r\nThe coursers bounding o\xe2\x80\x99er the dusty field.\r\nThe first who mark\xe2\x80\x99d them was the Cretan king;\r\nHigh on a rising ground, above the ring,\r\nThe monarch sat: from whence with sure survey\r\nHe well observed the chief who led the way,\r\nAnd heard from far his animating cries,\r\nAnd saw the foremost steed with sharpen\xe2\x80\x99d eyes;\r\nOn whose broad front a blaze of shining white,\r\nLike the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.\r\nHe saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre yonder horse discern\xe2\x80\x99d by me alone?\r\nOr can ye, all, another chief survey,\r\nAnd other steeds than lately led the way?\r\nThose, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,\r\nLie sure disabled in the middle field:\r\nFor, since the goal they doubled, round the plain\r\nI search to find them, but I search in vain.\r\nPerchance the reins forsook the driver\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nAnd, turn\xe2\x80\x99d too short, he tumbled on the strand,\r\nShot from the chariot; while his coursers stray\r\nWith frantic fury from the destined way.\r\nRise then some other, and inform my sight,\r\nFor these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;\r\nYet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,\r\nThe great \xc3\x86tolian chief, renown\xe2\x80\x99d in war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld man! (Oileus rashly thus replies)\r\nThy tongue too hastily confers the prize;\r\nOf those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,\r\nNor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.\r\nEumelus\xe2\x80\x99 steeds, high bounding in the chase,\r\nStill, as at first, unrivall\xe2\x80\x99d lead the race:\r\nI well discern him, as he shakes the rein,\r\nAnd hear his shouts victorious o\xe2\x80\x99er the plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBarbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!\r\nContentious prince, of all the Greeks beside\r\nThe last in merit, as the first in pride!\r\nTo vile reproach what answer can we make?\r\nA goblet or a tripod let us stake,\r\nAnd be the king the judge. The most unwise\r\nWill learn their rashness, when they pay the price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,\r\nStern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn\r\nTo fell extremes. But Thetis\xe2\x80\x99 godlike son\r\nAwful amidst them rose, and thus begun:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;\r\nMuch would ye blame, should others thus offend:\r\nAnd lo! the approaching steeds your contest end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nNo sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,\r\nDrives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.\r\nHigh o\xe2\x80\x99er his head the circling lash he wields:\r\nHis bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:\r\nHis car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nBright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,\r\nRefulgent through the cloud: no eye could find\r\nThe track his flying wheels had left behind:\r\nAnd the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace\r\nSo swift, it seem\xe2\x80\x99d a flight, and not a race.\r\nNow victor at the goal Tydides stands,\r\nQuits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;\r\nFrom the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;\r\nThe well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:\r\nWith joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,\r\nThe tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:\r\nThese to the ships his train triumphant leads,\r\nThe chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.\r\n\r\nYoung Nestor follows (who by art, not force,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99erpass\xe2\x80\x99d Atrides) second in the course.\r\nBehind, Atrides urged the race, more near\r\nThan to the courser in his swift career\r\nThe following car, just touching with his heel\r\nAnd brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:\r\nSuch, and so narrow now the space between\r\nThe rivals, late so distant on the green;\r\nSo soon swift \xc3\x86the her lost ground regain\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nOne length, one moment, had the race obtain\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n\r\nMerion pursued, at greater distance still,\r\nWith tardier coursers, and inferior skill.\r\nLast came, Admetus! thy unhappy son;\r\nSlow dragged the steeds his batter\xe2\x80\x99d chariot on:\r\nAchilles saw, and pitying thus begun:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold! the man whose matchless art surpass\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe sons of Greece! the ablest, yet the last!\r\nFortune denies, but justice bids us pay\r\n(Since great Tydides bears the first away)\r\nTo him the second honours of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Greeks consent with loud-applauding cries,\r\nAnd then Eumelus had received the prize,\r\nBut youthful Nestor, jealous of his fame,\r\nThe award opposes, and asserts his claim.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink not (he cries) I tamely will resign,\r\nO Peleus\xe2\x80\x99 son! the mare so justly mine.\r\nWhat if the gods, the skilful to confound,\r\nHave thrown the horse and horseman to the ground?\r\nPerhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice,\r\nAnd vows omitted forfeited the prize.\r\nIf yet (distinction to thy friend to show,\r\nAnd please a soul desirous to bestow)\r\nSome gift must grace Eumelus, view thy store\r\nOf beauteous handmaids, steeds, and shining ore;\r\nAn ample present let him thence receive,\r\nAnd Greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give.\r\nBut this my prize I never shall forego;\r\nThis, who but touches, warriors! is my foe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus spake the youth; nor did his words offend;\r\nPleased with the well-turn\xe2\x80\x99d flattery of a friend,\r\nAchilles smiled: \xe2\x80\x9cThe gift proposed (he cried),\r\nAntilochus! we shall ourself provide.\r\nWith plates of brass the corslet cover\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er,\r\n(The same renown\xe2\x80\x99d Asteropaeus wore,)\r\nWhose glittering margins raised with silver shine,\r\n(No vulgar gift,) Eumelus! shall be thine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: Automedon at his command\r\nThe corslet brought, and gave it to his hand.\r\nDistinguish\xe2\x80\x99d by his friend, his bosom glows\r\nWith generous joy: then Menelaus rose;\r\nThe herald placed the sceptre in his hands,\r\nAnd still\xe2\x80\x99d the clamour of the shouting bands.\r\nNot without cause incensed at Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s son,\r\nAnd inly grieving, thus the king begun:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAn act so rash, Antilochus! has stain\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nRobb\xe2\x80\x99d of my glory and my just reward,\r\nTo you, O Grecians! be my wrong declared:\r\nSo not a leader shall our conduct blame,\r\nOr judge me envious of a rival\xe2\x80\x99s fame.\r\nBut shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?\r\nWhat needs appealing in a fact so plain?\r\nWhat Greek shall blame me, if I bid thee rise,\r\nAnd vindicate by oath th\xe2\x80\x99 ill-gotten prize?\r\nRise if thou darest, before thy chariot stand,\r\nThe driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand;\r\nAnd touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent\r\nWas but to conquer, not to circumvent.\r\nSwear by that god whose liquid arms surround\r\nThe globe, and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prudent chief with calm attention heard;\r\nThen mildly thus: \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse, if youth have err\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nSuperior as thou art, forgive the offence,\r\nNor I thy equal, or in years, or sense.\r\nThou know\xe2\x80\x99st the errors of unripen\xe2\x80\x99d age,\r\nWeak are its counsels, headlong is its rage.\r\nThe prize I quit, if thou thy wrath resign;\r\nThe mare, or aught thou ask\xe2\x80\x99st, be freely thine\r\nEre I become (from thy dear friendship torn)\r\nHateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spoke Antilochus; and at the word\r\nThe mare contested to the king restored.\r\nJoy swells his soul: as when the vernal grain\r\nLifts the green ear above the springing plain,\r\nThe fields their vegetable life renew,\r\nAnd laugh and glitter with the morning dew;\r\nSuch joy the Spartan\xe2\x80\x99s shining face o\xe2\x80\x99erspread,\r\nAnd lifted his gay heart, while thus he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill may our souls, O generous youth! agree\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis now Atrides\xe2\x80\x99 turn to yield to thee.\r\nRash heat perhaps a moment might control,\r\nNot break, the settled temper of thy soul.\r\nNot but (my friend) \xe2\x80\x99tis still the wiser way\r\nTo waive contention with superior sway;\r\nFor ah! how few, who should like thee offend,\r\nLike thee, have talents to regain the friend!\r\nTo plead indulgence, and thy fault atone,\r\nSuffice thy father\xe2\x80\x99s merit and thy own:\r\nGenerous alike, for me, the sire and son\r\nHave greatly suffer\xe2\x80\x99d, and have greatly done.\r\nI yield; that all may know, my soul can bend,\r\nNor is my pride preferr\xe2\x80\x99d before my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said; and pleased his passion to command,\r\nResign\xe2\x80\x99d the courser to Noemon\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nFriend of the youthful chief: himself content,\r\nThe shining charger to his vessel sent.\r\nThe golden talents Merion next obtain\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThe fifth reward, the double bowl, remain\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nAchilles this to reverend Nestor bears.\r\nAnd thus the purpose of his gift declares:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccept thou this, O sacred sire! (he said)\r\nIn dear memorial of Patroclus dead;\r\nDead and for ever lost Patroclus lies,\r\nFor ever snatch\xe2\x80\x99d from our desiring eyes!\r\nTake thou this token of a grateful heart,\r\nThough \xe2\x80\x99tis not thine to hurl the distant dart,\r\nThe quoit to toss, the ponderous mace to wield,\r\nOr urge the race, or wrestle on the field:\r\nThy pristine vigour age has overthrown,\r\nBut left the glory of the past thy own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said, and placed the goblet at his side;\r\nWith joy the venerable king replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWisely and well, my son, thy words have proved\r\nA senior honour\xe2\x80\x99d, and a friend beloved!\r\nToo true it is, deserted of my strength,\r\nThese wither\xe2\x80\x99d arms and limbs have fail\xe2\x80\x99d at length.\r\nOh! had I now that force I felt of yore,\r\nKnown through Buprasium and the Pylian shore!\r\nVictorious then in every solemn game,\r\nOrdain\xe2\x80\x99d to Amarynces\xe2\x80\x99 mighty name;\r\nThe brave Epeians gave my glory way,\r\n\xc3\x86tolians, Pylians, all resign\xe2\x80\x99d the day.\r\nI quell\xe2\x80\x99d Clytomedes in fights of hand,\r\nAnd backward hurl\xe2\x80\x99d Ancaeus on the sand,\r\nSurpass\xe2\x80\x99d Iphyclus in the swift career,\r\nPhyleus and Polydorus with the spear.\r\nThe sons of Actor won the prize of horse,\r\nBut won by numbers, not by art or force:\r\nFor the famed twins, impatient to survey\r\nPrize after prize by Nestor borne away,\r\nSprung to their car; and with united pains\r\nOne lash\xe2\x80\x99d the coursers, while one ruled the reins.\r\nSuch once I was! Now to these tasks succeeds\r\nA younger race, that emulate our deeds:\r\nI yield, alas! (to age who must not yield?)\r\nThough once the foremost hero of the field.\r\nGo thou, my son! by generous friendship led,\r\nWith martial honours decorate the dead:\r\nWhile pleased I take the gift thy hands present,\r\n(Pledge of benevolence, and kind intent,)\r\nRejoiced, of all the numerous Greeks, to see\r\nNot one but honours sacred age and me:\r\nThose due distinctions thou so well canst pay,\r\nMay the just gods return another day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProud of the gift, thus spake the full of days:\r\nAchilles heard him, prouder of the praise.\r\n\r\nThe prizes next are order\xe2\x80\x99d to the field,\r\nFor the bold champions who the caestus wield.\r\nA stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,\r\nOf six years\xe2\x80\x99 age, unconscious of the yoke,\r\nIs to the circus led, and firmly bound;\r\nNext stands a goblet, massy, large, and round.\r\nAchilles rising, thus: \xe2\x80\x9cLet Greece excite\r\nTwo heroes equal to this hardy fight;\r\nWho dare the foe with lifted arms provoke,\r\nAnd rush beneath the long-descending stroke.\r\nOn whom Apollo shall the palm bestow,\r\nAnd whom the Greeks supreme by conquest know,\r\nThis mule his dauntless labours shall repay,\r\nThe vanquish\xe2\x80\x99d bear the massy bowl away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis dreadful combat great Epeus chose;291\r\nHigh o\xe2\x80\x99er the crowd, enormous bulk! he rose,\r\nAnd seized the beast, and thus began to say:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand forth some man, to bear the bowl away!\r\n(Price of his ruin: for who dares deny\r\nThis mule my right; the undoubted victor I)\r\nOthers, \xe2\x80\x99tis own\xe2\x80\x99d, in fields of battle shine,\r\nBut the first honours of this fight are mine;\r\nFor who excels in all? Then let my foe\r\nDraw near, but first his certain fortune know;\r\nSecure this hand shall his whole frame confound,\r\nMash all his bones, and all his body pound:\r\nSo let his friends be nigh, a needful train,\r\nTo heave the batter\xe2\x80\x99d carcase off the plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze\r\nThe host beheld him, silent with amaze!\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire\r\nTo meet his might, and emulate thy sire,\r\nThe great Mecistheus; who in days of yore\r\nIn Theban games the noblest trophy bore,\r\n(The games ordain\xe2\x80\x99d dead OEdipus to grace,)\r\nAnd singly vanquish the Cadmean race.\r\nHim great Tydides urges to contend,\r\nWarm with the hopes of conquest for his friend;\r\nOfficious with the cincture girds him round;\r\nAnd to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.\r\nAmid the circle now each champion stands,\r\nAnd poises high in air his iron hands;\r\nWith clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,\r\nTheir crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,\r\nAnd painful sweat from all their members flows.\r\nAt length Epeus dealt a weighty blow\r\nFull on the cheek of his unwary foe;\r\nBeneath that ponderous arm\xe2\x80\x99s resistless sway\r\nDown dropp\xe2\x80\x99d he, nerveless, and extended lay.\r\nAs a large fish, when winds and waters roar,\r\nBy some huge billow dash\xe2\x80\x99d against the shore,\r\nLies panting; not less batter\xe2\x80\x99d with his wound,\r\nThe bleeding hero pants upon the ground.\r\nTo rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,\r\nScornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;\r\nWhose arms support him, reeling through the throng,\r\nAnd dragging his disabled legs along;\r\nNodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o\xe2\x80\x99er;\r\nHis mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;292\r\nWrapp\xe2\x80\x99d round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;\r\nHis friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.\r\n\r\nThe third bold game Achilles next demands,\r\nAnd calls the wrestlers to the level sands:\r\nA massy tripod for the victor lies,\r\nOf twice six oxen its reputed price;\r\nAnd next, the loser\xe2\x80\x99s spirits to restore,\r\nA female captive, valued but at four.\r\nScarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose\r\nWhen tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.\r\nAmid the ring each nervous rival stands,\r\nEmbracing rigid with implicit hands.\r\nClose lock\xe2\x80\x99d above, their heads and arms are mix\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nBelow, their planted feet at distance fix\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nLike two strong rafters which the builder forms,\r\nProof to the wintry winds and howling storms,\r\nTheir tops connected, but at wider space\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d on the centre stands their solid base.\r\nNow to the grasp each manly body bends;\r\nThe humid sweat from every pore descends;\r\nTheir bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs\r\nSwell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.\r\nNor could Ulysses, for his art renown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;\r\nNor could the strength of Ajax overthrow\r\nThe watchful caution of his artful foe.\r\nWhile the long strife even tired the lookers on,\r\nThus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:\r\nProve we our force, and Jove the rest decree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground\r\nWith matchless strength; that time Ulysses found\r\nThe strength to evade, and where the nerves combine\r\nHis ankle struck: the giant fell supine;\r\nUlysses, following, on his bosom lies;\r\nShouts of applause run rattling through the skies.\r\nAjax to lift Ulysses next essays;\r\nHe barely stirr\xe2\x80\x99d him, but he could not raise:\r\nHis knee lock\xe2\x80\x99d fast, the foe\xe2\x80\x99s attempt denied;\r\nAnd grappling close, they tumbled side by side.\r\nDefiled with honourable dust they roll,\r\nStill breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:\r\nAgain they rage, again to combat rise;\r\nWhen great Achilles thus divides the prize:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour noble vigour, O my friends, restrain;\r\nNor weary out your generous strength in vain.\r\nYe both have won: let others who excel,\r\nNow prove that prowess you have proved so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hero\xe2\x80\x99s words the willing chiefs obey,\r\nFrom their tired bodies wipe the dust away,\r\nAnd, clothed anew, the following games survey.\r\n\r\nAnd now succeed the gifts ordain\xe2\x80\x99d to grace\r\nThe youths contending in the rapid race:\r\nA silver urn that full six measures held,\r\nBy none in weight or workmanship excell\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\nSidonian artists taught the frame to shine,\r\nElaborate, with artifice divine;\r\nWhence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,\r\nAnd gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:\r\nFrom him descended, good Eunaeus heir\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,\r\nTo brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:\r\nNow, the same hero\xe2\x80\x99s funeral rites to grace,\r\nIt stands the prize of swiftness in the race.\r\nA well-fed ox was for the second placed;\r\nAnd half a talent must content the last.\r\nAchilles rising then bespoke the train:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,\r\nStand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hero said, and starting from his place,\r\nOilean Ajax rises to the race;\r\nUlysses next; and he whose speed surpass\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nHis youthful equals, Nestor\xe2\x80\x99s son, the last.\r\nRanged in a line the ready racers stand;\r\nPelides points the barrier with his hand;\r\nAll start at once; Oileus led the race;\r\nThe next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;\r\nBehind him, diligently close, he sped,\r\nAs closely following as the running thread\r\nThe spindle follows, and displays the charms\r\nOf the fair spinster\xe2\x80\x99s breast and moving arms:\r\nGraceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,\r\nAnd treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;\r\nHis glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:\r\nThe admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise:\r\nTo him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,\r\nAnd send their souls before him as he flies.\r\nNow three times turn\xe2\x80\x99d in prospect of the goal,\r\nThe panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssist, O goddess!\xe2\x80\x9d thus in thought he pray\xe2\x80\x99d!\r\nAnd present at his thought descends the maid.\r\nBuoy\xe2\x80\x99d by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,\r\nAnd feels a pinion lifting every limb.\r\nAll fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,\r\nUnhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain\r\n(O\xe2\x80\x99erturn\xe2\x80\x99d by Pallas), where the slippery shore\r\nWas clogg\xe2\x80\x99d with slimy dung and mingled gore.\r\n(The self-same place beside Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 pyre,\r\nWhere late the slaughter\xe2\x80\x99d victims fed the fire.)\r\nBesmear\xe2\x80\x99d with filth, and blotted o\xe2\x80\x99er with clay,\r\nObscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;\r\nThe well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,\r\nAnd left the urn Ulysses\xe2\x80\x99 rich reward.\r\nThen, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,\r\nThe baffled hero thus the Greeks address\xe2\x80\x99d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccursed fate! the conquest I forego;\r\nA mortal I, a goddess was my foe;\r\nShe urged her favourite on the rapid way,\r\nAnd Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus sourly wail\xe2\x80\x99d he, sputtering dirt and gore;\r\nA burst of laughter echoed through the shore.\r\nAntilochus, more humorous than the rest,\r\nTakes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy with our wiser elders should we strive?\r\nThe gods still love them, and they always thrive.\r\nYe see, to Ajax I must yield the prize:\r\nHe to Ulysses, still more aged and wise;\r\n(A green old age unconscious of decays,\r\nThat proves the hero born in better days!)\r\nBehold his vigour in this active race!\r\nAchilles only boasts a swifter pace:\r\nFor who can match Achilles? He who can,\r\nMust yet be more than hero, more than man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy artful praise deserves a better prize.\r\nNor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nReceive a talent of the purest gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe youth departs content. The host admire\r\nThe son of Nestor, worthy of his sire.\r\n\r\nNext these a buckler, spear, and helm, he brings;\r\nCast on the plain, the brazen burden rings:\r\nArms which of late divine Sarpedon wore,\r\nAnd great Patroclus in short triumph bore.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand forth the bravest of our host!

Jupiter\r\nsends Thetis to Achilles, to dispose him for the restoring it, and Iris\r\nto Priam, to encourage him to go in person and treat for it. The old\r\nking, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen, makes ready for\r\nthe journey, to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter. He sets\r\nforth in his chariot, with a waggon loaded with presents, under the\r\ncharge of Idaeus the herald. Mercury descends in the shape of a young\r\nman, and conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles. Their conversation\r\non the way. Priam finds Achilles at his table, casts himself at his\r\nfeet, and begs for the body of his son: Achilles, moved with\r\ncompassion, grants his request, detains him one night in his tent, and\r\nthe next morning sends him home with the body: the Trojans run out to\r\nmeet him. The lamentations of Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen, with the\r\nsolemnities of the funeral.\r\n\r\nThe time of twelve days is employed in this book, while the body of\r\nHector lies in the tent of Achilles; and as many more are spent in the\r\ntruce allowed for his interment. The scene is partly in Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 camp,\r\nand partly in Troy.\r\n\r\nNow from the finish\xe2\x80\x99d games the Grecian band\r\nSeek their black ships, and clear the crowded strand,\r\nAll stretch\xe2\x80\x99d at ease the genial banquet share,\r\nAnd pleasing slumbers quiet all their care.\r\nNot so Achilles: he, to grief resign\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nHis friend\xe2\x80\x99s dear image present to his mind,\r\nTakes his sad couch, more unobserved to weep;\r\nNor tastes the gifts of all-composing sleep.\r\nRestless he roll\xe2\x80\x99d around his weary bed,\r\nAnd all his soul on his Patroclus fed:\r\nThe form so pleasing, and the heart so kind,\r\nThat youthful vigour, and that manly mind,\r\nWhat toils they shared, what martial works they wrought,\r\nWhat seas they measured, and what fields they fought;\r\nAll pass\xe2\x80\x99d before him in remembrance dear,\r\nThought follows thought, and tear succeeds to tear.\r\nAnd now supine, now prone, the hero lay,\r\nNow shifts his side, impatient for the day:\r\nThen starting up, disconsolate he goes\r\nWide on the lonely beach to vent his woes.\r\nThere as the solitary mourner raves,\r\nThe ruddy morning rises o\xe2\x80\x99er the waves:\r\nSoon as it rose, his furious steeds he join\xe2\x80\x99d!\r\nThe chariot flies, and Hector trails behind.\r\nAnd thrice, Patroclus!

For scarce of mortal kind\r\nAppear thy form, thy feature, and thy mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor true are all thy words, nor erring wide;\r\n(The sacred messenger of heaven replied;)\r\nBut say, convey\xe2\x80\x99st thou through the lonely plains\r\nWhat yet most precious of thy store remains,\r\nTo lodge in safety with some friendly hand:\r\nPrepared, perchance, to leave thy native land?\r\nOr fliest thou now?\xe2\x80\x94What hopes can Troy retain,\r\nThy matchless son, her guard and glory, slain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king, alarm\xe2\x80\x99d: \xe2\x80\x9cSay what, and whence thou art\r\nWho search the sorrows of a parent\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\nAnd know so well how godlike Hector died?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThus Priam spoke, and Hermes thus replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tempt me, father, and with pity touch:\r\nOn this sad subject you inquire too much.\r\nOft have these eyes that godlike Hector view\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nIn glorious fight, with Grecian blood embrued:\r\nI saw him when, like Jove, his flames he toss\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nOn thousand ships, and wither\xe2\x80\x99d half a host:\r\nI saw, but help\xe2\x80\x99d not: stern Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 ire\r\nForbade assistance, and enjoy\xe2\x80\x99d the fire.\r\nFor him I serve, of Myrmidonian race;\r\nOne ship convey\xe2\x80\x99d us from our native place;\r\nPolyctor is my sire, an honour\xe2\x80\x99d name,\r\nOld like thyself, and not unknown to fame;\r\nOf seven his sons, by whom the lot was cast\r\nTo serve our prince, it fell on me, the last.\r\nTo watch this quarter, my adventure falls:\r\nFor with the morn the Greeks attack your walls;\r\nSleepless they sit, impatient to engage,\r\nAnd scarce their rulers check their martial rage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf then thou art of stern Pelides\xe2\x80\x99 train,\r\n(The mournful monarch thus rejoin\xe2\x80\x99d again,)\r\nAh tell me truly, where, oh! where are laid\r\nMy son\xe2\x80\x99s dear relics? what befalls him dead?\r\nHave dogs dismember\xe2\x80\x99d (on the naked plains),\r\nOr yet unmangled rest, his cold remains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO favour\xe2\x80\x99d of the skies! (thus answered then\r\nThe power that mediates between god and men)\r\nNor dogs nor vultures have thy Hector rent,\r\nBut whole he lies, neglected in the tent:\r\nThis the twelfth evening since he rested there,\r\nUntouch\xe2\x80\x99d by worms, untainted by the air.\r\nStill as Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s ruddy beam is spread,\r\nRound his friend\xe2\x80\x99s tomb Achilles drags the dead:\r\nYet undisfigured, or in limb or face,\r\nAll fresh he lies, with every living grace,\r\nMajestical in death! No stains are found\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er all the corse, and closed is every wound,\r\nThough many a wound they gave. Some heavenly care,\r\nSome hand divine, preserves him ever fair:\r\nOr all the host of heaven, to whom he led\r\nA life so grateful, still regard him dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus spoke to Priam the celestial guide,\r\nAnd joyful thus the royal sire replied:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlest is the man who pays the gods above\r\nThe constant tribute of respect and love!\r\nThose who inhabit the Olympian bower\r\nMy son forgot not, in exalted power;\r\nAnd heaven, that every virtue bears in mind,\r\nEven to the ashes of the just is kind.\r\nBut thou, O generous youth!

and understand\r\nThou ow\xe2\x80\x99st thy guidance to no mortal hand:\r\nHermes I am, descended from above,\r\nThe king of arts, the messenger of Jove,\r\nFarewell: to shun Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 sight I fly;\r\nUncommon are such favours of the sky,\r\nNor stand confess\xe2\x80\x99d to frail mortality.\r\nNow fearless enter, and prefer thy prayers;\r\nAdjure him by his father\xe2\x80\x99s silver hairs,\r\nHis son, his mother! urge him to bestow\r\nWhatever pity that stern heart can know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus having said, he vanish\xe2\x80\x99d from his eyes,\r\nAnd in a moment shot into the skies:\r\nThe king, confirm\xe2\x80\x99d from heaven, alighted there,\r\nAnd left his aged herald on the car,\r\nWith solemn pace through various rooms he went,\r\nAnd found Achilles in his inner tent:\r\nThere sat the hero: Alcimus the brave,\r\nAnd great Automedon, attendance gave:\r\nThese served his person at the royal feast;\r\nAround, at awful distance, stood the rest.\r\n\r\nUnseen by these, the king his entry made:\r\nAnd, prostrate now before Achilles laid,\r\nSudden (a venerable sight!) appears;\r\nEmbraced his knees, and bathed his hands in tears;\r\nThose direful hands his kisses press\xe2\x80\x99d, embrued\r\nEven with the best, the dearest of his blood!\r\n\r\nAs when a wretch (who, conscious of his crime,\r\nPursued for murder, flies his native clime)\r\nJust gains some frontier, breathless, pale, amazed,\r\nAll gaze, all wonder: thus Achilles gazed:\r\nThus stood the attendants stupid with surprise:\r\nAll mute, yet seem\xe2\x80\x99d to question with their eyes:\r\nEach look\xe2\x80\x99d on other, none the silence broke,\r\nTill thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh think, thou favour\xe2\x80\x99d of the powers divine!295\r\nThink of thy father\xe2\x80\x99s age, and pity mine!\r\nIn me that father\xe2\x80\x99s reverend image trace,\r\nThose silver hairs, that venerable face;\r\nHis trembling limbs, his helpless person, see!\r\nIn all my equal, but in misery!\r\nYet now, perhaps, some turn of human fate\r\nExpels him helpless from his peaceful state;\r\nThink, from some powerful foe thou seest him fly,\r\nAnd beg protection with a feeble cry.\r\nYet still one comfort in his soul may rise;\r\nHe hears his son still lives to glad his eyes,\r\nAnd, hearing, still may hope a better day\r\nMay send him thee, to chase that foe away.\r\nNo comfort to my griefs, no hopes remain,\r\nThe best, the bravest, of my sons are slain!\r\nYet what a race! ere Greece to Ilion came,\r\nThe pledge of many a loved and loving dame:\r\nNineteen one mother bore\xe2\x80\x94Dead, all are dead!\r\nHow oft, alas! has wretched Priam bled!\r\nStill one was left their loss to recompense;\r\nHis father\xe2\x80\x99s hope, his country\xe2\x80\x99s last defence.\r\nHim too thy rage has slain! beneath thy steel,\r\nUnhappy in his country\xe2\x80\x99s cause he fell!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor him through hostile camps I bent my way,\r\nFor him thus prostrate at thy feet I lay;\r\nLarge gifts proportion\xe2\x80\x99d to thy wrath I bear;\r\nO hear the wretched, and the gods revere!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of thy father, and this face behold!\r\nSee him in me, as helpless and as old!\r\nThough not so wretched: there he yields to me,\r\nThe first of men in sovereign misery!\r\nThus forced to kneel, thus grovelling to embrace\r\nThe scourge and ruin of my realm and race;\r\nSuppliant my children\xe2\x80\x99s murderer to implore,\r\nAnd kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words soft pity in the chief inspire,\r\nTouch\xe2\x80\x99d with the dear remembrance of his sire.\r\nThen with his hand (as prostrate still he lay)\r\nThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s cheek he gently turn\xe2\x80\x99d away.\r\nNow each by turns indulged the gush of woe;\r\nAnd now the mingled tides together flow:\r\nThis low on earth, that gently bending o\xe2\x80\x99er;\r\nA father one, and one a son deplore:\r\nBut great Achilles different passions rend,\r\nAnd now his sire he mourns, and now his friend.\r\nThe infectious softness through the heroes ran;\r\nOne universal solemn shower began;\r\nThey bore as heroes, but they felt as man.\r\n\r\nSatiate at length with unavailing woes,\r\nFrom the high throne divine Achilles rose;\r\nThe reverend monarch by the hand he raised;\r\nOn his white beard and form majestic gazed,\r\nNot unrelenting; then serene began\r\nWith words to soothe the miserable man:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, what weight of anguish hast thou known,\r\nUnhappy prince! thus guardless and alone\r\nTo pass through foes, and thus undaunted face\r\nThe man whose fury has destroy\xe2\x80\x99d thy race!\r\nHeaven sure has arm\xe2\x80\x99d thee with a heart of steel,\r\nA strength proportion\xe2\x80\x99d to the woes you feel.\r\nRise, then: let reason mitigate your care:\r\nTo mourn avails not: man is born to bear.\r\nSuch is, alas! the gods\xe2\x80\x99 severe decree:\r\nThey, only they are blest, and only free.\r\nTwo urns by Jove\xe2\x80\x99s high throne have ever stood,\r\nThe source of evil one, and one of good;\r\nFrom thence the cup of mortal man he fills,\r\nBlessings to these, to those distributes ill;\r\nTo most he mingles both: the wretch decreed\r\nTo taste the bad unmix\xe2\x80\x99d, is cursed indeed;\r\nPursued by wrongs, by meagre famine driven,\r\nHe wanders, outcast both of earth and heaven.\r\nThe happiest taste not happiness sincere;\r\nBut find the cordial draught is dash\xe2\x80\x99d with care.\r\nWho more than Peleus shone in wealth and power\r\nWhat stars concurring bless\xe2\x80\x99d his natal hour!\r\nA realm, a goddess, to his wishes given;\r\nGraced by the gods with all the gifts of heaven.\r\nOne evil yet o\xe2\x80\x99ertakes his latest day:\r\nNo race succeeding to imperial sway;\r\nAn only son; and he, alas! ordain\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nTo fall untimely in a foreign land.\r\nSee him, in Troy, the pious care decline\r\nOf his weak age, to live the curse of thine!\r\nThou too, old man, hast happier days beheld;\r\nIn riches once, in children once excell\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nExtended Phrygia own\xe2\x80\x99d thy ample reign,\r\nAnd all fair Lesbos\xe2\x80\x99 blissful seats contain,\r\nAnd all wide Hellespont\xe2\x80\x99s unmeasured main.\r\nBut since the god his hand has pleased to turn,\r\nAnd fill thy measure from his bitter urn,\r\nWhat sees the sun, but hapless heroes\xe2\x80\x99 falls?\r\nWar, and the blood of men, surround thy walls!\r\nWhat must be, must be. Bear thy lot, nor shed\r\nThese unavailing sorrows o\xe2\x80\x99er the dead;\r\nThou canst not call him from the Stygian shore,\r\nBut thou, alas! may\xe2\x80\x99st live to suffer more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo whom the king: \xe2\x80\x9cO favour\xe2\x80\x99d of the skies!\r\nHere let me grow to earth! since Hector lies\r\nOn the bare beach deprived of obsequies.\r\nO give me Hector! to my eyes restore\r\nHis corse, and take the gifts: I ask no more.\r\nThou, as thou may\xe2\x80\x99st, these boundless stores enjoy;\r\nSafe may\xe2\x80\x99st thou sail, and turn thy wrath from Troy;\r\nSo shall thy pity and forbearance give\r\nA weak old man to see the light and live!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMove me no more, (Achilles thus replies,\r\nWhile kindling anger sparkled in his eyes,)\r\nNor seek by tears my steady soul to bend:\r\nTo yield thy Hector I myself intend:\r\nFor know, from Jove my goddess-mother came,\r\n(Old Ocean\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, silver-footed dame,)\r\nNor comest thou but by heaven; nor comest alone,\r\nSome god impels with courage not thy own:\r\nNo human hand the weighty gates unbarr\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nNor could the boldest of our youth have dared\r\nTo pass our outworks, or elude the guard.\r\nCease; lest, neglectful of high Jove\xe2\x80\x99s command,\r\nI show thee, king! thou tread\xe2\x80\x99st on hostile land;\r\nRelease my knees, thy suppliant arts give o\xe2\x80\x99er,\r\nAnd shake the purpose of my soul no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sire obey\xe2\x80\x99d him, trembling and o\xe2\x80\x99eraw\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nAchilles, like a lion, rush\xe2\x80\x99d abroad:\r\nAutomedon and Alcimus attend,\r\n(Whom most he honour\xe2\x80\x99d, since he lost his friend,)\r\nThese to unyoke the mules and horses went,\r\nAnd led the hoary herald to the tent;\r\nNext, heap\xe2\x80\x99d on high, the numerous presents bear,\r\n(Great Hector\xe2\x80\x99s ransom,) from the polish\xe2\x80\x99d car.\r\nTwo splendid mantles, and a carpet spread,\r\nThey leave: to cover and enwrap the dead.\r\nThen call the handmaids, with assistant toil\r\nTo wash the body and anoint with oil,\r\nApart from Priam: lest the unhappy sire,\r\nProvoked to passion, once more rouse to ire\r\nThe stern Pelides; and nor sacred age,\r\nNor Jove\xe2\x80\x99s command, should check the rising rage.\r\nThis done, the garments o\xe2\x80\x99er the corse they spread;\r\nAchilles lifts it to the funeral bed:\r\nThen, while the body on the car they laid,\r\nHe groans, and calls on loved Patroclus\xe2\x80\x99 shade:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf, in that gloom which never light must know,\r\nThe deeds of mortals touch the ghosts below,\r\nO friend! forgive me, that I thus fulfil\r\n(Restoring Hector) heaven\xe2\x80\x99s unquestion\xe2\x80\x99d will.\r\nThe gifts the father gave, be ever thine,\r\nTo grace thy manes, and adorn thy shrine.\xe2\x80\x9d296\r\n\r\nHe said, and, entering, took his seat of state;\r\nWhere full before him reverend Priam sate;\r\nTo whom, composed, the godlike chief begun:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLo! to thy prayer restored, thy breathless son;\r\nExtended on the funeral couch he lies;\r\nAnd soon as morning paints the eastern skies,\r\nThe sight is granted to thy longing eyes:\r\nBut now the peaceful hours of sacred night\r\nDemand reflection, and to rest invite:\r\nNor thou, O father! thus consumed with woe,\r\nThe common cares that nourish life forego.\r\nNot thus did Niobe, of form divine,\r\nA parent once, whose sorrows equall\xe2\x80\x99d thine:\r\nSix youthful sons, as many blooming maids,\r\nIn one sad day beheld the Stygian shades;\r\nThose by Apollo\xe2\x80\x99s silver bow were slain,\r\nThese, Cynthia\xe2\x80\x99s arrows stretch\xe2\x80\x99d upon the plain:\r\nSo was her pride chastised by wrath divine,\r\nWho match\xe2\x80\x99d her own with bright Latona\xe2\x80\x99s line;\r\nBut two the goddess, twelve the queen enjoy\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThose boasted twelve, the avenging two destroy\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nSteep\xe2\x80\x99d in their blood, and in the dust outspread,\r\nNine days, neglected, lay exposed the dead;\r\nNone by to weep them, to inhume them none;\r\n(For Jove had turn\xe2\x80\x99d the nation all to stone.)\r\nThe gods themselves, at length relenting gave\r\nThe unhappy race the honours of a grave.\r\nHerself a rock (for such was heaven\xe2\x80\x99s high will)\r\nThrough deserts wild now pours a weeping rill;\r\nWhere round the bed whence Achelous springs,\r\nThe watery fairies dance in mazy rings;\r\nThere high on Sipylus\xe2\x80\x99s shaggy brow,\r\nShe stands, her own sad monument of woe;\r\nThe rock for ever lasts, the tears for ever flow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch griefs, O king! have other parents known;\r\nRemember theirs, and mitigate thy own.\r\nThe care of heaven thy Hector has appear\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nNor shall he lie unwept, and uninterr\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nSoon may thy aged cheeks in tears be drown\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd all the eyes of Ilion stream around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said, and, rising, chose the victim ewe\r\nWith silver fleece, which his attendants slew.\r\nThe limbs they sever from the reeking hide,\r\nWith skill prepare them, and in parts divide:\r\nEach on the coals the separate morsels lays,\r\nAnd, hasty, snatches from the rising blaze.\r\nWith bread the glittering canisters they load,\r\nWhich round the board Automedon bestow\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nThe chief himself to each his portion placed,\r\nAnd each indulging shared in sweet repast.\r\nWhen now the rage of hunger was repress\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nThe wondering hero eyes his royal guest:\r\nNo less the royal guest the hero eyes,\r\nHis godlike aspect and majestic size;\r\nHere, youthful grace and noble fire engage;\r\nAnd there, the mild benevolence of age.\r\nThus gazing long, the silence neither broke,\r\n(A solemn scene!) at length the father spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me now, beloved of Jove! to steep\r\nMy careful temples in the dew of sleep:\r\nFor, since the day that number\xe2\x80\x99d with the dead\r\nMy hapless son, the dust has been my bed;\r\nSoft sleep a stranger to my weeping eyes;\r\nMy only food, my sorrows and my sighs!\r\nTill now, encouraged by the grace you give,\r\nI share thy banquet, and consent to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, Achilles bade prepare the bed,\r\nWith purple soft and shaggy carpets spread;\r\nForth, by the flaming lights, they bend their way,\r\nAnd place the couches, and the coverings lay.\r\nThen he: \xe2\x80\x9cNow, father, sleep, but sleep not here;\r\nConsult thy safety, and forgive my fear,\r\nLest any Argive, at this hour awake,\r\nTo ask our counsel, or our orders take,\r\nApproaching sudden to our open\xe2\x80\x99d tent,\r\nPerchance behold thee, and our grace prevent.\r\nShould such report thy honour\xe2\x80\x99d person here,\r\nThe king of men the ransom might defer;\r\nBut say with speed, if aught of thy desire\r\nRemains unask\xe2\x80\x99d; what time the rites require\r\nTo inter thy Hector? For, so long we stay\r\nOur slaughtering arm, and bid the hosts obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf then thy will permit (the monarch said)\r\nTo finish all due honours to the dead,\r\nThis of thy grace accord: to thee are known\r\nThe fears of Ilion, closed within her town;\r\nAnd at what distance from our walls aspire\r\nThe hills of Ide, and forests for the fire.\r\nNine days to vent our sorrows I request,\r\nThe tenth shall see the funeral and the feast;\r\nThe next, to raise his monument be given;\r\nThe twelfth we war, if war be doom\xe2\x80\x99d by heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis thy request (replied the chief) enjoy:\r\nTill then our arms suspend the fall of Troy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen gave his hand at parting, to prevent\r\nThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s fears, and turn\xe2\x80\x99d within the tent;\r\nWhere fair Briseis, bright in blooming charms,\r\nExpects her hero with desiring arms.\r\nBut in the porch the king and herald rest;\r\nSad dreams of care yet wandering in their breast.\r\nNow gods and men the gifts of sleep partake;\r\nIndustrious Hermes only was awake,\r\nThe king\xe2\x80\x99s return revolving in his mind,\r\nTo pass the ramparts, and the watch to blind.\r\nThe power descending hover\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99er his head:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd sleep\xe2\x80\x99st thou, father! (thus the vision said:)\r\nNow dost thou sleep, when Hector is restored?\r\nNor fear the Grecian foes, or Grecian lord?\r\nThy presence here should stern Atrides see,\r\nThy still surviving sons may sue for thee;\r\nMay offer all thy treasures yet contain,\r\nTo spare thy age; and offer all in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaked with the word the trembling sire arose,\r\nAnd raised his friend: the god before him goes:\r\nHe joins the mules, directs them with his hand,\r\nAnd moves in silence through the hostile land.\r\nWhen now to Xanthus\xe2\x80\x99 yellow stream they drove,\r\n(Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove,)\r\nThe winged deity forsook their view,\r\nAnd in a moment to Olympus flew.\r\nNow shed Aurora round her saffron ray,\r\nSprang through the gates of light, and gave the day:\r\nCharged with the mournful load, to Ilion go\r\nThe sage and king, majestically slow.\r\nCassandra first beholds, from Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s spire,\r\nThe sad procession of her hoary sire;\r\nThen, as the pensive pomp advanced more near,\r\n(Her breathless brother stretched upon the bier,)\r\nA shower of tears o\xe2\x80\x99erflows her beauteous eyes,\r\nAlarming thus all Ilion with her cries:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn here your steps, and here your eyes employ,\r\nYe wretched daughters, and ye sons of Troy!\r\nIf e\xe2\x80\x99er ye rush\xe2\x80\x99d in crowds, with vast delight,\r\nTo hail your hero glorious from the fight,\r\nNow meet him dead, and let your sorrows flow;\r\nYour common triumph, and your common woe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn thronging crowds they issue to the plains;\r\nNor man nor woman in the walls remains;\r\nIn every face the self-same grief is shown;\r\nAnd Troy sends forth one universal groan.\r\nAt Scaea\xe2\x80\x99s gates they meet the mourning wain,\r\nHang on the wheels, and grovel round the slain.\r\nThe wife and mother, frantic with despair,\r\nKiss his pale cheek, and rend their scatter\xe2\x80\x99d hair:\r\nThus wildly wailing, at the gates they lay;\r\nAnd there had sigh\xe2\x80\x99d and sorrow\xe2\x80\x99d out the day;\r\nBut godlike Priam from the chariot rose:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForbear (he cried) this violence of woes;\r\nFirst to the palace let the car proceed,\r\nThen pour your boundless sorrows o\xe2\x80\x99er the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waves of people at his word divide,\r\nSlow rolls the chariot through the following tide;\r\nEven to the palace the sad pomp they wait:\r\nThey weep, and place him on the bed of state.\r\nA melancholy choir attend around,\r\nWith plaintive sighs, and music\xe2\x80\x99s solemn sound:\r\nAlternately they sing, alternate flow\r\nThe obedient tears, melodious in their woe.\r\nWhile deeper sorrows groan from each full heart,\r\nAnd nature speaks at every pause of art.\r\n\r\nFirst to the corse the weeping consort flew;\r\nAround his neck her milk-white arms she threw,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd oh, my Hector! Oh, my lord! (she cries)\r\nSnatch\xe2\x80\x99d in thy bloom from these desiring eyes!\r\nThou to the dismal realms for ever gone!\r\nAnd I abandon\xe2\x80\x99d, desolate, alone!\r\nAn only son, once comfort of our pains,\r\nSad product now of hapless love, remains!\r\nNever to manly age that son shall rise,\r\nOr with increasing graces glad my eyes:\r\nFor Ilion now (her great defender slain)\r\nShall sink a smoking ruin on the plain.\r\nWho now protects her wives with guardian care?\r\nWho saves her infants from the rage of war?\r\nNow hostile fleets must waft those infants o\xe2\x80\x99er\r\n(Those wives must wait them) to a foreign shore:\r\nThou too, my son, to barbarous climes shall go,\r\nThe sad companion of thy mother\xe2\x80\x99s woe;\r\nDriven hence a slave before the victor\xe2\x80\x99s sword\r\nCondemn\xe2\x80\x99d to toil for some inhuman lord:\r\nOr else some Greek whose father press\xe2\x80\x99d the plain,\r\nOr son, or brother, by great Hector slain,\r\nIn Hector\xe2\x80\x99s blood his vengeance shall enjoy,\r\nAnd hurl thee headlong from the towers of Troy.297\r\nFor thy stern father never spared a foe:\r\nThence all these tears, and all this scene of woe!\r\nThence many evils his sad parents bore,\r\nHis parents many, but his consort more.\r\nWhy gav\xe2\x80\x99st thou not to me thy dying hand?\r\nAnd why received not I thy last command?\r\nSome word thou would\xe2\x80\x99st have spoke, which, sadly dear,\r\nMy soul might keep, or utter with a tear;\r\nWhich never, never could be lost in air,\r\nFix\xe2\x80\x99d in my heart, and oft repeated there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus to her weeping maids she makes her moan,\r\nHer weeping handmaids echo groan for groan.\r\n\r\nThe mournful mother next sustains her part:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO thou, the best, the dearest to my heart!\r\nOf all my race thou most by heaven approved,\r\nAnd by the immortals even in death beloved!\r\nWhile all my other sons in barbarous bands\r\nAchilles bound, and sold to foreign lands,\r\nThis felt no chains, but went a glorious ghost,\r\nFree, and a hero, to the Stygian coast.\r\nSentenced, \xe2\x80\x99tis true, by his inhuman doom,\r\nThy noble corse was dragg\xe2\x80\x99d around the tomb;\r\n(The tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain;)\r\nUngenerous insult, impotent and vain!\r\nYet glow\xe2\x80\x99st thou fresh with every living grace;\r\nNo mark of pain, or violence of face:\r\nRosy and fair! as Phoebus\xe2\x80\x99 silver bow\r\nDismiss\xe2\x80\x99d thee gently to the shades below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus spoke the dame, and melted into tears.\r\nSad Helen next in pomp of grief appears;\r\nFast from the shining sluices of her eyes\r\nFall the round crystal drops, while thus she cries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dearest friend! in whom the gods had join\xe2\x80\x99d298\r\nThe mildest manners with the bravest mind,\r\nNow twice ten years (unhappy years) are o\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nSince Paris brought me to the Trojan shore,\r\n(O had I perish\xe2\x80\x99d, ere that form divine\r\nSeduced this soft, this easy heart of mine!)\r\nYet was it ne\xe2\x80\x99er my fate, from thee to find\r\nA deed ungentle, or a word unkind.\r\nWhen others cursed the authoress of their woe,\r\nThy pity check\xe2\x80\x99d my sorrows in their flow.\r\nIf some proud brother eyed me with disdain,\r\nOr scornful sister with her sweeping train,\r\nThy gentle accents soften\xe2\x80\x99d all my pain.\r\nFor thee I mourn, and mourn myself in thee,\r\nThe wretched source of all this misery.\r\nThe fate I caused, for ever I bemoan;\r\nSad Helen has no friend, now thou art gone!\r\nThrough Troy\xe2\x80\x99s wide streets abandon\xe2\x80\x99d shall I roam!\r\nIn Troy deserted, as abhorr\xe2\x80\x99d at home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spoke the fair, with sorrow-streaming eye.\r\nDistressful beauty melts each stander-by.\r\nOn all around the infectious sorrow grows;\r\nBut Priam check\xe2\x80\x99d the torrent as it rose:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerform, ye Trojans! what the rites require,\r\nAnd fell the forests for a funeral pyre;\r\nTwelve days, nor foes nor secret ambush dread;\r\nAchilles grants these honours to the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d299\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FUNERAL OF HECTOR.]\r\n\r\nHe spoke, and, at his word, the Trojan train\r\nTheir mules and oxen harness to the wain,\r\nPour through the gates, and fell\xe2\x80\x99d from Ida\xe2\x80\x99s crown,\r\nRoll back the gather\xe2\x80\x99d forests to the town.\r\nThese toils continue nine succeeding days,\r\nAnd high in air a sylvan structure raise.\r\nBut when the tenth fair morn began to shine,\r\nForth to the pile was borne the man divine,\r\nAnd placed aloft; while all, with streaming eyes,\r\nBeheld the flames and rolling smokes arise.\r\nSoon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn,\r\nWith rosy lustre streak\xe2\x80\x99d the dewy lawn,\r\nAgain the mournful crowds surround the pyre,\r\nAnd quench with wine the yet remaining fire.\r\nThe snowy bones his friends and brothers place\r\n(With tears collected) in a golden vase;\r\nThe golden vase in purple palls they roll\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nOf softest texture, and inwrought with gold.\r\nLast o\xe2\x80\x99er the urn the sacred earth they spread,\r\nAnd raised the tomb, memorial of the dead.\r\n(Strong guards and spies, till all the rites were done,\r\nWatch\xe2\x80\x99d from the rising to the setting sun.)\r\nAll Troy then moves to Priam\xe2\x80\x99s court again,\r\nA solemn, silent, melancholy train:\r\nAssembled there, from pious toil they rest,\r\nAnd sadly shared the last sepulchral feast.\r\nSuch honours Ilion to her hero paid,\r\nAnd peaceful slept the mighty Hector\xe2\x80\x99s shade.300\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now passed through the Iliad, and seen the anger of Achilles,\r\nand the terrible effects of it, at an end: as that only was the subject\r\nof the poem, and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our author\r\nto proceed to the event of the war, it perhaps may be acceptable to the\r\ncommon reader to give a short account of what happened to Troy and the\r\nchief actors in this poem after the conclusion of it.\r\n\r\nI need not mention that Troy was taken soon after the death of Hector\r\nby the stratagem of the wooden horse, the particulars of which are\r\ndescribed by Virgil in the second book of the \xc3\x86neid.\r\n\r\nAchilles fell before Troy, by the hand of Paris, by the shot of an\r\narrow in his heel, as Hector had prophesied at his death, lib. xxii.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Priam was killed by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles.\r\n\r\nAjax, after the death of Achilles, had a contest with Ulysses for the\r\narmour of Vulcan, but being defeated in his aim, he slew himself\r\nthrough indignation.\r\n\r\nHelen, after the death of Paris, married Deiphobus his brother, and at\r\nthe taking of Troy betrayed him, in order to reconcile herself to\r\nMenelaus her first husband, who received her again into favour.\r\n\r\nAgamemnon at his return was barbarously murdered by \xc3\x86gysthus, at the\r\ninstigation of Clytemnestra his wife, who in his absence had\r\ndishonoured his bed with \xc3\x86gysthus.\r\n\r\nDiomed, after the fall of Troy, was expelled his own country, and\r\nscarce escaped with his life from his adulterous wife \xc3\x86giale; but at\r\nlast was received by Daunus in Apulia, and shared his kingdom; it is\r\nuncertain how he died.\r\n\r\nNestor lived in peace with his children, in Pylos, his native country.\r\n\r\nUlysses also, after innumerable troubles by sea and land, at last\r\nreturned in safety to Ithaca, which is the subject of Homer\xe2\x80\x99s Odyssey.\r\n\r\nFor what remains, I beg to be excused from the ceremonies of taking\r\nleave at the end of my work, and from embarrassing myself, or others,\r\nwith any defences or apologies about it. But instead of endeavouring to\r\nraise a vain monument to myself, of the merits or difficulties of it\r\n(which must be left to the world, to truth, and to posterity), let me\r\nleave behind me a memorial of my friendship with one of the most\r\nvaluable of men, as well as finest writers, of my age and country, one\r\nwho has tried, and knows by his own experience, how hard an undertaking\r\nit is to do justice to Homer, and one whom (I am sure) sincerely\r\nrejoices with me at the period of my labours. To him, therefore, having\r\nbrought this long work to a conclusion, I desire to dedicate it, and to\r\nhave the honour and satisfaction of placing together, in this manner,\r\nthe names of Mr. CONGREVE, and of\r\n\r\nMarch 25, 1720\r\n\r\nA.

Hence the delight when we\r\nrecognize an act of nobility or justice in our hereditary princes\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tuque prior, tu parce genus qui ducis Olympo,\r\nProjice tela manu _sanguis meus_\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo strong is this feeling, that it regains an engrafted influence even\r\nwhen history witnesses that vast convulsions have rent and weakened it\r\nand the Celtic feeling towards the Stuarts has been rekindled in our\r\nown days towards the grand daughter of George the Third of Hanover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomewhat similar may be seen in the disposition to idolize those great\r\nlawgivers of man\xe2\x80\x99s race, who have given expression, in the immortal\r\nlanguage of song, to the deeper inspirations of our nature. The\r\nthoughts of Homer or of Shakespere are the universal inheritance of the\r\nhuman race. In this mutual ground every man meets his brother, they\r\nhave been bet forth by the providence of God to vindicate for all of us\r\nwhat nature could effect, and that, in these representatives of our\r\nrace, we might recognize our common benefactors.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94_Doctrine of the\r\nIncarnation,_ pp. 9, 10.\r\n\r\n2.

I may observe that this\r\nLife has been paraphrased in English by my learned young friend Kenneth\r\nR. H. Mackenzie, and appended to my prose translation of the Odyssey.\r\nThe present abridgement however, will contain all that is of use to the\r\nreader, for the biographical value of the treatise is most\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\n3. \xe2\x80\x94_I.e._ both of composing and reciting verses for as Blair observes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first poets sang their own verses.\xe2\x80\x9d Sextus Empir. adv.

The bard was provided with a harp on which he played a\r\nprelude, to elevate and inspire his mind, and with which he accompanied\r\nthe song when begun. His voice probably preserved a medium between\r\nsinging and recitation; the words, and not the melody were regarded by\r\nthe listeners, hence it was necessary for him to remain intelligible to\r\nall. In countries where nothing similar is found, it is difficult to\r\nrepresent such scenes to the mind; but whoever has had an opportunity\r\nof listening to the improvisation of Italy, can easily form an idea of\r\nDemodocus and Phemius.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Ancient Greece,_ p. 94.\r\n\r\n4. \xe2\x80\x9cShould it not be, since _my_ arrival? asks Mackenzie, observing\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cpoplars can hardly live so long\xe2\x80\x9d. But setting aside the fact that\r\nwe must not expect consistency in a mere romance, the ancients had a\r\nsuperstitious belief in the great age of trees which grew near places\r\nconsecrated by the presence of gods and great men. See Cicero de Legg\r\nII I, sub init., where he speaks of the plane tree under which Socrates\r\nused to walk and of the tree at Delos, where Latona gave birth to\r\nApollo. This passage is referred to by Stephanus of Byzantium, _s. v._\r\nN. T. p. 490, ed. de Pinedo. I omit quoting any of the dull epigrams\r\nascribed to Homer for, as Mr. Justice Talfourd rightly observes, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nauthenticity of these fragments depends upon that of the pseudo\r\nHerodotean Life of Homer, from which they are taken.\xe2\x80\x9d Lit of Greece,\r\npp. 38 in Encycl.

In fact, whoever was the author of\r\nthis fictitious biography, he showed some tact in identifying Homer\r\nwith certain events described in his poems, and in eliciting from them\r\nthe germs of something like a personal narrative.\r\n\r\n10.

But all this is nothing to two\r\ninstances of our own day. Visiting at Naples a gentleman of the highest\r\nintellectual attainments, and who held a distinguished rank among the\r\nmen of letters in the last century, he informed us that the day before\r\nhe had passed much time in examining a man, not highly educated, who\r\nhad learned to repeat the whole Gierusalemme of Tasso, not only to\r\nrecite it consecutively, but also to repeat those stanzas in utter\r\ndefiance of the sense, either forwards or backwards, or from the eighth\r\nline to the first, alternately the odd and even lines\xe2\x80\x94in short,\r\nwhatever the passage required; the memory, which seemed to cling to the\r\nwords much more than to the sense, had it at such perfect command, that\r\nit could produce it under any form. Our informant went on to state that\r\nthis singular being was proceeding to learn the Orlando Furioso in the\r\nsame manner. But even this instance is less wonderful than one as to\r\nwhich we may appeal to any of our readers that happened some twenty\r\nyears ago to visit the town of Stirling, in Scotland. No such person\r\ncan have forgotten the poor, uneducated man Blind Jamie who could\r\nactually repeat, after a few minutes consideration any verse required\r\nfrom any part of the Bible\xe2\x80\x94even the obscurest and most unimportant\r\nenumeration of mere proper names not excepted. We do not mention these\r\nfacts as touching the more difficult part of the question before us,\r\nbut facts they are; and if we find so much difficulty in calculating\r\nthe extent to which the mere memory may be cultivated, are we, in these\r\ndays of multifarious reading, and of countless distracting affairs,\r\nfair judges of the perfection to which the invention and the memory\r\ncombined may attain in a simpler age, and among a more single minded\r\npeople?\xe2\x80\x94Quarterly Review, _l. c.,_ p. 143, sqq.\r\n\r\nHeeren steers between the two opinions, observing that, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nDschungariade of the Calmucks is said to surpass the poems of Homer in\r\nlength, as much as it stands beneath them in merit, and yet it exists\r\nonly in the memory of a people which is not unacquainted with writing.\r\nBut the songs of a nation are probably the last things which are\r\ncommitted to writing, for the very reason that they are remembered.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n_Ancient Greece._ p. 100.\r\n\r\n26.

The following argument of the Iliad, corrected in a few\r\nparticulars, is translated from Bitaube, and is, perhaps, the neatest\r\nsummary that has ever been drawn up:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cA hero, injured by his general,\r\nand animated with a noble resentment, retires to his tent; and for a\r\nseason withdraws himself and his troops from the war. During this\r\ninterval, victory abandons the army, which for nine years has been\r\noccupied in a great enterprise, upon the successful termination of\r\nwhich the honour of their country depends. The general, at length\r\nopening his eyes to the fault which he had committed, deputes the\r\nprincipal officers of his army to the incensed hero, with commission to\r\nmake compensation for the injury, and to tender magnificent presents.\r\nThe hero, according to the proud obstinacy of his character, persists\r\nin his animosity; the army is again defeated, and is on the verge of\r\nentire destruction. This inexorable man has a friend; this friend weeps\r\nbefore him, and asks for the hero\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and for permission to go to\r\nthe war in his stead. The eloquence of friendship prevails more than\r\nthe intercession of the ambassadors or the gifts of the general. He\r\nlends his armour to his friend, but commands him not to engage with the\r\nchief of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s army, because he reserves to himself the honour of\r\nthat combat, and because he also fears for his friend\xe2\x80\x99s life. The\r\nprohibition is forgotten; the friend listens to nothing but his\r\ncourage; his corpse is brought back to the hero, and the hero\xe2\x80\x99s arms\r\nbecome the prize of the conqueror. Then the hero, given up to the most\r\nlively despair, prepares to fight; he receives from a divinity new\r\narmour, is reconciled with his general and, thirsting for glory and\r\nrevenge, enacts prodigies of valour, recovers the victory, slays the\r\nenemy\xe2\x80\x99s chief, honours his friend with superb funeral rites, and\r\nexercises a cruel vengeance on the body of his destroyer; but finally\r\nappeased by the tears and prayers of the father of the slain warrior,\r\nrestores to the old man the corpse of his son, which he buries with due\r\nsolemnities.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Coleridge, p. 177, sqq.\r\n\r\n41. Vultures: Pope is more accurate than the poet he translates, for\r\nHomer writes \xe2\x80\x9ca prey to dogs and to _all_ kinds of birds.

Strabo, however, says, that\r\nwhen the Teucri were migrating from Crete, they were told by an oracle\r\nto settle in that place, where they should not be attacked by the\r\noriginal inhabitants of the land, and that, having halted for the\r\nnight, a number of field-mice came and gnawed away the leathern straps\r\nof their baggage, and thongs of their armour. In fulfilment of the\r\noracle, they settled on the spot, and raised a temple to Sminthean\r\nApollo. Grote, \xe2\x80\x9cHistory of Greece,\xe2\x80\x9d i. p. 68, remarks that the \xe2\x80\x9cworship\r\nof Sminthean Apollo, in various parts of the Troad and its neighboring\r\nterritory, dates before the earliest period of Aeolian colonization.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n48. \xe2\x80\x94_Cilla,_ a town of Troas near Thebe, so called from Cillus, a\r\nsister of Hippodamia, slain by OEnomaus.\r\n\r\n49. A mistake. It should be,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf e\xe2\x80\x99er I roofed thy graceful fane,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nfor the custom of decorating temples with garlands was of later date.\r\n\r\n50. \xe2\x80\x94_Bent was his bow_ \xe2\x80\x9cThe Apollo of Homer, it must be borne in mind,\r\nis a different character from the deity of the same name in the later\r\nclassical pantheon. Throughout both poems, all deaths from unforeseen\r\nor invisible causes, the ravages of pestilence, the fate of the young\r\nchild or promising adult, cut off in the germ of infancy or flower of\r\nyouth, of the old man dropping peacefully into the grave, or of the\r\nreckless sinner suddenly checked in his career of crime, are ascribed\r\nto the arrows of Apollo or Diana. The oracular functions of the god\r\nrose naturally out of the above fundamental attributes, for who could\r\nmore appropriately impart to mortals what little foreknowledge Fate\r\npermitted of her decrees than the agent of her most awful\r\ndispensations? The close union of the arts of prophecy and song\r\nexplains his additional office of god of music, while the arrows with\r\nwhich he and his sister were armed, symbols of sudden death in every\r\nage, no less naturally procured him that of god of archery. Of any\r\nconnection between Apollo and the Sun, whatever may have existed in the\r\nmore esoteric doctrine of the Greek sanctuaries, there is no trace in\r\neither Iliad or Odyssey.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mure, \xe2\x80\x9cHistory of Greek Literature,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. i.\r\np. 478, sq.\r\n\r\n51. It has frequently been observed, that most pestilences begin with\r\nanimals, and that Homer had this fact in mind.\r\n\r\n52. \xe2\x80\x94_Convened to council._ The public assembly in the heroic times is\r\nwell characterized by Grote, vol. ii. p 92. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an assembly for\r\ntalk.

Old Jacob Duport, whose \xe2\x80\x9cGnomologia Homerica\xe2\x80\x9d is full of curious\r\nand useful things, quotes several passages of the ancients, in which\r\nreference is made to these words of Homer, in maintenance of the belief\r\nthat dreams had a divine origin and an import in which men were\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n54. Rather, \xe2\x80\x9cbright-eyed.\xe2\x80\x9d See the German critics quoted by Arnold.\r\n\r\n55. The prize given to Ajax was Tecmessa, while Ulysses received\r\nLaodice, the daughter of Cycnus.\r\n\r\n56. The Myrmidons dwelt on the southern borders of Thessaly, and took\r\ntheir origin from Myrmido, son of Jupiter and Eurymedusa. It is\r\nfancifully supposed that the name was derived from myrmaex, an _ant,_\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause they imitated the diligence of the ants, and like them were\r\nindefatigable, continually employed in cultivating the earth; the\r\nchange from ants to men is founded merely on the equivocation of their\r\nname, which resembles that of the ant: they bore a further resemblance\r\nto these little animals, in that instead of inhabiting towns or\r\nvillages, at first they commonly resided in the open fields, having no\r\nother retreats but dens and the cavities of trees, until Ithacus\r\nbrought them together, and settled them in more secure and comfortable\r\nhabitations.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Anthon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLempriere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n57. Eustathius, after Heraclides Ponticus and others, allegorizes this\r\napparition, as if the appearance of Minerva to Achilles, unseen by the\r\nrest, was intended to point out the sudden recollection that he would\r\ngain nothing by intemperate wrath, and that it were best to restrain\r\nhis anger, and only gratify it by withdrawing his services. The same\r\nidea is rather cleverly worked out by Apuleius, \xe2\x80\x9cDe Deo Socratis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n58. Compare Milton, \xe2\x80\x9cParadise Lost,\xe2\x80\x9d bk. ii:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough his tongue\r\nDropp\xe2\x80\x99d manna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Proverbs v. 3, \xe2\x80\x9cFor the lips of a strange woman drop as an\r\nhoney-comb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n59. Salt water was chiefly used in lustrations, from its being supposed\r\nto possess certain fiery particles.

His mother, Thetis, the daughter of Nereus and Doris, who was\r\ncourted by Neptune and Jupiter. When, however, it was known that the\r\nson to whom she would give birth must prove greater than his father, it\r\nwas determined to wed her to a mortal, and Peleus, with great\r\ndifficulty, succeeded in obtaining her hand, as she eluded him by\r\nassuming various forms. Her children were all destroyed by fire through\r\nher attempts to see whether they were immortal, and Achilles would have\r\nshared the same fate had not his father rescued him. She afterwards\r\nrendered him invulnerable by plunging him into the waters of the Styx,\r\nwith the exception of that part of the heel by which she held him.\r\nHygin. Fab. 54\r\n\r\n62. Thebe was a city of Mysia, north of Adramyttium.\r\n\r\n63. That is, defrauds me of the prize allotted me by their votes.\r\n\r\n64.

It has been observed that the annual procession of the sacred ship\r\nso often represented on Egyptian monuments, and the return of the deity\r\nfrom Ethiopia after some days\xe2\x80\x99 absence, serves to show the Ethiopian\r\norigin of Thebes, and of the worship of Jupiter Ammon. \xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nHeeren, after quoting a passage from Diodorus about the holy ship,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat this procession is represented in one of the great sculptured\r\nreliefs on the temple of Karnak. The sacred ship of Ammon is on the\r\nshore with its whole equipment, and is towed along by another boat. It\r\nis therefore on its voyage. This must have been one of the most\r\ncelebrated festivals, since, even according to the interpretation of\r\nantiquity, Homer alludes to it when he speaks of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the\r\nEthiopians, and his twelve days\xe2\x80\x99 absence.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Long, \xe2\x80\x9cEgyptian Antiquities\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nvol. 1 p. 96.

Those who beheld this\r\nstatue are said to have been so struck with it as to have asked whether\r\nJupiter had descended from heaven to show himself to Phidias, or\r\nwhether Phidias had been carried thither to contemplate the god.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElgin Marbles,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. xii p.124.\r\n\r\n71.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo was his will\r\nPronounced among the gods, and by an oath,\r\nThat shook heav\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s whole circumference, confirm\xe2\x80\x99d.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParadise Lost\xe2\x80\x9d ii. 351.\r\n\r\n72. \xe2\x80\x94_A double bowl, i.e._ a vessel with a cup at both ends, something\r\nlike the measures by which a halfpenny or pennyworth of nuts is sold.\r\nSee Buttmann, Lexic. p. 93 sq.\r\n\r\n73.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParadise Lost,\xe2\x80\x9d i. 44.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim th\xe2\x80\x99 Almighty power\r\nHurl\xe2\x80\x99d headlong flaming from th ethereal sky,\r\nWith hideous ruin and combustion\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n74. The occasion on which Vulcan incurred Jove\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure was\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94After Hercules, had taken and pillaged Troy, Juno raised a storm,\r\nwhich drove him to the island of Cos, having previously cast Jove into\r\na sleep, to prevent him aiding his son. Jove, in revenge, fastened iron\r\nanvils to her feet, and hung her from the sky, and Vulcan, attempting\r\nto relieve her, was kicked down from Olympus in the manner described.\r\nThe allegorists have gone mad in finding deep explanations for this\r\namusing fiction. See Heraclides, \xe2\x80\x9cPonticus,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 463 sq., ed Gale. The\r\nstory is told by Homer himself in Book xv. The Sinthians were a race of\r\nrobbers, the ancient inhabitants of Lemnos which island was ever after\r\nsacred to Vulcan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor was his name unheard or unadored\r\nIn ancient Greece, and in Ausonian land\r\nMen call\xe2\x80\x99d him Mulciber, and how he fell\r\nFrom heaven, they fabled, thrown by angry Jove\r\nSheer o\xe2\x80\x99er the crystal battlements from morn\r\nTo noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,\r\nA summer\xe2\x80\x99s day and with the setting sun\r\nDropp\xe2\x80\x99d from the zenith like a falling star\r\nOn Lemnos, th\xe2\x80\x99 Aegean isle thus they relate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParadise Lost,\xe2\x80\x9d i. 738\r\n\r\n75. It is ingeniously observed by Grote, vol i p. 463, that \xe2\x80\x9cThe gods\r\nformed a sort of political community of their own which had its\r\nhierarchy, its distribution of ranks and duties, its contentions for\r\npower and occasional revolutions, its public meetings in the agora of\r\nOlympus, and its multitudinous banquets or festivals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n76. Plato, Rep. iii. p. 437, was so scandalized at this deception of\r\nJupiter\xe2\x80\x99s, and at his other attacks on the character of the gods, that\r\nhe would fain sentence him to an honourable banishment. (See Minucius\r\nFelix, Section 22.) Coleridge, Introd. p. 154, well observes, that the\r\nsupreme father of gods and men had a full right to employ a lying\r\nspirit to work out his ultimate will.

Xviii. 246) an evening\r\nagora, to which men came elevated by wine, is also the forerunner of\r\nmischief (\xe2\x80\x98Odyssey,\xe2\x80\x99 iii. 138).\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Grote, ii. p. 91, _note._\r\n\r\n83.

This sentiment used to be a popular one with some of the greatest\r\ntyrants, who abused it into a pretext for unlimited usurpation of\r\npower. Dion, Caligula, and Domitian were particularly fond of it, and,\r\nin an extended form, we find the maxim propounded by Creon in the\r\nAntigone of Sophocles. See some important remarks of Heeren, \xe2\x80\x9cAncient\r\nGreece,\xe2\x80\x9d ch. vi. p. 105.\r\n\r\n87. It may be remarked, that the character of Thersites, revolting and\r\ncontemptible as it is, serves admirably to develop the disposition of\r\nUlysses in a new light, in which mere cunning is less prominent. Of the\r\ngradual and individual development of Homer\xe2\x80\x99s heroes, Schlegel well\r\nobserves, \xe2\x80\x9cIn bas-relief the figures are usually in profile, and in the\r\nepos all are characterized in the simplest manner in relief; they are\r\nnot grouped together, but follow one another; so Homer\xe2\x80\x99s heroes\r\nadvance, one by one, in succession before us. It has been remarked that\r\nthe _Iliad_ is not definitively closed, but that we are left to suppose\r\nsomething both to precede and to follow it. The bas-relief is equally\r\nwithout limit, and may be continued _ad infinitum,_ either from before\r\nor behind, on which account the ancients preferred for it such subjects\r\nas admitted of an indefinite extension, sacrificial processions,\r\ndances, and lines of combatants, and hence they also exhibit\r\nbas-reliefs on curved surfaces, such as vases, or the frieze of a\r\nrotunda, where, by the curvature, the two ends are withdrawn from our\r\nsight, and where, while we advance, one object appears as another\r\ndisappears. Reading Homer is very much like such a circuit; the present\r\nobject alone arresting our attention, we lose sight of what precedes,\r\nand do not concern ourselves about what is to follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDramatic\r\nLiterature,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 75.\r\n\r\n88. \xe2\x80\x9cThere cannot be a clearer indication than this description \xe2\x80\x94so\r\ngraphic in the original poem\xe2\x80\x94of the true character of the Homeric\r\nagora. The multitude who compose it are listening and acquiescent, not\r\noften hesitating, and never refractory to the chief. The fate which\r\nawaits a presumptuous critic, even where his virulent reproaches are\r\nsubstantially well-founded, is plainly set forth in the treatment of\r\nThersites; while the unpopularity of such a character is attested even\r\nmore by the excessive pains which Homer takes to heap upon him\r\nrepulsive personal deformities, than by the chastisement of Odysseus he\r\nis lame, bald, crook-backed, of misshapen head, and squinting\r\nvision.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Grote, vol. i. p. 97.\r\n\r\n89. According to Pausanias, both the sprig and the remains of the tree\r\nwere exhibited in his time. The tragedians, Lucretius and others,\r\nadopted a different fable to account for the stoppage at Aulis, and\r\nseem to have found the sacrifice of Iphigena better suited to form the\r\nsubject of a tragedy. Compare Dryden\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\x86neid,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. iii. sqq.\r\n\r\n90. \xe2\x80\x94_Full of his god, i.e.,_ Apollo, filled with the prophetic spirit.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_The_ god\xe2\x80\x9d would be more simple and emphatic.\r\n\r\n91. Those critics who have maintained that the \xe2\x80\x9cCatalogue of Ships\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nan interpolation, should have paid more attention to these lines, which\r\nform a most natural introduction to their enumeration.\r\n\r\n92. The following observation will be useful to Homeric readers:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParticular animals were, at a later time, consecrated to particular\r\ndeities. To Jupiter, Ceres, Juno, Apollo, and Bacchus victims of\r\nadvanced age might be offered. An ox of five years old was considered\r\nespecially acceptable to Jupiter. A black bull, a ram, or a boar pig,\r\nwere offerings for Neptune. A heifer, or a sheep, for Minerva. To Ceres\r\na sow was sacrificed, as an enemy to corn. The goat to Bacchus, because\r\nhe fed on vines. Diana was propitiated with a stag; and to Venus the\r\ndove was consecrated. The infernal and evil deities were to be appeased\r\nwith black victims. The most acceptable of all sacrifices was the\r\nheifer of a year old, which had never borne the yoke. It was to be\r\nperfect in every limb, healthy, and without blemish.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cElgin Marbles,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nvol. i. p. 78.\r\n\r\n93. \xe2\x80\x94_Idomeneus,_ son of Deucalion, was king of Crete. Having vowed,\r\nduring a tempest, on his return from Troy, to sacrifice to Neptune the\r\nfirst creature that should present itself to his eye on the Cretan\r\nshore, his son fell a victim to his rash vow.\r\n\r\n94. \xe2\x80\x94_Tydeus\xe2\x80\x99 son, i.e._ Diomed.\r\n\r\n95. That is, Ajax, the son of Oileus, a Locrian. He must be\r\ndistinguished from the other, who was king of Salamis.\r\n\r\n96. A great deal of nonsense has been written to account for the word\r\n_unbid,_ in this line. Even Plato, \xe2\x80\x9cSympos.\xe2\x80\x9d p. 315, has found some\r\ncurious meaning in what, to us, appears to need no explanation. Was\r\nthere any _heroic_ rule of etiquette which prevented one brother-king\r\nvisiting another without a formal invitation?\r\n\r\n97. Fresh water fowl, especially swans, were found in great numbers\r\nabout the Asian Marsh, a fenny tract of country in Lydia, formed by the\r\nriver Cayster, near its mouth. See Virgil, \xe2\x80\x9cGeorgics,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. i. 383, sq.\r\n\r\n98. \xe2\x80\x94_Scamander,_ or Scamandros, was a river of Troas, rising,\r\naccording to Strabo, on the highest part of Mount Ida, in the same hill\r\nwith the Granicus and the OEdipus, and falling into the sea at Sigaeum;\r\neverything tends to identify it with Mendere, as Wood, Rennell, and\r\nothers maintain; the Mendere is 40 miles long, 300 feet broad, deep in\r\nthe time of flood, nearly dry in the summer. Dr. Clarke successfully\r\ncombats the opinion of those who make the Scamander to have arisen from\r\nthe springs of Bounabarshy, and traces the source of the river to the\r\nhighest mountain in the chain of Ida, now Kusdaghy; receives the Simois\r\nin its course; towards its mouth it is very muddy, and flows through\r\nmarshes. Between the Scamander and Simois, Homer\xe2\x80\x99s Troy is supposed to\r\nhave stood: this river, according to Homer, was called Xanthus by the\r\ngods, Scamander by men. The waters of the Scamander had the singular\r\nproperty of giving a beautiful colour to the hair or wool of such\r\nanimals as bathed in them; hence the three goddesses, Minerva, Juno,\r\nand Venus, bathed there before they appeared before Paris to obtain the\r\ngolden apple: the name Xanthus, \xe2\x80\x9cyellow,\xe2\x80\x9d was given to the Scamander,\r\nfrom the peculiar colour of its waters, still applicable to the\r\nMendere, the yellow colour of whose waters attracts the attention of\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\n99. It should be \xe2\x80\x9chis _chest_ like Neptune.\xe2\x80\x9d The torso of Neptune, in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cElgin Marbles,\xe2\x80\x9d No. 103, (vol. ii. p. 26,) is remarkable for its\r\nbreadth and massiveness of development.\r\n\r\n100.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay first, for heav\xe2\x80\x99n hides nothing from thy view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cParadise Lost,\xe2\x80\x9d i. 27.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa di\xe2\x80\x99 tu, Musa, come i primi danni\r\nMandassero a Cristiani, e di quai parti:\r\nTu \xe2\x80\x99l sai; ma di tant\xe2\x80\x99 opra a noi si lunge\r\nDebil aura di fama appena giunge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGier.

The composition of\r\nthe Catalogue, whensoever it may have taken place, necessarily presumes\r\nits author\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance with a previously existing Iliad. It were\r\nimpossible otherwise to account for the harmony observable in the\r\nrecurrence of so vast a number of proper names, most of them\r\nhistorically unimportant, and not a few altogether fictitious: or of so\r\nmany geographical and genealogical details as are condensed in these\r\nfew hundred lines, and incidentally scattered over the thousands which\r\nfollow: equally inexplicable were the pointed allusions occurring in\r\nthis episode to events narrated in the previous and subsequent text,\r\nseveral of which could hardly be of traditional notoriety, but through\r\nthe medium of the Iliad.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mure, \xe2\x80\x9cLanguage and Literature of Greece,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nvol. i. p. 263.\r\n\r\n102. \xe2\x80\x94_Twice Sixty:_ \xe2\x80\x9cThucydides observes that the Boeotian vessels,\r\nwhich carried one hundred and twenty men each, were probably meant to\r\nbe the largest in the fleet, and those of Philoctetes, carrying fifty\r\neach, the smallest. The average would be eighty-five, and Thucydides\r\nsupposes the troops to have rowed and navigated themselves; and that\r\nvery few, besides the chiefs, went as mere passengers or landsmen. In\r\nshort, we have in the Homeric descriptions the complete picture of an\r\nIndian or African war canoe, many of which are considerably larger than\r\nthe largest scale assigned to those of the Greeks. If the total number\r\nof the Greek ships be taken at twelve hundred, according to Thucydides,\r\nalthough in point of fact there are only eleven hundred and eighty-six\r\nin the Catalogue, the amount of the army, upon the foregoing average,\r\nwill be about a hundred and two thousand men. The historian considers\r\nthis a small force as representing all Greece. Bryant, comparing it\r\nwith the allied army at Platae, thinks it so large as to prove the\r\nentire falsehood of the whole story; and his reasonings and\r\ncalculations are, for their curiosity, well worth a careful\r\nperusal.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Coleridge, p. 211, sq.\r\n\r\n103. The mention of Corinth is an anachronism, as that city was called\r\nEphyre before its capture by the Dorians. But Velleius, vol. i. p. 3,\r\nwell observes, that the poet would naturally speak of various towns and\r\ncities by the names by which they were known in his own time.\r\n\r\n104.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam, the goodliest man of men since born,\r\nHis sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cParadise Lost,\xe2\x80\x9d iv. 323.\r\n\r\n105. \xe2\x80\x94_\xc3\x86setes\xe2\x80\x99 tomb._ Monuments were often built on the sea-coast, and\r\nof a considerable height, so as to serve as watch-towers or land marks.\r\nSee my notes to my prose translations of the \xe2\x80\x9cOdyssey,\xe2\x80\x9d ii. p. 21, or\r\non Eur. \xe2\x80\x9cAlcest.\xe2\x80\x9d vol. i. p. 240.\r\n\r\n106. \xe2\x80\x94_Zeleia,_ another name for Lycia.

The early epic was largely occupied with the exploits and\r\nsufferings of women, or heroines, the wives and daughters of the\r\nGrecian heroes. A nation of courageous, hardy, indefatigable women,\r\ndwelling apart from men, permitting only a short temporary intercourse,\r\nfor the purpose of renovating their numbers, burning out their right\r\nbreast with a view of enabling themselves to draw the bow freely; this\r\nwas at once a general type, stimulating to the fancy of the poet, and a\r\ntheme eminently popular with his hearers. We find these warlike females\r\nconstantly reappearing in the ancient poems, and universally accepted\r\nas past realities in the Iliad. When Priam wishes to illustrate\r\nemphatically the most numerous host in which he ever found himself\r\nincluded, he tells us that it was assembled in Phrygia, on the banks of\r\nthe Sangarius, for the purpose of resisting the formidable Amazons.\r\nWhen Bellerophon is to be employed in a deadly and perilous\r\nundertaking, by those who prudently wished to procure his death, he is\r\ndespatched against the Amazons.\xe2\x80\x94Grote, vol. i p. 289.\r\n\r\n115. \xe2\x80\x94_Antenor,_ like \xc3\x86neas, had always been favourable to the\r\nrestoration of Helen.

Where,\r\nfor example, one or more heroes are despatched on some commission, to\r\nbe executed at a certain distance of time or place, the fulfilment of\r\nthis task is not, as a general rule, immediately described. A certain\r\ninterval is allowed them for reaching the appointed scene of action,\r\nwhich interval is dramatised, as it were, either by a temporary\r\ncontinuation of the previous narrative, or by fixing attention for a\r\nwhile on some new transaction, at the close of which the further\r\naccount of the mission is resumed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n168. \xe2\x80\x94_With tablets sealed._ These probably were only devices of a\r\nhieroglyphical character.

No interposition takes place but on the part of the specially\r\nauthorised agents of Jove, or on that of one or two contumacious\r\ndeities, described as boldly setting his commands at defiance, but\r\nchecked and reprimanded for their disobedience; while the other divine\r\nwarriors, who in the previous and subsequent cantos are so active in\r\nsupport of their favourite heroes, repeatedly allude to the supreme\r\nedict as the cause of their present inactivity.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mure, vol. i. p 257.\r\nSee however, Muller, \xe2\x80\x9cGreek Literature,\xe2\x80\x9d ch. v.

Lib. i. 7.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of the epithets which Homer applies to the heavens seem to imply\r\nthat he considered it as a solid vault of metal. But it is not\r\nnecessary to construe these epithets so literally, nor to draw any such\r\ninference from his description of Atlas, who holds the lofty pillars\r\nwhich keep earth and heaven asunder. Yet it would seem, from the manner\r\nin which the height of heaven is compared with the depth of Tartarus,\r\nthat the region of light was thought to have certain bounds. The summit\r\nof the Thessalian Olympus was regarded as the highest point on the\r\nearth, and it is not always carefully distinguished from the aerian\r\nregions above The idea of a seat of the gods\xe2\x80\x94perhaps derived from a\r\nmore ancient tradition, in which it was not attached to any\r\ngeographical site\xe2\x80\x94seems to be indistinctly blended in the poet\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nwith that of the real mountain.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Thirlwall\xe2\x80\x99s Greece, vol. i. p. 217,\r\nsq.\r\n\r\n191.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow lately heav\xe2\x80\x99n, earth, another world\r\nHung e\xe2\x80\x99er my realm, link\xe2\x80\x99d in a golden chain\r\nTo that side heav\xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cParadise Lost,\xe2\x80\x9d ii. 1004.\r\n\r\n192.\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_His golden scales._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJove now, sole arbiter of peace and war,\r\nHeld forth the fatal balance from afar:\r\nEach host he weighs; by turns they both prevail,\r\nTill Troy descending fix\xe2\x80\x99d the doubtful scale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerrick\xe2\x80\x99s Tryphiodorus, v 687, sqq.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,\r\nHung forth in heav\xe2\x80\x99n his golden scales,\r\nWherein all things created first he weighed;\r\nThe pendulous round earth, with balanced air\r\nIn counterpoise; now ponders all events,\r\nBattles and realms.

This flight of the Greeks, according to Buttmann, Lexil. p. 358,\r\nwas not a supernatural flight caused by the gods, but \xe2\x80\x9ca great and\r\ngeneral one, caused by Hector and the Trojans, but with the approval of\r\nJove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n200. Grote, vol. ii. p. 91, after noticing the modest calmness and\r\nrespect with which Nestor addresses Agamemnon, observes, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Homeric\r\nCouncil is a purely consultative body, assembled not with any power of\r\nperemptorily arresting mischievous resolves of the king, but solely for\r\nhis information and guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n201. In the heroic times, it is not unfrequent for the king to receive\r\npresents to purchase freedom from his wrath, or immunity from his\r\nexactions. Such gifts gradually became regular, and formed the income\r\nof the German, (Tacit. Germ. Section 15) Persian, (Herodot. iii.89),\r\nand other kings. So, too, in the middle ages, \xe2\x80\x98The feudal aids are the\r\nbeginning of taxation, of which they for a long time answered the\r\npurpose.\xe2\x80\x99 (Hallam, Middle Ages, ch. x. pt. 1, p. 189) This fact frees\r\nAchilles from the apparent charge of sordidness. Plato, however, (De\r\nRep. vi. 4), says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot commend Phoenix, the tutor of Achilles,\r\nas if he spoke correctly, when counselling him to accept of presents\r\nand assist the Greeks, but, without presents, not to desist from his\r\nwrath, nor again, should we commend Achilles himself, or approve of his\r\nbeing so covetous as to receive presents from Agamemnon,\xe2\x80\x9d &c.\r\n\r\n202. It may be observed, that, brief as is the mention of Briseis in\r\nthe Iliad, and small the part she plays\xe2\x80\x94what little is said is\r\npre-eminently calculated to enhance her fitness to be the bride of\r\nAchilles. Purity, and retiring delicacy, are features well contrasted\r\nwith the rough, but tender disposition of the hero.\r\n\r\n203. \xe2\x80\x94_Laodice._ Iphianassa, or Iphigenia, is not mentioned by Homer,\r\namong the daughters of Agamemnon.\r\n\r\n204. \xe2\x80\x9cAgamemnon, when he offers to transfer to Achilles seven towns\r\ninhabited by wealthy husbandmen, who would enrich their lord by\r\npresents and tribute, seems likewise to assume rather a property in\r\nthem, than an authority over them. And the same thing may be intimated\r\nwhen it is said that Peleus bestowed a great people, the Dolopes of\r\nPhthia, on Phoenix.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Thirlwall\xe2\x80\x99s Greece, vol. i Section 6, p. 162,\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n205. \xe2\x80\x94_Pray in deep silence._ Rather: \xe2\x80\x9cuse well-omened words;\xe2\x80\x9d or, as\r\nKennedy has explained it, \xe2\x80\x9cAbstain from expressions unsuitable to the\r\nsolemnity of the occasion, which, by offending the god, might defeat\r\nthe object of their supplications.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n206. \xe2\x80\x94_Purest hands._ This is one of the most ancient superstitions\r\nrespecting prayer, and one founded as much in nature as in tradition.\r\n\r\n207. It must be recollected, that the war at Troy was not a settled\r\nsiege, and that many of the chieftains busied themselves in piratical\r\nexpeditions about its neighborhood. Such a one was that of which\r\nAchilles now speaks. From the following verses, it is evident that\r\nfruits of these maraudings went to the common support of the\r\nexpedition, and not to the successful plunderer.\r\n\r\n208. \xe2\x80\x94_Pythia,_ the capital of Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 Thessalian domains.\r\n\r\n209. \xe2\x80\x94_Orchomenian town._ The topography of Orchomenus, in Boeotia,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csituated,\xe2\x80\x9d as it was, \xe2\x80\x9con the northern bank of the lake \xc3\x86pais, which\r\nreceives not only the river Cephisus from the valleys of Phocis, but\r\nalso other rivers from Parnassus and Helicon\xe2\x80\x9d (Grote, vol. p. 181), was\r\na sufficient reason for its prosperity and decay. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as the\r\nchannels of these waters were diligently watched and kept clear, a\r\nlarge portion of the lake was in the condition of alluvial land,\r\npre-eminently rich and fertile. But when the channels came to be either\r\nneglected, or designedly choked up by an enemy, the water accumulated\r\nin such a degree as to occupy the soil of more than one ancient islet,\r\nand to occasion the change of the site of Orchomenus itself from the\r\nplain to the declivity of Mount Hyphanteion.\xe2\x80\x9d (Ibid.)\r\n\r\n210. The phrase \xe2\x80\x9chundred gates,\xe2\x80\x9d &c., seems to be merely expressive of\r\na great number. See notes to my prose translation, p. 162.\r\n\r\n211.

There is a most elegant tribute to his memory in the\r\nPreface to the Heroica of Philostratus.\r\n\r\n243. \xe2\x80\x94_His best beloved._ The following elegant remarks of Thirlwall\r\n(Greece, vol. i, p. 176 seq.) well illustrate the character of the\r\nfriendship subsisting between these two heroes\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the noblest and most amiable sides of the Greek character, is\r\nthe readiness with which it lent itself to construct intimate and\r\ndurable friendships, and this is a feature no less prominent in the\r\nearliest than in later times. It was indeed connected with the\r\ncomparatively low estimation in which female society was held; but the\r\ndevotedness and constancy with which these attachments were maintained,\r\nwas not the less admirable and engaging. The heroic companions whom we\r\nfind celebrated partly by Homer and partly in traditions which, if not\r\nof equal antiquity, were grounded on the same feeling, seem to have but\r\none heart and soul, with scarcely a wish or object apart, and only to\r\nlive as they are always ready to die for one another. It is true that\r\nthe relation between them is not always one of perfect equality; but\r\nthis is a circumstance which, while it often adds a peculiar charm to\r\nthe poetical description, detracts little from the dignity of the idea\r\nwhich it presents. Such were the friendships of Hercules and Iolaus, of\r\nTheseus and Pirithous, of Orestes and Pylades; and though These may owe\r\nthe greater part of their fame to the later epic or even dramatic\r\npoetry, the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the period to\r\nwhich the traditions are referred. The argument of the Iliad mainly\r\nturns on the affection of Achilles for Patroclus, whose love for the\r\ngreater hero is only tempered by reverence for his higher birth and his\r\nunequalled prowess. But the mutual regard which united Idomeneus and\r\nMeriones, Diomedes and Sthenelus, though, as the persons themselves are\r\nless important, it is kept more in the back-ground, is manifestly\r\nviewed by the poet in the same light. The idea of a Greek hero seems\r\nnot to have been thought complete, without such a brother in arms by\r\nhis side.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Thirlwall, Greece, vol. i. p. 176, seq.\r\n\r\n244.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs hungry wolves with raging appetite,\r\nScour through the fields, ne\xe2\x80\x99er fear the stormy night\xe2\x80\x94\r\nTheir whelps at home expect the promised food,\r\nAnd long to temper their dry chaps in blood\xe2\x80\x94\r\nSo rush\xe2\x80\x99d we forth at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dryden\xe2\x80\x99s Virgil, ii. 479.\r\n\r\n245. \xe2\x80\x94_The destinies ordain._\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIn the mythology, also, of the Iliad,\r\npurely Pagan as it is, we discover one important truth unconsciously\r\ninvolved, which was almost entirely lost from view amidst the nearly\r\nequal scepticism and credulity of subsequent ages. Zeus or Jupiter is\r\npopularly to be taken as omnipotent. No distinct empire is assigned to\r\nfate or fortune; the will of the father of gods and men is absolute and\r\nuncontrollable. This seems to be the true character of the Homeric\r\ndeity, and it is very necessary that the student of Greek literature\r\nshould bear it constantly in mind. A strong instance in the Iliad\r\nitself to illustrate this position, is the passage where Jupiter\r\nlaments to Juno the approaching death of Sarpedon. \xe2\x80\x98Alas me!\xe2\x80\x99 says he\r\n\xe2\x80\x98since it is fated (moira) that Sarpedon, dearest to me of men, should\r\nbe slain by Patroclus, the son of Menoetius! Indeed, my heart is\r\ndivided within me while I ruminate it in my mind, whether having\r\nsnatched him up from out of the lamentable battle, I should not at once\r\nplace him alive in the fertile land of his own Lycia, or whether I\r\nshould now destroy him by the hands of the son of Menoetius!\xe2\x80\x99 To which\r\nJuno answers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Dost thou mean to rescue from death a mortal man, long\r\nsince destined by fate (palai pepromenon)? You may do it\xe2\x80\x94but we, the\r\nrest of the gods, do not sanction it.\xe2\x80\x99 Here it is clear from both\r\nspeakers, that although Sarpedon is said to be fated to die, Jupiter\r\nmight still, if he pleased, save him, and place him entirely out of the\r\nreach of any such event, and further, in the alternative, that Jupiter\r\nhimself would destroy him by the hands of another.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Coleridge, p. 156.\r\nseq.\r\n\r\n246. \xe2\x80\x94_Thrice at the battlements._ \xe2\x80\x9cThe art military of the Homeric age\r\nis upon a level with the state of navigation just described, personal\r\nprowess decided every thing; the night attack and the ambuscade,\r\nalthough much esteemed, were never upon a large scale. The chiefs fight\r\nin advance, and enact almost as much as the knights of romance. The\r\nsiege of Troy was as little like a modern siege as a captain in the\r\nguards is like Achilles. There is no mention of a ditch or any other\r\nline or work round the town, and the wall itself was accessible without\r\na ladder. It was probably a vast mound of earth with a declivity\r\noutwards. Patroclus thrice mounts it in armour. The Trojans are in no\r\nrespects blockaded, and receive assistance from their allies to the\r\nvery end.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Coleridge, p. 212.\r\n\r\n247. \xe2\x80\x94_Ciconians._\xe2\x80\x94A people of Thrace, near the Hebrus.\r\n\r\n248.\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_They wept._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFast by the manger stands the inactive steed,\r\nAnd, sunk in sorrow, hangs his languid head;\r\nHe stands, and careless of his golden grain,\r\nWeeps his associates and his master slain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerrick\xe2\x80\x99s Tryphiodorus, v. 18-24.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is heard upon the mountains now,\r\nBut pensive herds that for their master low,\r\nStraggling and comfortless about they rove,\r\nUnmindful of their pasture and their love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMoschus, id. 3, parodied, _ibid._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo close the pomp, \xc3\x86thon, the steed of state,\r\nIs led, the funeral of his lord to wait.\r\nStripp\xe2\x80\x99d of his trappings, with a sullen pace\r\nHe walks, and the big tears run rolling down his face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDryden\xe2\x80\x99s Virgil, bk. ii\r\n\r\n249.\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Some brawny bull._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike to a bull, that with impetuous spring\r\nDarts, at the moment when the fatal blow\r\nHath struck him, but unable to proceed\r\nPlunges on either side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Carey\xe2\x80\x99s Dante: Hell, c. xii.\r\n\r\n250.

Coleridge (Greek Classic Poets, p. 182, seq.) has diligently\r\ncompared this with the description of the shield of Hercules by Hesiod.\r\nHe remarks that, \xe2\x80\x9cwith two or three exceptions, the imagery differs in\r\nlittle more than the names and arrangements; and the difference of\r\narrangement in the Shield of Hercules is altogether for the worse. The\r\nnatural consecution of the Homeric images needs no exposition: it\r\nconstitutes in itself one of the beauties of the work. The Hesiodic\r\nimages are huddled together without connection or congruity: Mars and\r\nPallas are awkwardly introduced among the Centaurs and Lapithae;\xe2\x80\x94 but\r\nthe gap is wide indeed between them and Apollo with the Muses, waking\r\nthe echoes of Olympus to celestial harmonies; whence however, we are\r\nhurried back to Perseus, the Gorgons, and other images of war, over an\r\narm of the sea, in which the sporting dolphins, the fugitive fishes,\r\nand the fisherman on the shore with his casting net, are minutely\r\nrepresented. As to the Hesiodic images themselves, the leading remark\r\nis, that they catch at beauty by ornament, and at sublimity by\r\nexaggeration; and upon the untenable supposition of the genuineness of\r\nthis poem, there is this curious peculiarity, that, in the description\r\nof scenes of rustic peace, the superiority of Homer is decisive\xe2\x80\x94while\r\nin those of war and tumult it may be thought, perhaps, that the\r\nHesiodic poet has more than once the advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n258. \xe2\x80\x9cThis legend is one of the most pregnant and characteristic in the\r\nGrecian Mythology; it explains, according to the religious ideas\r\nfamiliar to the old epic poets, both the distinguishing attributes and\r\nthe endless toil and endurances of Heracles, the most renowned\r\nsubjugator of all the semi-divine personages worshipped by the\r\nHellenes,\xe2\x80\x94a being of irresistible force, and especially beloved by\r\nZeus, yet condemned constantly to labour for others and to obey the\r\ncommands of a worthless and cowardly persecutor. His recompense is\r\nreserved to the close of his career, when his afflicting trials are\r\nbrought to a close: he is then admitted to the godhead, and receives in\r\nmarriage Hebe.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Grote, vol. i. p. 128.\r\n\r\n259.\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Ambrosia._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blue-eyed maid,\r\nIn ev\xe2\x80\x99ry breast new vigour to infuse.\r\nBrings nectar temper\xe2\x80\x99d with ambrosial dews.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerrick\xe2\x80\x99s Tryphiodorus, vi. 249.\r\n\r\n260. \xe2\x80\x9cHell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.

The\r\noverwhelming fury of the stream finds the natural interpretation in the\r\ncharacter of the mountain torrents of Greece and Asia Minor. Their\r\nwide, shingly beds are in summer comparatively dry, so as to be easily\r\nforded by the foot passenger. But a thunder-shower in the mountains,\r\nunobserved perhaps by the traveller on the plain, may suddenly immerse\r\nhim in the flood of a mighty river. The rescue of Achilles by the fiery\r\narms of Vulcan scarcely admits of the same ready explanation from\r\nphysical causes. Yet the subsiding of the flood at the critical moment\r\nwhen the hero\xe2\x80\x99s destruction appeared imminent, might, by a slight\r\nextension of the figurative parallel, be ascribed to a god symbolic of\r\nthe influences opposed to all atmospheric moisture.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mure, vol. i. p.\r\n480, sq.\r\n\r\n270.

The example of Nausicaa, in the Odyssey, proves that the duties of\r\nthe laundry were not thought derogatory, even from the dignity of a\r\nprincess, in the heroic times.\r\n\r\n277.\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Hesper shines with keener light._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFairest of stars, last in the train of night,\r\nIf better thou belong not to the dawn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParadise Lost,\xe2\x80\x9d v. 166.\r\n\r\n278. Such was his fate. After chasing the Trojans into the town, he was\r\nslain by an arrow from the quiver of Paris, directed under the unerring\r\nauspices of Apollo. The greatest efforts were made by the Trojans to\r\npossess themselves of the body, which was however rescued and borne off\r\nto the Grecian camp by the valour of Ajax and Ulysses. Thetis stole\r\naway the body, just as the Greeks were about to burn it with funeral\r\nhonours, and conveyed it away to a renewed life of immortality in the\r\nisle of Leuke in the Euxine.\r\n\r\n279. \xe2\x80\x94_Astyanax,_ i.e. the _city-king_ or guardian. It is amusing that\r\nPlato, who often finds fault with Homer without reason, should have\r\ncopied this twaddling etymology into his Cratylus.\r\n\r\n280. This book has been closely imitated by Virgil in his fifth book,\r\nbut it is almost useless to attempt a selection of passages for\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\n281. \xe2\x80\x94_Thrice in order led._ This was a frequent rite at funerals. The\r\nRomans had the same custom, which they called _decursio._ Plutarch\r\nstates that Alexander, in after times, renewed these same honours to\r\nthe memory of Achilles himself.\r\n\r\n282. \xe2\x80\x94_And swore._ Literally, and called Orcus, the god of oaths, to\r\nwitness. See Buttmann, Lexilog, p. 436.\r\n\r\n283.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, long expected by thy friends! from whence\r\nArt thou so late return\xe2\x80\x99d for our defence?\r\nDo we behold thee, wearied as we are\r\nWith length of labours, and with, toils of war?\r\nAfter so many funerals of thy own,\r\nArt thou restored to thy declining town?\r\nBut say, what wounds are these? what new disgrace\r\nDeforms the manly features of thy face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDryden, xi. 369.\r\n\r\n284.\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Like a thin smoke._ Virgil, Georg. iv. 72.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn vain I reach my feeble hands to join\r\nIn sweet embraces\xe2\x80\x94ah! no longer thine!\r\nShe said, and from his eyes the fleeting fair\r\nRetired, like subtle smoke dissolved in air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDryden.\r\n\r\n285.\r\nSo Milton:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo eagerly the fiend\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er bog, o\xe2\x80\x99er steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,\r\nWith head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,\r\nAnd swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParadise Lost,\xe2\x80\x9d ii. 948.\r\n\r\n286.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn ancient forest, for the work design\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n(The shady covert of the savage kind).\r\nThe Trojans found: the sounding axe is placed:\r\nFirs, pines, and pitch-trees, and the tow\xe2\x80\x99ring pride\r\nOf forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke,\r\nAnd piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.\r\nHigh trunks of trees, fell\xe2\x80\x99d from the steepy crown\r\nOf the bare mountains, roll with ruin down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDryden\xe2\x80\x99s Virgil, vi. 261.\r\n\r\n287. \xe2\x80\x94_He vowed._ This was a very ancient custom.\r\n\r\n288. The height of the tomb or pile was a great proof of the dignity of\r\nthe deceased, and the honour in which he was held.\r\n\r\n289. On the prevalence of this cruel custom amongst the northern\r\nnations, see Mallet, p. 213.\r\n\r\n290. \xe2\x80\x94_And calls the spirit._ Such was the custom anciently, even at\r\nthe Roman funerals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHail, O ye holy manes! hail again,\r\nPaternal ashes, now revived in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDryden\xe2\x80\x99s Virgil, v. 106.\r\n\r\n291. Virgil, by making the boaster vanquished, has drawn a better moral\r\nfrom this episode than Homer. The following lines deserve comparison:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe haughty Dares in the lists appears:\r\nWalking he strides, his head erected bears:\r\nHis nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,\r\nAnd loud applauses echo through the field.\r\n* * * *\r\nSuch Dares was, and such he strode along,\r\nAnd drew the wonder of the gazing throng\r\nHis brawny breast and ample chest he shows;\r\nHis lifted arms around his head he throws,\r\nAnd deals in whistling air his empty blows.\r\nHis match is sought, but, through the trembling band,\r\nNo one dares answer to the proud demand.\r\nPresuming of his force, with sparkling eyes,\r\nAlready he devours the promised prize.\r\n* * * *\r\nIf none my matchless valour dares oppose,\r\nHow long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDryden\xe2\x80\x99s Virgil, v. 486, seq.\r\n\r\n292.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gauntlet-fight thus ended, from the shore\r\nHis faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:\r\nHis mouth and nostrils pour\xe2\x80\x99d a purple flood,\r\nAnd pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDryden\xe2\x80\x99s Virgil, v. 623.\r\n\r\n293. \xe2\x80\x9cTroilus is only once named in the Iliad; he was mentioned also in\r\nthe Cypriad but his youth, beauty, and untimely end made him an object\r\nof great interest with the subsequent poets.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Grote, i, p. 399.\r\n\r\n294. Milton has rivalled this passage describing the descent of\r\nGabriel, \xe2\x80\x9cParadise Lost,\xe2\x80\x9d bk. v. 266, seq.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown thither prone in flight\r\nHe speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky\r\nSails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing,\r\nNow on the polar winds, then with quick fan\r\nWinnows the buxom air. * * * *\r\n* * * *\r\nAt once on th\xe2\x80\x99 eastern cliff of Paradise\r\nHe lights, and to his proper shape returns\r\nA seraph wing\xe2\x80\x99d. * * * *\r\nLike Maia\xe2\x80\x99s son he stood,\r\nAnd shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance fill\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe circuit wide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirgil, \xc3\x86n. iv. 350:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHermes obeys; with golden pinions binds\r\nHis flying feet, and mounts the western winds:\r\nAnd whether o\xe2\x80\x99er the seas or earth he flies,\r\nWith rapid force they bear him down the skies\r\nBut first he grasps within his awful hand\r\nThe mark of sovereign power, his magic wand;\r\nWith this he draws the ghost from hollow graves;\r\nWith this he drives them from the Stygian waves:\r\n* * * *\r\nThus arm\xe2\x80\x99d, the god begins his airy race,\r\nAnd drives the racking clouds along the liquid space.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDryden.\r\n\r\n295. In reference to the whole scene that follows, the remarks of\r\nColeridge are well worth reading:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy a close study of life, and by a true and natural mode of expressing\r\neverything, Homer was enabled to venture upon the most peculiar and\r\ndifficult situations, and to extricate himself from them with the\r\ncompletest success. The whole scene between Achilles and Priam, when\r\nthe latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose of redeeming the\r\nbody of Hector, is at once the most profoundly skilful, and yet the\r\nsimplest and most affecting passage in the Iliad. Quinctilian has taken\r\nnotice of the following speech of Priam, the rhetorical artifice of\r\nwhich is so transcendent, that if genius did not often, especially in\r\noratory, unconsciously fulfil the most subtle precepts of criticism, we\r\nmight be induced, on this account alone, to consider the last book of\r\nthe Iliad as what is called spurious, in other words, of later date\r\nthan the rest of the poem. Observe the exquisite taste of Priam in\r\noccupying the mind of Achilles, from the outset, with the image of his\r\nfather; in gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation;\r\nand, lastly, mentioning Hector\xe2\x80\x99s name when he perceives that the hero\r\nis softened, and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of\r\nthe conqueror. The ego d\xe2\x80\x99eleeinoteros per, and the apusato aecha\r\ngeronta, are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the\r\nIliad. They are almost too fine and pathetic. The whole passage defies\r\ntranslation, for there is that about the Greek which has no name, but\r\nwhich is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can only be felt in\r\nthe original, and is lost in an attempt to transfuse it into another\r\nlanguage.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Coleridge, p. 195.\r\n\r\n296. \xe2\x80\x9cAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 ferocious treatment of the corpse of Hector cannot but\r\noffend as referred to the modern standard of humanity. The heroic age,\r\nhowever, must be judged by its own moral laws. Retributive vengeance on\r\nthe dead, as well as the living, was a duty inculcated by the religion\r\nof those barbarous times which not only taught that evil inflicted on\r\nthe author of evil was a solace to the injured man; but made the\r\nwelfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of the body from\r\nwhich it had separated. Hence a denial of the rites essential to the\r\nsoul\xe2\x80\x99s admission into the more favoured regions of the lower world was\r\na cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary shores of the infernal\r\nriver. The complaint of the ghost of Patroclus to Achilles, of but a\r\nbrief postponement of his own obsequies, shows how efficacious their\r\nrefusal to the remains of his destroyer must have been in satiating the\r\nthirst of revenge, which, even after death, was supposed to torment the\r\ndwellers in Hades. Hence before yielding up the body of Hector to\r\nPriam, Achilles asks pardon of Patroclus for even this partial cession\r\nof his just rights of retribution.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mure, vol. i. 289.\r\n\r\n297.\r\nSuch was the fate of Astyanax, when Troy was taken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, from the tow\xe2\x80\x99r by stern Ulysses thrown,\r\nAndromache bewail\xe2\x80\x99d her infant son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerrick\xe2\x80\x99s Tryphiodorus, v. 675.\r\n\r\n298. The following observations of Coleridge furnish a most gallant and\r\ninteresting view of Helen\xe2\x80\x99s character\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFew things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand that\r\nhas given us the fury and inconsistency of Achilles, gives us also the\r\nconsummate elegance and tenderness of Helen. She is through the Iliad a\r\ngenuine lady, graceful in motion and speech, noble in her associations,\r\nfull of remorse for a fault for which higher powers seem responsible,\r\nyet grateful and affectionate towards those with whom that fault had\r\ncommitted her. I have always thought the following speech in which\r\nHelen laments Hector, and hints at her own invidious and unprotected\r\nsituation in Troy, as almost the sweetest passage in the poem. It is\r\nanother striking instance of that refinement of feeling and softness of\r\ntone which so generally distinguish the last book of the Iliad from the\r\nrest.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Classic Poets, p. 198, seq.\r\n\r\n299. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here we part with Achilles at the moment best calculated to\r\nexalt and purify our impression of his character. We had accompanied\r\nhim through the effervescence, undulations, and final subsidence of his\r\nstormy passions. We now leave him in repose and under the full\r\ninfluence of the more amiable affections, while our admiration of his\r\ngreat qualities is chastened by the reflection that, within a few short\r\ndays the mighty being in whom they were united was himself to be\r\nsuddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise.\r\n\r\nThe frequent and touching allusions, interspersed throughout the Iliad,\r\nto the speedy termination of its hero\xe2\x80\x99s course, and the moral on the\r\nvanity of human life which they indicate, are among the finest\r\nevidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the whole framework of\r\nthe poem is united.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mure, vol. i. p 201.\r\n\r\n300. Cowper says,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot take my leave of this noble poem without\r\nexpressing how much I am struck with the plain conclusion of it. It is\r\nlike the exit of a great man out of company, whom he has entertained\r\nmagnificently; neither pompous nor familiar; not contemptuous, yet\r\nwithout much ceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d Coleridge, p. 227, considers the termination of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParadise Lost\xe2\x80\x9d somewhat similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ILIAD ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 6130-0.txt or 6130-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/6/1/3/6130/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
