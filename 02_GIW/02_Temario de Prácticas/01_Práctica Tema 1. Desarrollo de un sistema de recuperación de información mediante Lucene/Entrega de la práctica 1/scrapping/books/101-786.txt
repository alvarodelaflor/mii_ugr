Teach these boys and girls nothing but\r\nFacts.  Facts alone are wanted in life.  Plant nothing else, and root out\r\neverything else.  You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon\r\nFacts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them.  This is the\r\nprinciple on which I bring up my own children, and this is the principle\r\non which I bring up these children.  Stick to Facts, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe scene was a plain, bare, monotonous vault of a school-room, and the\r\nspeaker\xe2\x80\x99s square forefinger emphasized his observations by underscoring\r\nevery sentence with a line on the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve.  The emphasis\r\nwas helped by the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s square wall of a forehead, which had his\r\neyebrows for its base, while his eyes found commodious cellarage in two\r\ndark caves, overshadowed by the wall.  The emphasis was helped by the\r\nspeaker\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, which was wide, thin, and hard set.  The emphasis was\r\nhelped by the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s voice, which was inflexible, dry, and\r\ndictatorial.  The emphasis was helped by the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s hair, which\r\nbristled on the skirts of his bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the\r\nwind from its shining surface, all covered with knobs, like the crust of\r\na plum pie, as if the head had scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts\r\nstored inside.  The speaker\xe2\x80\x99s obstinate carriage, square coat, square\r\nlegs, square shoulders,\xe2\x80\x94nay, his very neckcloth, trained to take him by\r\nthe throat with an unaccommodating grasp, like a stubborn fact, as it\r\nwas,\xe2\x80\x94all helped the emphasis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In this life, we want nothing but Facts, sir; nothing but Facts!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe speaker, and the schoolmaster, and the third grown person present,\r\nall backed a little, and swept with their eyes the inclined plane of\r\nlittle vessels then and there arranged in order, ready to have imperial\r\ngallons of facts poured into them until they were full to the brim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nMURDERING THE INNOCENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS GRADGRIND, sir.  A man of realities.  A man of facts and\r\ncalculations.  A man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are\r\nfour, and nothing over, and who is not to be talked into allowing for\r\nanything over.  Thomas Gradgrind, sir\xe2\x80\x94peremptorily Thomas\xe2\x80\x94Thomas\r\nGradgrind.  With a rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication\r\ntable always in his pocket, sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of\r\nhuman nature, and tell you exactly what it comes to.  It is a mere\r\nquestion of figures, a case of simple arithmetic.  You might hope to get\r\nsome other nonsensical belief into the head of George Gradgrind, or\r\nAugustus Gradgrind, or John Gradgrind, or Joseph Gradgrind (all\r\nsupposititious, non-existent persons), but into the head of Thomas\r\nGradgrind\xe2\x80\x94no, sir!\r\n\r\nIn such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally introduced himself, whether\r\nto his private circle of acquaintance, or to the public in general.  In\r\nsuch terms, no doubt, substituting the words \xe2\x80\x98boys and girls,\xe2\x80\x99 for \xe2\x80\x98sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the little pitchers\r\nbefore him, who were to be filled so full of facts.\r\n\r\nIndeed, as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before\r\nmentioned, he seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts,\r\nand prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of childhood at one\r\ndischarge.  He seemed a galvanizing apparatus, too, charged with a grim\r\nmechanical substitute for the tender young imaginations that were to be\r\nstormed away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Girl number twenty,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, squarely pointing with his\r\nsquare forefinger, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that girl.  Who is that girl?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sissy Jupe, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 explained number twenty, blushing, standing up, and\r\ncurtseying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sissy is not a name,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t call yourself Sissy.\r\nCall yourself Cecilia.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s father as calls me Sissy, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the young girl in a\r\ntrembling voice, and with another curtsey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then he has no business to do it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98Tell him he\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t.  Cecilia Jupe.  Let me see.  What is your father?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He belongs to the horse-riding, if you please, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind frowned, and waved off the objectionable calling with his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know anything about that, here.  You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us\r\nabout that, here.  Your father breaks horses, don\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you please, sir, when they can get any to break, they do break horses\r\nin the ring, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us about the ring, here.  Very well, then.  Describe\r\nyour father as a horsebreaker.  He doctors sick horses, I dare say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, then.  He is a veterinary surgeon, a farrier, and\r\nhorsebreaker.  Give me your definition of a horse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(Sissy Jupe thrown into the greatest alarm by this demand.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Girl number twenty unable to define a horse!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, for\r\nthe general behoof of all the little pitchers.  \xe2\x80\x98Girl number twenty\r\npossessed of no facts, in reference to one of the commonest of animals!\r\nSome boy\xe2\x80\x99s definition of a horse.  Bitzer, yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe square finger, moving here and there, lighted suddenly on Bitzer,\r\nperhaps because he chanced to sit in the same ray of sunlight which,\r\ndarting in at one of the bare windows of the intensely white-washed room,\r\nirradiated Sissy.  For, the boys and girls sat on the face of the\r\ninclined plane in two compact bodies, divided up the centre by a narrow\r\ninterval; and Sissy, being at the corner of a row on the sunny side, came\r\nin for the beginning of a sunbeam, of which Bitzer, being at the corner\r\nof a row on the other side, a few rows in advance, caught the end.  But,\r\nwhereas the girl was so dark-eyed and dark-haired, that she seemed to\r\nreceive a deeper and more lustrous colour from the sun, when it shone\r\nupon her, the boy was so light-eyed and light-haired that the self-same\r\nrays appeared to draw out of him what little colour he ever possessed.\r\nHis cold eyes would hardly have been eyes, but for the short ends of\r\nlashes which, by bringing them into immediate contrast with something\r\npaler than themselves, expressed their form.  His short-cropped hair\r\nmight have been a mere continuation of the sandy freckles on his forehead\r\nand face.  His skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge,\r\nthat he looked as though, if he were cut, he would bleed white.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bitzer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Thomas Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98Your definition of a horse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quadruped.  Graminivorous.  Forty teeth, namely twenty-four grinders,\r\nfour eye-teeth, and twelve incisive.  Sheds coat in the spring; in marshy\r\ncountries, sheds hoofs, too.  Hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with\r\niron.  Age known by marks in mouth.\xe2\x80\x99  Thus (and much more) Bitzer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now girl number twenty,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98You know what a horse\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe curtseyed again, and would have blushed deeper, if she could have\r\nblushed deeper than she had blushed all this time.  Bitzer, after rapidly\r\nblinking at Thomas Gradgrind with both eyes at once, and so catching the\r\nlight upon his quivering ends of lashes that they looked like the antenn\xc3\xa6\r\nof busy insects, put his knuckles to his freckled forehead, and sat down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe third gentleman now stepped forth.  A mighty man at cutting and\r\ndrying, he was; a government officer; in his way (and in most other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s too), a professed pugilist; always in training, always with a\r\nsystem to force down the general throat like a bolus, always to be heard\r\nof at the bar of his little Public-office, ready to fight all England.\r\nTo continue in fistic phraseology, he had a genius for coming up to the\r\nscratch, wherever and whatever it was, and proving himself an ugly\r\ncustomer.  He would go in and damage any subject whatever with his right,\r\nfollow up with his left, stop, exchange, counter, bore his opponent (he\r\nalways fought All England) to the ropes, and fall upon him neatly.  He\r\nwas certain to knock the wind out of common sense, and render that\r\nunlucky adversary deaf to the call of time.  And he had it in charge from\r\nhigh authority to bring about the great public-office Millennium, when\r\nCommissioners should reign upon earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said this gentleman, briskly smiling, and folding his arms.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a horse.  Now, let me ask you girls and boys, Would you paper a\r\nroom with representations of horses?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, one half of the children cried in chorus, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nUpon which the other half, seeing in the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s face that Yes was\r\nwrong, cried out in chorus, \xe2\x80\x98No, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94as the custom is, in these\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course, No.  Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA pause.  One corpulent slow boy, with a wheezy manner of breathing,\r\nventured the answer, Because he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t paper a room at all, but would\r\npaint it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You _must_ paper it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman, rather warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must paper it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Thomas Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98whether you like it or not.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell _us_ you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t paper it.  What do you mean, boy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain to you, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman, after another and a\r\ndismal pause, \xe2\x80\x98why you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t paper a room with representations of\r\nhorses.  Do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in\r\nreality\xe2\x80\x94in fact?  Do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 from one half.  \xe2\x80\x98No, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 from the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course no,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman, with an indignant look at the wrong\r\nhalf.  \xe2\x80\x98Why, then, you are not to see anywhere, what you don\xe2\x80\x99t see in\r\nfact; you are not to have anywhere, what you don\xe2\x80\x99t have in fact.  What is\r\ncalled Taste, is only another name for Fact.\xe2\x80\x99  Thomas Gradgrind nodded\r\nhis approbation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a new principle, a discovery, a great discovery,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\ngentleman.  \xe2\x80\x98Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try you again.  Suppose you were going to carpet a\r\nroom.  Would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere being a general conviction by this time that \xe2\x80\x98No, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 was always\r\nthe right answer to this gentleman, the chorus of NO was very strong.\r\nOnly a few feeble stragglers said Yes: among them Sissy Jupe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Girl number twenty,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman, smiling in the calm strength of\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nSissy blushed, and stood up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you would carpet your room\xe2\x80\x94or your husband\xe2\x80\x99s room, if you were a\r\ngrown woman, and had a husband\xe2\x80\x94with representations of flowers, would\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman.  \xe2\x80\x98Why would you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And is that why you would put tables and chairs upon them, and have\r\npeople walking over them with heavy boots?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt them, sir.  They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t crush and wither, if you\r\nplease, sir.  They would be the pictures of what was very pretty and\r\npleasant, and I would fancy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay, ay!  But you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t fancy,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the gentleman, quite elated\r\nby coming so happily to his point.  \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it!  You are never to fancy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are not, Cecilia Jupe,\xe2\x80\x99 Thomas Gradgrind solemnly repeated, \xe2\x80\x98to do\r\nanything of that kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fact, fact, fact!\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman.  And \xe2\x80\x98Fact, fact, fact!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated\r\nThomas Gradgrind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are to be in all things regulated and governed,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98by fact.  We hope to have, before long, a board of fact, composed of\r\ncommissioners of fact, who will force the people to be a people of fact,\r\nand of nothing but fact.  You must discard the word Fancy altogether.\r\nYou have nothing to do with it.  You are not to have, in any object of\r\nuse or ornament, what would be a contradiction in fact.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t walk\r\nupon flowers in fact; you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in\r\ncarpets.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t find that foreign birds and butterflies come and\r\nperch upon your crockery; you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds\r\nand butterflies upon your crockery.  You never meet with quadrupeds going\r\nup and down walls; you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls.\r\nYou must use,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98for all these purposes, combinations\r\nand modifications (in primary colours) of mathematical figures which are\r\nsusceptible of proof and demonstration.  This is the new discovery.  This\r\nis fact.  This is taste.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe girl curtseyed, and sat down.  She was very young, and she looked as\r\nif she were frightened by the matter-of-fact prospect the world afforded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, if Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98will proceed to give\r\nhis first lesson here, Mr. Gradgrind, I shall be happy, at your request,\r\nto observe his mode of procedure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind was much obliged.  \xe2\x80\x98Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild, we only wait for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo, Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild began in his best manner.  He and some one hundred\r\nand forty other schoolmasters, had been lately turned at the same time,\r\nin the same factory, on the same principles, like so many pianoforte\r\nlegs.  He had been put through an immense variety of paces, and had\r\nanswered volumes of head-breaking questions.  Orthography, etymology,\r\nsyntax, and prosody, biography, astronomy, geography, and general\r\ncosmography, the sciences of compound proportion, algebra, land-surveying\r\nand levelling, vocal music, and drawing from models, were all at the ends\r\nof his ten chilled fingers.  He had worked his stony way into Her\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s most Honourable Privy Council\xe2\x80\x99s Schedule B, and had taken the\r\nbloom off the higher branches of mathematics and physical science,\r\nFrench, German, Latin, and Greek.  He knew all about all the Water Sheds\r\nof all the world (whatever they are), and all the histories of all the\r\npeoples, and all the names of all the rivers and mountains, and all the\r\nproductions, manners, and customs of all the countries, and all their\r\nboundaries and bearings on the two and thirty points of the compass.  Ah,\r\nrather overdone, M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild.  If he had only learnt a little less,\r\nhow infinitely better he might have taught much more!\r\n\r\nHe went to work in this preparatory lesson, not unlike Morgiana in the\r\nForty Thieves: looking into all the vessels ranged before him, one after\r\nanother, to see what they contained.  Say, good M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild.  When\r\nfrom thy boiling store, thou shalt fill each jar brim full by-and-by,\r\ndost thou think that thou wilt always kill outright the robber Fancy\r\nlurking within\xe2\x80\x94or sometimes only maim him and distort him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nA LOOPHOLE\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. GRADGRIND walked homeward from the school, in a state of considerable\r\nsatisfaction.  It was his school, and he intended it to be a model.  He\r\nintended every child in it to be a model\xe2\x80\x94just as the young Gradgrinds\r\nwere all models.\r\n\r\nThere were five young Gradgrinds, and they were models every one.  They\r\nhad been lectured at, from their tenderest years; coursed, like little\r\nhares.  Almost as soon as they could run alone, they had been made to run\r\nto the lecture-room.  The first object with which they had an\r\nassociation, or of which they had a remembrance, was a large black board\r\nwith a dry Ogre chalking ghastly white figures on it.\r\n\r\nNot that they knew, by name or nature, anything about an Ogre Fact\r\nforbid!  I only use the word to express a monster in a lecturing castle,\r\nwith Heaven knows how many heads manipulated into one, taking childhood\r\ncaptive, and dragging it into gloomy statistical dens by the hair.\r\n\r\nNo little Gradgrind had ever seen a face in the moon; it was up in the\r\nmoon before it could speak distinctly.  No little Gradgrind had ever\r\nlearnt the silly jingle, Twinkle, twinkle, little star; how I wonder what\r\nyou are!  No little Gradgrind had ever known wonder on the subject, each\r\nlittle Gradgrind having at five years old dissected the Great Bear like a\r\nProfessor Owen, and driven Charles\xe2\x80\x99s Wain like a locomotive\r\nengine-driver.  No little Gradgrind had ever associated a cow in a field\r\nwith that famous cow with the crumpled horn who tossed the dog who\r\nworried the cat who killed the rat who ate the malt, or with that yet\r\nmore famous cow who swallowed Tom Thumb: it had never heard of those\r\ncelebrities, and had only been introduced to a cow as a graminivorous\r\nruminating quadruped with several stomachs.\r\n\r\nTo his matter-of-fact home, which was called Stone Lodge, Mr. Gradgrind\r\ndirected his steps.  He had virtually retired from the wholesale hardware\r\ntrade before he built Stone Lodge, and was now looking about for a\r\nsuitable opportunity of making an arithmetical figure in Parliament.\r\nStone Lodge was situated on a moor within a mile or two of a great\r\ntown\xe2\x80\x94called Coketown in the present faithful guide-book.\r\n\r\nA very regular feature on the face of the country, Stone Lodge was.  Not\r\nthe least disguise toned down or shaded off that uncompromising fact in\r\nthe landscape.  A great square house, with a heavy portico darkening the\r\nprincipal windows, as its master\xe2\x80\x99s heavy brows overshadowed his eyes.  A\r\ncalculated, cast up, balanced, and proved house.  Six windows on this\r\nside of the door, six on that side; a total of twelve in this wing, a\r\ntotal of twelve in the other wing; four-and-twenty carried over to the\r\nback wings.  A lawn and garden and an infant avenue, all ruled straight\r\nlike a botanical account-book.  Gas and ventilation, drainage and\r\nwater-service, all of the primest quality.  Iron clamps and girders,\r\nfire-proof from top to bottom; mechanical lifts for the housemaids, with\r\nall their brushes and brooms; everything that heart could desire.\r\n\r\nEverything?  Well, I suppose so.  The little Gradgrinds had cabinets in\r\nvarious departments of science too.  They had a little conchological\r\ncabinet, and a little metallurgical cabinet, and a little mineralogical\r\ncabinet; and the specimens were all arranged and labelled, and the bits\r\nof stone and ore looked as though they might have been broken from the\r\nparent substances by those tremendously hard instruments their own names;\r\nand, to paraphrase the idle legend of Peter Piper, who had never found\r\nhis way into their nursery, If the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped at\r\nmore than this, what was it for good gracious goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake, that the\r\ngreedy little Gradgrinds grasped it!\r\n\r\nTheir father walked on in a hopeful and satisfied frame of mind.  He was\r\nan affectionate father, after his manner; but he would probably have\r\ndescribed himself (if he had been put, like Sissy Jupe, upon a\r\ndefinition) as \xe2\x80\x98an eminently practical\xe2\x80\x99 father.  He had a particular\r\npride in the phrase eminently practical, which was considered to have a\r\nspecial application to him.  Whatsoever the public meeting held in\r\nCoketown, and whatsoever the subject of such meeting, some Coketowner was\r\nsure to seize the occasion of alluding to his eminently practical friend\r\nGradgrind.  This always pleased the eminently practical friend.  He knew\r\nit to be his due, but his due was acceptable.\r\n\r\nHe had reached the neutral ground upon the outskirts of the town, which\r\nwas neither town nor country, and yet was either spoiled, when his ears\r\nwere invaded by the sound of music.  The clashing and banging band\r\nattached to the horse-riding establishment, which had there set up its\r\nrest in a wooden pavilion, was in full bray.  A flag, floating from the\r\nsummit of the temple, proclaimed to mankind that it was \xe2\x80\x98Sleary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHorse-riding\xe2\x80\x99 which claimed their suffrages.  Sleary himself, a stout\r\nmodern statue with a money-box at its elbow, in an ecclesiastical niche\r\nof early Gothic architecture, took the money.  Miss Josephine Sleary, as\r\nsome very long and very narrow strips of printed bill announced, was then\r\ninaugurating the entertainments with her graceful equestrian Tyrolean\r\nflower-act.  Among the other pleasing but always strictly moral wonders\r\nwhich must be seen to be believed, Signor Jupe was that afternoon to\r\n\xe2\x80\x98elucidate the diverting accomplishments of his highly trained performing\r\ndog Merrylegs.\xe2\x80\x99  He was also to exhibit \xe2\x80\x98his astounding feat of throwing\r\nseventy-five hundred-weight in rapid succession backhanded over his head,\r\nthus forming a fountain of solid iron in mid-air, a feat never before\r\nattempted in this or any other country, and which having elicited such\r\nrapturous plaudits from enthusiastic throngs it cannot be withdrawn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe same Signor Jupe was to \xe2\x80\x98enliven the varied performances at frequent\r\nintervals with his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts.\xe2\x80\x99  Lastly, he was\r\nto wind them up by appearing in his favourite character of Mr. William\r\nButton, of Tooley Street, in \xe2\x80\x98the highly novel and laughable\r\nhippo-comedietta of The Tailor\xe2\x80\x99s Journey to Brentford.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course, but passed\r\non as a practical man ought to pass on, either brushing the noisy insects\r\nfrom his thoughts, or consigning them to the House of Correction.  But,\r\nthe turning of the road took him by the back of the booth, and at the\r\nback of the booth a number of children were congregated in a number of\r\nstealthy attitudes, striving to peep in at the hidden glories of the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThis brought him to a stop.  \xe2\x80\x98Now, to think of these vagabonds,\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98attracting the young rabble from a model school.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA space of stunted grass and dry rubbish being between him and the young\r\nrabble, he took his eyeglass out of his waistcoat to look for any child\r\nhe knew by name, and might order off.  Phenomenon almost incredible\r\nthough distinctly seen, what did he then behold but his own metallurgical\r\nLouisa, peeping with all her might through a hole in a deal board, and\r\nhis own mathematical Thomas abasing himself on the ground to catch but a\r\nhoof of the graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act!\r\n\r\nDumb with amazement, Mr. Gradgrind crossed to the spot where his family\r\nwas thus disgraced, laid his hand upon each erring child, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Louisa!!  Thomas!!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBoth rose, red and disconcerted.  But, Louisa looked at her father with\r\nmore boldness than Thomas did.  Indeed, Thomas did not look at him, but\r\ngave himself up to be taken home like a machine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the name of wonder, idleness, and folly!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, leading\r\neach away by a hand; \xe2\x80\x98what do you do here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wanted to see what it was like,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Louisa, shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What it was like?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was an air of jaded sullenness in them both, and particularly in\r\nthe girl: yet, struggling through the dissatisfaction of her face, there\r\nwas a light with nothing to rest upon, a fire with nothing to burn, a\r\nstarved imagination keeping life in itself somehow, which brightened its\r\nexpression.  Not with the brightness natural to cheerful youth, but with\r\nuncertain, eager, doubtful flashes, which had something painful in them,\r\nanalogous to the changes on a blind face groping its way.\r\n\r\nShe was a child now, of fifteen or sixteen; but at no distant day would\r\nseem to become a woman all at once.  Her father thought so as he looked\r\nat her.  She was pretty.  Would have been self-willed (he thought in his\r\neminently practical way) but for her bringing-up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thomas, though I have the fact before me, I find it difficult to believe\r\nthat you, with your education and resources, should have brought your\r\nsister to a scene like this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I brought _him_, father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, quickly.  \xe2\x80\x98I asked him to come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry to hear it.  I am very sorry indeed to hear it.  It makes\r\nThomas no better, and it makes you worse, Louisa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked at her father again, but no tear fell down her cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You!  Thomas and you, to whom the circle of the sciences is open; Thomas\r\nand you, who may be said to be replete with facts; Thomas and you, who\r\nhave been trained to mathematical exactness; Thomas and you, here!\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nMr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98In this degraded position!  I am amazed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was tired, father.  I have been tired a long time,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tired?  Of what?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the astonished father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of what\xe2\x80\x94of everything, I think.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say not another word,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98You are childish.  I\r\nwill hear no more.\xe2\x80\x99  He did not speak again until they had walked some\r\nhalf-a-mile in silence, when he gravely broke out with: \xe2\x80\x98What would your\r\nbest friends say, Louisa?  Do you attach no value to their good opinion?\r\nWhat would Mr. Bounderby say?\xe2\x80\x99  At the mention of this name, his daughter\r\nstole a look at him, remarkable for its intense and searching character.\r\nHe saw nothing of it, for before he looked at her, she had again cast\r\ndown her eyes!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What,\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated presently, \xe2\x80\x98would Mr. Bounderby say?\xe2\x80\x99  All the way to\r\nStone Lodge, as with grave indignation he led the two delinquents home,\r\nhe repeated at intervals \xe2\x80\x98What would Mr. Bounderby say?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94as if Mr.\r\nBounderby had been Mrs. Grundy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nMR. BOUNDERBY\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT being Mrs. Grundy, who _was_ Mr. Bounderby?\r\n\r\nWhy, Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s bosom friend, as a\r\nman perfectly devoid of sentiment can approach that spiritual\r\nrelationship towards another man perfectly devoid of sentiment.  So near\r\nwas Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x94or, if the reader should prefer it, so far off.\r\n\r\nHe was a rich man: banker, merchant, manufacturer, and what not.  A big,\r\nloud man, with a stare, and a metallic laugh.  A man made out of a coarse\r\nmaterial, which seemed to have been stretched to make so much of him.  A\r\nman with a great puffed head and forehead, swelled veins in his temples,\r\nand such a strained skin to his face that it seemed to hold his eyes\r\nopen, and lift his eyebrows up.  A man with a pervading appearance on him\r\nof being inflated like a balloon, and ready to start.  A man who could\r\nnever sufficiently vaunt himself a self-made man.  A man who was always\r\nproclaiming, through that brassy speaking-trumpet of a voice of his, his\r\nold ignorance and his old poverty.  A man who was the Bully of humility.\r\n\r\nA year or two younger than his eminently practical friend, Mr. Bounderby\r\nlooked older; his seven or eight and forty might have had the seven or\r\neight added to it again, without surprising anybody.  He had not much\r\nhair.  One might have fancied he had talked it off; and that what was\r\nleft, all standing up in disorder, was in that condition from being\r\nconstantly blown about by his windy boastfulness.\r\n\r\nIn the formal drawing-room of Stone Lodge, standing on the hearthrug,\r\nwarming himself before the fire, Mr. Bounderby delivered some\r\nobservations to Mrs. Gradgrind on the circumstance of its being his\r\nbirthday.  He stood before the fire, partly because it was a cool spring\r\nafternoon, though the sun shone; partly because the shade of Stone Lodge\r\nwas always haunted by the ghost of damp mortar; partly because he thus\r\ntook up a commanding position, from which to subdue Mrs. Gradgrind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a shoe to my foot.  As to a stocking, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know such a\r\nthing by name.  I passed the day in a ditch, and the night in a pigsty.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way I spent my tenth birthday.  Not that a ditch was new to\r\nme, for I was born in a ditch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Gradgrind, a little, thin, white, pink-eyed bundle of shawls, of\r\nsurpassing feebleness, mental and bodily; who was always taking physic\r\nwithout any effect, and who, whenever she showed a symptom of coming to\r\nlife, was invariably stunned by some weighty piece of fact tumbling on\r\nher; Mrs. Gradgrind hoped it was a dry ditch?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!  As wet as a sop.  A foot of water in it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Enough to give a baby cold,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Gradgrind considered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cold?  I was born with inflammation of the lungs, and of everything\r\nelse, I believe, that was capable of inflammation,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr.\r\nBounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98For years, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I was one of the most miserable little\r\nwretches ever seen.  I was so sickly, that I was always moaning and\r\ngroaning.  I was so ragged and dirty, that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have touched me\r\nwith a pair of tongs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Gradgrind faintly looked at the tongs, as the most appropriate thing\r\nher imbecility could think of doing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How I fought through it, _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98I was\r\ndetermined, I suppose.  I have been a determined character in later life,\r\nand I suppose I was then.  Here I am, Mrs. Gradgrind, anyhow, and nobody\r\nto thank for my being here, but myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his mother\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_My_ mother?  Bolted, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gradgrind, stunned as usual, collapsed and gave it up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My mother left me to my grandmother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby; \xe2\x80\x98and, according to\r\nthe best of my remembrance, my grandmother was the wickedest and the\r\nworst old woman that ever lived.  If I got a little pair of shoes by any\r\nchance, she would take \xe2\x80\x99em off and sell \xe2\x80\x99em for drink.  Why, I have known\r\nthat grandmother of mine lie in her bed and drink her four-teen glasses\r\nof liquor before breakfast!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Gradgrind, weakly smiling, and giving no other sign of vitality,\r\nlooked (as she always did) like an indifferently executed transparency of\r\na small female figure, without enough light behind it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She kept a chandler\xe2\x80\x99s shop,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98and kept me in an\r\negg-box.  That was the cot of _my_ infancy; an old egg-box.  As soon as I\r\nwas big enough to run away, of course I ran away.  Then I became a young\r\nvagabond; and instead of one old woman knocking me about and starving me,\r\neverybody of all ages knocked me about and starved me.  They were right;\r\nthey had no business to do anything else.  I was a nuisance, an\r\nincumbrance, and a pest.  I know that very well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social\r\ndistinction as to be a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest, was only to\r\nbe satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of the boast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was to pull through it, I suppose, Mrs. Gradgrind.  Whether I was to\r\ndo it or not, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I did it.  I pulled through it, though nobody threw\r\nme out a rope.  Vagabond, errand-boy, vagabond, labourer, porter, clerk,\r\nchief manager, small partner, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  Those are\r\nthe antecedents, and the culmination.  Josiah Bounderby of Coketown\r\nlearnt his letters from the outsides of the shops, Mrs. Gradgrind, and\r\nwas first able to tell the time upon a dial-plate, from studying the\r\nsteeple clock of St. Giles\xe2\x80\x99s Church, London, under the direction of a\r\ndrunken cripple, who was a convicted thief, and an incorrigible vagrant.\r\nTell Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, of your district schools and your\r\nmodel schools, and your training schools, and your whole kettle-of-fish\r\nof schools; and Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, tells you plainly, all\r\nright, all correct\xe2\x80\x94he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t such advantages\xe2\x80\x94but let us have hard-headed,\r\nsolid-fisted people\xe2\x80\x94the education that made him won\xe2\x80\x99t do for everybody,\r\nhe knows well\xe2\x80\x94such and such his education was, however, and you may force\r\nhim to swallow boiling fat, but you shall never force him to suppress the\r\nfacts of his life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBeing heated when he arrived at this climax, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown\r\nstopped.  He stopped just as his eminently practical friend, still\r\naccompanied by the two young culprits, entered the room.  His eminently\r\npractical friend, on seeing him, stopped also, and gave Louisa a\r\nreproachful look that plainly said, \xe2\x80\x98Behold your Bounderby!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 blustered Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?  What is young\r\nThomas in the dumps about?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe spoke of young Thomas, but he looked at Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We were peeping at the circus,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Louisa, haughtily, without\r\nlifting up her eyes, \xe2\x80\x98and father caught us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, Mrs. Gradgrind,\xe2\x80\x99 said her husband in a lofty manner, \xe2\x80\x98I should as\r\nsoon have expected to find my children reading poetry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98How can you, Louisa and Thomas!  I\r\nwonder at you.  I declare you\xe2\x80\x99re enough to make one regret ever having\r\nhad a family at all.  I have a great mind to say I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t.  _Then_\r\nwhat would you have done, I should like to know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by these cogent remarks.\r\nHe frowned impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As if, with my head in its present throbbing state, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go and\r\nlook at the shells and minerals and things provided for you, instead of\r\ncircuses!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98You know, as well as I do, no young\r\npeople have circus masters, or keep circuses in cabinets, or attend\r\nlectures about circuses.  What can you possibly want to know of circuses\r\nthen?  I am sure you have enough to do, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you want.  With my\r\nhead in its present state, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember the mere names of half the\r\nfacts you have got to attend to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason!\xe2\x80\x99 pouted Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason, because it can\xe2\x80\x99t be nothing of the\r\nsort,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98Go and be somethingological directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific character, and usually dismissed her\r\nchildren to their studies with this general injunction to choose their\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Mrs. Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s stock of facts in general was woefully\r\ndefective; but Mr. Gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial\r\nposition, had been influenced by two reasons.  Firstly, she was most\r\nsatisfactory as a question of figures; and, secondly, she had \xe2\x80\x98no\r\nnonsense\xe2\x80\x99 about her.  By nonsense he meant fancy; and truly it is\r\nprobable she was as free from any alloy of that nature, as any human\r\nbeing not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot, ever was.\r\n\r\nThe simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and Mr.\r\nBounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without\r\ncollision between herself and any other fact.  So, she once more died\r\naway, and nobody minded her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, drawing a chair to the fireside, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nare always so interested in my young people\xe2\x80\x94particularly in Louisa\xe2\x80\x94that I\r\nmake no apology for saying to you, I am very much vexed by this\r\ndiscovery.  I have systematically devoted myself (as you know) to the\r\neducation of the reason of my family.  The reason is (as you know) the\r\nonly faculty to which education should be addressed.  \xe2\x80\x98And yet,\r\nBounderby, it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to-day,\r\nthough in itself a trifling one, as if something had crept into Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s minds which is\xe2\x80\x94or rather, which is not\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\r\ncan express myself better than by saying\xe2\x80\x94which has never been intended to\r\nbe developed, and in which their reason has no part.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of\r\nvagabonds,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98When I was a vagabond myself, nobody\r\nlooked with any interest at _me_; I know that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then comes the question; said the eminently practical father, with his\r\neyes on the fire, \xe2\x80\x98in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you in what.  In idle imagination.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not,\xe2\x80\x99 said the eminently practical; \xe2\x80\x98I confess, however, that the\r\nmisgiving _has_ crossed me on my way home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In idle imagination, Gradgrind,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98A very bad thing\r\nfor anybody, but a cursed bad thing for a girl like Louisa.  I should ask\r\nMrs. Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s pardon for strong expressions, but that she knows very\r\nwell I am not a refined character.  Whoever expects refinement in _me_\r\nwill be disappointed.  I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a refined bringing up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whether,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gradgrind, pondering with his hands in his pockets, and\r\nhis cavernous eyes on the fire, \xe2\x80\x98whether any instructor or servant can\r\nhave suggested anything?  Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading\r\nanything?  Whether, in spite of all precautions, any idle story-book can\r\nhave got into the house?  Because, in minds that have been practically\r\nformed by rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious, so\r\nincomprehensible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop a bit!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bounderby, who all this time had been standing, as\r\nbefore, on the hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with\r\nexplosive humility.  \xe2\x80\x98You have one of those strollers\xe2\x80\x99 children in the\r\nschool.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cecilia Jupe, by name,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, with something of a stricken\r\nlook at his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, stop a bit!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bounderby again.  \xe2\x80\x98How did she come there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just\r\nnow.  She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not\r\nregularly belonging to our town, and\xe2\x80\x94yes, you are right, Bounderby, you\r\nare right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, stop a bit!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bounderby, once more.  \xe2\x80\x98Louisa saw her when she\r\ncame?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me.\r\nBut Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98what passed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my poor health!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98The girl wanted to come\r\nto the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and\r\nLouisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr.\r\nGradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict\r\nthem when such was the fact!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98Turn this girl to\r\nthe right about, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am much of your opinion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do it at once,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98has always been my motto from a child.\r\nWhen I thought I would run away from my egg-box and my grandmother, I did\r\nit at once.  Do you the same.  Do this at once!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you walking?\xe2\x80\x99 asked his friend.  \xe2\x80\x98I have the father\xe2\x80\x99s address.\r\nPerhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the least in the world,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98as long as you do it\r\nat once!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo, Mr. Bounderby threw on his hat\xe2\x80\x94he always threw it on, as expressing a\r\nman who had been far too busily employed in making himself, to acquire\r\nany fashion of wearing his hat\xe2\x80\x94and with his hands in his pockets,\r\nsauntered out into the hall.  \xe2\x80\x98I never wear gloves,\xe2\x80\x99 it was his custom to\r\nsay.  \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t climb up the ladder in _them_.\xe2\x80\x94Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so high up,\r\nif I had.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBeing left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while Mr. Gradgrind\r\nwent up-stairs for the address, he opened the door of the children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstudy and looked into that serene floor-clothed apartment, which,\r\nnotwithstanding its book-cases and its cabinets and its variety of\r\nlearned and philosophical appliances, had much of the genial aspect of a\r\nroom devoted to hair-cutting.  Louisa languidly leaned upon the window\r\nlooking out, without looking at anything, while young Thomas stood\r\nsniffing revengefully at the fire.  Adam Smith and Malthus, two younger\r\nGradgrinds, were out at lecture in custody; and little Jane, after\r\nmanufacturing a good deal of moist pipe-clay on her face with\r\nslate-pencil and tears, had fallen asleep over vulgar fractions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all right now, Louisa: it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, young Thomas,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nBounderby; \xe2\x80\x98you won\xe2\x80\x99t do so any more.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for it\xe2\x80\x99s being all\r\nover with father.  Well, Louisa, that\xe2\x80\x99s worth a kiss, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can take one, Mr. Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Louisa, when she had coldly\r\npaused, and slowly walked across the room, and ungraciously raised her\r\ncheek towards him, with her face turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Always my pet; ain\xe2\x80\x99t you, Louisa?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye,\r\nLouisa!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe went his way, but she stood on the same spot, rubbing the cheek he had\r\nkissed, with her handkerchief, until it was burning red.  She was still\r\ndoing this, five minutes afterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you about, Loo?\xe2\x80\x99 her brother sulkily remonstrated.  \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll rub\r\na hole in your face.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may cut the piece out with your penknife if you like, Tom.  I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cry!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE KEYNOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nCOKETOWN, to which Messrs. Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked, was a\r\ntriumph of fact; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs.\r\nGradgrind herself.  Let us strike the key-note, Coketown, before pursuing\r\nour tune.\r\n\r\nIt was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the\r\nsmoke and ashes had allowed it; but as matters stood, it was a town of\r\nunnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage.  It was a town\r\nof machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of\r\nsmoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled.  It\r\nhad a black canal in it, and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling\r\ndye, and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a\r\nrattling and a trembling all day long, and where the piston of the\r\nsteam-engine worked monotonously up and down, like the head of an\r\nelephant in a state of melancholy madness.  It contained several large\r\nstreets all very like one another, and many small streets still more like\r\none another, inhabited by people equally like one another, who all went\r\nin and out at the same hours, with the same sound upon the same\r\npavements, to do the same work, and to whom every day was the same as\r\nyesterday and to-morrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\nThese attributes of Coketown were in the main inseparable from the work\r\nby which it was sustained; against them were to be set off, comforts of\r\nlife which found their way all over the world, and elegancies of life\r\nwhich made, we will not ask how much of the fine lady, who could scarcely\r\nbear to hear the place mentioned.  The rest of its features were\r\nvoluntary, and they were these.\r\n\r\nYou saw nothing in Coketown but what was severely workful.  If the\r\nmembers of a religious persuasion built a chapel there\xe2\x80\x94as the members of\r\neighteen religious persuasions had done\xe2\x80\x94they made it a pious warehouse of\r\nred brick, with sometimes (but this is only in highly ornamental\r\nexamples) a bell in a birdcage on the top of it.  The solitary exception\r\nwas the New Church; a stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the\r\ndoor, terminating in four short pinnacles like florid wooden legs.  All\r\nthe public inscriptions in the town were painted alike, in severe\r\ncharacters of black and white.  The jail might have been the infirmary,\r\nthe infirmary might have been the jail, the town-hall might have been\r\neither, or both, or anything else, for anything that appeared to the\r\ncontrary in the graces of their construction.  Fact, fact, fact,\r\neverywhere in the material aspect of the town; fact, fact, fact,\r\neverywhere in the immaterial.  The M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild school was all fact,\r\nand the school of design was all fact, and the relations between master\r\nand man were all fact, and everything was fact between the lying-in\r\nhospital and the cemetery, and what you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t state in figures, or\r\nshow to be purchaseable in the cheapest market and saleable in the\r\ndearest, was not, and never should be, world without end, Amen.\r\n\r\nA town so sacred to fact, and so triumphant in its assertion, of course\r\ngot on well?  Why no, not quite well.  No?  Dear me!\r\n\r\nNo.  Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces, in all respects like\r\ngold that had stood the fire.  First, the perplexing mystery of the place\r\nwas, Who belonged to the eighteen denominations?  Because, whoever did,\r\nthe labouring people did not.  It was very strange to walk through the\r\nstreets on a Sunday morning, and note how few of _them_ the barbarous\r\njangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad, called away\r\nfrom their own quarter, from their own close rooms, from the corners of\r\ntheir own streets, where they lounged listlessly, gazing at all the\r\nchurch and chapel going, as at a thing with which they had no manner of\r\nconcern.  Nor was it merely the stranger who noticed this, because there\r\nwas a native organization in Coketown itself, whose members were to be\r\nheard of in the House of Commons every session, indignantly petitioning\r\nfor acts of parliament that should make these people religious by main\r\nforce.  Then came the Teetotal Society, who complained that these same\r\npeople _would_ get drunk, and showed in tabular statements that they did\r\nget drunk, and proved at tea parties that no inducement, human or Divine\r\n(except a medal), would induce them to forego their custom of getting\r\ndrunk.  Then came the chemist and druggist, with other tabular\r\nstatements, showing that when they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get drunk, they took opium.\r\nThen came the experienced chaplain of the jail, with more tabular\r\nstatements, outdoing all the previous tabular statements, and showing\r\nthat the same people _would_ resort to low haunts, hidden from the public\r\neye, where they heard low singing and saw low dancing, and mayhap joined\r\nin it; and where A. B., aged twenty-four next birthday, and committed for\r\neighteen months\xe2\x80\x99 solitary, had himself said (not that he had ever shown\r\nhimself particularly worthy of belief) his ruin began, as he was\r\nperfectly sure and confident that otherwise he would have been a tip-top\r\nmoral specimen.  Then came Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby, the two\r\ngentlemen at this present moment walking through Coketown, and both\r\neminently practical, who could, on occasion, furnish more tabular\r\nstatements derived from their own personal experience, and illustrated by\r\ncases they had known and seen, from which it clearly appeared\xe2\x80\x94in short,\r\nit was the only clear thing in the case\xe2\x80\x94that these same people were a bad\r\nlot altogether, gentlemen; that do what you would for them they were\r\nnever thankful for it, gentlemen; that they were restless, gentlemen;\r\nthat they never knew what they wanted; that they lived upon the best, and\r\nbought fresh butter; and insisted on Mocha coffee, and rejected all but\r\nprime parts of meat, and yet were eternally dissatisfied and\r\nunmanageable.  In short, it was the moral of the old nursery fable:\r\n\r\n    There was an old woman, and what do you think?\r\n    She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink;\r\n    Victuals and drink were the whole of her diet,\r\n    And yet this old woman would NEVER be quiet.\r\n\r\nIs it possible, I wonder, that there was any analogy between the case of\r\nthe Coketown population and the case of the little Gradgrinds?  Surely,\r\nnone of us in our sober senses and acquainted with figures, are to be\r\ntold at this time of day, that one of the foremost elements in the\r\nexistence of the Coketown working-people had been for scores of years,\r\ndeliberately set at nought?  That there was any Fancy in them demanding\r\nto be brought into healthy existence instead of struggling on in\r\nconvulsions?  That exactly in the ratio as they worked long and\r\nmonotonously, the craving grew within them for some physical relief\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nrelaxation, encouraging good humour and good spirits, and giving them a\r\nvent\xe2\x80\x94some recognized holiday, though it were but for an honest dance to a\r\nstirring band of music\xe2\x80\x94some occasional light pie in which even\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild had no finger\xe2\x80\x94which craving must and would be satisfied\r\naright, or must and would inevitably go wrong, until the laws of the\r\nCreation were repealed?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This man lives at Pod\xe2\x80\x99s End, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know Pod\xe2\x80\x99s End,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nGradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98Which is it, Bounderby?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby knew it was somewhere down town, but knew no more\r\nrespecting it.  So they stopped for a moment, looking about.\r\n\r\nAlmost as they did so, there came running round the corner of the street\r\nat a quick pace and with a frightened look, a girl whom Mr. Gradgrind\r\nrecognized.  \xe2\x80\x98Halloa!\xe2\x80\x99 said he.  \xe2\x80\x98Stop!  Where are you going! Stop!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nGirl number twenty stopped then, palpitating, and made him a curtsey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why are you tearing about the streets,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98in this\r\nimproper manner?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was\xe2\x80\x94I was run after, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 the girl panted, \xe2\x80\x98and I wanted to get\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Run after?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98Who would run after _you_?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered for her, by the\r\ncolourless boy, Bitzer, who came round the corner with such blind speed\r\nand so little anticipating a stoppage on the pavement, that he brought\r\nhimself up against Mr. Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat and rebounded into the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean, boy?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98What are you doing?  How\r\ndare you dash against\xe2\x80\x94everybody\xe2\x80\x94in this manner?\xe2\x80\x99  Bitzer picked up his\r\ncap, which the concussion had knocked off; and backing, and knuckling his\r\nforehead, pleaded that it was an accident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was this boy running after you, Jupe?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Gradgrind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the girl reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bitzer.  \xe2\x80\x98Not till she run away from me.  But\r\nthe horse-riders never mind what they say, sir; they\xe2\x80\x99re famous for it.\r\nYou know the horse-riders are famous for never minding what they say,\xe2\x80\x99\r\naddressing Sissy.  \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s as well known in the town as\xe2\x80\x94please, sir, as the\r\nmultiplication table isn\xe2\x80\x99t known to the horse-riders.\xe2\x80\x99  Bitzer tried Mr.\r\nBounderby with this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He frightened me so,\xe2\x80\x99 said the girl, \xe2\x80\x98with his cruel faces!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bitzer.  \xe2\x80\x98Oh!  An\xe2\x80\x99t you one of the rest!  An\xe2\x80\x99t you a\r\nhorse-rider!  I never looked at her, sir.  I asked her if she would know\r\nhow to define a horse to-morrow, and offered to tell her again, and she\r\nran away, and I ran after her, sir, that she might know how to answer\r\nwhen she was asked.  You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought of saying such mischief if\r\nyou hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been a horse-rider?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her calling seems to be pretty well known among \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr.\r\nBounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d have had the whole school peeping in a row, in a\r\nweek.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Truly, I think so,\xe2\x80\x99 returned his friend.  \xe2\x80\x98Bitzer, turn you about and\r\ntake yourself home. Jupe, stay here a moment.  Let me hear of your\r\nrunning in this manner any more, boy, and you will hear of me through the\r\nmaster of the school.  You understand what I mean.  Go along.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy stopped in his rapid blinking, knuckled his forehead again,\r\nglanced at Sissy, turned about, and retreated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, girl,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98take this gentleman and me to your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s; we are going there.  What have you got in that bottle you are\r\ncarrying?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear, no, sir!  It\xe2\x80\x99s the nine oils.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The what?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The nine oils, sir, to rub father with.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, with a loud short laugh, \xe2\x80\x98what the devil do\r\nyou rub your father with nine oils for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s what our people aways use, sir, when they get any hurts in the\r\nring,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the girl, looking over her shoulder, to assure herself\r\nthat her pursuer was gone.  \xe2\x80\x98They bruise themselves very bad sometimes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Serve \xe2\x80\x99em right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98for being idle.\xe2\x80\x99  She glanced up\r\nat his face, with mingled astonishment and dread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By George!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98when I was four or five years younger\r\nthan you, I had worse bruises upon me than ten oils, twenty oils, forty\r\noils, would have rubbed off.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get \xe2\x80\x99em by posture-making, but by\r\nbeing banged about.  There was no rope-dancing for me; I danced on the\r\nbare ground and was larruped with the rope.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind, though hard enough, was by no means so rough a man as Mr.\r\nBounderby.  His character was not unkind, all things considered; it might\r\nhave been a very kind one indeed, if he had only made some round mistake\r\nin the arithmetic that balanced it, years ago.  He said, in what he meant\r\nfor a reassuring tone, as they turned down a narrow road, \xe2\x80\x98And this is\r\nPod\xe2\x80\x99s End; is it, Jupe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is it, sir, and\xe2\x80\x94if you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, sir\xe2\x80\x94this is the house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe stopped, at twilight, at the door of a mean little public-house, with\r\ndim red lights in it.  As haggard and as shabby, as if, for want of\r\ncustom, it had itself taken to drinking, and had gone the way all\r\ndrunkards go, and was very near the end of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s only crossing the bar, sir, and up the stairs, if you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind, and waiting there for a moment till I get a candle.  If you should\r\nhear a dog, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s only Merrylegs, and he only barks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Merrylegs and nine oils, eh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, entering last with his\r\nmetallic laugh.  \xe2\x80\x98Pretty well this, for a self-made man!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nSLEARY\xe2\x80\x99S HORSEMANSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE name of the public-house was the Pegasus\xe2\x80\x99s Arms.  The Pegasus\xe2\x80\x99s legs\r\nmight have been more to the purpose; but, underneath the winged horse\r\nupon the sign-board, the Pegasus\xe2\x80\x99s Arms was inscribed in Roman letters.\r\nBeneath that inscription again, in a flowing scroll, the painter had\r\ntouched off the lines:\r\n\r\n    Good malt makes good beer,\r\n    Walk in, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll draw it here;\r\n    Good wine makes good brandy,\r\n    Give us a call, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it handy.\r\n\r\nFramed and glazed upon the wall behind the dingy little bar, was another\r\nPegasus\xe2\x80\x94a theatrical one\xe2\x80\x94with real gauze let in for his wings, golden\r\nstars stuck on all over him, and his ethereal harness made of red silk.\r\n\r\nAs it had grown too dusky without, to see the sign, and as it had not\r\ngrown light enough within to see the picture, Mr. Gradgrind and Mr.\r\nBounderby received no offence from these idealities.  They followed the\r\ngirl up some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one, and stopped in\r\nthe dark while she went on for a candle.  They expected every moment to\r\nhear Merrylegs give tongue, but the highly trained performing dog had not\r\nbarked when the girl and the candle appeared together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father is not in our room, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with a face of great\r\nsurprise.  \xe2\x80\x98If you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind walking in, I\xe2\x80\x99ll find him directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThey walked in; and Sissy, having set two chairs for them, sped away with\r\na quick light step.  It was a mean, shabbily furnished room, with a bed\r\nin it.  The white night-cap, embellished with two peacock\xe2\x80\x99s feathers and\r\na pigtail bolt upright, in which Signor Jupe had that very afternoon\r\nenlivened the varied performances with his chaste Shaksperean quips and\r\nretorts, hung upon a nail; but no other portion of his wardrobe, or other\r\ntoken of himself or his pursuits, was to be seen anywhere.  As to\r\nMerrylegs, that respectable ancestor of the highly trained animal who\r\nwent aboard the ark, might have been accidentally shut out of it, for any\r\nsign of a dog that was manifest to eye or ear in the Pegasus\xe2\x80\x99s Arms.\r\n\r\nThey heard the doors of rooms above, opening and shutting as Sissy went\r\nfrom one to another in quest of her father; and presently they heard\r\nvoices expressing surprise.  She came bounding down again in a great\r\nhurry, opened a battered and mangy old hair trunk, found it empty, and\r\nlooked round with her hands clasped and her face full of terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father must have gone down to the Booth, sir.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why he\r\nshould go there, but he must be there; I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him in a minute!\xe2\x80\x99  She\r\nwas gone directly, without her bonnet; with her long, dark, childish hair\r\nstreaming behind her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does she mean!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98Back in a minute?  It\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\nthan a mile off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Bounderby could reply, a young man appeared at the door, and\r\nintroducing himself with the words, \xe2\x80\x98By your leaves, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x99 walked\r\nin with his hands in his pockets.  His face, close-shaven, thin, and\r\nsallow, was shaded by a great quantity of dark hair, brushed into a roll\r\nall round his head, and parted up the centre.  His legs were very robust,\r\nbut shorter than legs of good proportions should have been.  His chest\r\nand back were as much too broad, as his legs were too short.  He was\r\ndressed in a Newmarket coat and tight-fitting trousers; wore a shawl\r\nround his neck; smelt of lamp-oil, straw, orange-peel, horses\xe2\x80\x99 provender,\r\nand sawdust; and looked a most remarkable sort of Centaur, compounded of\r\nthe stable and the play-house.  Where the one began, and the other ended,\r\nnobody could have told with any precision.  This gentleman was mentioned\r\nin the bills of the day as Mr. E. W. B. Childers, so justly celebrated\r\nfor his daring vaulting act as the Wild Huntsman of the North American\r\nPrairies; in which popular performance, a diminutive boy with an old\r\nface, who now accompanied him, assisted as his infant son: being carried\r\nupside down over his father\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, by one foot, and held by the\r\ncrown of his head, heels upwards, in the palm of his father\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\naccording to the violent paternal manner in which wild huntsmen may be\r\nobserved to fondle their offspring.  Made up with curls, wreaths, wings,\r\nwhite bismuth, and carmine, this hopeful young person soared into so\r\npleasing a Cupid as to constitute the chief delight of the maternal part\r\nof the spectators; but in private, where his characteristics were a\r\nprecocious cutaway coat and an extremely gruff voice, he became of the\r\nTurf, turfy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By your leaves, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. E. W. B. Childers, glancing round\r\nthe room.  \xe2\x80\x98It was you, I believe, that were wishing to see Jupe!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98His daughter has gone to fetch him, but I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t wait; therefore, if you please, I will leave a message for him with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see, my friend,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Bounderby put in, \xe2\x80\x98we are the kind of people\r\nwho know the value of time, and you are the kind of people who don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthe value of time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr. Childers, after surveying him from head to\r\nfoot, \xe2\x80\x98the honour of knowing _you_,\xe2\x80\x94but if you mean that you can make\r\nmore money of your time than I can of mine, I should judge from your\r\nappearance, that you are about right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when you have made it, you can keep it too, I should think,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nCupid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kidderminster, stow that!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Childers.  (Master Kidderminster was\r\nCupid\xe2\x80\x99s mortal name.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does he come here cheeking us for, then?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Master\r\nKidderminster, showing a very irascible temperament.  \xe2\x80\x98If you want to\r\ncheek us, pay your ochre at the doors and take it out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kidderminster,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Childers, raising his voice, \xe2\x80\x98stow that!\xe2\x80\x94Sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98I was addressing myself to you.  You may or you may\r\nnot be aware (for perhaps you have not been much in the audience), that\r\nJupe has missed his tip very often, lately.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has\xe2\x80\x94what has he missed?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Gradgrind, glancing at the potent\r\nBounderby for assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Missed his tip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Offered at the Garters four times last night, and never done \xe2\x80\x99em once,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Master Kidderminster.  \xe2\x80\x98Missed his tip at the banners, too, and was\r\nloose in his ponging.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t do what he ought to do.  Was short in his leaps and bad in his\r\ntumbling,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Childers interpreted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98that is tip, is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a general way that\xe2\x80\x99s missing his tip,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. E. W. B. Childers\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nine oils, Merrylegs, missing tips, garters, banners, and Ponging, eh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nejaculated Bounderby, with his laugh of laughs.  \xe2\x80\x98Queer sort of company,\r\ntoo, for a man who has raised himself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lower yourself, then,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Cupid.  \xe2\x80\x98Oh Lord! if you\xe2\x80\x99ve raised\r\nyourself so high as all that comes to, let yourself down a bit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a very obtrusive lad!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, turning, and knitting\r\nhis brows on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99d have had a young gentleman to meet you, if we had known you were\r\ncoming,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Master Kidderminster, nothing abashed.  \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t have a bespeak, being so particular.  You\xe2\x80\x99re on the Tight-Jeff,\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does this unmannerly boy mean,\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Gradgrind, eyeing him in\r\na sort of desperation, \xe2\x80\x98by Tight-Jeff?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!  Get out, get out!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Childers, thrusting his young friend\r\nfrom the room, rather in the prairie manner.  \xe2\x80\x98Tight-Jeff or Slack-Jeff,\r\nit don\xe2\x80\x99t much signify: it\xe2\x80\x99s only tight-rope and slack-rope.  You were\r\ngoing to give me a message for Jupe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Childers, quickly, \xe2\x80\x98my opinion is, he will never\r\nreceive it.  Do you know much of him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never saw the man in my life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I doubt if you ever _will_ see him now.  It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty plain to me, he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean that he has deserted his daughter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay!  I mean,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Childers, with a nod, \xe2\x80\x98that he has cut.  He was\r\ngoosed last night, he was goosed the night before last, he was goosed\r\nto-day.  He has lately got in the way of being always goosed, and he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stand it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why has he been\xe2\x80\x94so very much\xe2\x80\x94Goosed?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Gradgrind, forcing the\r\nword out of himself, with great solemnity and reluctance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His joints are turning stiff, and he is getting used up,\xe2\x80\x99 said Childers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has his points as a Cackler still, but he can\xe2\x80\x99t get a living out of\r\n_them_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A Cackler!\xe2\x80\x99 Bounderby repeated.  \xe2\x80\x98Here we go again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A speaker, if the gentleman likes it better,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. E. W. B.\r\nChilders, superciliously throwing the interpretation over his shoulder,\r\nand accompanying it with a shake of his long hair\xe2\x80\x94which all shook at\r\nonce.  \xe2\x80\x98Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable fact, sir, that it cut that man deeper, to\r\nknow that his daughter knew of his being goosed, than to go through with\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good!\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98This is good, Gradgrind!  A man so\r\nfond of his daughter, that he runs away from her!  This is devilish good!\r\nHa! ha!  Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, young man.  I haven\xe2\x80\x99t always occupied\r\nmy present station of life.  I know what these things are.  You may be\r\nastonished to hear it, but my mother\xe2\x80\x94ran away from _me_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nE. W. B. Childers replied pointedly, that he was not at all astonished to\r\nhear it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98I was born in a ditch, and my mother ran\r\naway from me.  Do I excuse her for it?  No.  Have I ever excused her for\r\nit?  Not I.  What do I call her for it?  I call her probably the very\r\nworst woman that ever lived in the world, except my drunken grandmother.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no family pride about me, there\xe2\x80\x99s no imaginative sentimental\r\nhumbug about me.  I call a spade a spade; and I call the mother of Josiah\r\nBounderby of Coketown, without any fear or any favour, what I should call\r\nher if she had been the mother of Dick Jones of Wapping.  So, with this\r\nman.  He is a runaway rogue and a vagabond, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he is, in\r\nEnglish.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all the same to me what he is or what he is not, whether in English\r\nor whether in French,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr. E. W. B. Childers, facing about.  \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nam telling your friend what\xe2\x80\x99s the fact; if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear it, you\r\ncan avail yourself of the open air.  You give it mouth enough, you do;\r\nbut give it mouth in your own building at least,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated E. W. B.\r\nwith stern irony.  \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t give it mouth in this building, till you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncalled upon.  You have got some building of your own I dare say, now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Bounderby, rattling his money and laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then give it mouth in your own building, will you, if you please?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nChilders.  \xe2\x80\x98Because this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a strong building, and too much of you\r\nmight bring it down!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEyeing Mr. Bounderby from head to foot again, he turned from him, as from\r\na man finally disposed of, to Mr. Gradgrind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago, and then was\r\nseen to slip out himself, with his hat over his eyes, and a bundle tied\r\nup in a handkerchief under his arm.  She will never believe it of him,\r\nbut he has cut away and left her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98why will she never believe it of him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because those two were one.  Because they were never asunder.  Because,\r\nup to this time, he seemed to dote upon her,\xe2\x80\x99 said Childers, taking a\r\nstep or two to look into the empty trunk.  Both Mr. Childers and Master\r\nKidderminster walked in a curious manner; with their legs wider apart\r\nthan the general run of men, and with a very knowing assumption of being\r\nstiff in the knees.  This walk was common to all the male members of\r\nSleary\xe2\x80\x99s company, and was understood to express, that they were always on\r\nhorseback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Sissy!  He had better have apprenticed her,\xe2\x80\x99 said Childers, giving\r\nhis hair another shake, as he looked up from the empty box.  \xe2\x80\x98Now, he\r\nleaves her without anything to take to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is creditable to you, who have never been apprenticed, to express\r\nthat opinion,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Gradgrind, approvingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_I_ never apprenticed?  I was apprenticed when I was seven year old.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!  Indeed?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, rather resentfully, as having been\r\ndefrauded of his good opinion.  \xe2\x80\x98I was not aware of its being the custom\r\nto apprentice young persons to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Idleness,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Bounderby put in with a loud laugh.  \xe2\x80\x98No, by the Lord\r\nHarry!  Nor I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her father always had it in his head,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Childers, feigning\r\nunconsciousness of Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s existence, \xe2\x80\x98that she was to be taught\r\nthe deuce-and-all of education.  How it got into his head, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say; I\r\ncan only say that it never got out.  He has been picking up a bit of\r\nreading for her, here\xe2\x80\x94and a bit of writing for her, there\xe2\x80\x94and a bit of\r\nciphering for her, somewhere else\xe2\x80\x94these seven years.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. E. W. B. Childers took one of his hands out of his pockets, stroked\r\nhis face and chin, and looked, with a good deal of doubt and a little\r\nhope, at Mr. Gradgrind.  From the first he had sought to conciliate that\r\ngentleman, for the sake of the deserted girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When Sissy got into the school here,\xe2\x80\x99 he pursued, \xe2\x80\x98her father was as\r\npleased as Punch.  I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t altogether make out why, myself, as we were\r\nnot stationary here, being but comers and goers anywhere.  I suppose,\r\nhowever, he had this move in his mind\xe2\x80\x94he was always half-cracked\xe2\x80\x94and then\r\nconsidered her provided for.  If you should happen to have looked in\r\nto-night, for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her\r\nany little service,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Childers, stroking his face again, and\r\nrepeating his look, \xe2\x80\x98it would be very fortunate and well-timed; very\r\nfortunate and well-timed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On the contrary,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98I came to tell him that her\r\nconnections made her not an object for the school, and that she must not\r\nattend any more.  Still, if her father really has left her, without any\r\nconnivance on her part\xe2\x80\x94Bounderby, let me have a word with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUpon this, Mr. Childers politely betook himself, with his equestrian\r\nwalk, to the landing outside the door, and there stood stroking his face,\r\nand softly whistling.  While thus engaged, he overheard such phrases in\r\nMr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s voice as \xe2\x80\x98No.  _I_ say no.  I advise you not.  I say by\r\nno means.\xe2\x80\x99  While, from Mr. Gradgrind, he heard in his much lower tone\r\nthe words, \xe2\x80\x98But even as an example to Louisa, of what this pursuit which\r\nhas been the subject of a vulgar curiosity, leads to and ends in.  Think\r\nof it, Bounderby, in that point of view.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the various members of Sleary\xe2\x80\x99s company gradually gathered\r\ntogether from the upper regions, where they were quartered, and, from\r\nstanding about, talking in low voices to one another and to Mr. Childers,\r\ngradually insinuated themselves and him into the room.  There were two or\r\nthree handsome young women among them, with their two or three husbands,\r\nand their two or three mothers, and their eight or nine little children,\r\nwho did the fairy business when required.  The father of one of the\r\nfamilies was in the habit of balancing the father of another of the\r\nfamilies on the top of a great pole; the father of a third family often\r\nmade a pyramid of both those fathers, with Master Kidderminster for the\r\napex, and himself for the base; all the fathers could dance upon rolling\r\ncasks, stand upon bottles, catch knives and balls, twirl hand-basins,\r\nride upon anything, jump over everything, and stick at nothing.  All the\r\nmothers could (and did) dance, upon the slack wire and the tight-rope,\r\nand perform rapid acts on bare-backed steeds; none of them were at all\r\nparticular in respect of showing their legs; and one of them, alone in a\r\nGreek chariot, drove six in hand into every town they came to.  They all\r\nassumed to be mighty rakish and knowing, they were not very tidy in their\r\nprivate dresses, they were not at all orderly in their domestic\r\narrangements, and the combined literature of the whole company would have\r\nproduced but a poor letter on any subject.  Yet there was a remarkable\r\ngentleness and childishness about these people, a special inaptitude for\r\nany kind of sharp practice, and an untiring readiness to help and pity\r\none another, deserving often of as much respect, and always of as much\r\ngenerous construction, as the every-day virtues of any class of people in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nLast of all appeared Mr. Sleary: a stout man as already mentioned, with\r\none fixed eye, and one loose eye, a voice (if it can be called so) like\r\nthe efforts of a broken old pair of bellows, a flabby surface, and a\r\nmuddled head which was never sober and never drunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thquire!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Sleary, who was troubled with asthma, and whose\r\nbreath came far too thick and heavy for the letter s, \xe2\x80\x98Your thervant!\r\nThith ith a bad piethe of bithnith, thith ith.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of my Clown\r\nand hith dog being thuppothed to have morrithed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe addressed Mr. Gradgrind, who answered \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Thquire,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, taking off his hat, and rubbing the lining\r\nwith his pocket-handkerchief, which he kept inside for the purpose.  \xe2\x80\x98Ith\r\nit your intenthion to do anything for the poor girl, Thquire?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall have something to propose to her when she comes back,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nGradgrind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Glad to hear it, Thquire.  Not that I want to get rid of the child, any\r\nmore than I want to thtand in her way.  I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to take her prentith,\r\nthough at her age ith late.  My voithe ith a little huthky, Thquire, and\r\nnot eathy heard by them ath don\xe2\x80\x99t know me; but if you\xe2\x80\x99d been chilled and\r\nheated, heated and chilled, chilled and heated in the ring when you wath\r\nyoung, ath often ath I have been, _your_ voithe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have lathted\r\nout, Thquire, no more than mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What thall it be, Thquire, while you wait?  Thall it be Therry?  Give it\r\na name, Thquire!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Sleary, with hospitable ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing for me, I thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t thay nothing, Thquire.  What doth your friend thay?  If you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t took your feed yet, have a glath of bitterth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere his daughter Josephine\xe2\x80\x94a pretty fair-haired girl of eighteen, who\r\nhad been tied on a horse at two years old, and had made a will at twelve,\r\nwhich she always carried about with her, expressive of her dying desire\r\nto be drawn to the grave by the two piebald ponies\xe2\x80\x94cried, \xe2\x80\x98Father, hush!\r\nshe has come back!\xe2\x80\x99  Then came Sissy Jupe, running into the room as she\r\nhad run out of it.  And when she saw them all assembled, and saw their\r\nlooks, and saw no father there, she broke into a most deplorable cry, and\r\ntook refuge on the bosom of the most accomplished tight-rope lady\r\n(herself in the family-way), who knelt down on the floor to nurse her,\r\nand to weep over her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ith an internal thame, upon my thoul it ith,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sleary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O my dear father, my good kind father, where are you gone?  You are gone\r\nto try to do me some good, I know!  You are gone away for my sake, I am\r\nsure!  And how miserable and helpless you will be without me, poor, poor\r\nfather, until you come back!\xe2\x80\x99  It was so pathetic to hear her saying many\r\nthings of this kind, with her face turned upward, and her arms stretched\r\nout as if she were trying to stop his departing shadow and embrace it,\r\nthat no one spoke a word until Mr. Bounderby (growing impatient) took the\r\ncase in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, good people all,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98this is wanton waste of time.  Let the\r\ngirl understand the fact.  Let her take it from me, if you like, who have\r\nbeen run away from, myself.  Here, what\xe2\x80\x99s your name!  Your father has\r\nabsconded\xe2\x80\x94deserted you\xe2\x80\x94and you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to see him again as long as\r\nyou live.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey cared so little for plain Fact, these people, and were in that\r\nadvanced state of degeneracy on the subject, that instead of being\r\nimpressed by the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s strong common sense, they took it in\r\nextraordinary dudgeon.  The men muttered \xe2\x80\x98Shame!\xe2\x80\x99 and the women \xe2\x80\x98Brute!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand Sleary, in some haste, communicated the following hint, apart to Mr.\r\nBounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you what, Thquire.  To thpeak plain to you, my opinion ith that\r\nyou had better cut it thort, and drop it.  They\xe2\x80\x99re a very good natur\xe2\x80\x99d\r\npeople, my people, but they\xe2\x80\x99re accuthtomed to be quick in their\r\nmovementh; and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t act upon my advithe, I\xe2\x80\x99m damned if I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve they\xe2\x80\x99ll pith you out o\xe2\x80\x99 winder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby being restrained by this mild suggestion, Mr. Gradgrind\r\nfound an opening for his eminently practical exposition of the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is of no moment,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98whether this person is to be expected\r\nback at any time, or the contrary.  He is gone away, and there is no\r\npresent expectation of his return.  That, I believe, is agreed on all\r\nhands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thath agreed, Thquire.  Thick to that!\xe2\x80\x99  From Sleary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well then.  I, who came here to inform the father of the poor girl,\r\nJupe, that she could not be received at the school any more, in\r\nconsequence of there being practical objections, into which I need not\r\nenter, to the reception there of the children of persons so employed, am\r\nprepared in these altered circumstances to make a proposal.  I am willing\r\nto take charge of you, Jupe, and to educate you, and provide for you.\r\nThe only condition (over and above your good behaviour) I make is, that\r\nyou decide now, at once, whether to accompany me or remain here.  Also,\r\nthat if you accompany me now, it is understood that you communicate no\r\nmore with any of your friends who are here present.  These observations\r\ncomprise the whole of the case.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At the thame time,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sleary, \xe2\x80\x98I mutht put in my word, Thquire, tho\r\nthat both thides of the banner may be equally theen.  If you like,\r\nThethilia, to be prentitht, you know the natur of the work and you know\r\nyour companionth.  Emma Gordon, in whothe lap you\xe2\x80\x99re a lying at prethent,\r\nwould be a mother to you, and Joth\xe2\x80\x99phine would be a thithter to you.  I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be of the angel breed myself, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t thay but what,\r\nwhen you mith\xe2\x80\x99d your tip, you\xe2\x80\x99d find me cut up rough, and thwear an oath\r\nor two at you.  But what I thay, Thquire, ith, that good tempered or bad\r\ntempered, I never did a horthe a injury yet, no more than thwearing at\r\nhim went, and that I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect I thall begin otherwithe at my time of\r\nlife, with a rider.  I never wath much of a Cackler, Thquire, and I have\r\nthed my thay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this speech was addressed to Mr. Gradgrind, who\r\nreceived it with a grave inclination of his head, and then remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The only observation I will make to you, Jupe, in the way of influencing\r\nyour decision, is, that it is highly desirable to have a sound practical\r\neducation, and that even your father himself (from what I understand)\r\nappears, on your behalf, to have known and felt that much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe last words had a visible effect upon her.  She stopped in her wild\r\ncrying, a little detached herself from Emma Gordon, and turned her face\r\nfull upon her patron.  The whole company perceived the force of the\r\nchange, and drew a long breath together, that plainly said, \xe2\x80\x98she will\r\ngo!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Be sure you know your own mind, Jupe,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Gradgrind cautioned her; \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nsay no more.  Be sure you know your own mind!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When father comes back,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the girl, bursting into tears again after\r\na minute\xe2\x80\x99s silence, \xe2\x80\x98how will he ever find me if I go away!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may be quite at ease,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, calmly; he worked out the\r\nwhole matter like a sum: \xe2\x80\x98you may be quite at ease, Jupe, on that score.\r\nIn such a case, your father, I apprehend, must find out Mr.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thleary.  Thath my name, Thquire.  Not athamed of it.  Known all over\r\nEngland, and alwayth paythe ith way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Must find out Mr. Sleary, who would then let him know where you went.  I\r\nshould have no power of keeping you against his wish, and he would have\r\nno difficulty, at any time, in finding Mr. Thomas Gradgrind of Coketown.\r\nI am well known.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well known,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Mr. Sleary, rolling his loose eye.  \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re one of\r\nthe thort, Thquire, that keepth a prethiouth thight of money out of the\r\nhouthe.  But never mind that at prethent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was another silence; and then she exclaimed, sobbing with her hands\r\nbefore her face, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, give me my clothes, give me my clothes, and let me\r\ngo away before I break my heart!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe women sadly bestirred themselves to get the clothes together\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nsoon done, for they were not many\xe2\x80\x94and to pack them in a basket which had\r\noften travelled with them.  Sissy sat all the time upon the ground, still\r\nsobbing, and covering her eyes.  Mr. Gradgrind and his friend Bounderby\r\nstood near the door, ready to take her away.  Mr. Sleary stood in the\r\nmiddle of the room, with the male members of the company about him,\r\nexactly as he would have stood in the centre of the ring during his\r\ndaughter Josephine\xe2\x80\x99s performance.  He wanted nothing but his whip.\r\n\r\nThe basket packed in silence, they brought her bonnet to her, and\r\nsmoothed her disordered hair, and put it on.  Then they pressed about\r\nher, and bent over her in very natural attitudes, kissing and embracing\r\nher: and brought the children to take leave of her; and were a\r\ntender-hearted, simple, foolish set of women altogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Jupe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98If you are quite determined, come!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut she had to take her farewell of the male part of the company yet, and\r\nevery one of them had to unfold his arms (for they all assumed the\r\nprofessional attitude when they found themselves near Sleary), and give\r\nher a parting kiss\xe2\x80\x94Master Kidderminster excepted, in whose young nature\r\nthere was an original flavour of the misanthrope, who was also known to\r\nhave harboured matrimonial views, and who moodily withdrew.  Mr. Sleary\r\nwas reserved until the last.  Opening his arms wide he took her by both\r\nher hands, and would have sprung her up and down, after the riding-master\r\nmanner of congratulating young ladies on their dismounting from a rapid\r\nact; but there was no rebound in Sissy, and she only stood before him\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sleary.  \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll make your fortun, I hope, and\r\nnone of our poor folkth will ever trouble you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll pound it.  I with\r\nyour father hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken hith dog with him; ith a ill-conwenienth to have\r\nthe dog out of the billth.  But on thecond thoughth, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nperformed without hith mathter, tho ith ath broad ath ith long!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith that he regarded her attentively with his fixed eye, surveyed his\r\ncompany with his loose one, kissed her, shook his head, and handed her to\r\nMr. Gradgrind as to a horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There the ith, Thquire,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, sweeping her with a professional\r\nglance as if she were being adjusted in her seat, \xe2\x80\x98and the\xe2\x80\x99ll do you\r\njuthtithe.  Good-bye, Thethilia!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, Cecilia!\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, Sissy!\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98God bless you, dear!\xe2\x80\x99  In a\r\nvariety of voices from all the room.\r\n\r\nBut the riding-master eye had observed the bottle of the nine oils in her\r\nbosom, and he now interposed with \xe2\x80\x98Leave the bottle, my dear; ith large\r\nto carry; it will be of no uthe to you now.  Give it to me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, in another burst of tears.  \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no!  Pray let me\r\nkeep it for father till he comes back!  He will want it when he comes\r\nback.  He had never thought of going away, when he sent me for it.  I\r\nmust keep it for him, if you please!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tho be it, my dear.  (You thee how it ith, Thquire!)  Farewell,\r\nThethilia!  My latht wordth to you ith thith, Thtick to the termth of\r\nyour engagement, be obedient to the Thquire, and forget uth.  But if,\r\nwhen you\xe2\x80\x99re grown up and married and well off, you come upon any\r\nhorthe-riding ever, don\xe2\x80\x99t be hard upon it, don\xe2\x80\x99t be croth with it, give\r\nit a Bethpeak if you can, and think you might do wurth.  People mutht be\r\namuthed, Thquire, thomehow,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Sleary, rendered more pursy than\r\never, by so much talking; \xe2\x80\x98they can\xe2\x80\x99t be alwayth a working, nor yet they\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be alwayth a learning.  Make the betht of uth; not the wurtht.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got my living out of the horthe-riding all my life, I know; but I\r\nconthider that I lay down the philothophy of the thubject when I thay to\r\nyou, Thquire, make the betht of uth: not the wurtht!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Sleary philosophy was propounded as they went downstairs and the\r\nfixed eye of Philosophy\xe2\x80\x94and its rolling eye, too\xe2\x80\x94soon lost the three\r\nfigures and the basket in the darkness of the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nMRS. SPARSIT\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BOUNDERBY being a bachelor, an elderly lady presided over his\r\nestablishment, in consideration of a certain annual stipend.  Mrs.\r\nSparsit was this lady\xe2\x80\x99s name; and she was a prominent figure in\r\nattendance on Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s car, as it rolled along in triumph with the\r\nBully of humility inside.\r\n\r\nFor, Mrs. Sparsit had not only seen different days, but was highly\r\nconnected.  She had a great aunt living in these very times called Lady\r\nScadgers.  Mr. Sparsit, deceased, of whom she was the relict, had been by\r\nthe mother\xe2\x80\x99s side what Mrs. Sparsit still called \xe2\x80\x98a Powler.\xe2\x80\x99  Strangers\r\nof limited information and dull apprehension were sometimes observed not\r\nto know what a Powler was, and even to appear uncertain whether it might\r\nbe a business, or a political party, or a profession of faith.  The\r\nbetter class of minds, however, did not need to be informed that the\r\nPowlers were an ancient stock, who could trace themselves so exceedingly\r\nfar back that it was not surprising if they sometimes lost\r\nthemselves\xe2\x80\x94which they had rather frequently done, as respected\r\nhorse-flesh, blind-hookey, Hebrew monetary transactions, and the\r\nInsolvent Debtors\xe2\x80\x99 Court.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Sparsit, being by the mother\xe2\x80\x99s side a Powler, married this\r\nlady, being by the father\xe2\x80\x99s side a Scadgers.  Lady Scadgers (an immensely\r\nfat old woman, with an inordinate appetite for butcher\xe2\x80\x99s meat, and a\r\nmysterious leg which had now refused to get out of bed for fourteen\r\nyears) contrived the marriage, at a period when Sparsit was just of age,\r\nand chiefly noticeable for a slender body, weakly supported on two long\r\nslim props, and surmounted by no head worth mentioning.  He inherited a\r\nfair fortune from his uncle, but owed it all before he came into it, and\r\nspent it twice over immediately afterwards.  Thus, when he died, at\r\ntwenty-four (the scene of his decease, Calais, and the cause, brandy), he\r\ndid not leave his widow, from whom he had been separated soon after the\r\nhoneymoon, in affluent circumstances.  That bereaved lady, fifteen years\r\nolder than he, fell presently at deadly feud with her only relative, Lady\r\nScadgers; and, partly to spite her ladyship, and partly to maintain\r\nherself, went out at a salary.  And here she was now, in her elderly\r\ndays, with the Coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows\r\nwhich had captivated Sparsit, making Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s tea as he took his\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nIf Bounderby had been a Conqueror, and Mrs. Sparsit a captive Princess\r\nwhom he took about as a feature in his state-processions, he could not\r\nhave made a greater flourish with her than he habitually did.  Just as it\r\nbelonged to his boastfulness to depreciate his own extraction, so it\r\nbelonged to it to exalt Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s.  In the measure that he would not\r\nallow his own youth to have been attended by a single favourable\r\ncircumstance, he brightened Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile career with every\r\npossible advantage, and showered waggon-loads of early roses all over\r\nthat lady\xe2\x80\x99s path.  \xe2\x80\x98And yet, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he would say, \xe2\x80\x98how does it turn out\r\nafter all?  Why here she is at a hundred a year (I give her a hundred,\r\nwhich she is pleased to term handsome), keeping the house of Josiah\r\nBounderby of Coketown!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNay, he made this foil of his so very widely known, that third parties\r\ntook it up, and handled it on some occasions with considerable briskness.\r\nIt was one of the most exasperating attributes of Bounderby, that he not\r\nonly sang his own praises but stimulated other men to sing them.  There\r\nwas a moral infection of clap-trap in him.  Strangers, modest enough\r\nelsewhere, started up at dinners in Coketown, and boasted, in quite a\r\nrampant way, of Bounderby.  They made him out to be the Royal arms, the\r\nUnion-Jack, Magna Charta, John Bull, Habeas Corpus, the Bill of Rights,\r\nAn Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s house is his castle, Church and State, and God save the\r\nQueen, all put together.  And as often (and it was very often) as an\r\norator of this kind brought into his peroration,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Princes and lords may flourish or may fade,\r\n    A breath can make them, as a breath has made,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94it was, for certain, more or less understood among the company that he\r\nhad heard of Mrs. Sparsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98you are unusually slow, sir, with\r\nyour breakfast this morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, \xe2\x80\x98I am thinking about Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s whim;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nTom Gradgrind, for a bluff independent manner of speaking\xe2\x80\x94as if somebody\r\nwere always endeavouring to bribe him with immense sums to say Thomas,\r\nand he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; \xe2\x80\x98Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s whim, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, of bringing up the\r\ntumbling-girl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The girl is now waiting to know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98whether she is to\r\ngo straight to the school, or up to the Lodge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She must wait, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98till I know myself.  We\r\nshall have Tom Gradgrind down here presently, I suppose.  If he should\r\nwish her to remain here a day or two longer, of course she can, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course she can if you wish it, Mr. Bounderby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I told him I would give her a shake-down here, last night, in order that\r\nhe might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association\r\nwith Louisa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, Mr. Bounderby?  Very thoughtful of you!\xe2\x80\x99  Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCoriolanian nose underwent a slight expansion of the nostrils, and her\r\nblack eyebrows contracted as she took a sip of tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s tolerably clear to _me_,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98that the little puss can\r\nget small good out of such companionship.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you speaking of young Miss Gradgrind, Mr. Bounderby?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking of Louisa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your observation being limited to \xe2\x80\x9clittle puss,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and there being two little girls in question, I did not know which might\r\nbe indicated by that expression.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Louisa,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98Louisa, Louisa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite another father to Louisa, sir.\xe2\x80\x99  Mrs. Sparsit took a\r\nlittle more tea; and, as she bent her again contracted eyebrows over her\r\nsteaming cup, rather looked as if her classical countenance were invoking\r\nthe infernal gods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you had said I was another father to Tom\xe2\x80\x94young Tom, I mean, not my\r\nfriend Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x94you might have been nearer the mark.  I am going to\r\ntake young Tom into my office.  Going to have him under my wing, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed?  Rather young for that, is he not, sir?\xe2\x80\x99  Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nin addressing Mr. Bounderby, was a word of ceremony, rather exacting\r\nconsideration for herself in the use, than honouring him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to take him at once; he is to finish his educational\r\ncramming before then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98By the Lord Harry, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nenough of it, first and last!  He\xe2\x80\x99d open his eyes, that boy would, if he\r\nknew how empty of learning _my_ young maw was, at his time of life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWhich, by the by, he probably did know, for he had heard of it often\r\nenough.  \xe2\x80\x98But it\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary the difficulty I have on scores of such\r\nsubjects, in speaking to any one on equal terms.  Here, for example, I\r\nhave been speaking to you this morning about tumblers.  Why, what do\r\n_you_ know about tumblers?  At the time when, to have been a tumbler in\r\nthe mud of the streets, would have been a godsend to me, a prize in the\r\nlottery to me, you were at the Italian Opera.  You were coming out of the\r\nItalian Opera, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, in white satin and jewels, a blaze of splendour,\r\nwhen I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a penny to buy a link to light you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I certainly, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a dignity serenely\r\nmournful, \xe2\x80\x98was familiar with the Italian Opera at a very early age.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Egad, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, so was I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x94with the wrong side of it.  A\r\nhard bed the pavement of its Arcade used to make, I assure you.  People\r\nlike you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, accustomed from infancy to lie on Down feathers, have no\r\nidea _how_ hard a paving-stone is, without trying it.  No, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s of no\r\nuse my talking to _you_ about tumblers.  I should speak of foreign\r\ndancers, and the West End of London, and May Fair, and lords and ladies\r\nand honourables.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I trust, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, with decent resignation, \xe2\x80\x98it is\r\nnot necessary that you should do anything of that kind.  I hope I have\r\nlearnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life.  If I have\r\nacquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences, and can\r\nscarcely hear enough of them, I claim no merit for that, since I believe\r\nit is a general sentiment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said her patron, \xe2\x80\x98perhaps some people may be pleased to\r\nsay that they do like to hear, in his own unpolished way, what Josiah\r\nBounderby, of Coketown, has gone through.  But you must confess that you\r\nwere born in the lap of luxury, yourself.  Come, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you know you were\r\nborn in the lap of luxury.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit with a shake of her head, \xe2\x80\x98deny\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby was obliged to get up from table, and stand with his back\r\nto the fire, looking at her; she was such an enhancement of his position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you were in crack society.  Devilish high society,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, warming\r\nhis legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is true, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, with an affectation of humility\r\nthe very opposite of his, and therefore in no danger of jostling it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were in the tiptop fashion, and all the rest of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nBounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a kind of social widowhood upon\r\nher.  \xe2\x80\x98It is unquestionably true.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby, bending himself at the knees, literally embraced his legs\r\nin his great satisfaction and laughed aloud.  Mr. and Miss Gradgrind\r\nbeing then announced, he received the former with a shake of the hand,\r\nand the latter with a kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can Jupe be sent here, Bounderby?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Gradgrind.\r\n\r\nCertainly.  So Jupe was sent there.  On coming in, she curtseyed to Mr.\r\nBounderby, and to his friend Tom Gradgrind, and also to Louisa; but in\r\nher confusion unluckily omitted Mrs. Sparsit.  Observing this, the\r\nblustrous Bounderby had the following remarks to make:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I tell you what, my girl.  The name of that lady by the teapot, is\r\nMrs. Sparsit.  That lady acts as mistress of this house, and she is a\r\nhighly connected lady.  Consequently, if ever you come again into any\r\nroom in this house, you will make a short stay in it if you don\xe2\x80\x99t behave\r\ntowards that lady in your most respectful manner.  Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a\r\nbutton what you do to _me_, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t affect to be anybody.  So far\r\nfrom having high connections I have no connections at all, and I come of\r\nthe scum of the earth.  But towards that lady, I do care what you do; and\r\nyou shall do what is deferential and respectful, or you shall not come\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope, Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, in a conciliatory voice, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nthis was merely an oversight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friend Tom Gradgrind suggests, Mrs. Sparsit,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nthis was merely an oversight.  Very likely.  However, as you are aware,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, I don\xe2\x80\x99t allow of even oversights towards you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are very good indeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head\r\nwith her State humility.  \xe2\x80\x98It is not worth speaking of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSissy, who all this time had been faintly excusing herself with tears in\r\nher eyes, was now waved over by the master of the house to Mr. Gradgrind.\r\nShe stood looking intently at him, and Louisa stood coldly by, with her\r\neyes upon the ground, while he proceeded thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jupe, I have made up my mind to take you into my house; and, when you\r\nare not in attendance at the school, to employ you about Mrs. Gradgrind,\r\nwho is rather an invalid.  I have explained to Miss Louisa\xe2\x80\x94this is Miss\r\nLouisa\xe2\x80\x94the miserable but natural end of your late career; and you are to\r\nexpressly understand that the whole of that subject is past, and is not\r\nto be referred to any more.  From this time you begin your history.  You\r\nare, at present, ignorant, I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir, very,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, curtseying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated;\r\nand you will be a living proof to all who come into communication with\r\nyou, of the advantages of the training you will receive.  You will be\r\nreclaimed and formed.  You have been in the habit now of reading to your\r\nfather, and those people I found you among, I dare say?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nGradgrind, beckoning her nearer to him before he said so, and dropping\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only to father and Merrylegs, sir.  At least I mean to father, when\r\nMerrylegs was always there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind Merrylegs, Jupe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, with a passing frown.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask about him.  I understand you to have been in the habit of\r\nreading to your father?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, yes, sir, thousands of times.  They were the happiest\xe2\x80\x94O, of all the\r\nhappy times we had together, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was only now when her sorrow broke out, that Louisa looked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what,\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Gradgrind, in a still lower voice, \xe2\x80\x98did you read to\r\nyour father, Jupe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About the Fairies, sir, and the Dwarf, and the Hunchback, and the\r\nGenies,\xe2\x80\x99 she sobbed out; \xe2\x80\x98and about\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98that is enough.  Never breathe a word of\r\nsuch destructive nonsense any more.  Bounderby, this is a case for rigid\r\ntraining, and I shall observe it with interest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98I have given you my opinion already, and\r\nI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do as you do.  But, very well, very well.  Since you are bent\r\nupon it, _very_ well!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo, Mr. Gradgrind and his daughter took Cecilia Jupe off with them to\r\nStone Lodge, and on the way Louisa never spoke one word, good or bad.\r\nAnd Mr. Bounderby went about his daily pursuits.  And Mrs. Sparsit got\r\nbehind her eyebrows and meditated in the gloom of that retreat, all the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nNEVER WONDER\r\n\r\n\r\nLET us strike the key-note again, before pursuing the tune.\r\n\r\nWhen she was half a dozen years younger, Louisa had been overheard to\r\nbegin a conversation with her brother one day, by saying \xe2\x80\x98Tom, I\r\nwonder\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94upon which Mr. Gradgrind, who was the person overhearing, stepped\r\nforth into the light and said, \xe2\x80\x98Louisa, never wonder!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHerein lay the spring of the mechanical art and mystery of educating the\r\nreason without stooping to the cultivation of the sentiments and\r\naffections.  Never wonder.  By means of addition, subtraction,\r\nmultiplication, and division, settle everything somehow, and never\r\nwonder.  Bring to me, says M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild, yonder baby just able to walk,\r\nand I will engage that it shall never wonder.\r\n\r\nNow, besides very many babies just able to walk, there happened to be in\r\nCoketown a considerable population of babies who had been walking against\r\ntime towards the infinite world, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years and\r\nmore.  These portentous infants being alarming creatures to stalk about\r\nin any human society, the eighteen denominations incessantly scratched\r\none another\xe2\x80\x99s faces and pulled one another\xe2\x80\x99s hair by way of agreeing on\r\nthe steps to be taken for their improvement\xe2\x80\x94which they never did; a\r\nsurprising circumstance, when the happy adaptation of the means to the\r\nend is considered.  Still, although they differed in every other\r\nparticular, conceivable and inconceivable (especially inconceivable),\r\nthey were pretty well united on the point that these unlucky infants were\r\nnever to wonder.  Body number one, said they must take everything on\r\ntrust.  Body number two, said they must take everything on political\r\neconomy.  Body number three, wrote leaden little books for them, showing\r\nhow the good grown-up baby invariably got to the Savings-bank, and the\r\nbad grown-up baby invariably got transported.  Body number four, under\r\ndreary pretences of being droll (when it was very melancholy indeed),\r\nmade the shallowest pretences of concealing pitfalls of knowledge, into\r\nwhich it was the duty of these babies to be smuggled and inveigled.  But,\r\nall the bodies agreed that they were never to wonder.\r\n\r\nThere was a library in Coketown, to which general access was easy.  Mr.\r\nGradgrind greatly tormented his mind about what the people read in this\r\nlibrary: a point whereon little rivers of tabular statements periodically\r\nflowed into the howling ocean of tabular statements, which no diver ever\r\ngot to any depth in and came up sane.  It was a disheartening\r\ncircumstance, but a melancholy fact, that even these readers persisted in\r\nwondering.  They wondered about human nature, human passions, human hopes\r\nand fears, the struggles, triumphs and defeats, the cares and joys and\r\nsorrows, the lives and deaths of common men and women!  They sometimes,\r\nafter fifteen hours\xe2\x80\x99 work, sat down to read mere fables about men and\r\nwomen, more or less like themselves, and about children, more or less\r\nlike their own.  They took De Foe to their bosoms, instead of Euclid, and\r\nseemed to be on the whole more comforted by Goldsmith than by Cocker.\r\nMr. Gradgrind was for ever working, in print and out of print, at this\r\neccentric sum, and he never could make out how it yielded this\r\nunaccountable product.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sick of my life, Loo.  I, hate it altogether, and I hate everybody\r\nexcept you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the unnatural young Thomas Gradgrind in the\r\nhair-cutting chamber at twilight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t hate Sissy, Tom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hate to be obliged to call her Jupe.  And she hates me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom,\r\nmoodily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, she does not, Tom, I am sure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She must,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98She must just hate and detest the whole set-out\r\nof us.  They\xe2\x80\x99ll bother her head off, I think, before they have done with\r\nher.  Already she\xe2\x80\x99s getting as pale as wax, and as heavy as\xe2\x80\x94I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYoung Thomas expressed these sentiments sitting astride of a chair before\r\nthe fire, with his arms on the back, and his sulky face on his arms.  His\r\nsister sat in the darker corner by the fireside, now looking at him, now\r\nlooking at the bright sparks as they dropped upon the hearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, tumbling his hair all manner of ways with his sulky\r\nhands, \xe2\x80\x98I am a Donkey, that\xe2\x80\x99s what _I_ am.  I am as obstinate as one, I\r\nam more stupid than one, I get as much pleasure as one, and I should like\r\nto kick like one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not me, I hope, Tom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Loo; I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt _you_.  I made an exception of you at first.  I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what this\xe2\x80\x94jolly old\xe2\x80\x94Jaundiced Jail,\xe2\x80\x99 Tom had paused to find a\r\nsufficiently complimentary and expressive name for the parental roof, and\r\nseemed to relieve his mind for a moment by the strong alliteration of\r\nthis one, \xe2\x80\x98would be without you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, Tom?  Do you really and truly say so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, of course I do.  What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking about it!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Tom,\r\nchafing his face on his coat-sleeve, as if to mortify his flesh, and have\r\nit in unison with his spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because, Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 said his sister, after silently watching the sparks\r\nawhile, \xe2\x80\x98as I get older, and nearer growing up, I often sit wondering\r\nhere, and think how unfortunate it is for me that I can\xe2\x80\x99t reconcile you\r\nto home better than I am able to do.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what other girls know.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t play to you, or sing to you.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to you so as to\r\nlighten your mind, for I never see any amusing sights or read any amusing\r\nbooks that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about, when\r\nyou are tired.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, no more do I.  I am as bad as you in that respect; and I am a Mule\r\ntoo, which you\xe2\x80\x99re not.  If father was determined to make me either a Prig\r\nor a Mule, and I am not a Prig, why, it stands to reason, I must be a\r\nMule.  And so I am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, desperately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a great pity,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, after another pause, and speaking\r\nthoughtfully out of her dark corner: \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a great pity, Tom.  It\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nunfortunate for both of us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!  You,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom; \xe2\x80\x98you are a girl, Loo, and a girl comes out of it\r\nbetter than a boy does.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t miss anything in you.  You are the only\r\npleasure I have\xe2\x80\x94you can brighten even this place\xe2\x80\x94and you can always lead\r\nme as you like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a dear brother, Tom; and while you think I can do such things, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t so much mind knowing better.  Though I do know better, Tom, and am\r\nvery sorry for it.\xe2\x80\x99  She came and kissed him, and went back into her\r\ncorner again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I could collect all the Facts we hear so much about,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom,\r\nspitefully setting his teeth, \xe2\x80\x98and all the Figures, and all the people\r\nwho found them out: and I wish I could put a thousand barrels of\r\ngunpowder under them, and blow them all up together!  However, when I go\r\nto live with old Bounderby, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have my revenge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your revenge, Tom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ll enjoy myself a little, and go about and see something, and\r\nhear something.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll recompense myself for the way in which I have been\r\nbrought up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But don\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint yourself beforehand, Tom.  Mr. Bounderby thinks as\r\nfather thinks, and is a great deal rougher, and not half so kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, laughing; \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that.  I shall very well know how\r\nto manage and smooth old Bounderby!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTheir shadows were defined upon the wall, but those of the high presses\r\nin the room were all blended together on the wall and on the ceiling, as\r\nif the brother and sister were overhung by a dark cavern.  Or, a fanciful\r\nimagination\xe2\x80\x94if such treason could have been there\xe2\x80\x94might have made it out\r\nto be the shadow of their subject, and of its lowering association with\r\ntheir future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is your great mode of smoothing and managing, Tom?  Is it a\r\nsecret?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, \xe2\x80\x98if it is a secret, it\xe2\x80\x99s not far off.  It\xe2\x80\x99s you.  You are\r\nhis little pet, you are his favourite; he\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything for you.  When\r\nhe says to me what I don\xe2\x80\x99t like, I shall say to him, \xe2\x80\x9cMy sister Loo will\r\nbe hurt and disappointed, Mr. Bounderby.  She always used to tell me she\r\nwas sure you would be easier with me than this.\xe2\x80\x9d  That\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him\r\nabout, or nothing will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter waiting for some answering remark, and getting none, Tom wearily\r\nrelapsed into the present time, and twined himself yawning round and\r\nabout the rails of his chair, and rumpled his head more and more, until\r\nhe suddenly looked up, and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you gone to sleep, Loo?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Tom.  I am looking at the fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You seem to find more to look at in it than ever I could find,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nTom.  \xe2\x80\x98Another of the advantages, I suppose, of being a girl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 enquired his sister, slowly, and in a curious tone, as if she were\r\nreading what she asked in the fire, and it was not quite plainly written\r\nthere, \xe2\x80\x98do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to Mr.\r\nBounderby\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to be said of it,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Tom, pushing his\r\nchair from him, and standing up; \xe2\x80\x98it will be getting away from home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is one thing to be said of it,\xe2\x80\x99 Louisa repeated in her former\r\ncurious tone; \xe2\x80\x98it will be getting away from home.  Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not but what I shall be very unwilling, both to leave you, Loo, and to\r\nleave you here.  But I must go, you know, whether I like it or not; and I\r\nhad better go where I can take with me some advantage of your influence,\r\nthan where I should lose it altogether.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Tom.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe answer was so long in coming, though there was no indecision in it,\r\nthat Tom went and leaned on the back of her chair, to contemplate the\r\nfire which so engrossed her, from her point of view, and see what he\r\ncould make of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Except that it is a fire,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, \xe2\x80\x98it looks to me as stupid and blank\r\nas everything else looks.  What do you see in it?  Not a circus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything in it, Tom, particularly.  But since I have been\r\nlooking at it, I have been wondering about you and me, grown up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wondering again!\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have such unmanageable thoughts,\xe2\x80\x99 returned his sister, \xe2\x80\x98that they\r\n_will_ wonder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I beg of you, Louisa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Gradgrind, who had opened the door\r\nwithout being heard, \xe2\x80\x98to do nothing of that description, for goodness\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsake, you inconsiderate girl, or I shall never hear the last of it from\r\nyour father.  And, Thomas, it is really shameful, with my poor head\r\ncontinually wearing me out, that a boy brought up as you have been, and\r\nwhose education has cost what yours has, should be found encouraging his\r\nsister to wonder, when he knows his father has expressly said that she is\r\nnot to do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa denied Tom\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the offence; but her mother stopped\r\nher with the conclusive answer, \xe2\x80\x98Louisa, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me, in my state of\r\nhealth; for unless you had been encouraged, it is morally and physically\r\nimpossible that you could have done it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was encouraged by nothing, mother, but by looking at the red sparks\r\ndropping out of the fire, and whitening and dying.  It made me think,\r\nafter all, how short my life would be, and how little I could hope to do\r\nin it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Gradgrind, rendered almost energetic.  \xe2\x80\x98Nonsense!\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t stand there and tell me such stuff, Louisa, to my face, when you\r\nknow very well that if it was ever to reach your father\xe2\x80\x99s ears I should\r\nnever hear the last of it.  After all the trouble that has been taken\r\nwith you!  After the lectures you have attended, and the experiments you\r\nhave seen!  After I have heard you myself, when the whole of my right\r\nside has been benumbed, going on with your master about combustion, and\r\ncalcination, and calorification, and I may say every kind of ation that\r\ncould drive a poor invalid distracted, to hear you talking in this absurd\r\nway about sparks and ashes!  I wish,\xe2\x80\x99 whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind, taking a\r\nchair, and discharging her strongest point before succumbing under these\r\nmere shadows of facts, \xe2\x80\x98yes, I really _do_ wish that I had never had a\r\nfamily, and then you would have known what it was to do without me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nSISSY\xe2\x80\x99S PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nSISSY JUPE had not an easy time of it, between Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild and\r\nMrs. Gradgrind, and was not without strong impulses, in the first months\r\nof her probation, to run away.  It hailed facts all day long so very\r\nhard, and life in general was opened to her as such a closely ruled\r\nciphering-book, that assuredly she would have run away, but for only one\r\nrestraint.\r\n\r\nIt is lamentable to think of; but this restraint was the result of no\r\narithmetical process, was self-imposed in defiance of all calculation,\r\nand went dead against any table of probabilities that any Actuary would\r\nhave drawn up from the premises.  The girl believed that her father had\r\nnot deserted her; she lived in the hope that he would come back, and in\r\nthe faith that he would be made the happier by her remaining where she\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nThe wretched ignorance with which Jupe clung to this consolation,\r\nrejecting the superior comfort of knowing, on a sound arithmetical basis,\r\nthat her father was an unnatural vagabond, filled Mr. Gradgrind with\r\npity.  Yet, what was to be done?  M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild reported that she had a\r\nvery dense head for figures; that, once possessed with a general idea of\r\nthe globe, she took the smallest conceivable interest in its exact\r\nmeasurements; that she was extremely slow in the acquisition of dates,\r\nunless some pitiful incident happened to be connected therewith; that she\r\nwould burst into tears on being required (by the mental process)\r\nimmediately to name the cost of two hundred and forty-seven muslin caps\r\nat fourteen-pence halfpenny; that she was as low down, in the school, as\r\nlow could be; that after eight weeks of induction into the elements of\r\nPolitical Economy, she had only yesterday been set right by a prattler\r\nthree feet high, for returning to the question, \xe2\x80\x98What is the first\r\nprinciple of this science?\xe2\x80\x99 the absurd answer, \xe2\x80\x98To do unto others as I\r\nwould that they should do unto me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind observed, shaking his head, that all this was very bad;\r\nthat it showed the necessity of infinite grinding at the mill of\r\nknowledge, as per system, schedule, blue book, report, and tabular\r\nstatements A to Z; and that Jupe \xe2\x80\x98must be kept to it.\xe2\x80\x99  So Jupe was kept\r\nto it, and became low-spirited, but no wiser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be a fine thing to be you, Miss Louisa!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, one night,\r\nwhen Louisa had endeavoured to make her perplexities for next day\r\nsomething clearer to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should know so much, Miss Louisa.  All that is difficult to me now,\r\nwould be so easy then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You might not be the better for it, Sissy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSissy submitted, after a little hesitation, \xe2\x80\x98I should not be the worse,\r\nMiss Louisa.\xe2\x80\x99  To which Miss Louisa answered, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere had been so little communication between these two\xe2\x80\x94both because\r\nlife at Stone Lodge went monotonously round like a piece of machinery\r\nwhich discouraged human interference, and because of the prohibition\r\nrelative to Sissy\xe2\x80\x99s past career\xe2\x80\x94that they were still almost strangers.\r\nSissy, with her dark eyes wonderingly directed to Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s face, was\r\nuncertain whether to say more or to remain silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are more useful to my mother, and more pleasant with her than I can\r\never be,\xe2\x80\x99 Louisa resumed.  \xe2\x80\x98You are pleasanter to yourself, than _I_ am\r\nto _my_self.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, if you please, Miss Louisa,\xe2\x80\x99 Sissy pleaded, \xe2\x80\x98I am\xe2\x80\x94O so stupid!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa, with a brighter laugh than usual, told her she would be wiser\r\nby-and-by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sissy, half crying, \xe2\x80\x98what a stupid girl I am.  All\r\nthrough school hours I make mistakes.  Mr. and Mrs. M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild call\r\nme up, over and over again, regularly to make mistakes.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nthem.  They seem to come natural to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. and Mrs. M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves, I\r\nsuppose, Sissy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no!\xe2\x80\x99 she eagerly returned.  \xe2\x80\x98They know everything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me some of your mistakes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am almost ashamed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sissy, with reluctance.  \xe2\x80\x98But to-day, for\r\ninstance, Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild was explaining to us about Natural\r\nProsperity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98National, I think it must have been,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it was.\xe2\x80\x94But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it the same?\xe2\x80\x99 she timidly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better say, National, as he said so,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Louisa, with her\r\ndry reserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98National Prosperity.  And he said, Now, this schoolroom is a Nation.\r\nAnd in this nation, there are fifty millions of money.  Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this a\r\nprosperous nation?  Girl number twenty, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this a prosperous nation,\r\nand a\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you in a thriving state?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you say?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Louisa, I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.  I thought I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it\r\nwas a prosperous nation or not, and whether I was in a thriving state or\r\nnot, unless I knew who had got the money, and whether any of it was mine.\r\nBut that had nothing to do with it.  It was not in the figures at all,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Sissy, wiping her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was a great mistake of yours,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Miss Louisa, I know it was, now.  Then Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild said he\r\nwould try me again.  And he said, This schoolroom is an immense town, and\r\nin it there are a million of inhabitants, and only five-and-twenty are\r\nstarved to death in the streets, in the course of a year.  What is your\r\nremark on that proportion?  And my remark was\xe2\x80\x94for I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of a\r\nbetter one\xe2\x80\x94that I thought it must be just as hard upon those who were\r\nstarved, whether the others were a million, or a million million.  And\r\nthat was wrong, too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course it was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild said he would try me once more.  And he said,\r\nHere are the stutterings\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Statistics,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Miss Louisa\xe2\x80\x94they always remind me of stutterings, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanother of my mistakes\xe2\x80\x94of accidents upon the sea.  And I find (Mr.\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild said) that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went\r\nto sea on long voyages, and only five hundred of them were drowned or\r\nburnt to death.  What is the percentage?  And I said, Miss;\xe2\x80\x99 here Sissy\r\nfairly sobbed as confessing with extreme contrition to her greatest\r\nerror; \xe2\x80\x98I said it was nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, Sissy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, Miss\xe2\x80\x94to the relations and friends of the people who were\r\nkilled.  I shall never learn,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sissy.  \xe2\x80\x98And the worst of all is,\r\nthat although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I\r\nam so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed\r\nbefore her, until it was raised again to glance at her face.  Then she\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well\r\ntaught too, Sissy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that\r\nthey were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, \xe2\x80\x98No one hears\r\nus; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an\r\ninnocent question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Miss Louisa,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her\r\nhead; \xe2\x80\x98father knows very little indeed.  It\xe2\x80\x99s as much as he can do to\r\nwrite; and it\xe2\x80\x99s more than people in general can do to read his writing.\r\nThough it\xe2\x80\x99s plain to _me_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your mother?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father says she was quite a scholar.  She died when I was born.  She\r\nwas;\xe2\x80\x99 Sissy made the terrible communication nervously; \xe2\x80\x98she was a\r\ndancer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did your father love her?\xe2\x80\x99  Louisa asked these questions with a strong,\r\nwild, wandering interest peculiar to her; an interest gone astray like a\r\nbanished creature, and hiding in solitary places.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes!  As dearly as he loves me.  Father loved me, first, for her sake.\r\nHe carried me about with him when I was quite a baby.  We have never been\r\nasunder from that time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet he leaves you now, Sissy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only for my good.  Nobody understands him as I do; nobody knows him as I\r\ndo.  When he left me for my good\xe2\x80\x94he never would have left me for his\r\nown\xe2\x80\x94I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial.  He will not be\r\nhappy for a single minute, till he comes back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me more about him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, \xe2\x80\x98I will never ask you again.\r\nWhere did you live?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We travelled about the country, and had no fixed place to live in.\r\nFather\xe2\x80\x99s a;\xe2\x80\x99 Sissy whispered the awful word, \xe2\x80\x98a clown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To make the people laugh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, with a nod of intelligence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.  But they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh sometimes, and then father cried.  Lately,\r\nthey very often wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh, and he used to come home despairing.\r\nFather\xe2\x80\x99s not like most.  Those who didn\xe2\x80\x99t know him as well as I do, and\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t love him as dearly as I do, might believe he was not quite right.\r\nSometimes they played tricks upon him; but they never knew how he felt\r\nthem, and shrunk up, when he was alone with me.  He was far, far timider\r\nthan they thought!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you were his comfort through everything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe nodded, with the tears rolling down her face.  \xe2\x80\x98I hope so, and father\r\nsaid I was.  It was because he grew so scared and trembling, and because\r\nhe felt himself to be a poor, weak, ignorant, helpless man (those used to\r\nbe his words), that he wanted me so much to know a great deal, and be\r\ndifferent from him.  I used to read to him to cheer his courage, and he\r\nwas very fond of that.  They were wrong books\xe2\x80\x94I am never to speak of them\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know there was any harm in them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And he liked them?\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, with a searching gaze on Sissy all this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O very much!  They kept him, many times, from what did him real harm.\r\nAnd often and often of a night, he used to forget all his troubles in\r\nwondering whether the Sultan would let the lady go on with the story, or\r\nwould have her head cut off before it was finished.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And your father was always kind?  To the last?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Louisa\r\ncontravening the great principle, and wondering very much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Always, always!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Sissy, clasping her hands.  \xe2\x80\x98Kinder and kinder\r\nthan I can tell.  He was angry only one night, and that was not to me,\r\nbut Merrylegs.  Merrylegs;\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered the awful fact; \xe2\x80\x98is his\r\nperforming dog.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why was he angry with the dog?\xe2\x80\x99 Louisa demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to\r\njump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them\xe2\x80\x94which is one\r\nof his tricks.  He looked at father, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it at once.\r\nEverything of father\xe2\x80\x99s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t pleased\r\nthe public at all.  He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing,\r\nand had no compassion on him.  Then he beat the dog, and I was\r\nfrightened, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cFather, father!  Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt the creature who\r\nis so fond of you!  O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!\xe2\x80\x9d  And he stopped,\r\nand the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the\r\ndog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her\r\nhand, and sat down beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy.  Now that I have\r\nasked you so much, tell me the end.  The blame, if there is any blame, is\r\nmine, not yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear Miss Louisa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ncame home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come\r\nhome too, from the booth.  And he sat rocking himself over the fire, as\r\nif he was in pain.  And I said, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you hurt yourself, father?\xe2\x80\x9d (as he\r\ndid sometimes, like they all did), and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cA little, my darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd when I came to stoop down and look up at his face, I saw that he was\r\ncrying.  The more I spoke to him, the more he hid his face; and at first\r\nhe shook all over, and said nothing but \xe2\x80\x9cMy darling;\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMy love!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Tom came lounging in, and stared at the two with a coolness not\r\nparticularly savouring of interest in anything but himself, and not much\r\nof that at present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am asking Sissy a few questions, Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 observed his sister.  \xe2\x80\x98You have\r\nno occasion to go away; but don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt us for a moment, Tom dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! very well!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Only father has brought old Bounderby\r\nhome, and I want you to come into the drawing-room.  Because if you come,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance of old Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s asking me to dinner; and if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, there\xe2\x80\x99s none.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll come directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, \xe2\x80\x98to make sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSissy resumed in a lower voice.  \xe2\x80\x98At last poor father said that he had\r\ngiven no satisfaction again, and never did give any satisfaction now, and\r\nthat he was a shame and disgrace, and I should have done better without\r\nhim all along.  I said all the affectionate things to him that came into\r\nmy heart, and presently he was quiet and I sat down by him, and told him\r\nall about the school and everything that had been said and done there.\r\nWhen I had no more left to tell, he put his arms round my neck, and\r\nkissed me a great many times.  Then he asked me to fetch some of the\r\nstuff he used, for the little hurt he had had, and to get it at the best\r\nplace, which was at the other end of town from there; and then, after\r\nkissing me again, he let me go.  When I had gone down-stairs, I turned\r\nback that I might be a little bit more company to him yet, and looked in\r\nat the door, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cFather dear, shall I take Merrylegs?\xe2\x80\x9d  Father\r\nshook his head and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sissy, no; take nothing that\xe2\x80\x99s known to be\r\nmine, my darling;\xe2\x80\x9d and I left him sitting by the fire.  Then the thought\r\nmust have come upon him, poor, poor father! of going away to try\r\nsomething for my sake; for when I came back, he was gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say!  Look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!\xe2\x80\x99 Tom remonstrated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no more to tell, Miss Louisa.  I keep the nine oils ready for\r\nhim, and I know he will come back.  Every letter that I see in Mr.\r\nGradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes, for I think it\r\ncomes from father, or from Mr. Sleary about father.  Mr. Sleary promised\r\nto write as soon as ever father should be heard of, and I trust to him to\r\nkeep his word.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, with an impatient\r\nwhistle.  \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99ll be off if you don\xe2\x80\x99t look sharp!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter this, whenever Sissy dropped a curtsey to Mr. Gradgrind in the\r\npresence of his family, and said in a faltering way, \xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon,\r\nsir, for being troublesome\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94have you had any letter yet about me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nLouisa would suspend the occupation of the moment, whatever it was, and\r\nlook for the reply as earnestly as Sissy did.  And when Mr. Gradgrind\r\nregularly answered, \xe2\x80\x98No, Jupe, nothing of the sort,\xe2\x80\x99 the trembling of\r\nSissy\xe2\x80\x99s lip would be repeated in Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s face, and her eyes would follow\r\nSissy with compassion to the door.  Mr. Gradgrind usually improved these\r\noccasions by remarking, when she was gone, that if Jupe had been properly\r\ntrained from an early age she would have remonstrated to herself on sound\r\nprinciples the baselessness of these fantastic hopes.  Yet it did seem\r\n(though not to him, for he saw nothing of it) as if fantastic hope could\r\ntake as strong a hold as Fact.\r\n\r\nThis observation must be limited exclusively to his daughter.  As to Tom,\r\nhe was becoming that not unprecedented triumph of calculation which is\r\nusually at work on number one.  As to Mrs. Gradgrind, if she said\r\nanything on the subject, she would come a little way out of her wrappers,\r\nlike a feminine dormouse, and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good gracious bless me, how my poor head is vexed and worried by that\r\ngirl Jupe\xe2\x80\x99s so perseveringly asking, over and over again, about her\r\ntiresome letters!  Upon my word and honour I seem to be fated, and\r\ndestined, and ordained, to live in the midst of things that I am never to\r\nhear the last of.  It really is a most extraordinary circumstance that it\r\nappears as if I never was to hear the last of anything!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt about this point, Mr. Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s eye would fall upon her; and under\r\nthe influence of that wintry piece of fact, she would become torpid\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nSTEPHEN BLACKPOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nI ENTERTAIN a weak idea that the English people are as hard-worked as any\r\npeople upon whom the sun shines.  I acknowledge to this ridiculous\r\nidiosyncrasy, as a reason why I would give them a little more play.\r\n\r\nIn the hardest working part of Coketown; in the innermost fortifications\r\nof that ugly citadel, where Nature was as strongly bricked out as killing\r\nairs and gases were bricked in; at the heart of the labyrinth of narrow\r\ncourts upon courts, and close streets upon streets, which had come into\r\nexistence piecemeal, every piece in a violent hurry for some one man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npurpose, and the whole an unnatural family, shouldering, and trampling,\r\nand pressing one another to death; in the last close nook of this great\r\nexhausted receiver, where the chimneys, for want of air to make a\r\ndraught, were built in an immense variety of stunted and crooked shapes,\r\nas though every house put out a sign of the kind of people who might be\r\nexpected to be born in it; among the multitude of Coketown, generically\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x98the Hands,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94a race who would have found more favour with some\r\npeople, if Providence had seen fit to make them only hands, or, like the\r\nlower creatures of the seashore, only hands and stomachs\xe2\x80\x94lived a certain\r\nStephen Blackpool, forty years of age.\r\n\r\nStephen looked older, but he had had a hard life.  It is said that every\r\nlife has its roses and thorns; there seemed, however, to have been a\r\nmisadventure or mistake in Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s case, whereby somebody else had\r\nbecome possessed of his roses, and he had become possessed of the same\r\nsomebody else\xe2\x80\x99s thorns in addition to his own.  He had known, to use his\r\nwords, a peck of trouble.  He was usually called Old Stephen, in a kind\r\nof rough homage to the fact.\r\n\r\nA rather stooping man, with a knitted brow, a pondering expression of\r\nface, and a hard-looking head sufficiently capacious, on which his\r\niron-grey hair lay long and thin, Old Stephen might have passed for a\r\nparticularly intelligent man in his condition.  Yet he was not.  He took\r\nno place among those remarkable \xe2\x80\x98Hands,\xe2\x80\x99 who, piecing together their\r\nbroken intervals of leisure through many years, had mastered difficult\r\nsciences, and acquired a knowledge of most unlikely things.  He held no\r\nstation among the Hands who could make speeches and carry on debates.\r\nThousands of his compeers could talk much better than he, at any time.\r\nHe was a good power-loom weaver, and a man of perfect integrity.  What\r\nmore he was, or what else he had in him, if anything, let him show for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe lights in the great factories, which looked, when they were\r\nilluminated, like Fairy palaces\xe2\x80\x94or the travellers by express-train said\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94were all extinguished; and the bells had rung for knocking off for the\r\nnight, and had ceased again; and the Hands, men and women, boy and girl,\r\nwere clattering home.  Old Stephen was standing in the street, with the\r\nold sensation upon him which the stoppage of the machinery always\r\nproduced\xe2\x80\x94the sensation of its having worked and stopped in his own head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet I don\xe2\x80\x99t see Rachael, still!\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\nIt was a wet night, and many groups of young women passed him, with their\r\nshawls drawn over their bare heads and held close under their chins to\r\nkeep the rain out.  He knew Rachael well, for a glance at any one of\r\nthese groups was sufficient to show him that she was not there.  At last,\r\nthere were no more to come; and then he turned away, saying in a tone of\r\ndisappointment, \xe2\x80\x98Why, then, ha\xe2\x80\x99 missed her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, he had not gone the length of three streets, when he saw another of\r\nthe shawled figures in advance of him, at which he looked so keenly that\r\nperhaps its mere shadow indistinctly reflected on the wet pavement\xe2\x80\x94if he\r\ncould have seen it without the figure itself moving along from lamp to\r\nlamp, brightening and fading as it went\xe2\x80\x94would have been enough to tell\r\nhim who was there.  Making his pace at once much quicker and much softer,\r\nhe darted on until he was very near this figure, then fell into his\r\nformer walk, and called \xe2\x80\x98Rachael!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe turned, being then in the brightness of a lamp; and raising her hood\r\na little, showed a quiet oval face, dark and rather delicate, irradiated\r\nby a pair of very gentle eyes, and further set off by the perfect order\r\nof her shining black hair.  It was not a face in its first bloom; she was\r\na woman five and thirty years of age.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, lad!  \xe2\x80\x99Tis thou?\xe2\x80\x99  When she had said this, with a smile which would\r\nhave been quite expressed, though nothing of her had been seen but her\r\npleasant eyes, she replaced her hood again, and they went on together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought thou wast ahind me, Rachael?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Early t\xe2\x80\x99night, lass?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Times I\xe2\x80\x99m a little early, Stephen! \xe2\x80\x99times a little late.  I\xe2\x80\x99m never to\r\nbe counted on, going home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor going t\xe2\x80\x99other way, neither, \xe2\x80\x99t seems to me, Rachael?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Stephen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with some disappointment in his face, but with a\r\nrespectful and patient conviction that she must be right in whatever she\r\ndid.  The expression was not lost upon her; she laid her hand lightly on\r\nhis arm a moment as if to thank him for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are such true friends, lad, and such old friends, and getting to be\r\nsuch old folk, now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Rachael, thou\xe2\x80\x99rt as young as ever thou wast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of us would be puzzled how to get old, Stephen, without \xe2\x80\x99t other\r\ngetting so too, both being alive,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, laughing; \xe2\x80\x98but, anyways,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re such old friends, and t\xe2\x80\x99 hide a word of honest truth fro\xe2\x80\x99 one\r\nanother would be a sin and a pity.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis better not to walk too much\r\ntogether.  \xe2\x80\x99Times, yes!  \xe2\x80\x99Twould be hard, indeed, if \xe2\x80\x99twas not to be at\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with a cheerfulness she sought to communicate to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis hard, anyways, Rachael.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Try to think not; and \xe2\x80\x99twill seem better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried a long time, and \xe2\x80\x99ta\xe2\x80\x99nt got better.  But thou\xe2\x80\x99rt right; \xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmight mak fok talk, even of thee.  Thou hast been that to me, Rachael,\r\nthrough so many year: thou hast done me so much good, and heartened of me\r\nin that cheering way, that thy word is a law to me.  Ah, lass, and a\r\nbright good law!  Better than some real ones.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never fret about them, Stephen,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered quickly, and not without\r\nan anxious glance at his face.  \xe2\x80\x98Let the laws be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, with a slow nod or two.  \xe2\x80\x98Let \xe2\x80\x99em be.  Let everything be.\r\nLet all sorts alone.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis a muddle, and that\xe2\x80\x99s aw.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Always a muddle?\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael, with another gentle touch upon his arm,\r\nas if to recall him out of the thoughtfulness, in which he was biting the\r\nlong ends of his loose neckerchief as he walked along.  The touch had its\r\ninstantaneous effect.  He let them fall, turned a smiling face upon her,\r\nand said, as he broke into a good-humoured laugh, \xe2\x80\x98Ay, Rachael, lass,\r\nawlus a muddle.  That\xe2\x80\x99s where I stick.  I come to the muddle many times\r\nand agen, and I never get beyond it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey had walked some distance, and were near their own homes.  The\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s was the first reached.  It was in one of the many small streets\r\nfor which the favourite undertaker (who turned a handsome sum out of the\r\none poor ghastly pomp of the neighbourhood) kept a black ladder, in order\r\nthat those who had done their daily groping up and down the narrow stairs\r\nmight slide out of this working world by the windows.  She stopped at the\r\ncorner, and putting her hand in his, wished him good night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good night, dear lass; good night!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe went, with her neat figure and her sober womanly step, down the dark\r\nstreet, and he stood looking after her until she turned into one of the\r\nsmall houses.  There was not a flutter of her coarse shawl, perhaps, but\r\nhad its interest in this man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; not a tone of her voice but had its\r\necho in his innermost heart.\r\n\r\nWhen she was lost to his view, he pursued his homeward way, glancing up\r\nsometimes at the sky, where the clouds were sailing fast and wildly.\r\nBut, they were broken now, and the rain had ceased, and the moon\r\nshone,\xe2\x80\x94looking down the high chimneys of Coketown on the deep furnaces\r\nbelow, and casting Titanic shadows of the steam-engines at rest, upon the\r\nwalls where they were lodged.  The man seemed to have brightened with the\r\nnight, as he went on.\r\n\r\nHis home, in such another street as the first, saving that it was\r\nnarrower, was over a little shop.  How it came to pass that any people\r\nfound it worth their while to sell or buy the wretched little toys, mixed\r\nup in its window with cheap newspapers and pork (there was a leg to be\r\nraffled for to-morrow-night), matters not here.  He took his end of\r\ncandle from a shelf, lighted it at another end of candle on the counter,\r\nwithout disturbing the mistress of the shop who was asleep in her little\r\nroom, and went upstairs into his lodging.\r\n\r\nIt was a room, not unacquainted with the black ladder under various\r\ntenants; but as neat, at present, as such a room could be.  A few books\r\nand writings were on an old bureau in a corner, the furniture was decent\r\nand sufficient, and, though the atmosphere was tainted, the room was\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nGoing to the hearth to set the candle down upon a round three-legged\r\ntable standing there, he stumbled against something.  As he recoiled,\r\nlooking down at it, it raised itself up into the form of a woman in a\r\nsitting attitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s mercy, woman!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, falling farther off from the figure.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hast thou come back again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSuch a woman!  A disabled, drunken creature, barely able to preserve her\r\nsitting posture by steadying herself with one begrimed hand on the floor,\r\nwhile the other was so purposeless in trying to push away her tangled\r\nhair from her face, that it only blinded her the more with the dirt upon\r\nit.  A creature so foul to look at, in her tatters, stains and splashes,\r\nbut so much fouler than that in her moral infamy, that it was a shameful\r\nthing even to see her.\r\n\r\nAfter an impatient oath or two, and some stupid clawing of herself with\r\nthe hand not necessary to her support, she got her hair away from her\r\neyes sufficiently to obtain a sight of him.  Then she sat swaying her\r\nbody to and fro, and making gestures with her unnerved arm, which seemed\r\nintended as the accompaniment to a fit of laughter, though her face was\r\nstolid and drowsy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eigh, lad?  What, yo\xe2\x80\x99r there?\xe2\x80\x99  Some hoarse sounds meant for this, came\r\nmockingly out of her at last; and her head dropped forward on her breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Back agen?\xe2\x80\x99 she screeched, after some minutes, as if he had that moment\r\nsaid it.  \xe2\x80\x98Yes!  And back agen.  Back agen ever and ever so often.  Back?\r\nYes, back.  Why not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRoused by the unmeaning violence with which she cried it out, she\r\nscrambled up, and stood supporting herself with her shoulders against the\r\nwall; dangling in one hand by the string, a dunghill-fragment of a\r\nbonnet, and trying to look scornfully at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll sell thee off again, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll sell thee off again, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll sell\r\nthee off a score of times!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried, with something between a furious\r\nmenace and an effort at a defiant dance.  \xe2\x80\x98Come awa\xe2\x80\x99 from th\xe2\x80\x99 bed!\xe2\x80\x99  He\r\nwas sitting on the side of it, with his face hidden in his hands.  \xe2\x80\x98Come\r\nawa! from \xe2\x80\x99t.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis mine, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to t\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs she staggered to it, he avoided her with a shudder, and passed\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nface still hidden\xe2\x80\x94to the opposite end of the room.  She threw herself\r\nupon the bed heavily, and soon was snoring hard.  He sunk into a chair,\r\nand moved but once all that night.  It was to throw a covering over her;\r\nas if his hands were not enough to hide her, even in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nNO WAY OUT\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Fairy palaces burst into illumination, before pale morning showed the\r\nmonstrous serpents of smoke trailing themselves over Coketown.  A\r\nclattering of clogs upon the pavement; a rapid ringing of bells; and all\r\nthe melancholy mad elephants, polished and oiled up for the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmonotony, were at their heavy exercise again.\r\n\r\nStephen bent over his loom, quiet, watchful, and steady.  A special\r\ncontrast, as every man was in the forest of looms where Stephen worked,\r\nto the crashing, smashing, tearing piece of mechanism at which he\r\nlaboured.  Never fear, good people of an anxious turn of mind, that Art\r\nwill consign Nature to oblivion.  Set anywhere, side by side, the work of\r\nGOD and the work of man; and the former, even though it be a troop of\r\nHands of very small account, will gain in dignity from the comparison.\r\n\r\nSo many hundred Hands in this Mill; so many hundred horse Steam Power.\r\nIt is known, to the force of a single pound weight, what the engine will\r\ndo; but, not all the calculators of the National Debt can tell me the\r\ncapacity for good or evil, for love or hatred, for patriotism or\r\ndiscontent, for the decomposition of virtue into vice, or the reverse, at\r\nany single moment in the soul of one of these its quiet servants, with\r\nthe composed faces and the regulated actions.  There is no mystery in it;\r\nthere is an unfathomable mystery in the meanest of them, for\r\never.\xe2\x80\x94Supposing we were to reverse our arithmetic for material objects,\r\nand to govern these awful unknown quantities by other means!\r\n\r\nThe day grew strong, and showed itself outside, even against the flaming\r\nlights within.  The lights were turned out, and the work went on.  The\r\nrain fell, and the Smoke-serpents, submissive to the curse of all that\r\ntribe, trailed themselves upon the earth.  In the waste-yard outside, the\r\nsteam from the escape pipe, the litter of barrels and old iron, the\r\nshining heaps of coals, the ashes everywhere, were shrouded in a veil of\r\nmist and rain.\r\n\r\nThe work went on, until the noon-bell rang.  More clattering upon the\r\npavements.  The looms, and wheels, and Hands all out of gear for an hour.\r\n\r\nStephen came out of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold wet streets,\r\nhaggard and worn.  He turned from his own class and his own quarter,\r\ntaking nothing but a little bread as he walked along, towards the hill on\r\nwhich his principal employer lived, in a red house with black outside\r\nshutters, green inside blinds, a black street door, up two white steps,\r\nBOUNDERBY (in letters very like himself) upon a brazen plate, and a round\r\nbrazen door-handle underneath it, like a brazen full-stop.\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby was at his lunch.  So Stephen had expected.  Would his\r\nservant say that one of the Hands begged leave to speak to him?  Message\r\nin return, requiring name of such Hand.  Stephen Blackpool.  There was\r\nnothing troublesome against Stephen Blackpool; yes, he might come in.\r\n\r\nStephen Blackpool in the parlour.  Mr. Bounderby (whom he just knew by\r\nsight), at lunch on chop and sherry.  Mrs. Sparsit netting at the\r\nfireside, in a side-saddle attitude, with one foot in a cotton stirrup.\r\nIt was a part, at once of Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s dignity and service, not to\r\nlunch.  She supervised the meal officially, but implied that in her own\r\nstately person she considered lunch a weakness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Stephen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with _you_?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen made a bow.  Not a servile one\xe2\x80\x94these Hands will never do that!\r\nLord bless you, sir, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never catch them at that, if they have been\r\nwith you twenty years!\xe2\x80\x94and, as a complimentary toilet for Mrs. Sparsit,\r\ntucked his neckerchief ends into his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, taking some sherry, \xe2\x80\x98we have never\r\nhad any difficulty with you, and you have never been one of the\r\nunreasonable ones.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to be set up in a coach and six, and\r\nto be fed on turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon, as a good many\r\nof \xe2\x80\x99em do!\xe2\x80\x99  Mr. Bounderby always represented this to be the sole,\r\nimmediate, and direct object of any Hand who was not entirely satisfied;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and therefore I know already that you have not come here to make a\r\ncomplaint.  Now, you know, I am certain of that, beforehand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir, sure I ha\xe2\x80\x99 not coom for nowt o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby seemed agreeably surprised, notwithstanding his previous\r\nstrong conviction.  \xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned.  \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a steady Hand, and\r\nI was not mistaken.  Now, let me hear what it\xe2\x80\x99s all about.  As it\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nthat, let me hear what it is.  What have you got to say?  Out with it,\r\nlad!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen happened to glance towards Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98I can go, Mr.\r\nBounderby, if you wish it,\xe2\x80\x99 said that self-sacrificing lady, making a\r\nfeint of taking her foot out of the stirrup.\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby stayed her, by holding a mouthful of chop in suspension\r\nbefore swallowing it, and putting out his left hand.  Then, withdrawing\r\nhis hand and swallowing his mouthful of chop, he said to Stephen:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now you know, this good lady is a born lady, a high lady.  You are not\r\nto suppose because she keeps my house for me, that she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been very\r\nhigh up the tree\xe2\x80\x94ah, up at the top of the tree!  Now, if you have got\r\nanything to say that can\xe2\x80\x99t be said before a born lady, this lady will\r\nleave the room.  If what you have got to say _can_ be said before a born\r\nlady, this lady will stay where she is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, I hope I never had nowt to say, not fitten for a born lady to year,\r\nsin\xe2\x80\x99 I were born mysen\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 was the reply, accompanied with a slight flush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, pushing away his plate, and leaning\r\nback.  \xe2\x80\x98Fire away!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ha\xe2\x80\x99 coom,\xe2\x80\x99 Stephen began, raising his eyes from the floor, after a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration, \xe2\x80\x98to ask yo yor advice.  I need \xe2\x80\x99t overmuch.  I\r\nwere married on Eas\xe2\x80\x99r Monday nineteen year sin, long and dree.  She were\r\na young lass\xe2\x80\x94pretty enow\xe2\x80\x94wi\xe2\x80\x99 good accounts of herseln.  Well!  She went\r\nbad\xe2\x80\x94soon.  Not along of me.  Gonnows I were not a unkind husband to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have heard all this before,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98She took to\r\ndrinking, left off working, sold the furniture, pawned the clothes, and\r\nplayed old Gooseberry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I were patient wi\xe2\x80\x99 her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x98The more fool you, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, in confidence to his\r\nwine-glass.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I were very patient wi\xe2\x80\x99 her.  I tried to wean her fra \xe2\x80\x99t ower and ower\r\nagen.  I tried this, I tried that, I tried t\xe2\x80\x99other.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone home,\r\nmany\xe2\x80\x99s the time, and found all vanished as I had in the world, and her\r\nwithout a sense left to bless herseln lying on bare ground.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 dun \xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnot once, not twice\xe2\x80\x94twenty time!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEvery line in his face deepened as he said it, and put in its affecting\r\nevidence of the suffering he had undergone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From bad to worse, from worse to worsen.  She left me.  She disgraced\r\nherseln everyways, bitter and bad.  She coom back, she coom back, she\r\ncoom back.  What could I do t\xe2\x80\x99 hinder her?  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 walked the streets\r\nnights long, ere ever I\xe2\x80\x99d go home.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone t\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 brigg, minded to\r\nfling myseln ower, and ha\xe2\x80\x99 no more on\xe2\x80\x99t.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 bore that much, that I\r\nwere owd when I were young.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit, easily ambling along with her netting-needles, raised the\r\nCoriolanian eyebrows and shook her head, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x98The great\r\nknow trouble as well as the small.  Please to turn your humble eye in My\r\ndirection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ha\xe2\x80\x99 paid her to keep awa\xe2\x80\x99 fra\xe2\x80\x99 me.  These five year I ha\xe2\x80\x99 paid her.  I\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 gotten decent fewtrils about me agen.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 lived hard and sad, but\r\nnot ashamed and fearfo\xe2\x80\x99 a\xe2\x80\x99 the minnits o\xe2\x80\x99 my life.  Last night, I went\r\nhome.  There she lay upon my har-stone!  There she is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the strength of his misfortune, and the energy of his distress, he\r\nfired for the moment like a proud man.  In another moment, he stood as he\r\nhad stood all the time\xe2\x80\x94his usual stoop upon him; his pondering face\r\naddressed to Mr. Bounderby, with a curious expression on it, half shrewd,\r\nhalf perplexed, as if his mind were set upon unravelling something very\r\ndifficult; his hat held tight in his left hand, which rested on his hip;\r\nhis right arm, with a rugged propriety and force of action, very\r\nearnestly emphasizing what he said: not least so when it always paused, a\r\nlittle bent, but not withdrawn, as he paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was acquainted with all this, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98except\r\nthe last clause, long ago.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a bad job; that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is.  You had\r\nbetter have been satisfied as you were, and not have got married.\r\nHowever, it\xe2\x80\x99s too late to say that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was it an unequal marriage, sir, in point of years?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs. Sparsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You hear what this lady asks.  Was it an unequal marriage in point of\r\nyears, this unlucky job of yours?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not e\xe2\x80\x99en so.  I were one-and-twenty myseln; she were twenty nighbut.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit to her Chief, with great placidity.  \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ninferred, from its being so miserable a marriage, that it was probably an\r\nunequal one in point of years.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in a side-long way that\r\nhad an odd sheepishness about it.  He fortified himself with a little\r\nmore sherry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?  Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go on?\xe2\x80\x99 he then asked, turning rather irritably on\r\nStephen Blackpool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ha\xe2\x80\x99 coom to ask yo, sir, how I am to be ridded o\xe2\x80\x99 this woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nStephen infused a yet deeper gravity into the mixed expression of his\r\nattentive face.  Mrs. Sparsit uttered a gentle ejaculation, as having\r\nreceived a moral shock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, getting up to lean his back against\r\nthe chimney-piece.  \xe2\x80\x98What are you talking about?  You took her for better\r\nfor worse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mun\xe2\x80\x99 be ridden o\xe2\x80\x99 her.  I cannot bear \xe2\x80\x99t nommore.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 lived under\r\n\xe2\x80\x99t so long, for that I ha\xe2\x80\x99 had\xe2\x80\x99n the pity and comforting words o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbest lass living or dead.  Haply, but for her, I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone\r\nbattering mad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He wishes to be free, to marry the female of whom he speaks, I fear,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mrs. Sparsit in an undertone, and much dejected by the\r\nimmorality of the people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do.  The lady says what\xe2\x80\x99s right.  I do.  I were a coming to \xe2\x80\x99t.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nread i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 papers that great folk (fair faw \xe2\x80\x99em a\xe2\x80\x99!  I wishes \xe2\x80\x99em no\r\nhurt!) are not bonded together for better for worst so fast, but that\r\nthey can be set free fro\xe2\x80\x99 _their_ misfortnet marriages, an\xe2\x80\x99 marry ower\r\nagen.  When they dunnot agree, for that their tempers is ill-sorted, they\r\nhas rooms o\xe2\x80\x99 one kind an\xe2\x80\x99 another in their houses, above a bit, and they\r\ncan live asunders.  We fok ha\xe2\x80\x99 only one room, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t.  When that\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do, they ha\xe2\x80\x99 gowd an\xe2\x80\x99 other cash, an\xe2\x80\x99 they can say \xe2\x80\x9cThis for yo\xe2\x80\x99\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 that for me,\xe2\x80\x9d an\xe2\x80\x99 they can go their separate ways.  We can\xe2\x80\x99t.  Spite\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 all that, they can be set free for smaller wrongs than mine.  So, I\r\nmun be ridden o\xe2\x80\x99 this woman, and I want t\xe2\x80\x99 know how?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No how,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I do her any hurt, sir, there\xe2\x80\x99s a law to punish me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course there is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I flee from her, there\xe2\x80\x99s a law to punish me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course there is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I marry t\xe2\x80\x99oother dear lass, there\xe2\x80\x99s a law to punish me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course there is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I was to live wi\xe2\x80\x99 her an\xe2\x80\x99 not marry her\xe2\x80\x94saying such a thing could be,\r\nwhich it never could or would, an\xe2\x80\x99 her so good\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a law to punish\r\nme, in every innocent child belonging to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course there is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, a\xe2\x80\x99 God\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen Blackpool, \xe2\x80\x98show me the law to help\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem!  There\xe2\x80\x99s a sanctity in this relation of life,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94it must be kept up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No no, dunnot say that, sir.  \xe2\x80\x99Tan\xe2\x80\x99t kep\xe2\x80\x99 up that way.  Not that way.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis kep\xe2\x80\x99 down that way.  I\xe2\x80\x99m a weaver, I were in a fact\xe2\x80\x99ry when a chilt,\r\nbut I ha\xe2\x80\x99 gotten een to see wi\xe2\x80\x99 and eern to year wi\xe2\x80\x99.  I read in th\xe2\x80\x99\r\npapers every \xe2\x80\x99Sizes, every Sessions\xe2\x80\x94and you read too\xe2\x80\x94I know it!\xe2\x80\x94with\r\ndismay\xe2\x80\x94how th\xe2\x80\x99 supposed unpossibility o\xe2\x80\x99 ever getting unchained from one\r\nanother, at any price, on any terms, brings blood upon this land, and\r\nbrings many common married fok to battle, murder, and sudden death.  Let\r\nus ha\xe2\x80\x99 this, right understood.  Mine\xe2\x80\x99s a grievous case, an\xe2\x80\x99 I want\xe2\x80\x94if yo\r\nwill be so good\xe2\x80\x94t\xe2\x80\x99 know the law that helps me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I tell you what!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, putting his hands in his\r\npockets.  \xe2\x80\x98There _is_ such a law.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen, subsiding into his quiet manner, and never wandering in his\r\nattention, gave a nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it\xe2\x80\x99s not for you at all.  It costs money.  It costs a mint of\r\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How much might that be?\xe2\x80\x99 Stephen calmly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to go to Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons with a suit, and you\xe2\x80\x99d have to\r\ngo to a court of Common Law with a suit, and you\xe2\x80\x99d have to go to the\r\nHouse of Lords with a suit, and you\xe2\x80\x99d have to get an Act of Parliament to\r\nenable you to marry again, and it would cost you (if it was a case of\r\nvery plain sailing), I suppose from a thousand to fifteen hundred pound,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps twice the money.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no other law?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why then, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen, turning white, and motioning with that\r\nright hand of his, as if he gave everything to the four winds, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99_tis_ a\r\nmuddle.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis just a muddle a\xe2\x80\x99toogether, an\xe2\x80\x99 the sooner I am dead, the\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(Mrs. Sparsit again dejected by the impiety of the people.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh, pooh!  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you talk nonsense, my good fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nBounderby, \xe2\x80\x98about things you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand; and don\xe2\x80\x99t you call the\r\nInstitutions of your country a muddle, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll get yourself into a real\r\nmuddle one of these fine mornings.  The institutions of your country are\r\nnot your piece-work, and the only thing you have got to do, is, to mind\r\nyour piece-work.  You didn\xe2\x80\x99t take your wife for fast and for loose; but\r\nfor better for worse.  If she has turned out worse\xe2\x80\x94why, all we have got\r\nto say is, she might have turned out better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis a muddle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen, shaking his head as he moved to the door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis a\xe2\x80\x99 a muddle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Bounderby resumed, as a valedictory\r\naddress.  \xe2\x80\x98With what I shall call your unhallowed opinions, you have been\r\nquite shocking this lady: who, as I have already told you, is a born\r\nlady, and who, as I have not already told you, has had her own marriage\r\nmisfortunes to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds\xe2\x80\x94tens of Thousands\r\nof Pounds!\xe2\x80\x99 (he repeated it with great relish).  \xe2\x80\x98Now, you have always\r\nbeen a steady Hand hitherto; but my opinion is, and so I tell you\r\nplainly, that you are turning into the wrong road.  You have been\r\nlistening to some mischievous stranger or other\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re always about\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe best thing you can do is, to come out of that.  Now you know;\xe2\x80\x99 here\r\nhis countenance expressed marvellous acuteness; \xe2\x80\x98I can see as far into a\r\ngrindstone as another man; farther than a good many, perhaps, because I\r\nhad my nose well kept to it when I was young.  I see traces of the turtle\r\nsoup, and venison, and gold spoon in this.  Yes, I do!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr.\r\nBounderby, shaking his head with obstinate cunning.  \xe2\x80\x98By the Lord Harry,\r\nI do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a very different shake of the head and deep sigh, Stephen said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir, I wish you good day.\xe2\x80\x99  So he left Mr. Bounderby swelling\r\nat his own portrait on the wall, as if he were going to explode himself\r\ninto it; and Mrs. Sparsit still ambling on with her foot in her stirrup,\r\nlooking quite cast down by the popular vices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nTHE OLD WOMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD STEPHEN descended the two white steps, shutting the black door with\r\nthe brazen door-plate, by the aid of the brazen full-stop, to which he\r\ngave a parting polish with the sleeve of his coat, observing that his hot\r\nhand clouded it.  He crossed the street with his eyes bent upon the\r\nground, and thus was walking sorrowfully away, when he felt a touch upon\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\nIt was not the touch he needed most at such a moment\xe2\x80\x94the touch that could\r\ncalm the wild waters of his soul, as the uplifted hand of the sublimest\r\nlove and patience could abate the raging of the sea\xe2\x80\x94yet it was a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand too.  It was an old woman, tall and shapely still, though withered\r\nby time, on whom his eyes fell when he stopped and turned.  She was very\r\ncleanly and plainly dressed, had country mud upon her shoes, and was\r\nnewly come from a journey.  The flutter of her manner, in the unwonted\r\nnoise of the streets; the spare shawl, carried unfolded on her arm; the\r\nheavy umbrella, and little basket; the loose long-fingered gloves, to\r\nwhich her hands were unused; all bespoke an old woman from the country,\r\nin her plain holiday clothes, come into Coketown on an expedition of rare\r\noccurrence.  Remarking this at a glance, with the quick observation of\r\nhis class, Stephen Blackpool bent his attentive face\xe2\x80\x94his face, which,\r\nlike the faces of many of his order, by dint of long working with eyes\r\nand hands in the midst of a prodigious noise, had acquired the\r\nconcentrated look with which we are familiar in the countenances of the\r\ndeaf\xe2\x80\x94the better to hear what she asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old woman, \xe2\x80\x98didn\xe2\x80\x99t I see you come out of that\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s house?\xe2\x80\x99 pointing back to Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s.  \xe2\x80\x98I believe it was\r\nyou, unless I have had the bad luck to mistake the person in following?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, missus,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Stephen, \xe2\x80\x98it were me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse an old woman\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity\xe2\x80\x94have you seen the\r\ngentleman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, missus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how did he look, sir?  Was he portly, bold, outspoken, and hearty?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAs she straightened her own figure, and held up her head in adapting her\r\naction to her words, the idea crossed Stephen that he had seen this old\r\nwoman before, and had not quite liked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, observing her more attentively, \xe2\x80\x98he were all that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And healthy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old woman, \xe2\x80\x98as the fresh wind?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Stephen.  \xe2\x80\x98He were ett\xe2\x80\x99n and drinking\xe2\x80\x94as large and as\r\nloud as a Hummobee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old woman, with infinite content.  \xe2\x80\x98Thank you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe certainly never had seen this old woman before.  Yet there was a vague\r\nremembrance in his mind, as if he had more than once dreamed of some old\r\nwoman like her.\r\n\r\nShe walked along at his side, and, gently accommodating himself to her\r\nhumour, he said Coketown was a busy place, was it not?  To which she\r\nanswered \xe2\x80\x98Eigh sure!  Dreadful busy!\xe2\x80\x99  Then he said, she came from the\r\ncountry, he saw?  To which she answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By Parliamentary, this morning.  I came forty mile by Parliamentary this\r\nmorning, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going back the same forty mile this afternoon.  I walked\r\nnine mile to the station this morning, and if I find nobody on the road\r\nto give me a lift, I shall walk the nine mile back to-night.  That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npretty well, sir, at my age!\xe2\x80\x99 said the chatty old woman, her eye\r\nbrightening with exultation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Deed \xe2\x80\x99tis.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t do\xe2\x80\x99t too often, missus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no.  Once a year,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, shaking her head.  \xe2\x80\x98I spend my\r\nsavings so, once every year.  I come regular, to tramp about the streets,\r\nand see the gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only to see \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s enough for me,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied, with great earnestness and interest\r\nof manner.  \xe2\x80\x98I ask no more!  I have been standing about, on this side of\r\nthe way, to see that gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 turning her head back towards Mr.\r\nBounderby\xe2\x80\x99s again, \xe2\x80\x98come out.  But, he\xe2\x80\x99s late this year, and I have not\r\nseen him.  You came out instead.  Now, if I am obliged to go back without\r\na glimpse of him\xe2\x80\x94I only want a glimpse\xe2\x80\x94well!  I have seen you, and you\r\nhave seen him, and I must make that do.\xe2\x80\x99  Saying this, she looked at\r\nStephen as if to fix his features in her mind, and her eye was not so\r\nbright as it had been.\r\n\r\nWith a large allowance for difference of tastes, and with all submission\r\nto the patricians of Coketown, this seemed so extraordinary a source of\r\ninterest to take so much trouble about, that it perplexed him.  But they\r\nwere passing the church now, and as his eye caught the clock, he\r\nquickened his pace.\r\n\r\nHe was going to his work? the old woman said, quickening hers, too, quite\r\neasily.  Yes, time was nearly out.  On his telling her where he worked,\r\nthe old woman became a more singular old woman than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An\xe2\x80\x99t you happy?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s awmost nobbody but has their troubles, missus.\xe2\x80\x99  He answered\r\nevasively, because the old woman appeared to take it for granted that he\r\nwould be very happy indeed, and he had not the heart to disappoint her.\r\nHe knew that there was trouble enough in the world; and if the old woman\r\nhad lived so long, and could count upon his having so little, why so much\r\nthe better for her, and none the worse for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay!  You have your troubles at home, you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Times.  Just now and then,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, working under such a gentleman, they don\xe2\x80\x99t follow you to the\r\nFactory?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo, no; they didn\xe2\x80\x99t follow him there, said Stephen.  All correct there.\r\nEverything accordant there.  (He did not go so far as to say, for her\r\npleasure, that there was a sort of Divine Right there; but, I have heard\r\nclaims almost as magnificent of late years.)\r\n\r\nThey were now in the black by-road near the place, and the Hands were\r\ncrowding in.  The bell was ringing, and the Serpent was a Serpent of many\r\ncoils, and the Elephant was getting ready.  The strange old woman was\r\ndelighted with the very bell.  It was the beautifullest bell she had ever\r\nheard, she said, and sounded grand!\r\n\r\nShe asked him, when he stopped good-naturedly to shake hands with her\r\nbefore going in, how long he had worked there?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A dozen year,\xe2\x80\x99 he told her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must kiss the hand,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98that has worked in this fine factory\r\nfor a dozen year!\xe2\x80\x99  And she lifted it, though he would have prevented\r\nher, and put it to her lips.  What harmony, besides her age and her\r\nsimplicity, surrounded her, he did not know, but even in this fantastic\r\naction there was a something neither out of time nor place: a something\r\nwhich it seemed as if nobody else could have made as serious, or done\r\nwith such a natural and touching air.\r\n\r\nHe had been at his loom full half an hour, thinking about this old woman,\r\nwhen, having occasion to move round the loom for its adjustment, he\r\nglanced through a window which was in his corner, and saw her still\r\nlooking up at the pile of building, lost in admiration.  Heedless of the\r\nsmoke and mud and wet, and of her two long journeys, she was gazing at\r\nit, as if the heavy thrum that issued from its many stories were proud\r\nmusic to her.\r\n\r\nShe was gone by and by, and the day went after her, and the lights sprung\r\nup again, and the Express whirled in full sight of the Fairy Palace over\r\nthe arches near: little felt amid the jarring of the machinery, and\r\nscarcely heard above its crash and rattle.  Long before then his thoughts\r\nhad gone back to the dreary room above the little shop, and to the\r\nshameful figure heavy on the bed, but heavier on his heart.\r\n\r\nMachinery slackened; throbbing feebly like a fainting pulse; stopped.\r\nThe bell again; the glare of light and heat dispelled; the factories,\r\nlooming heavy in the black wet night\xe2\x80\x94their tall chimneys rising up into\r\nthe air like competing Towers of Babel.\r\n\r\nHe had spoken to Rachael only last night, it was true, and had walked\r\nwith her a little way; but he had his new misfortune on him, in which no\r\none else could give him a moment\xe2\x80\x99s relief, and, for the sake of it, and\r\nbecause he knew himself to want that softening of his anger which no\r\nvoice but hers could effect, he felt he might so far disregard what she\r\nhad said as to wait for her again.  He waited, but she had eluded him.\r\nShe was gone.  On no other night in the year could he so ill have spared\r\nher patient face.\r\n\r\nO!  Better to have no home in which to lay his head, than to have a home\r\nand dread to go to it, through such a cause.  He ate and drank, for he\r\nwas exhausted\xe2\x80\x94but he little knew or cared what; and he wandered about in\r\nthe chill rain, thinking and thinking, and brooding and brooding.\r\n\r\nNo word of a new marriage had ever passed between them; but Rachael had\r\ntaken great pity on him years ago, and to her alone he had opened his\r\nclosed heart all this time, on the subject of his miseries; and he knew\r\nvery well that if he were free to ask her, she would take him.  He\r\nthought of the home he might at that moment have been seeking with\r\npleasure and pride; of the different man he might have been that night;\r\nof the lightness then in his now heavy-laden breast; of the then restored\r\nhonour, self-respect, and tranquillity all torn to pieces.  He thought of\r\nthe waste of the best part of his life, of the change it made in his\r\ncharacter for the worse every day, of the dreadful nature of his\r\nexistence, bound hand and foot, to a dead woman, and tormented by a demon\r\nin her shape.  He thought of Rachael, how young when they were first\r\nbrought together in these circumstances, how mature now, how soon to grow\r\nold.  He thought of the number of girls and women she had seen marry, how\r\nmany homes with children in them she had seen grow up around her, how she\r\nhad contentedly pursued her own lone quiet path\xe2\x80\x94for him\xe2\x80\x94and how he had\r\nsometimes seen a shade of melancholy on her blessed face, that smote him\r\nwith remorse and despair.  He set the picture of her up, beside the\r\ninfamous image of last night; and thought, Could it be, that the whole\r\nearthly course of one so gentle, good, and self-denying, was subjugate to\r\nsuch a wretch as that!\r\n\r\nFilled with these thoughts\xe2\x80\x94so filled that he had an unwholesome sense of\r\ngrowing larger, of being placed in some new and diseased relation towards\r\nthe objects among which he passed, of seeing the iris round every misty\r\nlight turn red\xe2\x80\x94he went home for shelter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nRACHAEL\r\n\r\n\r\nA CANDLE faintly burned in the window, to which the black ladder had\r\noften been raised for the sliding away of all that was most precious in\r\nthis world to a striving wife and a brood of hungry babies; and Stephen\r\nadded to his other thoughts the stern reflection, that of all the\r\ncasualties of this existence upon earth, not one was dealt out with so\r\nunequal a hand as Death.  The inequality of Birth was nothing to it.\r\nFor, say that the child of a King and the child of a Weaver were born\r\nto-night in the same moment, what was that disparity, to the death of any\r\nhuman creature who was serviceable to, or beloved by, another, while this\r\nabandoned woman lived on!\r\n\r\nFrom the outside of his home he gloomily passed to the inside, with\r\nsuspended breath and with a slow footstep.  He went up to his door,\r\nopened it, and so into the room.\r\n\r\nQuiet and peace were there.  Rachael was there, sitting by the bed.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head, and the light of her face shone in upon the midnight\r\nof his mind.  She sat by the bed, watching and tending his wife.  That is\r\nto say, he saw that some one lay there, and he knew too well it must be\r\nshe; but Rachael\xe2\x80\x99s hands had put a curtain up, so that she was screened\r\nfrom his eyes.  Her disgraceful garments were removed, and some of\r\nRachael\xe2\x80\x99s were in the room.  Everything was in its place and order as he\r\nhad always kept it, the little fire was newly trimmed, and the hearth was\r\nfreshly swept.  It appeared to him that he saw all this in Rachael\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface, and looked at nothing besides.  While looking at it, it was shut\r\nout from his view by the softened tears that filled his eyes; but not\r\nbefore he had seen how earnestly she looked at him, and how her own eyes\r\nwere filled too.\r\n\r\nShe turned again towards the bed, and satisfying herself that all was\r\nquiet there, spoke in a low, calm, cheerful voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad you have come at last, Stephen.  You are very late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ha\xe2\x80\x99 been walking up an\xe2\x80\x99 down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought so.  But \xe2\x80\x99tis too bad a night for that.  The rain falls very\r\nheavy, and the wind has risen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wind?  True.  It was blowing hard.  Hark to the thundering in the\r\nchimney, and the surging noise!  To have been out in such a wind, and not\r\nto have known it was blowing!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been here once before, to-day, Stephen.  Landlady came round for\r\nme at dinner-time.  There was some one here that needed looking to, she\r\nsaid.  And \xe2\x80\x98deed she was right.  All wandering and lost, Stephen.\r\nWounded too, and bruised.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe slowly moved to a chair and sat down, drooping his head before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I came to do what little I could, Stephen; first, for that she worked\r\nwith me when we were girls both, and for that you courted her and married\r\nher when I was her friend\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe laid his furrowed forehead on his hand, with a low groan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And next, for that I know your heart, and am right sure and certain that\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis far too merciful to let her die, or even so much as suffer, for want\r\nof aid.  Thou knowest who said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet him who is without sin among you\r\ncast the first stone at her!\xe2\x80\x9d  There have been plenty to do that.  Thou\r\nart not the man to cast the last stone, Stephen, when she is brought so\r\nlow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Rachael, Rachael!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou hast been a cruel sufferer, Heaven reward thee!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, in\r\ncompassionate accents.  \xe2\x80\x98I am thy poor friend, with all my heart and\r\nmind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n             [Picture: Stephen and Rachael in the sick room]\r\n\r\nThe wounds of which she had spoken, seemed to be about the neck of the\r\nself-made outcast.  She dressed them now, still without showing her.  She\r\nsteeped a piece of linen in a basin, into which she poured some liquid\r\nfrom a bottle, and laid it with a gentle hand upon the sore.  The\r\nthree-legged table had been drawn close to the bedside, and on it there\r\nwere two bottles.  This was one.\r\n\r\nIt was not so far off, but that Stephen, following her hands with his\r\neyes, could read what was printed on it in large letters.  He turned of a\r\ndeadly hue, and a sudden horror seemed to fall upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will stay here, Stephen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael, quietly resuming her seat,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98till the bells go Three.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis to be done again at three, and then she\r\nmay be left till morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But thy rest agen to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s work, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I slept sound last night.  I can wake many nights, when I am put to it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis thou who art in need of rest\xe2\x80\x94so white and tired.  Try to sleep in\r\nthe chair there, while I watch.  Thou hadst no sleep last night, I can\r\nwell believe.  To-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s work is far harder for thee than for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe heard the thundering and surging out of doors, and it seemed to him as\r\nif his late angry mood were going about trying to get at him.  She had\r\ncast it out; she would keep it out; he trusted to her to defend him from\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She don\xe2\x80\x99t know me, Stephen; she just drowsily mutters and stares.  I\r\nhave spoken to her times and again, but she don\xe2\x80\x99t notice!  \xe2\x80\x99Tis as well\r\nso.  When she comes to her right mind once more, I shall have done what I\r\ncan, and she never the wiser.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long, Rachael, is \xe2\x80\x99t looked for, that she\xe2\x80\x99ll be so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doctor said she would haply come to her mind to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis eyes fell again on the bottle, and a tremble passed over him, causing\r\nhim to shiver in every limb.  She thought he was chilled with the wet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98it was not that.  He had had a fright.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A fright?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay! coming in.  When I were walking.  When I were thinking.  When\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99  It seized him again; and he stood up, holding by the mantel-shelf,\r\nas he pressed his dank cold hair down with a hand that shook as if it\r\nwere palsied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stephen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was coming to him, but he stretched out his arm to stop her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!  Don\xe2\x80\x99t, please; don\xe2\x80\x99t.  Let me see thee setten by the bed.  Let me\r\nsee thee, a\xe2\x80\x99 so good, and so forgiving.  Let me see thee as I see thee\r\nwhen I coom in.  I can never see thee better than so.  Never, never,\r\nnever!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had a violent fit of trembling, and then sunk into his chair.  After a\r\ntime he controlled himself, and, resting with an elbow on one knee, and\r\nhis head upon that hand, could look towards Rachael.  Seen across the dim\r\ncandle with his moistened eyes, she looked as if she had a glory shining\r\nround her head.  He could have believed she had.  He did believe it, as\r\nthe noise without shook the window, rattled at the door below, and went\r\nabout the house clamouring and lamenting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When she gets better, Stephen, \xe2\x80\x99tis to be hoped she\xe2\x80\x99ll leave thee to\r\nthyself again, and do thee no more hurt.  Anyways we will hope so now.\r\nAnd now I shall keep silence, for I want thee to sleep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes, more to please her than to rest his weary head; but,\r\nby slow degrees as he listened to the great noise of the wind, he ceased\r\nto hear it, or it changed into the working of his loom, or even into the\r\nvoices of the day (his own included) saying what had been really said.\r\nEven this imperfect consciousness faded away at last, and he dreamed a\r\nlong, troubled dream.\r\n\r\nHe thought that he, and some one on whom his heart had long been set\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nshe was not Rachael, and that surprised him, even in the midst of his\r\nimaginary happiness\xe2\x80\x94stood in the church being married.  While the\r\nceremony was performing, and while he recognized among the witnesses some\r\nwhom he knew to be living, and many whom he knew to be dead, darkness\r\ncame on, succeeded by the shining of a tremendous light.  It broke from\r\none line in the table of commandments at the altar, and illuminated the\r\nbuilding with the words.  They were sounded through the church, too, as\r\nif there were voices in the fiery letters.  Upon this, the whole\r\nappearance before him and around him changed, and nothing was left as it\r\nhad been, but himself and the clergyman.  They stood in the daylight\r\nbefore a crowd so vast, that if all the people in the world could have\r\nbeen brought together into one space, they could not have looked, he\r\nthought, more numerous; and they all abhorred him, and there was not one\r\npitying or friendly eye among the millions that were fastened on his\r\nface.  He stood on a raised stage, under his own loom; and, looking up at\r\nthe shape the loom took, and hearing the burial service distinctly read,\r\nhe knew that he was there to suffer death.  In an instant what he stood\r\non fell below him, and he was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Out of what mystery he came back to his usual life, and to places that\r\nhe knew, he was unable to consider; but he was back in those places by\r\nsome means, and with this condemnation upon him, that he was never, in\r\nthis world or the next, through all the unimaginable ages of eternity, to\r\nlook on Rachael\xe2\x80\x99s face or hear her voice.  Wandering to and fro,\r\nunceasingly, without hope, and in search of he knew not what (he only\r\nknew that he was doomed to seek it), he was the subject of a nameless,\r\nhorrible dread, a mortal fear of one particular shape which everything\r\ntook.  Whatsoever he looked at, grew into that form sooner or later.  The\r\nobject of his miserable existence was to prevent its recognition by any\r\none among the various people he encountered.  Hopeless labour!  If he led\r\nthem out of rooms where it was, if he shut up drawers and closets where\r\nit stood, if he drew the curious from places where he knew it to be\r\nsecreted, and got them out into the streets, the very chimneys of the\r\nmills assumed that shape, and round them was the printed word.\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing again, the rain was beating on the house-tops, and\r\nthe larger spaces through which he had strayed contracted to the four\r\nwalls of his room.  Saving that the fire had died out, it was as his eyes\r\nhad closed upon it.  Rachael seemed to have fallen into a doze, in the\r\nchair by the bed.  She sat wrapped in her shawl, perfectly still.  The\r\ntable stood in the same place, close by the bedside, and on it, in its\r\nreal proportions and appearance, was the shape so often repeated.\r\n\r\nHe thought he saw the curtain move.  He looked again, and he was sure it\r\nmoved.  He saw a hand come forth and grope about a little.  Then the\r\ncurtain moved more perceptibly, and the woman in the bed put it back, and\r\nsat up.\r\n\r\nWith her woful eyes, so haggard and wild, so heavy and large, she looked\r\nall round the room, and passed the corner where he slept in his chair.\r\nHer eyes returned to that corner, and she put her hand over them as a\r\nshade, while she looked into it.  Again they went all round the room,\r\nscarcely heeding Rachael if at all, and returned to that corner.  He\r\nthought, as she once more shaded them\xe2\x80\x94not so much looking at him, as\r\nlooking for him with a brutish instinct that he was there\xe2\x80\x94that no single\r\ntrace was left in those debauched features, or in the mind that went\r\nalong with them, of the woman he had married eighteen years before.  But\r\nthat he had seen her come to this by inches, he never could have believed\r\nher to be the same.\r\n\r\nAll this time, as if a spell were on him, he was motionless and\r\npowerless, except to watch her.\r\n\r\nStupidly dozing, or communing with her incapable self about nothing, she\r\nsat for a little while with her hands at her ears, and her head resting\r\non them.  Presently, she resumed her staring round the room.  And now,\r\nfor the first time, her eyes stopped at the table with the bottles on it.\r\n\r\nStraightway she turned her eyes back to his corner, with the defiance of\r\nlast night, and moving very cautiously and softly, stretched out her\r\ngreedy hand.  She drew a mug into the bed, and sat for a while\r\nconsidering which of the two bottles she should choose.  Finally, she\r\nlaid her insensate grasp upon the bottle that had swift and certain death\r\nin it, and, before his eyes, pulled out the cork with her teeth.\r\n\r\nDream or reality, he had no voice, nor had he power to stir.  If this be\r\nreal, and her allotted time be not yet come, wake, Rachael, wake!\r\n\r\nShe thought of that, too.  She looked at Rachael, and very slowly, very\r\ncautiously, poured out the contents.  The draught was at her lips.  A\r\nmoment and she would be past all help, let the whole world wake and come\r\nabout her with its utmost power.  But in that moment Rachael started up\r\nwith a suppressed cry.  The creature struggled, struck her, seized her by\r\nthe hair; but Rachael had the cup.\r\n\r\nStephen broke out of his chair.  \xe2\x80\x98Rachael, am I wakin\xe2\x80\x99 or dreamin\xe2\x80\x99 this\r\ndreadfo\xe2\x80\x99 night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis all well, Stephen.  I have been asleep, myself.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis near three.\r\nHush!  I hear the bells.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wind brought the sounds of the church clock to the window.  They\r\nlistened, and it struck three.  Stephen looked at her, saw how pale she\r\nwas, noted the disorder of her hair, and the red marks of fingers on her\r\nforehead, and felt assured that his senses of sight and hearing had been\r\nawake.  She held the cup in her hand even now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought it must be near three,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, calmly pouring from the cup\r\ninto the basin, and steeping the linen as before.  \xe2\x80\x98I am thankful I\r\nstayed!  \xe2\x80\x99Tis done now, when I have put this on.  There!  And now she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquiet again.  The few drops in the basin I\xe2\x80\x99ll pour away, for \xe2\x80\x99tis bad\r\nstuff to leave about, though ever so little of it.\xe2\x80\x99  As she spoke, she\r\ndrained the basin into the ashes of the fire, and broke the bottle on the\r\nhearth.\r\n\r\nShe had nothing to do, then, but to cover herself with her shawl before\r\ngoing out into the wind and rain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou\xe2\x80\x99lt let me walk wi\xe2\x80\x99 thee at this hour, Rachael?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Stephen.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis but a minute, and I\xe2\x80\x99m home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou\xe2\x80\x99rt not fearfo\xe2\x80\x99;\xe2\x80\x99 he said it in a low voice, as they went out at the\r\ndoor; \xe2\x80\x98to leave me alone wi\xe2\x80\x99 her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs she looked at him, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Stephen?\xe2\x80\x99 he went down on his knee before\r\nher, on the poor mean stairs, and put an end of her shawl to his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou art an Angel.  Bless thee, bless thee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am, as I have told thee, Stephen, thy poor friend.  Angels are not\r\nlike me.  Between them, and a working woman fu\xe2\x80\x99 of faults, there is a\r\ndeep gulf set.  My little sister is among them, but she is changed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes for a moment as she said the words; and then they\r\nfell again, in all their gentleness and mildness, on his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou changest me from bad to good.  Thou mak\xe2\x80\x99st me humbly wishfo\xe2\x80\x99 to be\r\nmore like thee, and fearfo\xe2\x80\x99 to lose thee when this life is ower, and a\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe muddle cleared awa\xe2\x80\x99.  Thou\xe2\x80\x99rt an Angel; it may be, thou hast saved my\r\nsoul alive!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, on his knee at her feet, with her shawl still in his\r\nhand, and the reproof on her lips died away when she saw the working of\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I coom home desp\xe2\x80\x99rate.  I coom home wi\xe2\x80\x99out a hope, and mad wi\xe2\x80\x99 thinking\r\nthat when I said a word o\xe2\x80\x99 complaint I was reckoned a unreasonable Hand.\r\nI told thee I had had a fright.  It were the Poison-bottle on table.  I\r\nnever hurt a livin\xe2\x80\x99 creetur; but happenin\xe2\x80\x99 so suddenly upon \xe2\x80\x99t, I thowt,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can _I_ say what I might ha\xe2\x80\x99 done to myseln, or her, or both!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe put her two hands on his mouth, with a face of terror, to stop him\r\nfrom saying more.  He caught them in his unoccupied hand, and holding\r\nthem, and still clasping the border of her shawl, said hurriedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I see thee, Rachael, setten by the bed.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 seen thee, aw this\r\nnight.  In my troublous sleep I ha\xe2\x80\x99 known thee still to be there.\r\nEvermore I will see thee there.  I nevermore will see her or think o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nher, but thou shalt be beside her.  I nevermore will see or think o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nanything that angers me, but thou, so much better than me, shalt be by\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 side on\xe2\x80\x99t.  And so I will try t\xe2\x80\x99 look t\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 time, and so I will try\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99 trust t\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 time, when thou and me at last shall walk together far\r\nawa\xe2\x80\x99, beyond the deep gulf, in th\xe2\x80\x99 country where thy little sister is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe kissed the border of her shawl again, and let her go.  She bade him\r\ngood night in a broken voice, and went out into the street.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew from the quarter where the day would soon appear, and still\r\nblew strongly.  It had cleared the sky before it, and the rain had spent\r\nitself or travelled elsewhere, and the stars were bright.  He stood\r\nbare-headed in the road, watching her quick disappearance.  As the\r\nshining stars were to the heavy candle in the window, so was Rachael, in\r\nthe rugged fancy of this man, to the common experiences of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nTHE GREAT MANUFACTURER\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME went on in Coketown like its own machinery: so much material wrought\r\nup, so much fuel consumed, so many powers worn out, so much money made.\r\nBut, less inexorable than iron, steel, and brass, it brought its varying\r\nseasons even into that wilderness of smoke and brick, and made the only\r\nstand that ever _was_ made in the place against its direful uniformity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Louisa is becoming,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98almost a young woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTime, with his innumerable horse-power, worked away, not minding what\r\nanybody said, and presently turned out young Thomas a foot taller than\r\nwhen his father had last taken particular notice of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thomas is becoming,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98almost a young man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTime passed Thomas on in the mill, while his father was thinking about\r\nit, and there he stood in a long-tailed coat and a stiff shirt-collar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98the period has arrived when Thomas ought\r\nto go to Bounderby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTime, sticking to him, passed him on into Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s Bank, made him an\r\ninmate of Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s house, necessitated the purchase of his first\r\nrazor, and exercised him diligently in his calculations relative to\r\nnumber one.\r\n\r\nThe same great manufacturer, always with an immense variety of work on\r\nhand, in every stage of development, passed Sissy onward in his mill, and\r\nworked her up into a very pretty article indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fear, Jupe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98that your continuance at the school\r\nany longer would be useless.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid it would, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 Sissy answered with a curtsey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot disguise from you, Jupe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, knitting his\r\nbrow, \xe2\x80\x98that the result of your probation there has disappointed me; has\r\ngreatly disappointed me.  You have not acquired, under Mr. and Mrs.\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Choakumchild, anything like that amount of exact knowledge which I\r\nlooked for.  You are extremely deficient in your facts.  Your\r\nacquaintance with figures is very limited.  You are altogether backward,\r\nand below the mark.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 she returned; \xe2\x80\x98but I know it is quite true.  Yet I\r\nhave tried hard, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98yes, I believe you have tried hard; I have\r\nobserved you, and I can find no fault in that respect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir.  I have thought sometimes;\xe2\x80\x99 Sissy very timid here; \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nperhaps I tried to learn too much, and that if I had asked to be allowed\r\nto try a little less, I might have\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Jupe, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, shaking his head in his profoundest\r\nand most eminently practical way.  \xe2\x80\x98No.  The course you pursued, you\r\npursued according to the system\xe2\x80\x94the system\xe2\x80\x94and there is no more to be\r\nsaid about it.  I can only suppose that the circumstances of your early\r\nlife were too unfavourable to the development of your reasoning powers,\r\nand that we began too late.  Still, as I have said already, I am\r\ndisappointed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I could have made a better acknowledgment, sir, of your kindness\r\nto a poor forlorn girl who had no claim upon you, and of your protection\r\nof her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t shed tears,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t shed tears.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncomplain of you.  You are an affectionate, earnest, good young\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94and we must make that do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir, very much,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sissy, with a grateful curtsey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are useful to Mrs. Gradgrind, and (in a generally pervading way) you\r\nare serviceable in the family also; so I understand from Miss Louisa,\r\nand, indeed, so I have observed myself.  I therefore hope,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nGradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98that you can make yourself happy in those relations.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should have nothing to wish, sir, if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I understand you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind; \xe2\x80\x98you still refer to your father.\r\nI have heard from Miss Louisa that you still preserve that bottle.  Well!\r\nIf your training in the science of arriving at exact results had been\r\nmore successful, you would have been wiser on these points.  I will say\r\nno more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for her; otherwise he\r\nheld her calculating powers in such very slight estimation that he must\r\nhave fallen upon that conclusion.  Somehow or other, he had become\r\npossessed by an idea that there was something in this girl which could\r\nhardly be set forth in a tabular form.  Her capacity of definition might\r\nbe easily stated at a very low figure, her mathematical knowledge at\r\nnothing; yet he was not sure that if he had been required, for example,\r\nto tick her off into columns in a parliamentary return, he would have\r\nquite known how to divide her.\r\n\r\nIn some stages of his manufacture of the human fabric, the processes of\r\nTime are very rapid.  Young Thomas and Sissy being both at such a stage\r\nof their working up, these changes were effected in a year or two; while\r\nMr. Gradgrind himself seemed stationary in his course, and underwent no\r\nalteration.\r\n\r\nExcept one, which was apart from his necessary progress through the mill.\r\nTime hustled him into a little noisy and rather dirty machinery, in a\r\nby-comer, and made him Member of Parliament for Coketown: one of the\r\nrespected members for ounce weights and measures, one of the\r\nrepresentatives of the multiplication table, one of the deaf honourable\r\ngentlemen, dumb honourable gentlemen, blind honourable gentlemen, lame\r\nhonourable gentlemen, dead honourable gentlemen, to every other\r\nconsideration.  Else wherefore live we in a Christian land, eighteen\r\nhundred and odd years after our Master?\r\n\r\nAll this while, Louisa had been passing on, so quiet and reserved, and so\r\nmuch given to watching the bright ashes at twilight as they fell into the\r\ngrate, and became extinct, that from the period when her father had said\r\nshe was almost a young woman\xe2\x80\x94which seemed but yesterday\xe2\x80\x94she had scarcely\r\nattracted his notice again, when he found her quite a young woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite a young woman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, musing.  \xe2\x80\x98Dear me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSoon after this discovery, he became more thoughtful than usual for\r\nseveral days, and seemed much engrossed by one subject.  On a certain\r\nnight, when he was going out, and Louisa came to bid him good-bye before\r\nhis departure\xe2\x80\x94as he was not to be home until late and she would not see\r\nhim again until the morning\xe2\x80\x94he held her in his arms, looking at her in\r\nhis kindest manner, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Louisa, you are a woman!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe answered with the old, quick, searching look of the night when she\r\nwas found at the Circus; then cast down her eyes.  \xe2\x80\x98Yes, father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98I must speak with you alone and\r\nseriously.  Come to me in my room after breakfast to-morrow, will you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your hands are rather cold, Louisa.  Are you not well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite well, father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And cheerful?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked at him again, and smiled in her peculiar manner.  \xe2\x80\x98I am as\r\ncheerful, father, as I usually am, or usually have been.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.  So, he kissed her and went away; and\r\nLouisa returned to the serene apartment of the hair-cutting character,\r\nand leaning her elbow on her hand, looked again at the short-lived sparks\r\nthat so soon subsided into ashes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you there, Loo?\xe2\x80\x99 said her brother, looking in at the door.  He was\r\nquite a young gentleman of pleasure now, and not quite a prepossessing\r\none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, rising and embracing him, \xe2\x80\x98how long it is since\r\nyou have been to see me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I have been otherwise engaged, Loo, in the evenings; and in the\r\ndaytime old Bounderby has been keeping me at it rather.  But I touch him\r\nup with you when he comes it too strong, and so we preserve an\r\nunderstanding.  I say!  Has father said anything particular to you to-day\r\nor yesterday, Loo?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Tom.  But he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!  That\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Do you know where he is\r\nto-night?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94with a very deep expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you.  He\xe2\x80\x99s with old Bounderby.  They are having a regular\r\nconfab together up at the Bank.  Why at the Bank, do you think?  Well,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you again.  To keep Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s ears as far off as possible,\r\nI expect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith her hand upon her brother\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, Louisa still stood looking at\r\nthe fire.  Her brother glanced at her face with greater interest than\r\nusual, and, encircling her waist with his arm, drew her coaxingly to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are very fond of me, an\xe2\x80\x99t you, Loo?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed I am, Tom, though you do let such long intervals go by without\r\ncoming to see me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sister of mine,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, \xe2\x80\x98when you say that, you are near my\r\nthoughts.  We might be so much oftener together\xe2\x80\x94mightn\xe2\x80\x99t we?  Always\r\ntogether, almost\xe2\x80\x94mightn\xe2\x80\x99t we?  It would do me a great deal of good if you\r\nwere to make up your mind to I know what, Loo.  It would be a splendid\r\nthing for me.  It would be uncommonly jolly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer thoughtfulness baffled his cunning scrutiny.  He could make nothing\r\nof her face.  He pressed her in his arm, and kissed her cheek.  She\r\nreturned the kiss, but still looked at the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say, Loo!  I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d come, and just hint to you what was going on:\r\nthough I supposed you\xe2\x80\x99d most likely guess, even if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.  I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stay, because I\xe2\x80\x99m engaged to some fellows to-night.  You won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforget how fond you are of me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, dear Tom, I won\xe2\x80\x99t forget.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a capital girl,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, Loo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe gave him an affectionate good-night, and went out with him to the\r\ndoor, whence the fires of Coketown could be seen, making the distance\r\nlurid.  She stood there, looking steadfastly towards them, and listening\r\nto his departing steps.  They retreated quickly, as glad to get away from\r\nStone Lodge; and she stood there yet, when he was gone and all was quiet.\r\nIt seemed as if, first in her own fire within the house, and then in the\r\nfiery haze without, she tried to discover what kind of woof Old Time,\r\nthat greatest and longest-established Spinner of all, would weave from\r\nthe threads he had already spun into a woman.  But his factory is a\r\nsecret place, his work is noiseless, and his Hands are mutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nFATHER AND DAUGHTER\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH Mr. Gradgrind did not take after Blue Beard, his room was quite\r\na blue chamber in its abundance of blue books.  Whatever they could prove\r\n(which is usually anything you like), they proved there, in an army\r\nconstantly strengthening by the arrival of new recruits.  In that charmed\r\napartment, the most complicated social questions were cast up, got into\r\nexact totals, and finally settled\xe2\x80\x94if those concerned could only have been\r\nbrought to know it.  As if an astronomical observatory should be made\r\nwithout any windows, and the astronomer within should arrange the starry\r\nuniverse solely by pen, ink, and paper, so Mr. Gradgrind, in _his_\r\nObservatory (and there are many like it), had no need to cast an eye upon\r\nthe teeming myriads of human beings around him, but could settle all\r\ntheir destinies on a slate, and wipe out all their tears with one dirty\r\nlittle bit of sponge.\r\n\r\nTo this Observatory, then: a stern room, with a deadly statistical clock\r\nin it, which measured every second with a beat like a rap upon a\r\ncoffin-lid; Louisa repaired on the appointed morning.  A window looked\r\ntowards Coketown; and when she sat down near her father\xe2\x80\x99s table, she saw\r\nthe high chimneys and the long tracts of smoke looming in the heavy\r\ndistance gloomily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Louisa,\xe2\x80\x99 said her father, \xe2\x80\x98I prepared you last night to give me\r\nyour serious attention in the conversation we are now going to have\r\ntogether.  You have been so well trained, and you do, I am happy to say,\r\nso much justice to the education you have received, that I have perfect\r\nconfidence in your good sense.  You are not impulsive, you are not\r\nromantic, you are accustomed to view everything from the strong\r\ndispassionate ground of reason and calculation.  From that ground alone,\r\nI know you will view and consider what I am going to communicate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe waited, as if he would have been glad that she said something.  But\r\nshe said never a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Louisa, my dear, you are the subject of a proposal of marriage that has\r\nbeen made to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain he waited, and again she answered not one word.  This so far\r\nsurprised him, as to induce him gently to repeat, \xe2\x80\x98a proposal of\r\nmarriage, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99  To which she returned, without any visible emotion\r\nwhatever:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hear you, father.  I am attending, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, breaking into a smile, after being for the\r\nmoment at a loss, \xe2\x80\x98you are even more dispassionate than I expected,\r\nLouisa.  Or, perhaps, you are not unprepared for the announcement I have\r\nit in charge to make?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot say that, father, until I hear it.  Prepared or unprepared, I\r\nwish to hear it all from you.  I wish to hear you state it to me,\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStrange to relate, Mr. Gradgrind was not so collected at this moment as\r\nhis daughter was.  He took a paper-knife in his hand, turned it over,\r\nlaid it down, took it up again, and even then had to look along the blade\r\nof it, considering how to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What you say, my dear Louisa, is perfectly reasonable.  I have\r\nundertaken then to let you know that\xe2\x80\x94in short, that Mr. Bounderby has\r\ninformed me that he has long watched your progress with particular\r\ninterest and pleasure, and has long hoped that the time might ultimately\r\narrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage.  That time, to\r\nwhich he has so long, and certainly with great constancy, looked forward,\r\nis now come.  Mr. Bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me, and\r\nhas entreated me to make it known to you, and to express his hope that\r\nyou will take it into your favourable consideration.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSilence between them.  The deadly statistical clock very hollow.  The\r\ndistant smoke very black and heavy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, \xe2\x80\x98do you think I love Mr. Bounderby?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my child,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x94really\xe2\x80\x94cannot take upon myself to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before, \xe2\x80\x98do you ask\r\nme to love Mr. Bounderby?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Louisa, no.  No.  I ask nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father,\xe2\x80\x99 she still pursued, \xe2\x80\x98does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98it is difficult to answer your\r\nquestion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Difficult to answer it, Yes or No, father?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, my dear.  Because;\xe2\x80\x99 here was something to demonstrate, and it\r\nset him up again; \xe2\x80\x98because the reply depends so materially, Louisa, on\r\nthe sense in which we use the expression.  Now, Mr. Bounderby does not do\r\nyou the injustice, and does not do himself the injustice, of pretending\r\nto anything fanciful, fantastic, or (I am using synonymous terms)\r\nsentimental.  Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes,\r\nto very little purpose, if he could so far forget what is due to your\r\ngood sense, not to say to his, as to address you from any such ground.\r\nTherefore, perhaps the expression itself\xe2\x80\x94I merely suggest this to you, my\r\ndear\xe2\x80\x94may be a little misplaced.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What would you advise me to use in its stead, father?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, my dear Louisa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, completely recovered by this\r\ntime, \xe2\x80\x98I would advise you (since you ask me) to consider this question,\r\nas you have been accustomed to consider every other question, simply as\r\none of tangible Fact.  The ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such\r\nsubjects with irrelevant fancies, and other absurdities that have no\r\nexistence, properly viewed\xe2\x80\x94really no existence\xe2\x80\x94but it is no compliment to\r\nyou to say, that you know better.  Now, what are the Facts of this case?\r\nYou are, we will say in round numbers, twenty years of age; Mr. Bounderby\r\nis, we will say in round numbers, fifty.  There is some disparity in your\r\nrespective years, but in your means and positions there is none; on the\r\ncontrary, there is a great suitability.  Then the question arises, Is\r\nthis one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage?  In\r\nconsidering this question, it is not unimportant to take into account the\r\nstatistics of marriage, so far as they have yet been obtained, in England\r\nand Wales.  I find, on reference to the figures, that a large proportion\r\nof these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages,\r\nand that the elder of these contracting parties is, in rather more than\r\nthree-fourths of these instances, the bridegroom.  It is remarkable as\r\nshowing the wide prevalence of this law, that among the natives of the\r\nBritish possessions in India, also in a considerable part of China, and\r\namong the Calmucks of Tartary, the best means of computation yet\r\nfurnished us by travellers, yield similar results.  The disparity I have\r\nmentioned, therefore, almost ceases to be disparity, and (virtually) all\r\nbut disappears.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you recommend, father,\xe2\x80\x99 asked Louisa, her reserved composure not\r\nin the least affected by these gratifying results, \xe2\x80\x98that I should\r\nsubstitute for the term I used just now?  For the misplaced expression?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Louisa,\xe2\x80\x99 returned her father, \xe2\x80\x98it appears to me that nothing can be\r\nplainer.  Confining yourself rigidly to Fact, the question of Fact you\r\nstate to yourself is: Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him?  Yes, he\r\ndoes.  The sole remaining question then is: Shall I marry him?  I think\r\nnothing can be plainer than that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I marry him?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Louisa, with great deliberation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Precisely.  And it is satisfactory to me, as your father, my dear\r\nLouisa, to know that you do not come to the consideration of that\r\nquestion with the previous habits of mind, and habits of life, that\r\nbelong to many young women.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, father,\xe2\x80\x99 she returned, \xe2\x80\x98I do not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I now leave you to judge for yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\nstated the case, as such cases are usually stated among practical minds;\r\nI have stated it, as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its\r\ntime.  The rest, my dear Louisa, is for you to decide.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, she had sat looking at him fixedly.  As he now leaned\r\nback in his chair, and bent his deep-set eyes upon her in his turn,\r\nperhaps he might have seen one wavering moment in her, when she was\r\nimpelled to throw herself upon his breast, and give him the pent-up\r\nconfidences of her heart.  But, to see it, he must have overleaped at a\r\nbound the artificial barriers he had for many years been erecting,\r\nbetween himself and all those subtle essences of humanity which will\r\nelude the utmost cunning of algebra until the last trumpet ever to be\r\nsounded shall blow even algebra to wreck.  The barriers were too many and\r\ntoo high for such a leap.  With his unbending, utilitarian,\r\nmatter-of-fact face, he hardened her again; and the moment shot away into\r\nthe plumbless depths of the past, to mingle with all the lost\r\nopportunities that are drowned there.\r\n\r\nRemoving her eyes from him, she sat so long looking silently towards the\r\ntown, that he said, at length: \xe2\x80\x98Are you consulting the chimneys of the\r\nCoketown works, Louisa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke.  Yet\r\nwhen the night comes, Fire bursts out, father!\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, turning\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I know that, Louisa.  I do not see the application of the\r\nremark.\xe2\x80\x99  To do him justice he did not, at all.\r\n\r\nShe passed it away with a slight motion of her hand, and concentrating\r\nher attention upon him again, said, \xe2\x80\x98Father, I have often thought that\r\nlife is very short.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94This was so distinctly one of his subjects that he\r\ninterposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is short, no doubt, my dear.  Still, the average duration of human\r\nlife is proved to have increased of late years.  The calculations of\r\nvarious life assurance and annuity offices, among other figures which\r\ncannot go wrong, have established the fact.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I speak of my own life, father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O indeed?  Still,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98I need not point out to you,\r\nLouisa, that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the\r\naggregate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98While it lasts, I would wish to do the little I can, and the little I am\r\nfit for.  What does it matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind seemed rather at a loss to understand the last four words;\r\nreplying, \xe2\x80\x98How, matter?  What matter, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on in a steady, straight way, without regarding\r\nthis, \xe2\x80\x98asks me to marry him.  The question I have to ask myself is, shall\r\nI marry him?  That is so, father, is it not?  You have told me so,\r\nfather.  Have you not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let it be so.  Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me thus, I am satisfied\r\nto accept his proposal.  Tell him, father, as soon as you please, that\r\nthis was my answer.  Repeat it, word for word, if you can, because I\r\nshould wish him to know what I said.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is quite right, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted her father approvingly, \xe2\x80\x98to be\r\nexact.  I will observe your very proper request.  Have you any wish in\r\nreference to the period of your marriage, my child?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None, father.  What does it matter!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind had drawn his chair a little nearer to her, and taken her\r\nhand.  But, her repetition of these words seemed to strike with some\r\nlittle discord on his ear.  He paused to look at her, and, still holding\r\nher hand, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Louisa, I have not considered it essential to ask you one question,\r\nbecause the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote.\r\nBut perhaps I ought to do so.  You have never entertained in secret any\r\nother proposal?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father,\xe2\x80\x99 she returned, almost scornfully, \xe2\x80\x98what other proposal can have\r\nbeen made to _me_?  Whom have I seen?  Where have I been?  What are my\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s experiences?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Louisa,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Gradgrind, reassured and satisfied.  \xe2\x80\x98You\r\ncorrect me justly.  I merely wished to discharge my duty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do _I_ know, father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa in her quiet manner, \xe2\x80\x98of tastes\r\nand fancies; of aspirations and affections; of all that part of my nature\r\nin which such light things might have been nourished?  What escape have I\r\nhad from problems that could be demonstrated, and realities that could be\r\ngrasped?\xe2\x80\x99  As she said it, she unconsciously closed her hand, as if upon\r\na solid object, and slowly opened it as though she were releasing dust or\r\nash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 assented her eminently practical parent, \xe2\x80\x98quite true, quite\r\ntrue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, father,\xe2\x80\x99 she pursued, \xe2\x80\x98what a strange question to ask _me_!  The\r\nbaby-preference that even I have heard of as common among children, has\r\nnever had its innocent resting-place in my breast.  You have been so\r\ncareful of me, that I never had a child\xe2\x80\x99s heart.  You have trained me so\r\nwell, that I never dreamed a child\xe2\x80\x99s dream.  You have dealt so wisely\r\nwith me, father, from my cradle to this hour, that I never had a child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbelief or a child\xe2\x80\x99s fear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind was quite moved by his success, and by this testimony to\r\nit.  \xe2\x80\x98My dear Louisa,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98you abundantly repay my care.  Kiss me,\r\nmy dear girl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo, his daughter kissed him.  Detaining her in his embrace, he said, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nmay assure you now, my favourite child, that I am made happy by the sound\r\ndecision at which you have arrived.  Mr. Bounderby is a very remarkable\r\nman; and what little disparity can be said to exist between you\xe2\x80\x94if any\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nmore than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired.  It has\r\nalways been my object so to educate you, as that you might, while still\r\nin your early youth, be (if I may so express myself) almost any age.\r\nKiss me once more, Louisa.  Now, let us go and find your mother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they went down to the drawing-room, where the esteemed lady\r\nwith no nonsense about her, was recumbent as usual, while Sissy worked\r\nbeside her.  She gave some feeble signs of returning animation when they\r\nentered, and presently the faint transparency was presented in a sitting\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Gradgrind,\xe2\x80\x99 said her husband, who had waited for the achievement of\r\nthis feat with some impatience, \xe2\x80\x98allow me to present to you Mrs.\r\nBounderby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98so you have settled it!  Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\r\nhope your health may be good, Louisa; for if your head begins to split as\r\nsoon as you are married, which was the case with mine, I cannot consider\r\nthat you are to be envied, though I have no doubt you think you are, as\r\nall girls do.  However, I give you joy, my dear\xe2\x80\x94and I hope you may now\r\nturn all your ological studies to good account, I am sure I do!  I must\r\ngive you a kiss of congratulation, Louisa; but don\xe2\x80\x99t touch my right\r\nshoulder, for there\xe2\x80\x99s something running down it all day long.  And now\r\nyou see,\xe2\x80\x99 whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind, adjusting her shawls after the\r\naffectionate ceremony, \xe2\x80\x98I shall be worrying myself, morning, noon, and\r\nnight, to know what I am to call him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Gradgrind,\xe2\x80\x99 said her husband, solemnly, \xe2\x80\x98what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whatever I am to call him, Mr. Gradgrind, when he is married to Louisa!\r\nI must call him something.  It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Gradgrind, with a\r\nmingled sense of politeness and injury, \xe2\x80\x98to be constantly addressing him\r\nand never giving him a name.  I cannot call him Josiah, for the name is\r\ninsupportable to me.  You yourself wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of Joe, you very well\r\nknow.  Am I to call my own son-in-law, Mister!  Not, I believe, unless\r\nthe time has arrived when, as an invalid, I am to be trampled upon by my\r\nrelations.  Then, what am I to call him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNobody present having any suggestion to offer in the remarkable\r\nemergency, Mrs. Gradgrind departed this life for the time being, after\r\ndelivering the following codicil to her remarks already executed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As to the wedding, all I ask, Louisa, is,\xe2\x80\x94and I ask it with a fluttering\r\nin my chest, which actually extends to the soles of my feet,\xe2\x80\x94that it may\r\ntake place soon.  Otherwise, I know it is one of those subjects I shall\r\nnever hear the last of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gradgrind had presented Mrs. Bounderby, Sissy had suddenly\r\nturned her head, and looked, in wonder, in pity, in sorrow, in doubt, in\r\na multitude of emotions, towards Louisa.  Louisa had known it, and seen\r\nit, without looking at her.  From that moment she was impassive, proud\r\nand cold\xe2\x80\x94held Sissy at a distance\xe2\x80\x94changed to her altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nHUSBAND AND WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BOUNDERBY\xe2\x80\x99S first disquietude on hearing of his happiness, was\r\noccasioned by the necessity of imparting it to Mrs. Sparsit.  He could\r\nnot make up his mind how to do that, or what the consequences of the step\r\nmight be.  Whether she would instantly depart, bag and baggage, to Lady\r\nScadgers, or would positively refuse to budge from the premises; whether\r\nshe would be plaintive or abusive, tearful or tearing; whether she would\r\nbreak her heart, or break the looking-glass; Mr. Bounderby could not all\r\nforesee.  However, as it must be done, he had no choice but to do it; so,\r\nafter attempting several letters, and failing in them all, he resolved to\r\ndo it by word of mouth.\r\n\r\nOn his way home, on the evening he set aside for this momentous purpose,\r\nhe took the precaution of stepping into a chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop and buying a\r\nbottle of the very strongest smelling-salts.  \xe2\x80\x98By George!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nBounderby, \xe2\x80\x98if she takes it in the fainting way, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the skin off\r\nher nose, at all events!\xe2\x80\x99  But, in spite of being thus forearmed, he\r\nentered his own house with anything but a courageous air; and appeared\r\nbefore the object of his misgivings, like a dog who was conscious of\r\ncoming direct from the pantry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good evening, Mr. Bounderby!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good evening, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, good evening.\xe2\x80\x99  He drew up his chair, and Mrs.\r\nSparsit drew back hers, as who should say, \xe2\x80\x98Your fireside, sir.  I freely\r\nadmit it.  It is for you to occupy it all, if you think proper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t go to the North Pole, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, and returned, though short of her\r\nformer position.\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby sat looking at her, as, with the points of a stiff, sharp\r\npair of scissors, she picked out holes for some inscrutable ornamental\r\npurpose, in a piece of cambric.  An operation which, taken in connexion\r\nwith the bushy eyebrows and the Roman nose, suggested with some\r\nliveliness the idea of a hawk engaged upon the eyes of a tough little\r\nbird.  She was so steadfastly occupied, that many minutes elapsed before\r\nshe looked up from her work; when she did so Mr. Bounderby bespoke her\r\nattention with a hitch of his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Sparsit, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, putting his hands in his\r\npockets, and assuring himself with his right hand that the cork of the\r\nlittle bottle was ready for use, \xe2\x80\x98I have no occasion to say to you, that\r\nyou are not only a lady born and bred, but a devilish sensible woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the lady, \xe2\x80\x98this is indeed not the first time that you\r\nhave honoured me with similar expressions of your good opinion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Sparsit, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98I am going to astonish you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, interrogatively, and in the most\r\ntranquil manner possible.  She generally wore mittens, and she now laid\r\ndown her work, and smoothed those mittens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98to marry Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98I hope you may be happy, Mr.\r\nBounderby.  Oh, indeed I hope you may be happy, sir!\xe2\x80\x99  And she said it\r\nwith such great condescension as well as with such great compassion for\r\nhim, that Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x94far more disconcerted than if she had thrown her\r\nworkbox at the mirror, or swooned on the hearthrug,\xe2\x80\x94corked up the\r\nsmelling-salts tight in his pocket, and thought, \xe2\x80\x98Now confound this\r\nwoman, who could have even guessed that she would take it in this way!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish with all my heart, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, in a highly superior\r\nmanner; somehow she seemed, in a moment, to have established a right to\r\npity him ever afterwards; \xe2\x80\x98that you may be in all respects very happy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bounderby, with some resentment in his tone:\r\nwhich was clearly lowered, though in spite of himself, \xe2\x80\x98I am obliged to\r\nyou.  I hope I shall be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Do_ you, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, with great affability.  \xe2\x80\x98But\r\nnaturally you do; of course you do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA very awkward pause on Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s part, succeeded.  Mrs. Sparsit\r\nsedately resumed her work and occasionally gave a small cough, which\r\nsounded like the cough of conscious strength and forbearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98under these circumstances, I imagine\r\nit would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here,\r\nthough you would be very welcome here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, dear no, sir, I could on no account think of that!\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Sparsit\r\nshook her head, still in her highly superior manner, and a little changed\r\nthe small cough\xe2\x80\x94coughing now, as if the spirit of prophecy rose within\r\nher, but had better be coughed down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98there are apartments at the Bank,\r\nwhere a born and bred lady, as keeper of the place, would be rather a\r\ncatch than otherwise; and if the same terms\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, sir.  You were so good as to promise that you would\r\nalways substitute the phrase, annual compliment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, annual compliment.  If the same annual compliment would be\r\nacceptable there, why, I see nothing to part us, unless you do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98The proposal is like yourself, and if the\r\nposition I shall assume at the Bank is one that I could occupy without\r\ndescending lower in the social scale\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, of course it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98If it was not, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuppose that I should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you\r\nhave moved in.  Not that _I_ care for such society, you know!  But _you_\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Bounderby, you are very considerate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll have your own private apartments, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have your coals and\r\nyour candles, and all the rest of it, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have your maid to attend\r\nupon you, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have your light porter to protect you, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nwhat I take the liberty of considering precious comfortable,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nBounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98say no more.  In yielding up my trust\r\nhere, I shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of\r\ndependence:\xe2\x80\x99 she might have said the sweetbread, for that delicate\r\narticle in a savoury brown sauce was her favourite supper: \xe2\x80\x98and I would\r\nrather receive it from your hand, than from any other.  Therefore, sir, I\r\naccept your offer gratefully, and with many sincere acknowledgments for\r\npast favours.  And I hope, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, concluding in an\r\nimpressively compassionate manner, \xe2\x80\x98I fondly hope that Miss Gradgrind may\r\nbe all you desire, and deserve!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNothing moved Mrs. Sparsit from that position any more.  It was in vain\r\nfor Bounderby to bluster or to assert himself in any of his explosive\r\nways; Mrs. Sparsit was resolved to have compassion on him, as a Victim.\r\nShe was polite, obliging, cheerful, hopeful; but, the more polite, the\r\nmore obliging, the more cheerful, the more hopeful, the more exemplary\r\naltogether, she; the forlorner Sacrifice and Victim, he.  She had that\r\ntenderness for his melancholy fate, that his great red countenance used\r\nto break out into cold perspirations when she looked at him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the marriage was appointed to be solemnized in eight weeks\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntime, and Mr. Bounderby went every evening to Stone Lodge as an accepted\r\nwooer.  Love was made on these occasions in the form of bracelets; and,\r\non all occasions during the period of betrothal, took a manufacturing\r\naspect.  Dresses were made, jewellery was made, cakes and gloves were\r\nmade, settlements were made, and an extensive assortment of Facts did\r\nappropriate honour to the contract.  The business was all Fact, from\r\nfirst to last.  The Hours did not go through any of those rosy\r\nperformances, which foolish poets have ascribed to them at such times;\r\nneither did the clocks go any faster, or any slower, than at other\r\nseasons.  The deadly statistical recorder in the Gradgrind observatory\r\nknocked every second on the head as it was born, and buried it with his\r\naccustomed regularity.\r\n\r\nSo the day came, as all other days come to people who will only stick to\r\nreason; and when it came, there were married in the church of the florid\r\nwooden legs\xe2\x80\x94that popular order of architecture\xe2\x80\x94Josiah Bounderby Esquire\r\nof Coketown, to Louisa eldest daughter of Thomas Gradgrind Esquire of\r\nStone Lodge, M.P. for that borough.  And when they were united in holy\r\nmatrimony, they went home to breakfast at Stone Lodge aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThere was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion, who\r\nknew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of, and how it\r\nwas imported or exported, and in what quantities, and in what bottoms,\r\nwhether native or foreign, and all about it.  The bridesmaids, down to\r\nlittle Jane Gradgrind, were, in an intellectual point of view, fit\r\nhelpmates for the calculating boy; and there was no nonsense about any of\r\nthe company.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, the bridegroom addressed them in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ladies and gentlemen, I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  Since you have\r\ndone my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness,\r\nI suppose I must acknowledge the same; though, as you all know me, and\r\nknow what I am, and what my extraction was, you won\xe2\x80\x99t expect a speech\r\nfrom a man who, when he sees a Post, says \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a Post,\xe2\x80\x9d and when he\r\nsees a Pump, says \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a Pump,\xe2\x80\x9d and is not to be got to call a Post a\r\nPump, or a Pump a Post, or either of them a Toothpick.  If you want a\r\nspeech this morning, my friend and father-in-law, Tom Gradgrind, is a\r\nMember of Parliament, and you know where to get it.  I am not your man.\r\nHowever, if I feel a little independent when I look around this table\r\nto-day, and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter when I was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his face unless\r\nit was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I hope I\r\nmay be excused.  So, I hope you like my feeling independent; if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.  I _do_ feel independent.  Now I have mentioned,\r\nand you have mentioned, that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter.  I am very glad to be so.  It has long been my wish to be so.\r\nI have watched her bringing-up, and I believe she is worthy of me.  At\r\nthe same time\xe2\x80\x94not to deceive you\xe2\x80\x94I believe I am worthy of her.  So, I\r\nthank you, on both our parts, for the good-will you have shown towards\r\nus; and the best wish I can give the unmarried part of the present\r\ncompany, is this: I hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as I have\r\nfound.  And I hope every spinster may find as good a husband as my wife\r\nhas found.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShortly after which oration, as they were going on a nuptial trip to\r\nLyons, in order that Mr. Bounderby might take the opportunity of seeing\r\nhow the Hands got on in those parts, and whether they, too, required to\r\nbe fed with gold spoons; the happy pair departed for the railroad.  The\r\nbride, in passing down-stairs, dressed for her journey, found Tom waiting\r\nfor her\xe2\x80\x94flushed, either with his feelings, or the vinous part of the\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a game girl you are, to be such a first-rate sister, Loo!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhispered Tom.\r\n\r\nShe clung to him as she should have clung to some far better nature that\r\nday, and was a little shaken in her reserved composure for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s quite ready,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Time\xe2\x80\x99s up.  Good-bye!  I shall\r\nbe on the look-out for you, when you come back.  I say, my dear Loo!\r\nAN\xe2\x80\x99T it uncommonly jolly now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n                          END OF THE FIRST BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SECOND\r\n_REAPING_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nEFFECTS IN THE BANK\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUNNY midsummer day.  There was such a thing sometimes, even in\r\nCoketown.\r\n\r\nSeen from a distance in such weather, Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of\r\nits own, which appeared impervious to the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays.  You only knew the\r\ntown was there, because you knew there could have been no such sulky\r\nblotch upon the prospect without a town.  A blur of soot and smoke, now\r\nconfusedly tending this way, now that way, now aspiring to the vault of\r\nHeaven, now murkily creeping along the earth, as the wind rose and fell,\r\nor changed its quarter: a dense formless jumble, with sheets of cross\r\nlight in it, that showed nothing but masses of darkness:\xe2\x80\x94Coketown in the\r\ndistance was suggestive of itself, though not a brick of it could be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe wonder was, it was there at all.  It had been ruined so often, that\r\nit was amazing how it had borne so many shocks.  Surely there never was\r\nsuch fragile china-ware as that of which the millers of Coketown were\r\nmade.  Handle them never so lightly, and they fell to pieces with such\r\nease that you might suspect them of having been flawed before.  They were\r\nruined, when they were required to send labouring children to school;\r\nthey were ruined when inspectors were appointed to look into their works;\r\nthey were ruined, when such inspectors considered it doubtful whether\r\nthey were quite justified in chopping people up with their machinery;\r\nthey were utterly undone, when it was hinted that perhaps they need not\r\nalways make quite so much smoke.  Besides Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s gold spoon\r\nwhich was generally received in Coketown, another prevalent fiction was\r\nvery popular there.  It took the form of a threat.  Whenever a Coketowner\r\nfelt he was ill-used\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, whenever he was not left entirely\r\nalone, and it was proposed to hold him accountable for the consequences\r\nof any of his acts\xe2\x80\x94he was sure to come out with the awful menace, that he\r\nwould \xe2\x80\x98sooner pitch his property into the Atlantic.\xe2\x80\x99  This had terrified\r\nthe Home Secretary within an inch of his life, on several occasions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Coketowners were so patriotic after all, that they never had\r\npitched their property into the Atlantic yet, but, on the contrary, had\r\nbeen kind enough to take mighty good care of it.  So there it was, in the\r\nhaze yonder; and it increased and multiplied.\r\n\r\nThe streets were hot and dusty on the summer day, and the sun was so\r\nbright that it even shone through the heavy vapour drooping over\r\nCoketown, and could not be looked at steadily.  Stokers emerged from low\r\nunderground doorways into factory yards, and sat on steps, and posts, and\r\npalings, wiping their swarthy visages, and contemplating coals.  The\r\nwhole town seemed to be frying in oil.  There was a stifling smell of hot\r\noil everywhere.  The steam-engines shone with it, the dresses of the\r\nHands were soiled with it, the mills throughout their many stories oozed\r\nand trickled it.  The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the\r\nbreath of the simoom: and their inhabitants, wasting with heat, toiled\r\nlanguidly in the desert.  But no temperature made the melancholy mad\r\nelephants more mad or more sane.  Their wearisome heads went up and down\r\nat the same rate, in hot weather and cold, wet weather and dry, fair\r\nweather and foul.  The measured motion of their shadows on the walls, was\r\nthe substitute Coketown had to show for the shadows of rustling woods;\r\nwhile, for the summer hum of insects, it could offer, all the year round,\r\nfrom the dawn of Monday to the night of Saturday, the whirr of shafts and\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\nDrowsily they whirred all through this sunny day, making the passenger\r\nmore sleepy and more hot as he passed the humming walls of the mills.\r\nSun-blinds, and sprinklings of water, a little cooled the main streets\r\nand the shops; but the mills, and the courts and alleys, baked at a\r\nfierce heat.  Down upon the river that was black and thick with dye, some\r\nCoketown boys who were at large\xe2\x80\x94a rare sight there\xe2\x80\x94rowed a crazy boat,\r\nwhich made a spumous track upon the water as it jogged along, while every\r\ndip of an oar stirred up vile smells.  But the sun itself, however\r\nbeneficent, generally, was less kind to Coketown than hard frost, and\r\nrarely looked intently into any of its closer regions without engendering\r\nmore death than life.  So does the eye of Heaven itself become an evil\r\neye, when incapable or sordid hands are interposed between it and the\r\nthings it looks upon to bless.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit sat in her afternoon apartment at the Bank, on the shadier\r\nside of the frying street.  Office-hours were over: and at that period of\r\nthe day, in warm weather, she usually embellished with her genteel\r\npresence, a managerial board-room over the public office.  Her own\r\nprivate sitting-room was a story higher, at the window of which post of\r\nobservation she was ready, every morning, to greet Mr. Bounderby, as he\r\ncame across the road, with the sympathizing recognition appropriate to a\r\nVictim.  He had been married now a year; and Mrs. Sparsit had never\r\nreleased him from her determined pity a moment.\r\n\r\nThe Bank offered no violence to the wholesome monotony of the town.  It\r\nwas another red brick house, with black outside shutters, green inside\r\nblinds, a black street-door up two white steps, a brazen door-plate, and\r\na brazen door-handle full stop.  It was a size larger than Mr.\r\nBounderby\xe2\x80\x99s house, as other houses were from a size to half-a-dozen sizes\r\nsmaller; in all other particulars, it was strictly according to pattern.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit was conscious that by coming in the evening-tide among the\r\ndesks and writing implements, she shed a feminine, not to say also\r\naristocratic, grace upon the office.  Seated, with her needlework or\r\nnetting apparatus, at the window, she had a self-laudatory sense of\r\ncorrecting, by her ladylike deportment, the rude business aspect of the\r\nplace.  With this impression of her interesting character upon her, Mrs.\r\nSparsit considered herself, in some sort, the Bank Fairy.  The\r\ntownspeople who, in their passing and repassing, saw her there, regarded\r\nher as the Bank Dragon keeping watch over the treasures of the mine.\r\n\r\nWhat those treasures were, Mrs. Sparsit knew as little as they did.  Gold\r\nand silver coin, precious paper, secrets that if divulged would bring\r\nvague destruction upon vague persons (generally, however, people whom she\r\ndisliked), were the chief items in her ideal catalogue thereof.  For the\r\nrest, she knew that after office-hours, she reigned supreme over all the\r\noffice furniture, and over a locked-up iron room with three locks,\r\nagainst the door of which strong chamber the light porter laid his head\r\nevery night, on a truckle bed, that disappeared at cockcrow.  Further,\r\nshe was lady paramount over certain vaults in the basement, sharply\r\nspiked off from communication with the predatory world; and over the\r\nrelics of the current day\xe2\x80\x99s work, consisting of blots of ink, worn-out\r\npens, fragments of wafers, and scraps of paper torn so small, that\r\nnothing interesting could ever be deciphered on them when Mrs. Sparsit\r\ntried.  Lastly, she was guardian over a little armoury of cutlasses and\r\ncarbines, arrayed in vengeful order above one of the official\r\nchimney-pieces; and over that respectable tradition never to be separated\r\nfrom a place of business claiming to be wealthy\xe2\x80\x94a row of\r\nfire-buckets\xe2\x80\x94vessels calculated to be of no physical utility on any\r\noccasion, but observed to exercise a fine moral influence, almost equal\r\nto bullion, on most beholders.\r\n\r\nA deaf serving-woman and the light porter completed Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nempire.  The deaf serving-woman was rumoured to be wealthy; and a saying\r\nhad for years gone about among the lower orders of Coketown, that she\r\nwould be murdered some night when the Bank was shut, for the sake of her\r\nmoney.  It was generally considered, indeed, that she had been due some\r\ntime, and ought to have fallen long ago; but she had kept her life, and\r\nher situation, with an ill-conditioned tenacity that occasioned much\r\noffence and disappointment.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s tea was just set for her on a pert little table, with its\r\ntripod of legs in an attitude, which she insinuated after office-hours,\r\ninto the company of the stern, leathern-topped, long board-table that\r\nbestrode the middle of the room.  The light porter placed the tea-tray on\r\nit, knuckling his forehead as a form of homage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Bitzer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank _you_, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the light porter.  He was a very light\r\nporter indeed; as light as in the days when he blinkingly defined a\r\nhorse, for girl number twenty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All is shut up, Bitzer?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All is shut up, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, pouring out her tea, \xe2\x80\x98is the news of the\r\nday?  Anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I have heard anything particular.  Our\r\npeople are a bad lot, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; but that is no news, unfortunately.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are the restless wretches doing now?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs. Sparsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Merely going on in the old way, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  Uniting, and leaguing, and\r\nengaging to stand by one another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is much to be regretted,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, making her nose more\r\nRoman and her eyebrows more Coriolanian in the strength of her severity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that the united masters allow of any such class-combinations.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Being united themselves, they ought one and all to set their faces\r\nagainst employing any man who is united with any other man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nSparsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They have done that, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bitzer; \xe2\x80\x98but it rather fell\r\nthrough, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not pretend to understand these things,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, with\r\ndignity, \xe2\x80\x98my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere;\r\nand Mr. Sparsit, as a Powler, being also quite out of the pale of any\r\nsuch dissensions.  I only know that these people must be conquered, and\r\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s high time it was done, once for all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bitzer, with a demonstration of great respect for\r\nMrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s oracular authority.  \xe2\x80\x98You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put it clearer, I am\r\nsure, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with\r\nMrs. Sparsit, and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was\r\ngoing to ask him something, he made a pretence of arranging the rulers,\r\ninkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her tea, glancing\r\nthrough the open window, down into the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has it been a busy day, Bitzer?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs. Sparsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a very busy day, my lady.  About an average day.\xe2\x80\x99  He now and then\r\nslided into my lady, instead of ma\xe2\x80\x99am, as an involuntary acknowledgment\r\nof Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s personal dignity and claims to reverence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The clerks,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, carefully brushing an imperceptible\r\ncrumb of bread and butter from her left-hand mitten, \xe2\x80\x98are trustworthy,\r\npunctual, and industrious, of course?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, pretty fair, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  With the usual exception.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe held the respectable office of general spy and informer in the\r\nestablishment, for which volunteer service he received a present at\r\nChristmas, over and above his weekly wage.  He had grown into an\r\nextremely clear-headed, cautious, prudent young man, who was safe to rise\r\nin the world.  His mind was so exactly regulated, that he had no\r\naffections or passions.  All his proceedings were the result of the\r\nnicest and coldest calculation; and it was not without cause that Mrs.\r\nSparsit habitually observed of him, that he was a young man of the\r\nsteadiest principle she had ever known.  Having satisfied himself, on his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s death, that his mother had a right of settlement in Coketown,\r\nthis excellent young economist had asserted that right for her with such\r\na steadfast adherence to the principle of the case, that she had been\r\nshut up in the workhouse ever since.  It must be admitted that he allowed\r\nher half a pound of tea a year, which was weak in him: first, because all\r\ngifts have an inevitable tendency to pauperise the recipient, and\r\nsecondly, because his only reasonable transaction in that commodity would\r\nhave been to buy it for as little as he could possibly give, and sell it\r\nfor as much as he could possibly get; it having been clearly ascertained\r\nby philosophers that in this is comprised the whole duty of man\xe2\x80\x94not a\r\npart of man\xe2\x80\x99s duty, but the whole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty fair, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  With the usual exception, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Bitzer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah\xe2\x80\x94h!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head over her tea-cup, and taking\r\na long gulp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Thomas, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I doubt Mr. Thomas very much, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like his\r\nways at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bitzer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, in a very impressive manner, \xe2\x80\x98do you\r\nrecollect my having said anything to you respecting names?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  It\xe2\x80\x99s quite true that you did object to names\r\nbeing used, and they\xe2\x80\x99re always best avoided.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please to remember that I have a charge here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, with\r\nher air of state.  \xe2\x80\x98I hold a trust here, Bitzer, under Mr. Bounderby.\r\nHowever improbable both Mr. Bounderby and myself might have deemed it\r\nyears ago, that he would ever become my patron, making me an annual\r\ncompliment, I cannot but regard him in that light.  From Mr. Bounderby I\r\nhave received every acknowledgment of my social station, and every\r\nrecognition of my family descent, that I could possibly expect.  More,\r\nfar more.  Therefore, to my patron I will be scrupulously true.  And I do\r\nnot consider, I will not consider, I cannot consider,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit,\r\nwith a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality, \xe2\x80\x98that I\r\n_should_ be scrupulously true, if I allowed names to be mentioned under\r\nthis roof, that are unfortunately\xe2\x80\x94most unfortunately\xe2\x80\x94no doubt of\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94connected with his.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBitzer knuckled his forehead again, and again begged pardon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Bitzer,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98say an individual, and I will hear\r\nyou; say Mr. Thomas, and you must excuse me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With the usual exception, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer, trying back, \xe2\x80\x98of an\r\nindividual.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah\xe2\x80\x94h!\xe2\x80\x99  Mrs. Sparsit repeated the ejaculation, the shake of the head\r\nover her tea-cup, and the long gulp, as taking up the conversation again\r\nat the point where it had been interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An individual, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer, \xe2\x80\x98has never been what he ought to\r\nhave been, since he first came into the place.  He is a dissipated,\r\nextravagant idler.  He is not worth his salt, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it\r\neither, if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a friend and relation at court, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah\xe2\x80\x94h!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, with another melancholy shake of her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I only hope, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Bitzer, \xe2\x80\x98that his friend and relation may\r\nnot supply him with the means of carrying on.  Otherwise, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, we know\r\nout of whose pocket _that_ money comes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah\xe2\x80\x94h!\xe2\x80\x99 sighed Mrs. Sparsit again, with another melancholy shake of her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is to be pitied, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  The last party I have alluded to, is to be\r\npitied, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Bitzer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98I have always pitied the delusion,\r\nalways.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As to an individual, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer, dropping his voice and drawing\r\nnearer, \xe2\x80\x98he is as improvident as any of the people in this town.  And you\r\nknow what _their_ improvidence is, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  No one could wish to know it\r\nbetter than a lady of your eminence does.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They would do well,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98to take example by you,\r\nBitzer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  But, since you do refer to me, now look at me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\r\nI have put by a little, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, already.  That gratuity which I receive at\r\nChristmas, ma\xe2\x80\x99am: I never touch it.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t even go the length of my\r\nwages, though they\xe2\x80\x99re not high, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  Why can\xe2\x80\x99t they do as I have done,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am?  What one person can do, another can do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis, again, was among the fictions of Coketown.  Any capitalist there,\r\nwho had made sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence, always professed to\r\nwonder why the sixty thousand nearest Hands didn\xe2\x80\x99t each make sixty\r\nthousand pounds out of sixpence, and more or less reproached them every\r\none for not accomplishing the little feat.  What I did you can do.  Why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you go and do it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As to their wanting recreations, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s stuff and\r\nnonsense.  _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want recreations.  I never did, and I never shall; I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like \xe2\x80\x99em.  As to their combining together; there are many of them,\r\nI have no doubt, that by watching and informing upon one another could\r\nearn a trifle now and then, whether in money or good will, and improve\r\ntheir livelihood.  Then, why don\xe2\x80\x99t they improve it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!  It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nfirst consideration of a rational creature, and it\xe2\x80\x99s what they pretend to\r\nwant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretend indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure we are constantly hearing, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, till it becomes quite\r\nnauseous, concerning their wives and families,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer.  \xe2\x80\x98Why look\r\nat me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!  I don\xe2\x80\x99t want a wife and family.  Why should they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because they are improvident,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bitzer, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s where it is.  If they were more\r\nprovident and less perverse, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, what would they do?  They would say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile my hat covers my family,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwhile my bonnet covers my\r\nfamily,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as the case might be, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have only one to feed, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe person I most like to feed.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Mrs. Sparsit, eating muffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer, knuckling his forehead again, in return\r\nfor the favour of Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s improving conversation.  \xe2\x80\x98Would you wish\r\na little more hot water, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, or is there anything else that I could\r\nfetch you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing just now, Bitzer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to disturb you at your meals, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\nparticularly tea, knowing your partiality for it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer, craning a\r\nlittle to look over into the street from where he stood; \xe2\x80\x98but there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngentleman been looking up here for a minute or so, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and he has come\r\nacross as if he was going to knock.  That _is_ his knock, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, no\r\ndoubt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stepped to the window; and looking out, and drawing in his head again,\r\nconfirmed himself with, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  Would you wish the gentleman to be\r\nshown in, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who it can be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, wiping her mouth and\r\narranging her mittens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A stranger, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, evidently.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a stranger can want at the Bank at this time of the evening, unless\r\nhe comes upon some business for which he is too late, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98but I hold a charge in this establishment from Mr.\r\nBounderby, and I will never shrink from it.  If to see him is any part of\r\nthe duty I have accepted, I will see him.  Use your own discretion,\r\nBitzer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the visitor, all unconscious of Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s magnanimous words,\r\nrepeated his knock so loudly that the light porter hastened down to open\r\nthe door; while Mrs. Sparsit took the precaution of concealing her little\r\ntable, with all its appliances upon it, in a cupboard, and then decamped\r\nup-stairs, that she might appear, if needful, with the greater dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you please, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, the gentleman would wish to see you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer,\r\nwith his light eye at Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s keyhole.  So, Mrs. Sparsit, who had\r\nimproved the interval by touching up her cap, took her classical features\r\ndown-stairs again, and entered the board-room in the manner of a Roman\r\nmatron going outside the city walls to treat with an invading general.\r\n\r\nThe visitor having strolled to the window, and being then engaged in\r\nlooking carelessly out, was as unmoved by this impressive entry as man\r\ncould possibly be.  He stood whistling to himself with all imaginable\r\ncoolness, with his hat still on, and a certain air of exhaustion upon\r\nhim, in part arising from excessive summer, and in part from excessive\r\ngentility.  For it was to be seen with half an eye that he was a thorough\r\ngentleman, made to the model of the time; weary of everything, and\r\nputting no more faith in anything than Lucifer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98you wished to see me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, turning and removing his hat; \xe2\x80\x98pray excuse\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Humph!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mrs. Sparsit, as she made a stately bend.  \xe2\x80\x98Five and\r\nthirty, good-looking, good figure, good teeth, good voice, good breeding,\r\nwell-dressed, dark hair, bold eyes.\xe2\x80\x99  All which Mrs. Sparsit observed in\r\nher womanly way\xe2\x80\x94like the Sultan who put his head in the pail of\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x94merely in dipping down and coming up again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please to be seated, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you.  Allow me.\xe2\x80\x99  He placed a chair for her, but remained himself\r\ncarelessly lounging against the table.  \xe2\x80\x98I left my servant at the railway\r\nlooking after the luggage\xe2\x80\x94very heavy train and vast quantity of it in the\r\nvan\xe2\x80\x94and strolled on, looking about me.  Exceedingly odd place.  Will you\r\nallow me to ask you if it\xe2\x80\x99s _always_ as black as this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In general much blacker,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, in her uncompromising\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it possible!  Excuse me: you are not a native, I think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98It was once my good or ill fortune,\r\nas it may be\xe2\x80\x94before I became a widow\xe2\x80\x94to move in a very different sphere.\r\nMy husband was a Powler.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, really!\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger.  \xe2\x80\x98Was\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit repeated, \xe2\x80\x98A Powler.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Powler Family,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, after reflecting a few moments.  Mrs.\r\nSparsit signified assent.  The stranger seemed a little more fatigued\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must be very much bored here?\xe2\x80\x99 was the inference he drew from the\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am the servant of circumstances, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98and I have\r\nlong adapted myself to the governing power of my life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very philosophical,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the stranger, \xe2\x80\x98and very exemplary and\r\nlaudable, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99  It seemed to be scarcely worth his while to finish the\r\nsentence, so he played with his watch-chain wearily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I be permitted to ask, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98to what I am\r\nindebted for the favour of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Assuredly,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger.  \xe2\x80\x98Much obliged to you for reminding me.\r\nI am the bearer of a letter of introduction to Mr. Bounderby, the banker.\r\nWalking through this extraordinarily black town, while they were getting\r\ndinner ready at the hotel, I asked a fellow whom I met; one of the\r\nworking people; who appeared to have been taking a shower-bath of\r\nsomething fluffy, which I assume to be the raw material\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit inclined her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x94Raw material\xe2\x80\x94where Mr. Bounderby, the banker, might reside.  Upon\r\nwhich, misled no doubt by the word Banker, he directed me to the Bank.\r\nFact being, I presume, that Mr. Bounderby the Banker does _not_ reside in\r\nthe edifice in which I have the honour of offering this explanation?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98he does not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you.  I had no intention of delivering my letter at the present\r\nmoment, nor have I. But strolling on to the Bank to kill time, and having\r\nthe good fortune to observe at the window,\xe2\x80\x99 towards which he languidly\r\nwaved his hand, then slightly bowed, \xe2\x80\x98a lady of a very superior and\r\nagreeable appearance, I considered that I could not do better than take\r\nthe liberty of asking that lady where Mr. Bounderby the Banker _does_\r\nlive.  Which I accordingly venture, with all suitable apologies, to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe inattention and indolence of his manner were sufficiently relieved,\r\nto Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s thinking, by a certain gallantry at ease, which offered\r\nher homage too.  Here he was, for instance, at this moment, all but\r\nsitting on the table, and yet lazily bending over her, as if he\r\nacknowledged an attraction in her that made her charming\xe2\x80\x94in her way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Banks, I know, are always suspicious, and officially must be,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nstranger, whose lightness and smoothness of speech were pleasant\r\nlikewise; suggesting matter far more sensible and humorous than it ever\r\ncontained\xe2\x80\x94which was perhaps a shrewd device of the founder of this\r\nnumerous sect, whosoever may have been that great man: \xe2\x80\x98therefore I may\r\nobserve that my letter\xe2\x80\x94here it is\xe2\x80\x94is from the member for this\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x94whom I have had the pleasure of knowing in London.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit recognized the hand, intimated that such confirmation was\r\nquite unnecessary, and gave Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s address, with all needful\r\nclues and directions in aid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thousand thanks,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger.  \xe2\x80\x98Of course you know the Banker\r\nwell?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98In my dependent relation towards\r\nhim, I have known him ten years.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite an eternity!  I think he married Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s daughter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, suddenly compressing her mouth, \xe2\x80\x98he had\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94honour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The lady is quite a philosopher, I am told?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98_Is_ she?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excuse my impertinent curiosity,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the stranger, fluttering over\r\nMrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrows, with a propitiatory air, \xe2\x80\x98but you know the\r\nfamily, and know the world.  I am about to know the family, and may have\r\nmuch to do with them.  Is the lady so very alarming?  Her father gives\r\nher such a portentously hard-headed reputation, that I have a burning\r\ndesire to know.  Is she absolutely unapproachable?  Repellently and\r\nstunningly clever?  I see, by your meaning smile, you think not.  You\r\nhave poured balm into my anxious soul.  As to age, now.  Forty?  Five and\r\nthirty?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit laughed outright.  \xe2\x80\x98A chit,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.  \xe2\x80\x98Not twenty when she\r\nwas married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I give you my honour, Mrs. Powler,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the stranger, detaching\r\nhimself from the table, \xe2\x80\x98that I never was so astonished in my life!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt really did seem to impress him, to the utmost extent of his capacity\r\nof being impressed.  He looked at his informant for full a quarter of a\r\nminute, and appeared to have the surprise in his mind all the time.  \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nassure you, Mrs. Powler,\xe2\x80\x99 he then said, much exhausted, \xe2\x80\x98that the\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity.  I am obliged\r\nto you, of all things, for correcting so absurd a mistake.  Pray excuse\r\nmy intrusion.  Many thanks.  Good day!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe bowed himself out; and Mrs. Sparsit, hiding in the window curtain, saw\r\nhim languishing down the street on the shady side of the way, observed of\r\nall the town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think of the gentleman, Bitzer?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked the light porter,\r\nwhen he came to take away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Spends a deal of money on his dress, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It must be admitted,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98that it\xe2\x80\x99s very tasteful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bitzer, \xe2\x80\x98if that\xe2\x80\x99s worth the money.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Besides which, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Bitzer, while he was polishing the table,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98he looks to me as if he gamed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s immoral to game,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer, \xe2\x80\x98because the chances are against\r\nthe players.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhether it was that the heat prevented Mrs. Sparsit from working, or\r\nwhether it was that her hand was out, she did no work that night.  She\r\nsat at the window, when the sun began to sink behind the smoke; she sat\r\nthere, when the smoke was burning red, when the colour faded from it,\r\nwhen darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground, and creep upward,\r\nupward, up to the house-tops, up the church steeple, up to the summits of\r\nthe factory chimneys, up to the sky.  Without a candle in the room, Mrs.\r\nSparsit sat at the window, with her hands before her, not thinking much\r\nof the sounds of evening; the whooping of boys, the barking of dogs, the\r\nrumbling of wheels, the steps and voices of passengers, the shrill street\r\ncries, the clogs upon the pavement when it was their hour for going by,\r\nthe shutting-up of shop-shutters.  Not until the light porter announced\r\nthat her nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did Mrs. Sparsit arouse herself\r\nfrom her reverie, and convey her dense black eyebrows\xe2\x80\x94by that time\r\ncreased with meditation, as if they needed ironing out-up-stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, you Fool!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, when she was alone at her supper.  Whom\r\nshe meant, she did not say; but she could scarcely have meant the\r\nsweetbread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nMR. JAMES HARTHOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the\r\nGraces.  They went about recruiting; and where could they enlist recruits\r\nmore hopefully, than among the fine gentlemen who, having found out\r\neverything to be worth nothing, were equally ready for anything?\r\n\r\nMoreover, the healthy spirits who had mounted to this sublime height were\r\nattractive to many of the Gradgrind school.  They liked fine gentlemen;\r\nthey pretended that they did not, but they did.  They became exhausted in\r\nimitation of them; and they yaw-yawed in their speech like them; and they\r\nserved out, with an enervated air, the little mouldy rations of political\r\neconomy, on which they regaled their disciples.  There never before was\r\nseen on earth such a wonderful hybrid race as was thus produced.\r\n\r\nAmong the fine gentlemen not regularly belonging to the Gradgrind school,\r\nthere was one of a good family and a better appearance, with a happy turn\r\nof humour which had told immensely with the House of Commons on the\r\noccasion of his entertaining it with his (and the Board of Directors)\r\nview of a railway accident, in which the most careful officers ever\r\nknown, employed by the most liberal managers ever heard of, assisted by\r\nthe finest mechanical contrivances ever devised, the whole in action on\r\nthe best line ever constructed, had killed five people and wounded\r\nthirty-two, by a casualty without which the excellence of the whole\r\nsystem would have been positively incomplete.  Among the slain was a cow,\r\nand among the scattered articles unowned, a widow\xe2\x80\x99s cap.  And the\r\nhonourable member had so tickled the House (which has a delicate sense of\r\nhumour) by putting the cap on the cow, that it became impatient of any\r\nserious reference to the Coroner\xe2\x80\x99s Inquest, and brought the railway off\r\nwith Cheers and Laughter.\r\n\r\nNow, this gentleman had a younger brother of still better appearance than\r\nhimself, who had tried life as a Cornet of Dragoons, and found it a bore;\r\nand had afterwards tried it in the train of an English minister abroad,\r\nand found it a bore; and had then strolled to Jerusalem, and got bored\r\nthere; and had then gone yachting about the world, and got bored\r\neverywhere.  To whom this honourable and jocular, member fraternally said\r\none day, \xe2\x80\x98Jem, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good opening among the hard Fact fellows, and\r\nthey want men.  I wonder you don\xe2\x80\x99t go in for statistics.\xe2\x80\x99  Jem, rather\r\ntaken by the novelty of the idea, and very hard up for a change, was as\r\nready to \xe2\x80\x98go in\xe2\x80\x99 for statistics as for anything else.  So, he went in.\r\nHe coached himself up with a blue-book or two; and his brother put it\r\nabout among the hard Fact fellows, and said, \xe2\x80\x98If you want to bring in,\r\nfor any place, a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech,\r\nlook after my brother Jem, for he\xe2\x80\x99s your man.\xe2\x80\x99  After a few dashes in the\r\npublic meeting way, Mr. Gradgrind and a council of political sages\r\napproved of Jem, and it was resolved to send him down to Coketown, to\r\nbecome known there and in the neighbourhood.  Hence the letter Jem had\r\nlast night shown to Mrs. Sparsit, which Mr. Bounderby now held in his\r\nhand; superscribed, \xe2\x80\x98Josiah Bounderby, Esquire, Banker, Coketown.\r\nSpecially to introduce James Harthouse, Esquire.  Thomas Gradgrind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithin an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncard, Mr. Bounderby put on his hat and went down to the Hotel.  There he\r\nfound Mr. James Harthouse looking out of window, in a state of mind so\r\ndisconsolate, that he was already half-disposed to \xe2\x80\x98go in\xe2\x80\x99 for something\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said his visitor, \xe2\x80\x98is Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed (though he scarcely looked so)\r\nto have a pleasure he had long expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Coketown, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, obstinately taking a chair, \xe2\x80\x98is not the\r\nkind of place you have been accustomed to.  Therefore, if you will allow\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94or whether you will or not, for I am a plain man\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\r\nsomething about it before we go any further.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Harthouse would be charmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be too sure of that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t promise it.  First\r\nof all, you see our smoke.  That\xe2\x80\x99s meat and drink to us.  It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nhealthiest thing in the world in all respects, and particularly for the\r\nlungs.  If you are one of those who want us to consume it, I differ from\r\nyou.  We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster\r\nthan we wear \xe2\x80\x99em out now, for all the humbugging sentiment in Great\r\nBritain and Ireland.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy way of \xe2\x80\x98going in\xe2\x80\x99 to the fullest extent, Mr. Harthouse rejoined, \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\r\nBounderby, I assure you I am entirely and completely of your way of\r\nthinking.  On conviction.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98Now, you have heard a lot of\r\ntalk about the work in our mills, no doubt.  You have?  Very good.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstate the fact of it to you.  It\xe2\x80\x99s the pleasantest work there is, and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the lightest work there is, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the best-paid work there is.\r\nMore than that, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t improve the mills themselves, unless we laid\r\ndown Turkey carpets on the floors.  Which we\xe2\x80\x99re not a-going to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Bounderby, perfectly right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lastly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98as to our Hands.  There\xe2\x80\x99s not a Hand in this\r\ntown, sir, man, woman, or child, but has one ultimate object in life.\r\nThat object is, to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon.\r\nNow, they\xe2\x80\x99re not a-going\xe2\x80\x94none of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94ever to be fed on turtle soup and\r\nvenison with a gold spoon.  And now you know the place.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Harthouse professed himself in the highest degree instructed and\r\nrefreshed, by this condensed epitome of the whole Coketown question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you see,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98it suits my disposition to have a\r\nfull understanding with a man, particularly with a public man, when I\r\nmake his acquaintance.  I have only one thing more to say to you, Mr.\r\nHarthouse, before assuring you of the pleasure with which I shall\r\nrespond, to the utmost of my poor ability, to my friend Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter of introduction.  You are a man of family.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you deceive\r\nyourself by supposing for a moment that I am a man of family.  I am a bit\r\nof dirty riff-raff, and a genuine scrap of tag, rag, and bobtail.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf anything could have exalted Jem\xe2\x80\x99s interest in Mr. Bounderby, it would\r\nhave been this very circumstance.  Or, so he told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98we may shake hands on equal terms.  I say,\r\nequal terms, because although I know what I am, and the exact depth of\r\nthe gutter I have lifted myself out of, better than any man does, I am as\r\nproud as you are.  I am just as proud as you are.  Having now asserted my\r\nindependence in a proper manner, I may come to how do you find yourself,\r\nand I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe better, Mr. Harthouse gave him to understand as they shook hands, for\r\nthe salubrious air of Coketown.  Mr. Bounderby received the answer with\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you know,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98or perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I married Tom\r\nGradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.  If you have nothing better to do than to walk up\r\ntown with me, I shall be glad to introduce you to Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jem, \xe2\x80\x98you anticipate my dearest wishes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey went out without further discourse; and Mr. Bounderby piloted the\r\nnew acquaintance who so strongly contrasted with him, to the private red\r\nbrick dwelling, with the black outside shutters, the green inside blinds,\r\nand the black street door up the two white steps.  In the drawing-room of\r\nwhich mansion, there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl\r\nMr. James Harthouse had ever seen.  She was so constrained, and yet so\r\ncareless; so reserved, and yet so watchful; so cold and proud, and yet so\r\nsensitively ashamed of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s braggart humility\xe2\x80\x94from which she\r\nshrunk as if every example of it were a cut or a blow; that it was quite\r\na new sensation to observe her.  In face she was no less remarkable than\r\nin manner.  Her features were handsome; but their natural play was so\r\nlocked up, that it seemed impossible to guess at their genuine\r\nexpression.  Utterly indifferent, perfectly self-reliant, never at a\r\nloss, and yet never at her ease, with her figure in company with them\r\nthere, and her mind apparently quite alone\xe2\x80\x94it was of no use \xe2\x80\x98going in\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyet awhile to comprehend this girl, for she baffled all penetration.\r\n\r\nFrom the mistress of the house, the visitor glanced to the house itself.\r\nThere was no mute sign of a woman in the room.  No graceful little\r\nadornment, no fanciful little device, however trivial, anywhere expressed\r\nher influence.  Cheerless and comfortless, boastfully and doggedly rich,\r\nthere the room stared at its present occupants, unsoftened and unrelieved\r\nby the least trace of any womanly occupation.  As Mr. Bounderby stood in\r\nthe midst of his household gods, so those unrelenting divinities occupied\r\ntheir places around Mr. Bounderby, and they were worthy of one another,\r\nand well matched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98is my wife, Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neldest daughter.  Loo, Mr. James Harthouse.  Mr. Harthouse has joined\r\nyour father\xe2\x80\x99s muster-roll.  If he is not Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s colleague before\r\nlong, I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of\r\nour neighbouring towns.  You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my\r\njunior.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she saw in me to marry me, but she saw\r\nsomething in me, I suppose, or she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have married me.  She has\r\nlots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise.  If you want\r\nto cram for anything, I should be troubled to recommend you to a better\r\nadviser than Loo Bounderby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo a more agreeable adviser, or one from whom he would be more likely to\r\nlearn, Mr. Harthouse could never be recommended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99 said his host.  \xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99re in the complimentary line, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\non here, for you\xe2\x80\x99ll meet with no competition.  I have never been in the\r\nway of learning compliments myself, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t profess to understand the\r\nart of paying \xe2\x80\x99em.  In fact, despise \xe2\x80\x99em.  But, your bringing-up was\r\ndifferent from mine; mine was a real thing, by George!  You\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\ngentleman, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be one.  I am Josiah Bounderby of\r\nCoketown, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough for me.  However, though I am not influenced\r\nby manners and station, Loo Bounderby may be.  She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t my\r\nadvantages\xe2\x80\x94disadvantages you would call \xe2\x80\x99em, but I call \xe2\x80\x99em advantages\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll not waste your power, I dare say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jem, turning with a smile to Louisa, \xe2\x80\x98is a noble\r\nanimal in a comparatively natural state, quite free from the harness in\r\nwhich a conventional hack like myself works.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You respect Mr. Bounderby very much,\xe2\x80\x99 she quietly returned.  \xe2\x80\x98It is\r\nnatural that you should.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was disgracefully thrown out, for a gentleman who had seen so much of\r\nthe world, and thought, \xe2\x80\x98Now, how am I to take this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are going to devote yourself, as I gather from what Mr. Bounderby\r\nhas said, to the service of your country.  You have made up your mind,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Louisa, still standing before him where she had first stopped\xe2\x80\x94in all\r\nthe singular contrariety of her self-possession, and her being obviously\r\nvery ill at ease\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98to show the nation the way out of all its\r\ndifficulties.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, laughing, \xe2\x80\x98upon my honour, no.  I will\r\nmake no such pretence to you.  I have seen a little, here and there, up\r\nand down; I have found it all to be very worthless, as everybody has, and\r\nas some confess they have, and some do not; and I am going in for your\r\nrespected father\xe2\x80\x99s opinions\xe2\x80\x94really because I have no choice of opinions,\r\nand may as well back them as anything else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you none of your own?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not so much as the slightest predilection left.  I assure you I\r\nattach not the least importance to any opinions.  The result of the\r\nvarieties of boredom I have undergone, is a conviction (unless conviction\r\nis too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment I entertain on the\r\nsubject), that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other\r\nset, and just as much harm as any other set.  There\xe2\x80\x99s an English family\r\nwith a charming Italian motto.  What will be, will be.  It\xe2\x80\x99s the only\r\ntruth going!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis vicious assumption of honesty in dishonesty\xe2\x80\x94a vice so dangerous, so\r\ndeadly, and so common\xe2\x80\x94seemed, he observed, a little to impress her in his\r\nfavour.  He followed up the advantage, by saying in his pleasantest\r\nmanner: a manner to which she might attach as much or as little meaning\r\nas she pleased: \xe2\x80\x98The side that can prove anything in a line of units,\r\ntens, hundreds, and thousands, Mrs. Bounderby, seems to me to afford the\r\nmost fun, and to give a man the best chance.  I am quite as much attached\r\nto it as if I believed it.  I am quite ready to go in for it, to the same\r\nextent as if I believed it.  And what more could I possibly do, if I did\r\nbelieve it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a singular politician,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me; I have not even that merit.  We are the largest party in the\r\nstate, I assure you, Mrs. Bounderby, if we all fell out of our adopted\r\nranks and were reviewed together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby, who had been in danger of bursting in silence, interposed\r\nhere with a project for postponing the family dinner till half-past six,\r\nand taking Mr. James Harthouse in the meantime on a round of visits to\r\nthe voting and interesting notabilities of Coketown and its vicinity.\r\nThe round of visits was made; and Mr. James Harthouse, with a discreet\r\nuse of his blue coaching, came off triumphantly, though with a\r\nconsiderable accession of boredom.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, he found the dinner-table laid for four, but they sat\r\ndown only three.  It was an appropriate occasion for Mr. Bounderby to\r\ndiscuss the flavour of the hap\xe2\x80\x99orth of stewed eels he had purchased in\r\nthe streets at eight years old; and also of the inferior water, specially\r\nused for laying the dust, with which he had washed down that repast.  He\r\nlikewise entertained his guest over the soup and fish, with the\r\ncalculation that he (Bounderby) had eaten in his youth at least three\r\nhorses under the guise of polonies and saveloys.  These recitals, Jem, in\r\na languid manner, received with \xe2\x80\x98charming!\xe2\x80\x99 every now and then; and they\r\nprobably would have decided him to \xe2\x80\x98go in\xe2\x80\x99 for Jerusalem again to-morrow\r\nmorning, had he been less curious respecting Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 he thought, glancing at her as she sat at the head of\r\nthe table, where her youthful figure, small and slight, but very\r\ngraceful, looked as pretty as it looked misplaced; \xe2\x80\x98is there nothing that\r\nwill move that face?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYes!  By Jupiter, there was something, and here it was, in an unexpected\r\nshape.  Tom appeared.  She changed as the door opened, and broke into a\r\nbeaming smile.\r\n\r\nA beautiful smile.  Mr. James Harthouse might not have thought so much of\r\nit, but that he had wondered so long at her impassive face.  She put out\r\nher hand\xe2\x80\x94a pretty little soft hand; and her fingers closed upon her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s, as if she would have carried them to her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay?\xe2\x80\x99 thought the visitor.  \xe2\x80\x98This whelp is the only creature she\r\ncares for.  So, so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe whelp was presented, and took his chair.  The appellation was not\r\nflattering, but not unmerited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I was your age, young Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98I was punctual, or I\r\ngot no dinner!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you were my age,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Tom, \xe2\x80\x98you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a wrong balance to get\r\nright, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t to dress afterwards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind that now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then,\xe2\x80\x99 grumbled Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t begin with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Harthouse, perfectly hearing this under-strain as\r\nit went on; \xe2\x80\x98your brother\xe2\x80\x99s face is quite familiar to me.  Can I have\r\nseen him abroad?  Or at some public school, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 she resumed, quite interested, \xe2\x80\x98he has never been abroad yet, and\r\nwas educated here, at home.  Tom, love, I am telling Mr. Harthouse that\r\nhe never saw you abroad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No such luck, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.\r\n\r\nThere was little enough in him to brighten her face, for he was a sullen\r\nyoung fellow, and ungracious in his manner even to her.  So much the\r\ngreater must have been the solitude of her heart, and her need of some\r\none on whom to bestow it.  \xe2\x80\x98So much the more is this whelp the only\r\ncreature she has ever cared for,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. James Harthouse, turning it\r\nover and over.  \xe2\x80\x98So much the more.  So much the more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBoth in his sister\xe2\x80\x99s presence, and after she had left the room, the whelp\r\ntook no pains to hide his contempt for Mr. Bounderby, whenever he could\r\nindulge it without the observation of that independent man, by making wry\r\nfaces, or shutting one eye.  Without responding to these telegraphic\r\ncommunications, Mr. Harthouse encouraged him much in the course of the\r\nevening, and showed an unusual liking for him.  At last, when he rose to\r\nreturn to his hotel, and was a little doubtful whether he knew the way by\r\nnight, the whelp immediately proffered his services as guide, and turned\r\nout with him to escort him thither.\r\n\r\n            [Picture: Mr. Harthouse dines at the Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTHE WHELP\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was very remarkable that a young gentleman who had been brought up\r\nunder one continuous system of unnatural restraint, should be a\r\nhypocrite; but it was certainly the case with Tom.  It was very strange\r\nthat a young gentleman who had never been left to his own guidance for\r\nfive consecutive minutes, should be incapable at last of governing\r\nhimself; but so it was with Tom.  It was altogether unaccountable that a\r\nyoung gentleman whose imagination had been strangled in his cradle,\r\nshould be still inconvenienced by its ghost in the form of grovelling\r\nsensualities; but such a monster, beyond all doubt, was Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you smoke?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. James Harthouse, when they came to the hotel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe you!\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.\r\n\r\nHe could do no less than ask Tom up; and Tom could do no less than go up.\r\nWhat with a cooling drink adapted to the weather, but not so weak as\r\ncool; and what with a rarer tobacco than was to be bought in those parts;\r\nTom was soon in a highly free and easy state at his end of the sofa, and\r\nmore than ever disposed to admire his new friend at the other end.\r\n\r\nTom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and\r\ntook an observation of his friend.  \xe2\x80\x98He don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to care about his\r\ndress,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Tom, \xe2\x80\x98and yet how capitally he does it.  What an easy\r\nswell he is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom\xe2\x80\x99s eye, remarked that he drank\r\nnothing, and filled his glass with his own negligent hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee.  Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have\r\nhad about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.\xe2\x80\x99  Tom said this with one eye\r\nshut up again, and looking over his glass knowingly, at his entertainer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A very good fellow indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. James Harthouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think so, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  And shut up his eye again.\r\n\r\nMr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end of the sofa, and\r\nlounging with his back against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before\r\nthe empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front of Tom and looking down at\r\nhim, observed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a comical brother-in-law you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I think you mean,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a piece of caustic, Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr. James Harthouse.\r\n\r\nThere was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a\r\nwaistcoat; in being called Tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice;\r\nin being on such off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers;\r\nthat Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!  I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for old Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98if you mean that.  I\r\nhave always called old Bounderby by the same name when I have talked\r\nabout him, and I have always thought of him in the same way.  I am not\r\ngoing to begin to be polite now, about old Bounderby.  It would be rather\r\nlate in the day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me,\xe2\x80\x99 returned James; \xe2\x80\x98but take care when his wife is by, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His wife?\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98My sister Loo?  O yes!\xe2\x80\x99  And he laughed, and took\r\na little more of the cooling drink.\r\n\r\nJames Harthouse continued to lounge in the same place and attitude,\r\nsmoking his cigar in his own easy way, and looking pleasantly at the\r\nwhelp, as if he knew himself to be a kind of agreeable demon who had only\r\nto hover over him, and he must give up his whole soul if required.  It\r\ncertainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence.  He looked\r\nat his companion sneakingly, he looked at him admiringly, he looked at\r\nhim boldly, and put up one leg on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My sister Loo?\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98_She_ never cared for old Bounderby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the past tense, Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. James Harthouse, striking the\r\nash from his cigar with his little finger.  \xe2\x80\x98We are in the present tense,\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Verb neuter, not to care.  Indicative mood, present tense.  First person\r\nsingular, I do not care; second person singular, thou dost not care;\r\nthird person singular, she does not care,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good!  Very quaint!\xe2\x80\x99 said his friend.  \xe2\x80\x98Though you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I _do_ mean it,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Upon my honour!  Why, you won\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nme, Mr. Harthouse, that you really suppose my sister Loo does care for\r\nold Bounderby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other, \xe2\x80\x98what am I bound to suppose, when I\r\nfind two married people living in harmony and happiness?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTom had by this time got both his legs on the sofa.  If his second leg\r\nhad not been already there when he was called a dear fellow, he would\r\nhave put it up at that great stage of the conversation.  Feeling it\r\nnecessary to do something then, he stretched himself out at greater\r\nlength, and, reclining with the back of his head on the end of the sofa,\r\nand smoking with an infinite assumption of negligence, turned his common\r\nface, and not too sober eyes, towards the face looking down upon him so\r\ncarelessly yet so potently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know our governor, Mr. Harthouse,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, \xe2\x80\x98and therefore, you\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised that Loo married old Bounderby.  She never had a\r\nlover, and the governor proposed old Bounderby, and she took him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very dutiful in your interesting sister,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. James Harthouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been as dutiful, and it would not have come\r\noff as easily,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the whelp, \xe2\x80\x98if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe tempter merely lifted his eyebrows; but the whelp was obliged to go\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_I_ persuaded her,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, with an edifying air of superiority.  \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwas stuck into old Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s bank (where I never wanted to be), and I\r\nknew I should get into scrapes there, if she put old Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s pipe\r\nout; so I told her my wishes, and she came into them.  She would do\r\nanything for me.  It was very game of her, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was charming, Tom!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncontinued Tom coolly, \xe2\x80\x98because my liberty and comfort, and perhaps my\r\ngetting on, depended on it; and she had no other lover, and staying at\r\nhome was like staying in jail\xe2\x80\x94especially when I was gone.  It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as\r\nif she gave up another lover for old Bounderby; but still it was a good\r\nthing in her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perfectly delightful.  And she gets on so placidly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Tom, with contemptuous patronage, \xe2\x80\x98she\xe2\x80\x99s a regular girl.\r\nA girl can get on anywhere.  She has settled down to the life, and _she_\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind.  It does just as well as another.  Besides, though Loo is a\r\ngirl, she\xe2\x80\x99s not a common sort of girl.  She can shut herself up within\r\nherself, and think\xe2\x80\x94as I have often known her sit and watch the fire\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nan hour at a stretch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay?  Has resources of her own,\xe2\x80\x99 said Harthouse, smoking quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not so much of that as you may suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Tom; \xe2\x80\x98for our governor\r\nhad her crammed with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust.  It\xe2\x80\x99s his\r\nsystem.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Formed his daughter on his own model?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Harthouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His daughter?  Ah! and everybody else.  Why, he formed Me that way!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Impossible!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He did, though,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, shaking his head.  \xe2\x80\x98I mean to say, Mr.\r\nHarthouse, that when I first left home and went to old Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s, I was\r\nas flat as a warming-pan, and knew no more about life, than any oyster\r\ndoes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, Tom!  I can hardly believe that.  A joke\xe2\x80\x99s a joke.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my soul!\xe2\x80\x99 said the whelp.  \xe2\x80\x98I am serious; I am indeed!\xe2\x80\x99  He smoked\r\nwith great gravity and dignity for a little while, and then added, in a\r\nhighly complacent tone, \xe2\x80\x98Oh!  I have picked up a little since.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeny that.  But I have done it myself; no thanks to the governor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And your intelligent sister?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My intelligent sister is about where she was.  She used to complain to\r\nme that she had nothing to fall back upon, that girls usually fall back\r\nupon; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how she is to have got over that since.  But _she_\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x99 he sagaciously added, puffing at his cigar again.  \xe2\x80\x98Girls\r\ncan always get on, somehow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Calling at the Bank yesterday evening, for Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s address, I\r\nfound an ancient lady there, who seems to entertain great admiration for\r\nyour sister,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. James Harthouse, throwing away the last small\r\nremnant of the cigar he had now smoked out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mother Sparsit!\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98What! you have seen her already, have you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis friend nodded.  Tom took his cigar out of his mouth, to shut up his\r\neye (which had grown rather unmanageable) with the greater expression,\r\nand to tap his nose several times with his finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mother Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s feeling for Loo is more than admiration, I should\r\nthink,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Say affection and devotion.  Mother Sparsit never set\r\nher cap at Bounderby when he was a bachelor.  Oh no!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThese were the last words spoken by the whelp, before a giddy drowsiness\r\ncame upon him, followed by complete oblivion.  He was roused from the\r\nlatter state by an uneasy dream of being stirred up with a boot, and also\r\nof a voice saying: \xe2\x80\x98Come, it\xe2\x80\x99s late.  Be off!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, scrambling from the sofa.  \xe2\x80\x98I must take my leave of you\r\nthough.  I say.  Yours is very good tobacco.  But it\xe2\x80\x99s too mild.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s too mild,\xe2\x80\x99 returned his entertainer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculously mild,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s the door!  Good\r\nnight!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had another odd dream of being taken by a waiter through a mist,\r\nwhich, after giving him some trouble and difficulty, resolved itself into\r\nthe main street, in which he stood alone.  He then walked home pretty\r\neasily, though not yet free from an impression of the presence and\r\ninfluence of his new friend\xe2\x80\x94as if he were lounging somewhere in the air,\r\nin the same negligent attitude, regarding him with the same look.\r\n\r\nThe whelp went home, and went to bed.  If he had had any sense of what he\r\nhad done that night, and had been less of a whelp and more of a brother,\r\nhe might have turned short on the road, might have gone down to the\r\nill-smelling river that was dyed black, might have gone to bed in it for\r\ngood and all, and have curtained his head for ever with its filthy\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nMEN AND BROTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98OH, my friends, the down-trodden operatives of Coketown!  Oh, my friends\r\nand fellow-countrymen, the slaves of an iron-handed and a grinding\r\ndespotism!  Oh, my friends and fellow-sufferers, and fellow-workmen, and\r\nfellow-men!  I tell you that the hour is come, when we must rally round\r\none another as One united power, and crumble into dust the oppressors\r\nthat too long have battened upon the plunder of our families, upon the\r\nsweat of our brows, upon the labour of our hands, upon the strength of\r\nour sinews, upon the God-created glorious rights of Humanity, and upon\r\nthe holy and eternal privileges of Brotherhood!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good!\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98Hear, hear, hear!\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x99 and other cries, arose in many\r\nvoices from various parts of the densely crowded and suffocatingly close\r\nHall, in which the orator, perched on a stage, delivered himself of this\r\nand what other froth and fume he had in him.  He had declaimed himself\r\ninto a violent heat, and was as hoarse as he was hot.  By dint of roaring\r\nat the top of his voice under a flaring gaslight, clenching his fists,\r\nknitting his brows, setting his teeth, and pounding with his arms, he had\r\ntaken so much out of himself by this time, that he was brought to a stop,\r\nand called for a glass of water.\r\n\r\nAs he stood there, trying to quench his fiery face with his drink of\r\nwater, the comparison between the orator and the crowd of attentive faces\r\nturned towards him, was extremely to his disadvantage.  Judging him by\r\nNature\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, he was above the mass in very little but the stage on\r\nwhich he stood.  In many great respects he was essentially below them.\r\nHe was not so honest, he was not so manly, he was not so good-humoured;\r\nhe substituted cunning for their simplicity, and passion for their safe\r\nsolid sense.  An ill-made, high-shouldered man, with lowering brows, and\r\nhis features crushed into an habitually sour expression, he contrasted\r\nmost unfavourably, even in his mongrel dress, with the great body of his\r\nhearers in their plain working clothes.  Strange as it always is to\r\nconsider any assembly in the act of submissively resigning itself to the\r\ndreariness of some complacent person, lord or commoner, whom\r\nthree-fourths of it could, by no human means, raise out of the slough of\r\ninanity to their own intellectual level, it was particularly strange, and\r\nit was even particularly affecting, to see this crowd of earnest faces,\r\nwhose honesty in the main no competent observer free from bias could\r\ndoubt, so agitated by such a leader.\r\n\r\nGood!  Hear, hear!  Hurrah!  The eagerness both of attention and\r\nintention, exhibited in all the countenances, made them a most impressive\r\nsight.  There was no carelessness, no languor, no idle curiosity; none of\r\nthe many shades of indifference to be seen in all other assemblies,\r\nvisible for one moment there.  That every man felt his condition to be,\r\nsomehow or other, worse than it might be; that every man considered it\r\nincumbent on him to join the rest, towards the making of it better; that\r\nevery man felt his only hope to be in his allying himself to the comrades\r\nby whom he was surrounded; and that in this belief, right or wrong\r\n(unhappily wrong then), the whole of that crowd were gravely, deeply,\r\nfaithfully in earnest; must have been as plain to any one who chose to\r\nsee what was there, as the bare beams of the roof and the whitened brick\r\nwalls.  Nor could any such spectator fail to know in his own breast, that\r\nthese men, through their very delusions, showed great qualities,\r\nsusceptible of being turned to the happiest and best account; and that to\r\npretend (on the strength of sweeping axioms, howsoever cut and dried)\r\nthat they went astray wholly without cause, and of their own irrational\r\nwills, was to pretend that there could be smoke without fire, death\r\nwithout birth, harvest without seed, anything or everything produced from\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThe orator having refreshed himself, wiped his corrugated forehead from\r\nleft to right several times with his handkerchief folded into a pad, and\r\nconcentrated all his revived forces, in a sneer of great disdain and\r\nbitterness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But oh, my friends and brothers!  Oh, men and Englishmen, the\r\ndown-trodden operatives of Coketown!  What shall we say of that man\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nworking-man, that I should find it necessary so to libel the glorious\r\nname\xe2\x80\x94who, being practically and well acquainted with the grievances and\r\nwrongs of you, the injured pith and marrow of this land, and having heard\r\nyou, with a noble and majestic unanimity that will make Tyrants tremble,\r\nresolve for to subscribe to the funds of the United Aggregate Tribunal,\r\nand to abide by the injunctions issued by that body for your benefit,\r\nwhatever they may be\xe2\x80\x94what, I ask you, will you say of that working-man,\r\nsince such I must acknowledge him to be, who, at such a time, deserts his\r\npost, and sells his flag; who, at such a time, turns a traitor and a\r\ncraven and a recreant, who, at such a time, is not ashamed to make to you\r\nthe dastardly and humiliating avowal that he will hold himself aloof, and\r\nwill _not_ be one of those associated in the gallant stand for Freedom\r\nand for Right?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe assembly was divided at this point.  There were some groans and\r\nhisses, but the general sense of honour was much too strong for the\r\ncondemnation of a man unheard.  \xe2\x80\x98Be sure you\xe2\x80\x99re right, Slackbridge!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Put him up!\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear him!\xe2\x80\x99  Such things were said on many sides.\r\nFinally, one strong voice called out, \xe2\x80\x98Is the man heer?  If the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheer, Slackbridge, let\xe2\x80\x99s hear the man himseln, \xe2\x80\x99stead o\xe2\x80\x99 yo.\xe2\x80\x99  Which was\r\nreceived with a round of applause.\r\n\r\nSlackbridge, the orator, looked about him with a withering smile; and,\r\nholding out his right hand at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length (as the manner of all\r\nSlackbridges is), to still the thundering sea, waited until there was a\r\nprofound silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my friends and fellow-men!\xe2\x80\x99 said Slackbridge then, shaking his head\r\nwith violent scorn, \xe2\x80\x98I do not wonder that you, the prostrate sons of\r\nlabour, are incredulous of the existence of such a man.  But he who sold\r\nhis birthright for a mess of pottage existed, and Judas Iscariot existed,\r\nand Castlereagh existed, and this man exists!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere, a brief press and confusion near the stage, ended in the man\r\nhimself standing at the orator\xe2\x80\x99s side before the concourse.  He was pale\r\nand a little moved in the face\xe2\x80\x94his lips especially showed it; but he\r\nstood quiet, with his left hand at his chin, waiting to be heard.  There\r\nwas a chairman to regulate the proceedings, and this functionary now took\r\nthe case into his own hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friends,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98by virtue o\xe2\x80\x99 my office as your president, I askes\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 our friend Slackbridge, who may be a little over hetter in this\r\nbusiness, to take his seat, whiles this man Stephen Blackpool is heern.\r\nYou all know this man Stephen Blackpool.  You know him awlung o\xe2\x80\x99 his\r\nmisfort\xe2\x80\x99ns, and his good name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith that, the chairman shook him frankly by the hand, and sat down\r\nagain.  Slackbridge likewise sat down, wiping his hot forehead\xe2\x80\x94always\r\nfrom left to right, and never the reverse way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friends,\xe2\x80\x99 Stephen began, in the midst of a dead calm; \xe2\x80\x98I ha\xe2\x80\x99 hed\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s been spok\xe2\x80\x99n o\xe2\x80\x99 me, and \xe2\x80\x99tis lickly that I shan\xe2\x80\x99t mend it.  But I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nliefer you\xe2\x80\x99d hearn the truth concernin myseln, fro my lips than fro onny\r\nother man\xe2\x80\x99s, though I never cud\xe2\x80\x99n speak afore so monny, wi\xe2\x80\x99out bein\r\nmoydert and muddled.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSlackbridge shook his head as if he would shake it off, in his\r\nbitterness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m th\xe2\x80\x99 one single Hand in Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s mill, o\xe2\x80\x99 a\xe2\x80\x99 the men theer, as\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t coom in wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 proposed reg\xe2\x80\x99lations.  I canna coom in wi\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em.  My\r\nfriends, I doubt their doin\xe2\x80\x99 yo onny good.  Licker they\xe2\x80\x99ll do yo hurt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSlackbridge laughed, folded his arms, and frowned sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But \xe2\x80\x99t an\xe2\x80\x99t sommuch for that as I stands out.  If that were aw, I\xe2\x80\x99d coom\r\nin wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 rest.  But I ha\xe2\x80\x99 my reasons\xe2\x80\x94mine, yo see\xe2\x80\x94for being hindered;\r\nnot on\xe2\x80\x99y now, but awlus\xe2\x80\x94awlus\xe2\x80\x94life long!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSlackbridge jumped up and stood beside him, gnashing and tearing.  \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nmy friends, what but this did I tell you?  Oh, my fellow-countrymen, what\r\nwarning but this did I give you?  And how shows this recreant conduct in\r\na man on whom unequal laws are known to have fallen heavy?  Oh, you\r\nEnglishmen, I ask you how does this subornation show in one of\r\nyourselves, who is thus consenting to his own undoing and to yours, and\r\nto your children\xe2\x80\x99s and your children\xe2\x80\x99s children\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was some applause, and some crying of Shame upon the man; but the\r\ngreater part of the audience were quiet.  They looked at Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s worn\r\nface, rendered more pathetic by the homely emotions it evinced; and, in\r\nthe kindness of their nature, they were more sorry than indignant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis this Delegate\xe2\x80\x99s trade for t\xe2\x80\x99 speak,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen, \xe2\x80\x98an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s paid\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x99t, an\xe2\x80\x99 he knows his work.  Let him keep to \xe2\x80\x99t.  Let him give no heed\r\nto what I ha had\xe2\x80\x99n to bear.  That\xe2\x80\x99s not for him.  That\xe2\x80\x99s not for nobbody\r\nbut me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a propriety, not to say a dignity in these words, that made the\r\nhearers yet more quiet and attentive.  The same strong voice called out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Slackbridge, let the man be heern, and howd thee tongue!\xe2\x80\x99  Then the\r\nplace was wonderfully still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My brothers,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen, whose low voice was distinctly heard, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nmy fellow-workmen\xe2\x80\x94for that yo are to me, though not, as I knows on, to\r\nthis delegate here\xe2\x80\x94I ha but a word to sen, and I could sen nommore if I\r\nwas to speak till Strike o\xe2\x80\x99 day.  I know weel, aw what\xe2\x80\x99s afore me.  I\r\nknow weel that yo aw resolve to ha nommore ado wi\xe2\x80\x99 a man who is not wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyo in this matther.  I know weel that if I was a lyin parisht i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nroad, yo\xe2\x80\x99d feel it right to pass me by, as a forrenner and stranger.\r\nWhat I ha getn, I mun mak th\xe2\x80\x99 best on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stephen Blackpool,\xe2\x80\x99 said the chairman, rising, \xe2\x80\x98think on \xe2\x80\x99t agen.  Think\r\non \xe2\x80\x99t once agen, lad, afore thou\xe2\x80\x99rt shunned by aw owd friends.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was an universal murmur to the same effect, though no man\r\narticulated a word.  Every eye was fixed on Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s face.  To repent of\r\nhis determination, would be to take a load from all their minds.  He\r\nlooked around him, and knew that it was so.  Not a grain of anger with\r\nthem was in his heart; he knew them, far below their surface weaknesses\r\nand misconceptions, as no one but their fellow-labourer could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ha thowt on \xe2\x80\x99t, above a bit, sir.  I simply canna coom in.  I mun go\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 way as lays afore me.  I mun tak my leave o\xe2\x80\x99 aw heer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe made a sort of reverence to them by holding up his arms, and stood for\r\nthe moment in that attitude; not speaking until they slowly dropped at\r\nhis sides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Monny\xe2\x80\x99s the pleasant word as soom heer has spok\xe2\x80\x99n wi\xe2\x80\x99 me; monny\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nface I see heer, as I first seen when I were yoong and lighter heart\xe2\x80\x99n\r\nthan now.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 never had no fratch afore, sin ever I were born, wi\xe2\x80\x99 any\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 my like; Gonnows I ha\xe2\x80\x99 none now that\xe2\x80\x99s o\xe2\x80\x99 my makin\xe2\x80\x99.  Yo\xe2\x80\x99ll ca\xe2\x80\x99 me\r\ntraitor and that\xe2\x80\x94yo I mean t\xe2\x80\x99 say,\xe2\x80\x99 addressing Slackbridge, \xe2\x80\x98but \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\neasier to ca\xe2\x80\x99 than mak\xe2\x80\x99 out.  So let be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had moved away a pace or two to come down from the platform, when he\r\nremembered something he had not said, and returned again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Haply,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, turning his furrowed face slowly about, that he might\r\nas it were individually address the whole audience, those both near and\r\ndistant; \xe2\x80\x98haply, when this question has been tak\xe2\x80\x99n up and discoosed,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be a threat to turn out if I\xe2\x80\x99m let to work among yo.  I hope I\r\nshall die ere ever such a time cooms, and I shall work solitary among yo\r\nunless it cooms\xe2\x80\x94truly, I mun do \xe2\x80\x99t, my friends; not to brave yo, but to\r\nlive.  I ha nobbut work to live by; and wheerever can I go, I who ha\r\nworked sin I were no heighth at aw, in Coketown heer?  I mak\xe2\x80\x99 no\r\ncomplaints o\xe2\x80\x99 bein turned to the wa\xe2\x80\x99, o\xe2\x80\x99 bein outcasten and overlooken\r\nfro this time forrard, but hope I shall be let to work.  If there is any\r\nright for me at aw, my friends, I think \xe2\x80\x99tis that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken.  Not a sound was audible in the building, but the\r\nslight rustle of men moving a little apart, all along the centre of the\r\nroom, to open a means of passing out, to the man with whom they had all\r\nbound themselves to renounce companionship.  Looking at no one, and going\r\nhis way with a lowly steadiness upon him that asserted nothing and sought\r\nnothing, Old Stephen, with all his troubles on his head, left the scene.\r\n\r\nThen Slackbridge, who had kept his oratorical arm extended during the\r\ngoing out, as if he were repressing with infinite solicitude and by a\r\nwonderful moral power the vehement passions of the multitude, applied\r\nhimself to raising their spirits.  Had not the Roman Brutus, oh, my\r\nBritish countrymen, condemned his son to death; and had not the Spartan\r\nmothers, oh my soon to be victorious friends, driven their flying\r\nchildren on the points of their enemies\xe2\x80\x99 swords?  Then was it not the\r\nsacred duty of the men of Coketown, with forefathers before them, an\r\nadmiring world in company with them, and a posterity to come after them,\r\nto hurl out traitors from the tents they had pitched in a sacred and a\r\nGod-like cause?  The winds of heaven answered Yes; and bore Yes, east,\r\nwest, north, and south.  And consequently three cheers for the United\r\nAggregate Tribunal!\r\n\r\nSlackbridge acted as fugleman, and gave the time.  The multitude of\r\ndoubtful faces (a little conscience-stricken) brightened at the sound,\r\nand took it up.  Private feeling must yield to the common cause.  Hurrah!\r\nThe roof yet vibrated with the cheering, when the assembly dispersed.\r\n\r\nThus easily did Stephen Blackpool fall into the loneliest of lives, the\r\nlife of solitude among a familiar crowd.  The stranger in the land who\r\nlooks into ten thousand faces for some answering look and never finds it,\r\nis in cheering society as compared with him who passes ten averted faces\r\ndaily, that were once the countenances of friends.  Such experience was\r\nto be Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s now, in every waking moment of his life; at his work, on\r\nhis way to it and from it, at his door, at his window, everywhere.  By\r\ngeneral consent, they even avoided that side of the street on which he\r\nhabitually walked; and left it, of all the working men, to him only.\r\n\r\nHe had been for many years, a quiet silent man, associating but little\r\nwith other men, and used to companionship with his own thoughts.  He had\r\nnever known before the strength of the want in his heart for the frequent\r\nrecognition of a nod, a look, a word; or the immense amount of relief\r\nthat had been poured into it by drops through such small means.  It was\r\neven harder than he could have believed possible, to separate in his own\r\nconscience his abandonment by all his fellows from a baseless sense of\r\nshame and disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe first four days of his endurance were days so long and heavy, that he\r\nbegan to be appalled by the prospect before him.  Not only did he see no\r\nRachael all the time, but he avoided every chance of seeing her; for,\r\nalthough he knew that the prohibition did not yet formally extend to the\r\nwomen working in the factories, he found that some of them with whom he\r\nwas acquainted were changed to him, and he feared to try others, and\r\ndreaded that Rachael might be even singled out from the rest if she were\r\nseen in his company.  So, he had been quite alone during the four days,\r\nand had spoken to no one, when, as he was leaving his work at night, a\r\nyoung man of a very light complexion accosted him in the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your name\xe2\x80\x99s Blackpool, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 said the young man.\r\n\r\nStephen coloured to find himself with his hat in his hand, in his\r\ngratitude for being spoken to, or in the suddenness of it, or both.  He\r\nmade a feint of adjusting the lining, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are the Hand they have sent to Coventry, I mean?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer, the\r\nvery light young man in question.\r\n\r\nStephen answered \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I supposed so, from their all appearing to keep away from you.  Mr.\r\nBounderby wants to speak to you.  You know his house, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen said \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then go straight up there, will you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer.  \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re expected,\r\nand have only to tell the servant it\xe2\x80\x99s you.  I belong to the Bank; so, if\r\nyou go straight up without me (I was sent to fetch you), you\xe2\x80\x99ll save me a\r\nwalk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen, whose way had been in the contrary direction, turned about, and\r\nbetook himself as in duty bound, to the red brick castle of the giant\r\nBounderby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nMEN AND MASTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98WELL, Stephen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, in his windy manner, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s this I\r\nhear?  What have these pests of the earth been doing to _you_?  Come in,\r\nand speak up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was into the drawing-room that he was thus bidden.  A tea-table was\r\nset out; and Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s young wife, and her brother, and a great\r\ngentleman from London, were present.  To whom Stephen made his obeisance,\r\nclosing the door and standing near it, with his hat in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is the man I was telling you about, Harthouse,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby.\r\nThe gentleman he addressed, who was talking to Mrs. Bounderby on the\r\nsofa, got up, saying in an indolent way, \xe2\x80\x98Oh really?\xe2\x80\x99 and dawdled to the\r\nhearthrug where Mr. Bounderby stood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98speak up!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter the four days he had passed, this address fell rudely and\r\ndiscordantly on Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s ear.  Besides being a rough handling of his\r\nwounded mind, it seemed to assume that he really was the self-interested\r\ndeserter he had been called.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What were it, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen, \xe2\x80\x98as yo were pleased to want wi\xe2\x80\x99 me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I have told you,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98Speak up like a man, since\r\nyou are a man, and tell us about yourself and this Combination.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wi\xe2\x80\x99 yor pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen Blackpool, \xe2\x80\x98I ha\xe2\x80\x99 nowt to sen about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby, who was always more or less like a Wind, finding something\r\nin his way here, began to blow at it directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, look here, Harthouse,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99s a specimen of \xe2\x80\x99em.  When\r\nthis man was here once before, I warned this man against the mischievous\r\nstrangers who are always about\xe2\x80\x94and who ought to be hanged wherever they\r\nare found\xe2\x80\x94and I told this man that he was going in the wrong direction.\r\nNow, would you believe it, that although they have put this mark upon\r\nhim, he is such a slave to them still, that he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid to open his lips\r\nabout them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I sed as I had nowt to sen, sir; not as I was fearfo\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 openin\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\nlips.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You said!  Ah!  _I_ know what you said; more than that, I know what you\r\nmean, you see.  Not always the same thing, by the Lord Harry!  Quite\r\ndifferent things.  You had better tell us at once, that that fellow\r\nSlackbridge is not in the town, stirring up the people to mutiny; and\r\nthat he is not a regular qualified leader of the people: that is, a most\r\nconfounded scoundrel.  You had better tell us so at once; you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeceive me.  You want to tell us so.  Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m as sooary as yo, sir, when the people\xe2\x80\x99s leaders is bad,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nStephen, shaking his head.  \xe2\x80\x98They taks such as offers.  Haply \xe2\x80\x99tis na\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe sma\xe2\x80\x99est o\xe2\x80\x99 their misfortuns when they can get no better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wind began to get boisterous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, you\xe2\x80\x99ll think this pretty well, Harthouse,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll think this tolerably strong.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll say, upon my soul this is a\r\ntidy specimen of what my friends have to deal with; but this is nothing,\r\nsir!  You shall hear me ask this man a question.  Pray, Mr.\r\nBlackpool\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94wind springing up very fast\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98may I take the liberty of asking\r\nyou how it happens that you refused to be in this Combination?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How \xe2\x80\x99t happens?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, with his thumbs in the arms of his coat, and\r\njerking his head and shutting his eyes in confidence with the opposite\r\nwall: \xe2\x80\x98how it happens.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d leefer not coom to \xe2\x80\x99t, sir; but sin you put th\xe2\x80\x99 question\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 not\r\nwant\xe2\x80\x99n t\xe2\x80\x99 be ill-manner\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer.  I ha passed a promess.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not to me, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.  (Gusty weather with deceitful\r\ncalms.  One now prevailing.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, sir.  Not to yo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As for me, any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do\r\nwith it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, still in confidence with the wall.  \xe2\x80\x98If only\r\nJosiah Bounderby of Coketown had been in question, you would have joined\r\nand made no bones about it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why yes, sir.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis true.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Though he knows,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, now blowing a gale, \xe2\x80\x98that there\r\nare a set of rascals and rebels whom transportation is too good for!\r\nNow, Mr. Harthouse, you have been knocking about in the world some time.\r\nDid you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed\r\ncountry?\xe2\x80\x99  And Mr. Bounderby pointed him out for inspection, with an\r\nangry finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen Blackpool, staunchly protesting against the\r\nwords that had been used, and instinctively addressing himself to Louisa,\r\nafter glancing at her face.  \xe2\x80\x98Not rebels, nor yet rascals.  Nowt o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nkind, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, nowt o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 kind.  They\xe2\x80\x99ve not doon me a kindness, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, as\r\nI know and feel.  But there\xe2\x80\x99s not a dozen men amoong \xe2\x80\x99em, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94a dozen?\r\nNot six\xe2\x80\x94but what believes as he has doon his duty by the rest and by\r\nhimseln.  God forbid as I, that ha\xe2\x80\x99 known, and had\xe2\x80\x99n experience o\xe2\x80\x99 these\r\nmen aw my life\xe2\x80\x94I, that ha\xe2\x80\x99 ett\xe2\x80\x99n an\xe2\x80\x99 droonken wi\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em, an\xe2\x80\x99 seet\xe2\x80\x99n wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, and toil\xe2\x80\x99n wi\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em, and lov\xe2\x80\x99n \xe2\x80\x99em, should fail fur to stan by \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 the truth, let \xe2\x80\x99em ha\xe2\x80\x99 doon to me what they may!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe spoke with the rugged earnestness of his place and character\xe2\x80\x94deepened\r\nperhaps by a proud consciousness that he was faithful to his class under\r\nall their mistrust; but he fully remembered where he was, and did not\r\neven raise his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, no.  They\xe2\x80\x99re true to one another, faithfo\xe2\x80\x99 to one another,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99fectionate to one another, e\xe2\x80\x99en to death.  Be poor amoong \xe2\x80\x99em, be sick\r\namoong \xe2\x80\x99em, grieve amoong \xe2\x80\x99em for onny o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 monny causes that carries\r\ngrief to the poor man\xe2\x80\x99s door, an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99ll be tender wi\xe2\x80\x99 yo, gentle wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyo, comfortable wi\xe2\x80\x99 yo, Chrisen wi\xe2\x80\x99 yo.  Be sure o\xe2\x80\x99 that, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  They\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe riven to bits, ere ever they\xe2\x80\x99d be different.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In short,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s because they are so full of virtues\r\nthat they have turned you adrift.  Go through with it while you are about\r\nit.  Out with it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How \xe2\x80\x99tis, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Stephen, appearing still to find his natural\r\nrefuge in Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s face, \xe2\x80\x98that what is best in us fok, seems to turn us\r\nmost to trouble an\xe2\x80\x99 misfort\xe2\x80\x99n an\xe2\x80\x99 mistake, I dunno.  But \xe2\x80\x99tis so.  I know\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis, as I know the heavens is over me ahint the smoke.  We\xe2\x80\x99re patient\r\ntoo, an\xe2\x80\x99 wants in general to do right.  An\xe2\x80\x99 I canna think the fawt is aw\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, my friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, whom he could not have exasperated\r\nmore, quite unconscious of it though he was, than by seeming to appeal to\r\nany one else, \xe2\x80\x98if you will favour me with your attention for half a\r\nminute, I should like to have a word or two with you.  You said just now,\r\nthat you had nothing to tell us about this business.  You are quite sure\r\nof that before we go any further.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, I am sure on \xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman from London present,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Bounderby made a backhanded\r\npoint at Mr. James Harthouse with his thumb, \xe2\x80\x98a Parliament gentleman.  I\r\nshould like him to hear a short bit of dialogue between you and me,\r\ninstead of taking the substance of it\xe2\x80\x94for I know precious well,\r\nbeforehand, what it will be; nobody knows better than I do, take\r\nnotice!\xe2\x80\x94instead of receiving it on trust from my mouth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen bent his head to the gentleman from London, and showed a rather\r\nmore troubled mind than usual.  He turned his eyes involuntarily to his\r\nformer refuge, but at a look from that quarter (expressive though\r\ninstantaneous) he settled them on Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, what do you complain of?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ha\xe2\x80\x99 not coom here, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 Stephen reminded him, \xe2\x80\x98to complain.  I coom\r\nfor that I were sent for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Bounderby, folding his arms, \xe2\x80\x98do you people, in a\r\ngeneral way, complain of?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen looked at him with some little irresolution for a moment, and\r\nthen seemed to make up his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, I were never good at showin o \xe2\x80\x99t, though I ha had\xe2\x80\x99n my share in\r\nfeeling o \xe2\x80\x99t.  \xe2\x80\x99Deed we are in a muddle, sir.  Look round town\xe2\x80\x94so rich as\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis\xe2\x80\x94and see the numbers o\xe2\x80\x99 people as has been broughten into bein heer,\r\nfur to weave, an\xe2\x80\x99 to card, an\xe2\x80\x99 to piece out a livin\xe2\x80\x99, aw the same one\r\nway, somehows, \xe2\x80\x99twixt their cradles and their graves.  Look how we live,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 wheer we live, an\xe2\x80\x99 in what numbers, an\xe2\x80\x99 by what chances, and wi\xe2\x80\x99 what\r\nsameness; and look how the mills is awlus a goin, and how they never\r\nworks us no nigher to ony dis\xe2\x80\x99ant object\xe2\x80\x94ceptin awlus, Death.  Look how\r\nyou considers of us, and writes of us, and talks of us, and goes up wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyor deputations to Secretaries o\xe2\x80\x99 State \xe2\x80\x99bout us, and how yo are awlus\r\nright, and how we are awlus wrong, and never had\xe2\x80\x99n no reason in us sin\r\never we were born.  Look how this ha growen an\xe2\x80\x99 growen, sir, bigger an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbigger, broader an\xe2\x80\x99 broader, harder an\xe2\x80\x99 harder, fro year to year, fro\r\ngeneration unto generation.  Who can look on \xe2\x80\x99t, sir, and fairly tell a\r\nman \xe2\x80\x99tis not a muddle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98Now perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll let the gentleman\r\nknow, how you would set this muddle (as you\xe2\x80\x99re so fond of calling it) to\r\nrights.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I donno, sir.  I canna be expecten to \xe2\x80\x99t.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis not me as should be\r\nlooken to for that, sir.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis them as is put ower me, and ower aw the\r\nrest of us.  What do they tak upon themseln, sir, if not to do\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something towards it, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr.\r\nBounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98We will make an example of half a dozen Slackbridges.  We\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nindict the blackguards for felony, and get \xe2\x80\x99em shipped off to penal\r\nsettlements.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen gravely shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me we won\xe2\x80\x99t, man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, by this time blowing a\r\nhurricane, \xe2\x80\x98because we will, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Stephen, with the quiet confidence of absolute certainty,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98if yo was t\xe2\x80\x99 tak a hundred Slackbridges\xe2\x80\x94aw as there is, and aw the\r\nnumber ten times towd\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 was t\xe2\x80\x99 sew \xe2\x80\x99em up in separate sacks, an\xe2\x80\x99 sink\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em in the deepest ocean as were made ere ever dry land coom to be, yo\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nleave the muddle just wheer \xe2\x80\x99tis.  Mischeevous strangers!\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen,\r\nwith an anxious smile; \xe2\x80\x98when ha we not heern, I am sure, sin ever we can\r\ncall to mind, o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 mischeevous strangers!  \xe2\x80\x99Tis not by _them_ the\r\ntrouble\xe2\x80\x99s made, sir.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis not wi\xe2\x80\x99 _them_ \xe2\x80\x99t commences.  I ha no favour\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94I ha no reason to favour \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94but \xe2\x80\x99tis hopeless and useless to\r\ndream o\xe2\x80\x99 takin them fro their trade, \xe2\x80\x99stead o\xe2\x80\x99 takin their trade fro\r\nthem!  Aw that\xe2\x80\x99s now about me in this room were heer afore I coom, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwill be heer when I am gone.  Put that clock aboard a ship an\xe2\x80\x99 pack it\r\noff to Norfolk Island, an\xe2\x80\x99 the time will go on just the same.  So \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 Slackbridge every bit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nReverting for a moment to his former refuge, he observed a cautionary\r\nmovement of her eyes towards the door.  Stepping back, he put his hand\r\nupon the lock.  But he had not spoken out of his own will and desire; and\r\nhe felt it in his heart a noble return for his late injurious treatment\r\nto be faithful to the last to those who had repudiated him.  He stayed to\r\nfinish what was in his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, I canna, wi\xe2\x80\x99 my little learning an\xe2\x80\x99 my common way, tell the\r\ngenelman what will better aw this\xe2\x80\x94though some working men o\xe2\x80\x99 this town\r\ncould, above my powers\xe2\x80\x94but I can tell him what I know will never do \xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nThe strong hand will never do \xe2\x80\x99t.  Vict\xe2\x80\x99ry and triumph will never do \xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nAgreeing fur to mak one side unnat\xe2\x80\x99rally awlus and for ever right, and\r\ntoother side unnat\xe2\x80\x99rally awlus and for ever wrong, will never, never do\r\n\xe2\x80\x99t.  Nor yet lettin alone will never do \xe2\x80\x99t.  Let thousands upon thousands\r\nalone, aw leading the like lives and aw faw\xe2\x80\x99en into the like muddle, and\r\nthey will be as one, and yo will be as anoother, wi\xe2\x80\x99 a black unpassable\r\nworld betwixt yo, just as long or short a time as sich-like misery can\r\nlast.  Not drawin nigh to fok, wi\xe2\x80\x99 kindness and patience an\xe2\x80\x99 cheery ways,\r\nthat so draws nigh to one another in their monny troubles, and so\r\ncherishes one another in their distresses wi\xe2\x80\x99 what they need\r\nthemseln\xe2\x80\x94like, I humbly believe, as no people the genelman ha seen in aw\r\nhis travels can beat\xe2\x80\x94will never do \xe2\x80\x99t till th\xe2\x80\x99 Sun turns t\xe2\x80\x99 ice.  Most o\xe2\x80\x99\r\naw, rating \xe2\x80\x99em as so much Power, and reg\xe2\x80\x99latin \xe2\x80\x99em as if they was figures\r\nin a soom, or machines: wi\xe2\x80\x99out loves and likens, wi\xe2\x80\x99out memories and\r\ninclinations, wi\xe2\x80\x99out souls to weary and souls to hope\xe2\x80\x94when aw goes quiet,\r\ndraggin on wi\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em as if they\xe2\x80\x99d nowt o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 kind, and when aw goes\r\nonquiet, reproachin \xe2\x80\x99em for their want o\xe2\x80\x99 sitch humanly feelins in their\r\ndealins wi\xe2\x80\x99 yo\xe2\x80\x94this will never do \xe2\x80\x99t, sir, till God\xe2\x80\x99s work is onmade.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen stood with the open door in his hand, waiting to know if anything\r\nmore were expected of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just stop a moment,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, excessively red in the face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I told you, the last time you were here with a grievance, that you had\r\nbetter turn about and come out of that.  And I also told you, if you\r\nremember, that I was up to the gold spoon look-out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I were not up to \xe2\x80\x99t myseln, sir; I do assure yo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now it\xe2\x80\x99s clear to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98that you are one of those\r\nchaps who have always got a grievance.  And you go about, sowing it and\r\nraising crops.  That\xe2\x80\x99s the business of _your_ life, my friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen shook his head, mutely protesting that indeed he had other\r\nbusiness to do for his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are such a waspish, raspish, ill-conditioned chap, you see,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98that even your own Union, the men who know you best, will\r\nhave nothing to do with you.  I never thought those fellows could be\r\nright in anything; but I tell you what!  I so far go along with them for\r\na novelty, that _I_\xe2\x80\x99ll have nothing to do with you either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen raised his eyes quickly to his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can finish off what you\xe2\x80\x99re at,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, with a meaning\r\nnod, \xe2\x80\x98and then go elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, yo know weel,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen expressively, \xe2\x80\x98that if I canna get work\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 yo, I canna get it elsewheer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe reply was, \xe2\x80\x98What I know, I know; and what you know, you know.  I have\r\nno more to say about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen glanced at Louisa again, but her eyes were raised to his no more;\r\ntherefore, with a sigh, and saying, barely above his breath, \xe2\x80\x98Heaven help\r\nus aw in this world!\xe2\x80\x99 he departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nFADING AWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was falling dark when Stephen came out of Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s house.  The\r\nshadows of night had gathered so fast, that he did not look about him\r\nwhen he closed the door, but plodded straight along the street.  Nothing\r\nwas further from his thoughts than the curious old woman he had\r\nencountered on his previous visit to the same house, when he heard a step\r\nbehind him that he knew, and turning, saw her in Rachael\xe2\x80\x99s company.\r\n\r\nHe saw Rachael first, as he had heard her only.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Rachael, my dear!  Missus, thou wi\xe2\x80\x99 her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, and now you are surprised to be sure, and with reason I must say,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe old woman returned.  \xe2\x80\x98Here I am again, you see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But how wi\xe2\x80\x99 Rachael?\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen, falling into their step, walking\r\nbetween them, and looking from the one to the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I come to be with this good lass pretty much as I came to be with\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old woman, cheerfully, taking the reply upon herself.  \xe2\x80\x98My\r\nvisiting time is later this year than usual, for I have been rather\r\ntroubled with shortness of breath, and so put it off till the weather was\r\nfine and warm.  For the same reason I don\xe2\x80\x99t make all my journey in one\r\nday, but divide it into two days, and get a bed to-night at the\r\nTravellers\xe2\x80\x99 Coffee House down by the railroad (a nice clean house), and\r\ngo back Parliamentary, at six in the morning.  Well, but what has this to\r\ndo with this good lass, says you?  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell you.  I have heard\r\nof Mr. Bounderby being married.  I read it in the paper, where it looked\r\ngrand\xe2\x80\x94oh, it looked fine!\xe2\x80\x99 the old woman dwelt on it with strange\r\nenthusiasm: \xe2\x80\x98and I want to see his wife.  I have never seen her yet.\r\nNow, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll believe me, she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come out of that house since noon\r\nto-day.  So not to give her up too easily, I was waiting about, a little\r\nlast bit more, when I passed close to this good lass two or three times;\r\nand her face being so friendly I spoke to her, and she spoke to me.\r\nThere!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old woman to Stephen, \xe2\x80\x98you can make all the rest out for\r\nyourself now, a deal shorter than I can, I dare say!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOnce again, Stephen had to conquer an instinctive propensity to dislike\r\nthis old woman, though her manner was as honest and simple as a manner\r\npossibly could be.  With a gentleness that was as natural to him as he\r\nknew it to be to Rachael, he pursued the subject that interested her in\r\nher old age.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, missus,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I ha seen the lady, and she were young and\r\nhansom.  Wi\xe2\x80\x99 fine dark thinkin eyes, and a still way, Rachael, as I ha\r\nnever seen the like on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Young and handsome.  Yes!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the old woman, quite delighted.  \xe2\x80\x98As\r\nbonny as a rose!  And what a happy wife!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aye, missus, I suppose she be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen.  But with a doubtful\r\nglance at Rachael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose she be?  She must be.  She\xe2\x80\x99s your master\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the\r\nold woman.\r\n\r\nStephen nodded assent.  \xe2\x80\x98Though as to master,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, glancing again at\r\nRachael, \xe2\x80\x98not master onny more.  That\xe2\x80\x99s aw enden \xe2\x80\x99twixt him and me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you left his work, Stephen?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Rachael, anxiously and quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Rachael,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, \xe2\x80\x98whether I ha lef\xe2\x80\x99n his work, or whether his\r\nwork ha lef\xe2\x80\x99n me, cooms t\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 same.  His work and me are parted.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nas weel so\xe2\x80\x94better, I were thinkin when yo coom up wi\xe2\x80\x99 me.  It would ha\r\nbrought\xe2\x80\x99n trouble upon trouble if I had stayed theer.  Haply \xe2\x80\x99tis a\r\nkindness to monny that I go; haply \xe2\x80\x99tis a kindness to myseln; anyways it\r\nmun be done.  I mun turn my face fro Coketown fur th\xe2\x80\x99 time, and seek a\r\nfort\xe2\x80\x99n, dear, by beginnin fresh.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where will you go, Stephen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I donno t\xe2\x80\x99night,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, lifting off his hat, and smoothing his thin\r\nhair with the flat of his hand.  \xe2\x80\x98But I\xe2\x80\x99m not goin t\xe2\x80\x99night, Rachael, nor\r\nyet t\xe2\x80\x99morrow.  \xe2\x80\x99Tan\xe2\x80\x99t easy overmuch t\xe2\x80\x99 know wheer t\xe2\x80\x99 turn, but a good\r\nheart will coom to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHerein, too, the sense of even thinking unselfishly aided him.  Before he\r\nhad so much as closed Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s door, he had reflected that at\r\nleast his being obliged to go away was good for her, as it would save her\r\nfrom the chance of being brought into question for not withdrawing from\r\nhim.  Though it would cost him a hard pang to leave her, and though he\r\ncould think of no similar place in which his condemnation would not\r\npursue him, perhaps it was almost a relief to be forced away from the\r\nendurance of the last four days, even to unknown difficulties and\r\ndistresses.\r\n\r\nSo he said, with truth, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m more leetsome, Rachael, under \xe2\x80\x99t, than I\r\ncould\xe2\x80\x99n ha believed.\xe2\x80\x99  It was not her part to make his burden heavier.\r\nShe answered with her comforting smile, and the three walked on together.\r\n\r\nAge, especially when it strives to be self-reliant and cheerful, finds\r\nmuch consideration among the poor.  The old woman was so decent and\r\ncontented, and made so light of her infirmities, though they had\r\nincreased upon her since her former interview with Stephen, that they\r\nboth took an interest in her.  She was too sprightly to allow of their\r\nwalking at a slow pace on her account, but she was very grateful to be\r\ntalked to, and very willing to talk to any extent: so, when they came to\r\ntheir part of the town, she was more brisk and vivacious than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come to my poor place, missus,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen, \xe2\x80\x98and tak a coop o\xe2\x80\x99 tea.\r\nRachael will coom then; and arterwards I\xe2\x80\x99ll see thee safe t\xe2\x80\x99 thy\r\nTravellers\xe2\x80\x99 lodgin.  \xe2\x80\x99T may be long, Rachael, ere ever I ha th\xe2\x80\x99 chance o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthy coompany agen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey complied, and the three went on to the house where he lodged.  When\r\nthey turned into a narrow street, Stephen glanced at his window with a\r\ndread that always haunted his desolate home; but it was open, as he had\r\nleft it, and no one was there.  The evil spirit of his life had flitted\r\naway again, months ago, and he had heard no more of her since.  The only\r\nevidence of her last return now, were the scantier moveables in his room,\r\nand the grayer hair upon his head.\r\n\r\nHe lighted a candle, set out his little tea-board, got hot water from\r\nbelow, and brought in small portions of tea and sugar, a loaf, and some\r\nbutter from the nearest shop.  The bread was new and crusty, the butter\r\nfresh, and the sugar lump, of course\xe2\x80\x94in fulfilment of the standard\r\ntestimony of the Coketown magnates, that these people lived like princes,\r\nsir.  Rachael made the tea (so large a party necessitated the borrowing\r\nof a cup), and the visitor enjoyed it mightily.  It was the first glimpse\r\nof sociality the host had had for many days.  He too, with the world a\r\nwide heath before him, enjoyed the meal\xe2\x80\x94again in corroboration of the\r\nmagnates, as exemplifying the utter want of calculation on the part of\r\nthese people, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ha never thowt yet, missus,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen, \xe2\x80\x98o\xe2\x80\x99 askin thy name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old lady announced herself as \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Pegler.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A widder, I think?\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, many long years!\xe2\x80\x99  Mrs. Pegler\xe2\x80\x99s husband (one of the best on record)\r\nwas already dead, by Mrs. Pegler\xe2\x80\x99s calculation, when Stephen was born.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a one,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen.  \xe2\x80\x98Onny\r\nchildren?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Pegler\xe2\x80\x99s cup, rattling against her saucer as she held it, denoted\r\nsome nervousness on her part.  \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.  \xe2\x80\x98Not now, not now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dead, Stephen,\xe2\x80\x99 Rachael softly hinted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sooary I ha spok\xe2\x80\x99n on \xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen, \xe2\x80\x98I ought t\xe2\x80\x99 hadn in my mind\r\nas I might touch a sore place.  I\xe2\x80\x94I blame myseln.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile he excused himself, the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s cup rattled more and more.  \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhad a son,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual\r\nappearances of sorrow; \xe2\x80\x98and he did well, wonderfully well.  But he is not\r\nto be spoken of if you please.  He is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99  Putting down her cup, she moved\r\nher hands as if she would have added, by her action, \xe2\x80\x98dead!\xe2\x80\x99  Then she\r\nsaid aloud, \xe2\x80\x98I have lost him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain,\r\nwhen his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him to\r\nthe door, whispered in his ear.  Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf, for\r\nshe caught a word as it was uttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bounderby!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the\r\ntable.  \xe2\x80\x98Oh hide me!  Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me be seen for the world.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t let him\r\ncome up till I\xe2\x80\x99ve got away.  Pray, pray!\xe2\x80\x99  She trembled, and was\r\nexcessively agitated; getting behind Rachael, when Rachael tried to\r\nreassure her; and not seeming to know what she was about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But hearken, missus, hearken,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen, astonished.  \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr.\r\nBounderby; \xe2\x80\x99tis his wife.  Yo\xe2\x80\x99r not fearfo\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 her.  Yo was hey-go-mad\r\nabout her, but an hour sin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But are you sure it\xe2\x80\x99s the lady, and not the gentleman?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked, still\r\ntrembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certain sure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well then, pray don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me, nor yet take any notice of me,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe old woman.  \xe2\x80\x98Let me be quite to myself in this corner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen nodded; looking to Rachael for an explanation, which she was\r\nquite unable to give him; took the candle, went downstairs, and in a few\r\nmoments returned, lighting Louisa into the room.  She was followed by the\r\nwhelp.\r\n\r\nRachael had risen, and stood apart with her shawl and bonnet in her hand,\r\nwhen Stephen, himself profoundly astonished by this visit, put the candle\r\non the table.  Then he too stood, with his doubled hand upon the table\r\nnear it, waiting to be addressed.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in her life Louisa had come into one of the dwellings\r\nof the Coketown Hands; for the first time in her life she was face to\r\nface with anything like individuality in connection with them.  She knew\r\nof their existence by hundreds and by thousands.  She knew what results\r\nin work a given number of them would produce in a given space of time.\r\nShe knew them in crowds passing to and from their nests, like ants or\r\nbeetles.  But she knew from her reading infinitely more of the ways of\r\ntoiling insects than of these toiling men and women.\r\n\r\nSomething to be worked so much and paid so much, and there ended;\r\nsomething to be infallibly settled by laws of supply and demand;\r\nsomething that blundered against those laws, and floundered into\r\ndifficulty; something that was a little pinched when wheat was dear, and\r\nover-ate itself when wheat was cheap; something that increased at such a\r\nrate of percentage, and yielded such another percentage of crime, and\r\nsuch another percentage of pauperism; something wholesale, of which vast\r\nfortunes were made; something that occasionally rose like a sea, and did\r\nsome harm and waste (chiefly to itself), and fell again; this she knew\r\nthe Coketown Hands to be.  But, she had scarcely thought more of\r\nseparating them into units, than of separating the sea itself into its\r\ncomponent drops.\r\n\r\nShe stood for some moments looking round the room.  From the few chairs,\r\nthe few books, the common prints, and the bed, she glanced to the two\r\nwomen, and to Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have come to speak to you, in consequence of what passed just now.  I\r\nshould like to be serviceable to you, if you will let me.  Is this your\r\nwife?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRachael raised her eyes, and they sufficiently answered no, and dropped\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I remember,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, reddening at her mistake; \xe2\x80\x98I recollect, now,\r\nto have heard your domestic misfortunes spoken of, though I was not\r\nattending to the particulars at the time.  It was not my meaning to ask a\r\nquestion that would give pain to any one here.  If I should ask any other\r\nquestion that may happen to have that result, give me credit, if you\r\nplease, for being in ignorance how to speak to you as I ought.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Stephen had but a little while ago instinctively addressed himself to\r\nher, so she now instinctively addressed herself to Rachael.  Her manner\r\nwas short and abrupt, yet faltering and timid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has told you what has passed between himself and my husband?  You\r\nwould be his first resource, I think.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have heard the end of it, young lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did I understand, that, being rejected by one employer, he would\r\nprobably be rejected by all?  I thought he said as much?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The chances are very small, young lady\xe2\x80\x94next to nothing\xe2\x80\x94for a man who\r\ngets a bad name among them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What shall I understand that you mean by a bad name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The name of being troublesome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, by the prejudices of his own class, and by the prejudices of the\r\nother, he is sacrificed alike?  Are the two so deeply separated in this\r\ntown, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRachael shook her head in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He fell into suspicion,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, \xe2\x80\x98with his fellow-weavers,\r\nbecause\xe2\x80\x94he had made a promise not to be one of them.  I think it must\r\nhave been to you that he made that promise.  Might I ask you why he made\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRachael burst into tears.  \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t seek it of him, poor lad.  I prayed\r\nhim to avoid trouble for his own good, little thinking he\xe2\x80\x99d come to it\r\nthrough me.  But I know he\xe2\x80\x99d die a hundred deaths, ere ever he\xe2\x80\x99d break\r\nhis word.  I know that of him well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen had remained quietly attentive, in his usual thoughtful attitude,\r\nwith his hand at his chin.  He now spoke in a voice rather less steady\r\nthan usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No one, excepting myseln, can ever know what honour, an\xe2\x80\x99 what love, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrespect, I bear to Rachael, or wi\xe2\x80\x99 what cause.  When I passed that\r\npromess, I towd her true, she were th\xe2\x80\x99 Angel o\xe2\x80\x99 my life.  \xe2\x80\x99Twere a solemn\r\npromess.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis gone fro\xe2\x80\x99 me, for ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa turned her head to him, and bent it with a deference that was new\r\nin her.  She looked from him to Rachael, and her features softened.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What will you do?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked him.  And her voice had softened too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Weel, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen, making the best of it, with a smile; \xe2\x80\x98when I\r\nha finished off, I mun quit this part, and try another.  Fortnet or\r\nmisfortnet, a man can but try; there\xe2\x80\x99s nowt to be done wi\xe2\x80\x99out tryin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94cept\r\nlaying down and dying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How will you travel?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Afoot, my kind ledy, afoot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa coloured, and a purse appeared in her hand.  The rustling of a\r\nbank-note was audible, as she unfolded one and laid it on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rachael, will you tell him\xe2\x80\x94for you know how, without offence\xe2\x80\x94that this\r\nis freely his, to help him on his way?  Will you entreat him to take it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I canna do that, young lady,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, turning her head aside.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless you for thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 the poor lad wi\xe2\x80\x99 such tenderness.  But \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nfor him to know his heart, and what is right according to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa looked, in part incredulous, in part frightened, in part overcome\r\nwith quick sympathy, when this man of so much self-command, who had been\r\nso plain and steady through the late interview, lost his composure in a\r\nmoment, and now stood with his hand before his face.  She stretched out\r\nhers, as if she would have touched him; then checked herself, and\r\nremained still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not e\xe2\x80\x99en Rachael,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen, when he stood again with his face\r\nuncovered, \xe2\x80\x98could mak sitch a kind offerin, by onny words, kinder.  T\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshow that I\xe2\x80\x99m not a man wi\xe2\x80\x99out reason and gratitude, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tak two pound.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll borrow \xe2\x80\x99t for t\xe2\x80\x99 pay \xe2\x80\x99t back.  \xe2\x80\x99Twill be the sweetest work as ever I\r\nha done, that puts it in my power t\xe2\x80\x99 acknowledge once more my lastin\r\nthankfulness for this present action.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was fain to take up the note again, and to substitute the much\r\nsmaller sum he had named.  He was neither courtly, nor handsome, nor\r\npicturesque, in any respect; and yet his manner of accepting it, and of\r\nexpressing his thanks without more words, had a grace in it that Lord\r\nChesterfield could not have taught his son in a century.\r\n\r\nTom had sat upon the bed, swinging one leg and sucking his walking-stick\r\nwith sufficient unconcern, until the visit had attained this stage.\r\nSeeing his sister ready to depart, he got up, rather hurriedly, and put\r\nin a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just wait a moment, Loo!  Before we go, I should like to speak to him a\r\nmoment.  Something comes into my head.  If you\xe2\x80\x99ll step out on the stairs,\r\nBlackpool, I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention it.  Never mind a light, man!\xe2\x80\x99  Tom was\r\nremarkably impatient of his moving towards the cupboard, to get one.  \xe2\x80\x98It\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want a light.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room door, and held the lock\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say!\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered.  \xe2\x80\x98I think I can do you a good turn.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me\r\nwhat it is, because it may not come to anything.  But there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in\r\nmy trying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s ear, it was so hot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was our light porter at the Bank,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, \xe2\x80\x98who brought you the\r\nmessage to-night.  I call him our light porter, because I belong to the\r\nBank too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStephen thought, \xe2\x80\x98What a hurry he is in!\xe2\x80\x99  He spoke so confusedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Now look here!  When are you off?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98T\xe2\x80\x99 day\xe2\x80\x99s Monday,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Stephen, considering.  \xe2\x80\x98Why, sir, Friday or\r\nSaturday, nigh \xe2\x80\x99bout.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Friday or Saturday,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Now look here!  I am not sure that I\r\ncan do you the good turn I want to do you\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s my sister, you know, in\r\nyour room\xe2\x80\x94but I may be able to, and if I should not be able to, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno harm done.  So I tell you what.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll know our light porter again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98When you leave work of a night, between this\r\nand your going away, just hang about the Bank an hour or so, will you?\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t take on, as if you meant anything, if he should see you hanging\r\nabout there; because I shan\xe2\x80\x99t put him up to speak to you, unless I find I\r\ncan do you the service I want to do you.  In that case he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a note\r\nor a message for you, but not else.  Now look here!  You are sure you\r\nunderstand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had wormed a finger, in the darkness, through a button-hole of\r\nStephen\xe2\x80\x99s coat, and was screwing that corner of the garment tight up\r\nround and round, in an extraordinary manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I understand, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now look here!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Be sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t make any mistake then,\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t forget.  I shall tell my sister as we go home, what I have in\r\nview, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll approve, I know.  Now look here!  You\xe2\x80\x99re all right, are\r\nyou?  You understand all about it?  Very well then.  Come along, Loo!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe pushed the door open as he called to her, but did not return into the\r\nroom, or wait to be lighted down the narrow stairs.  He was at the bottom\r\nwhen she began to descend, and was in the street before she could take\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pegler remained in her corner until the brother and sister were\r\ngone, and until Stephen came back with the candle in his hand.  She was\r\nin a state of inexpressible admiration of Mrs. Bounderby, and, like an\r\nunaccountable old woman, wept, \xe2\x80\x98because she was such a pretty dear.\xe2\x80\x99  Yet\r\nMrs. Pegler was so flurried lest the object of her admiration should\r\nreturn by chance, or anybody else should come, that her cheerfulness was\r\nended for that night.  It was late too, to people who rose early and\r\nworked hard; therefore the party broke up; and Stephen and Rachael\r\nescorted their mysterious acquaintance to the door of the Travellers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCoffee House, where they parted from her.\r\n\r\nThey walked back together to the corner of the street where Rachael\r\nlived, and as they drew nearer and nearer to it, silence crept upon them.\r\nWhen they came to the dark corner where their unfrequent meetings always\r\nended, they stopped, still silent, as if both were afraid to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall strive t\xe2\x80\x99 see thee agen, Rachael, afore I go, but if not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou wilt not, Stephen, I know.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis better that we make up our minds\r\nto be open wi\xe2\x80\x99 one another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou\xe2\x80\x99rt awlus right.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis bolder and better.  I ha been thinkin then,\r\nRachael, that as \xe2\x80\x99tis but a day or two that remains, \xe2\x80\x99twere better for\r\nthee, my dear, not t\xe2\x80\x99 be seen wi\xe2\x80\x99 me.  \xe2\x80\x99T might bring thee into trouble,\r\nfur no good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis not for that, Stephen, that I mind.  But thou know\xe2\x80\x99st our old\r\nagreement.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis for that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.  \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis better, onnyways.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou\xe2\x80\x99lt write to me, and tell me all that happens, Stephen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.  What can I say now, but Heaven be wi\xe2\x80\x99 thee, Heaven bless thee,\r\nHeaven thank thee and reward thee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May it bless thee, Stephen, too, in all thy wanderings, and send thee\r\npeace and rest at last!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I towd thee, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stephen Blackpool\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98that night\xe2\x80\x94that I would\r\nnever see or think o\xe2\x80\x99 onnything that angered me, but thou, so much better\r\nthan me, should\xe2\x80\x99st be beside it.  Thou\xe2\x80\x99rt beside it now.  Thou mak\xe2\x80\x99st me\r\nsee it wi\xe2\x80\x99 a better eye.  Bless thee.  Good night.  Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was but a hurried parting in a common street, yet it was a sacred\r\nremembrance to these two common people.  Utilitarian economists,\r\nskeletons of schoolmasters, Commissioners of Fact, genteel and used-up\r\ninfidels, gabblers of many little dog\xe2\x80\x99s-eared creeds, the poor you will\r\nhave always with you.  Cultivate in them, while there is yet time, the\r\nutmost graces of the fancies and affections, to adorn their lives so much\r\nin need of ornament; or, in the day of your triumph, when romance is\r\nutterly driven out of their souls, and they and a bare existence stand\r\nface to face, Reality will take a wolfish turn, and make an end of you.\r\n\r\nStephen worked the next day, and the next, uncheered by a word from any\r\none, and shunned in all his comings and goings as before.  At the end of\r\nthe second day, he saw land; at the end of the third, his loom stood\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nHe had overstayed his hour in the street outside the Bank, on each of the\r\ntwo first evenings; and nothing had happened there, good or bad.  That he\r\nmight not be remiss in his part of the engagement, he resolved to wait\r\nfull two hours, on this third and last night.\r\n\r\nThere was the lady who had once kept Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s house, sitting at\r\nthe first-floor window as he had seen her before; and there was the light\r\nporter, sometimes talking with her there, and sometimes looking over the\r\nblind below which had BANK upon it, and sometimes coming to the door and\r\nstanding on the steps for a breath of air.  When he first came out,\r\nStephen thought he might be looking for him, and passed near; but the\r\nlight porter only cast his winking eyes upon him slightly, and said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nTwo hours were a long stretch of lounging about, after a long day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlabour.  Stephen sat upon the step of a door, leaned against a wall under\r\nan archway, strolled up and down, listened for the church clock, stopped\r\nand watched children playing in the street.  Some purpose or other is so\r\nnatural to every one, that a mere loiterer always looks and feels\r\nremarkable.  When the first hour was out, Stephen even began to have an\r\nuncomfortable sensation upon him of being for the time a disreputable\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThen came the lamplighter, and two lengthening lines of light all down\r\nthe long perspective of the street, until they were blended and lost in\r\nthe distance.  Mrs. Sparsit closed the first-floor window, drew down the\r\nblind, and went up-stairs.  Presently, a light went up-stairs after her,\r\npassing first the fanlight of the door, and afterwards the two staircase\r\nwindows, on its way up.  By and by, one corner of the second-floor blind\r\nwas disturbed, as if Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s eye were there; also the other\r\ncorner, as if the light porter\xe2\x80\x99s eye were on that side.  Still, no\r\ncommunication was made to Stephen.  Much relieved when the two hours were\r\nat last accomplished, he went away at a quick pace, as a recompense for\r\nso much loitering.\r\n\r\nHe had only to take leave of his landlady, and lie down on his temporary\r\nbed upon the floor; for his bundle was made up for to-morrow, and all was\r\narranged for his departure.  He meant to be clear of the town very early;\r\nbefore the Hands were in the streets.\r\n\r\nIt was barely daybreak, when, with a parting look round his room,\r\nmournfully wondering whether he should ever see it again, he went out.\r\nThe town was as entirely deserted as if the inhabitants had abandoned it,\r\nrather than hold communication with him.  Everything looked wan at that\r\nhour.  Even the coming sun made but a pale waste in the sky, like a sad\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nBy the place where Rachael lived, though it was not in his way; by the\r\nred brick streets; by the great silent factories, not trembling yet; by\r\nthe railway, where the danger-lights were waning in the strengthening\r\nday; by the railway\xe2\x80\x99s crazy neighbourhood, half pulled down and half\r\nbuilt up; by scattered red brick villas, where the besmoked evergreens\r\nwere sprinkled with a dirty powder, like untidy snuff-takers; by\r\ncoal-dust paths and many varieties of ugliness; Stephen got to the top of\r\nthe hill, and looked back.\r\n\r\nDay was shining radiantly upon the town then, and the bells were going\r\nfor the morning work.  Domestic fires were not yet lighted, and the high\r\nchimneys had the sky to themselves.  Puffing out their poisonous volumes,\r\nthey would not be long in hiding it; but, for half an hour, some of the\r\nmany windows were golden, which showed the Coketown people a sun\r\neternally in eclipse, through a medium of smoked glass.\r\n\r\nSo strange to turn from the chimneys to the birds.  So strange, to have\r\nthe road-dust on his feet instead of the coal-grit.  So strange to have\r\nlived to his time of life, and yet to be beginning like a boy this summer\r\nmorning!  With these musings in his mind, and his bundle under his arm,\r\nStephen took his attentive face along the high road.  And the trees\r\narched over him, whispering that he left a true and loving heart behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nGUNPOWDER\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. JAMES HARTHOUSE, \xe2\x80\x98going in\xe2\x80\x99 for his adopted party, soon began to\r\nscore.  With the aid of a little more coaching for the political sages, a\r\nlittle more genteel listlessness for the general society, and a tolerable\r\nmanagement of the assumed honesty in dishonesty, most effective and most\r\npatronized of the polite deadly sins, he speedily came to be considered\r\nof much promise.  The not being troubled with earnestness was a grand\r\npoint in his favour, enabling him to take to the hard Fact fellows with\r\nas good a grace as if he had been born one of the tribe, and to throw all\r\nother tribes overboard, as conscious hypocrites.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whom none of us believe, my dear Mrs. Bounderby, and who do not believe\r\nthemselves.  The only difference between us and the professors of virtue\r\nor benevolence, or philanthropy\xe2\x80\x94never mind the name\xe2\x80\x94is, that we know it\r\nis all meaningless, and say so; while they know it equally and will never\r\nsay so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhy should she be shocked or warned by this reiteration?  It was not so\r\nunlike her father\xe2\x80\x99s principles, and her early training, that it need\r\nstartle her.  Where was the great difference between the two schools,\r\nwhen each chained her down to material realities, and inspired her with\r\nno faith in anything else?  What was there in her soul for James\r\nHarthouse to destroy, which Thomas Gradgrind had nurtured there in its\r\nstate of innocence!\r\n\r\nIt was even the worse for her at this pass, that in her mind\xe2\x80\x94implanted\r\nthere before her eminently practical father began to form it\xe2\x80\x94a struggling\r\ndisposition to believe in a wider and nobler humanity than she had ever\r\nheard of, constantly strove with doubts and resentments.  With doubts,\r\nbecause the aspiration had been so laid waste in her youth.  With\r\nresentments, because of the wrong that had been done her, if it were\r\nindeed a whisper of the truth.  Upon a nature long accustomed to\r\nself-suppression, thus torn and divided, the Harthouse philosophy came as\r\na relief and justification.  Everything being hollow and worthless, she\r\nhad missed nothing and sacrificed nothing.  What did it matter, she had\r\nsaid to her father, when he proposed her husband.  What did it matter,\r\nshe said still.  With a scornful self-reliance, she asked herself, What\r\ndid anything matter\xe2\x80\x94and went on.\r\n\r\nTowards what?  Step by step, onward and downward, towards some end, yet\r\nso gradually, that she believed herself to remain motionless.  As to Mr.\r\nHarthouse, whither _he_ tended, he neither considered nor cared.  He had\r\nno particular design or plan before him: no energetic wickedness ruffled\r\nhis lassitude.  He was as much amused and interested, at present, as it\r\nbecame so fine a gentleman to be; perhaps even more than it would have\r\nbeen consistent with his reputation to confess.  Soon after his arrival\r\nhe languidly wrote to his brother, the honourable and jocular member,\r\nthat the Bounderbys were \xe2\x80\x98great fun;\xe2\x80\x99 and further, that the female\r\nBounderby, instead of being the Gorgon he had expected, was young, and\r\nremarkably pretty.  After that, he wrote no more about them, and devoted\r\nhis leisure chiefly to their house.  He was very often in their house, in\r\nhis flittings and visitings about the Coketown district; and was much\r\nencouraged by Mr. Bounderby.  It was quite in Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s gusty way\r\nto boast to all his world that _he_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t care about your highly\r\nconnected people, but that if his wife Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s daughter did, she\r\nwas welcome to their company.\r\n\r\nMr. James Harthouse began to think it would be a new sensation, if the\r\nface which changed so beautifully for the whelp, would change for him.\r\n\r\nHe was quick enough to observe; he had a good memory, and did not forget\r\na word of the brother\xe2\x80\x99s revelations.  He interwove them with everything\r\nhe saw of the sister, and he began to understand her.  To be sure, the\r\nbetter and profounder part of her character was not within his scope of\r\nperception; for in natures, as in seas, depth answers unto depth; but he\r\nsoon began to read the rest with a student\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby had taken possession of a house and grounds, about fifteen\r\nmiles from the town, and accessible within a mile or two, by a railway\r\nstriding on many arches over a wild country, undermined by deserted\r\ncoal-shafts, and spotted at night by fires and black shapes of stationary\r\nengines at pits\xe2\x80\x99 mouths.  This country, gradually softening towards the\r\nneighbourhood of Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s retreat, there mellowed into a rustic\r\nlandscape, golden with heath, and snowy with hawthorn in the spring of\r\nthe year, and tremulous with leaves and their shadows all the summer\r\ntime.  The bank had foreclosed a mortgage effected on the property thus\r\npleasantly situated, by one of the Coketown magnates, who, in his\r\ndetermination to make a shorter cut than usual to an enormous fortune,\r\noverspeculated himself by about two hundred thousand pounds.  These\r\naccidents did sometimes happen in the best regulated families of\r\nCoketown, but the bankrupts had no connexion whatever with the\r\nimprovident classes.\r\n\r\nIt afforded Mr. Bounderby supreme satisfaction to instal himself in this\r\nsnug little estate, and with demonstrative humility to grow cabbages in\r\nthe flower-garden.  He delighted to live, barrack-fashion, among the\r\nelegant furniture, and he bullied the very pictures with his origin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he would say to a visitor, \xe2\x80\x98I am told that Nickits,\xe2\x80\x99 the late\r\nowner, \xe2\x80\x98gave seven hundred pound for that Seabeach.  Now, to be plain\r\nwith you, if I ever, in the whole course of my life, take seven looks at\r\nit, at a hundred pound a look, it will be as much as I shall do.  No, by\r\nGeorge!  I don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  For\r\nyears upon years, the only pictures in my possession, or that I could\r\nhave got into my possession, by any means, unless I stole \xe2\x80\x99em, were the\r\nengravings of a man shaving himself in a boot, on the blacking bottles\r\nthat I was overjoyed to use in cleaning boots with, and that I sold when\r\nthey were empty for a farthing a-piece, and glad to get it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he would address Mr. Harthouse in the same style.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Harthouse, you have a couple of horses down here.  Bring half a dozen\r\nmore if you like, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll find room for \xe2\x80\x99em.  There\xe2\x80\x99s stabling in this\r\nplace for a dozen horses; and unless Nickits is belied, he kept the full\r\nnumber.  A round dozen of \xe2\x80\x99em, sir.  When that man was a boy, he went to\r\nWestminster School.  Went to Westminster School as a King\xe2\x80\x99s Scholar, when\r\nI was principally living on garbage, and sleeping in market baskets.\r\nWhy, if I wanted to keep a dozen horses\xe2\x80\x94which I don\xe2\x80\x99t, for one\xe2\x80\x99s enough\r\nfor me\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see \xe2\x80\x99em in their stalls here, and think what my\r\nown lodging used to be.  I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at \xe2\x80\x99em, sir, and not order \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nout.  Yet so things come round.  You see this place; you know what sort\r\nof a place it is; you are aware that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a completer place of its\r\nsize in this kingdom or elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t care where\xe2\x80\x94and here, got into\r\nthe middle of it, like a maggot into a nut, is Josiah Bounderby.  While\r\nNickits (as a man came into my office, and told me yesterday), Nickits,\r\nwho used to act in Latin, in the Westminster School plays, with the\r\nchief-justices and nobility of this country applauding him till they were\r\nblack in the face, is drivelling at this minute\xe2\x80\x94drivelling, sir!\xe2\x80\x94in a\r\nfifth floor, up a narrow dark back street in Antwerp.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was among the leafy shadows of this retirement, in the long sultry\r\nsummer days, that Mr. Harthouse began to prove the face which had set him\r\nwondering when he first saw it, and to try if it would change for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Bounderby, I esteem it a most fortunate accident that I find you\r\nalone here.  I have for some time had a particular wish to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was not by any wonderful accident that he found her, the time of day\r\nbeing that at which she was always alone, and the place being her\r\nfavourite resort.  It was an opening in a dark wood, where some felled\r\ntrees lay, and where she would sit watching the fallen leaves of last\r\nyear, as she had watched the falling ashes at home.\r\n\r\nHe sat down beside her, with a glance at her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your brother.  My young friend Tom\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer colour brightened, and she turned to him with a look of interest.  \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nnever in my life,\xe2\x80\x99 he thought, \xe2\x80\x98saw anything so remarkable and so\r\ncaptivating as the lighting of those features!\xe2\x80\x99  His face betrayed his\r\nthoughts\xe2\x80\x94perhaps without betraying him, for it might have been according\r\nto its instructions so to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me.  The expression of your sisterly interest is so beautiful\xe2\x80\x94Tom\r\nshould be so proud of it\xe2\x80\x94I know this is inexcusable, but I am so\r\ncompelled to admire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Being so impulsive,\xe2\x80\x99 she said composedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Bounderby, no: you know I make no pretence with you.  You know I am\r\na sordid piece of human nature, ready to sell myself at any time for any\r\nreasonable sum, and altogether incapable of any Arcadian proceeding\r\nwhatever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am waiting,\xe2\x80\x99 she returned, \xe2\x80\x98for your further reference to my brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are rigid with me, and I deserve it.  I am as worthless a dog as you\r\nwill find, except that I am not false\xe2\x80\x94not false.  But you surprised and\r\nstarted me from my subject, which was your brother.  I have an interest\r\nin him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you an interest in anything, Mr. Harthouse?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked, half\r\nincredulously and half gratefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you had asked me when I first came here, I should have said no.  I\r\nmust say now\xe2\x80\x94even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence, and of\r\njustly awakening your incredulity\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe made a slight movement, as if she were trying to speak, but could not\r\nfind voice; at length she said, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Harthouse, I give you credit for\r\nbeing interested in my brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you.  I claim to deserve it.  You know how little I do claim, but\r\nI will go that length.  You have done so much for him, you are so fond of\r\nhim; your whole life, Mrs. Bounderby, expresses such charming\r\nself-forgetfulness on his account\xe2\x80\x94pardon me again\xe2\x80\x94I am running wide of\r\nthe subject.  I am interested in him for his own sake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had made the slightest action possible, as if she would have risen in\r\na hurry and gone away.  He had turned the course of what he said at that\r\ninstant, and she remained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 he resumed, in a lighter manner, and yet with a show of\r\neffort in assuming it, which was even more expressive than the manner he\r\ndismissed; \xe2\x80\x98it is no irrevocable offence in a young fellow of your\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s years, if he is heedless, inconsiderate, and expensive\xe2\x80\x94a little\r\ndissipated, in the common phrase.  Is he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Allow me to be frank.  Do you think he games at all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think he makes bets.\xe2\x80\x99  Mr. Harthouse waiting, as if that were not her\r\nwhole answer, she added, \xe2\x80\x98I know he does.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course he loses?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everybody does lose who bets.  May I hint at the probability of your\r\nsometimes supplying him with money for these purposes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe sat, looking down; but, at this question, raised her eyes searchingly\r\nand a little resentfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Acquit me of impertinent curiosity, my dear Mrs. Bounderby.  I think Tom\r\nmay be gradually falling into trouble, and I wish to stretch out a\r\nhelping hand to him from the depths of my wicked experience.\xe2\x80\x94Shall I say\r\nagain, for his sake?  Is that necessary?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe seemed to try to answer, but nothing came of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said James\r\nHarthouse, again gliding with the same appearance of effort into his more\r\nairy manner; \xe2\x80\x98I will confide to you my doubt whether he has had many\r\nadvantages.  Whether\xe2\x80\x94forgive my plainness\xe2\x80\x94whether any great amount of\r\nconfidence is likely to have been established between himself and his\r\nmost worthy father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, flushing with her own great remembrance in that\r\nwise, \xe2\x80\x98think it likely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or, between himself, and\xe2\x80\x94I may trust to your perfect understanding of my\r\nmeaning, I am sure\xe2\x80\x94and his highly esteemed brother-in-law.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe flushed deeper and deeper, and was burning red when she replied in a\r\nfainter voice, \xe2\x80\x98I do not think that likely, either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Harthouse, after a short silence, \xe2\x80\x98may there be a\r\nbetter confidence between yourself and me?  Tom has borrowed a\r\nconsiderable sum of you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will understand, Mr. Harthouse,\xe2\x80\x99 she returned, after some\r\nindecision: she had been more or less uncertain, and troubled throughout\r\nthe conversation, and yet had in the main preserved her self-contained\r\nmanner; \xe2\x80\x98you will understand that if I tell you what you press to know,\r\nit is not by way of complaint or regret.  I would never complain of\r\nanything, and what I have done I do not in the least regret.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So spirited, too!\xe2\x80\x99 thought James Harthouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I married, I found that my brother was even at that time heavily in\r\ndebt.  Heavily for him, I mean.  Heavily enough to oblige me to sell some\r\ntrinkets.  They were no sacrifice.  I sold them very willingly.  I\r\nattached no value to them.  They, were quite worthless to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEither she saw in his face that he knew, or she only feared in her\r\nconscience that he knew, that she spoke of some of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s gifts.\r\nShe stopped, and reddened again.  If he had not known it before, he would\r\nhave known it then, though he had been a much duller man than he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since then, I have given my brother, at various times, what money I\r\ncould spare: in short, what money I have had.  Confiding in you at all,\r\non the faith of the interest you profess for him, I will not do so by\r\nhalves.  Since you have been in the habit of visiting here, he has wanted\r\nin one sum as much as a hundred pounds.  I have not been able to give it\r\nto him.  I have felt uneasy for the consequences of his being so\r\ninvolved, but I have kept these secrets until now, when I trust them to\r\nyour honour.  I have held no confidence with any one, because\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nanticipated my reason just now.\xe2\x80\x99  She abruptly broke off.\r\n\r\nHe was a ready man, and he saw, and seized, an opportunity here of\r\npresenting her own image to her, slightly disguised as her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Bounderby, though a graceless person, of the world worldly, I feel\r\nthe utmost interest, I assure you, in what you tell me.  I cannot\r\npossibly be hard upon your brother.  I understand and share the wise\r\nconsideration with which you regard his errors.  With all possible\r\nrespect both for Mr. Gradgrind and for Mr. Bounderby, I think I perceive\r\nthat he has not been fortunate in his training.  Bred at a disadvantage\r\ntowards the society in which he has his part to play, he rushes into\r\nthese extremes for himself, from opposite extremes that have long been\r\nforced\xe2\x80\x94with the very best intentions we have no doubt\xe2\x80\x94upon him.  Mr.\r\nBounderby\xe2\x80\x99s fine bluff English independence, though a most charming\r\ncharacteristic, does not\xe2\x80\x94as we have agreed\xe2\x80\x94invite confidence.  If I might\r\nventure to remark that it is the least in the world deficient in that\r\ndelicacy to which a youth mistaken, a character misconceived, and\r\nabilities misdirected, would turn for relief and guidance, I should\r\nexpress what it presents to my own view.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs she sat looking straight before her, across the changing lights upon\r\nthe grass into the darkness of the wood beyond, he saw in her face her\r\napplication of his very distinctly uttered words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All allowance,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, \xe2\x80\x98must be made.  I have one great fault to\r\nfind with Tom, however, which I cannot forgive, and for which I take him\r\nheavily to account.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa turned her eyes to his face, and asked him what fault was that?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, \xe2\x80\x98I have said enough.  Perhaps it would have been\r\nbetter, on the whole, if no allusion to it had escaped me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You alarm me, Mr. Harthouse.  Pray let me know it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To relieve you from needless apprehension\xe2\x80\x94and as this confidence\r\nregarding your brother, which I prize I am sure above all possible\r\nthings, has been established between us\xe2\x80\x94I obey.  I cannot forgive him for\r\nnot being more sensible in every word, look, and act of his life, of the\r\naffection of his best friend; of the devotion of his best friend; of her\r\nunselfishness; of her sacrifice.  The return he makes her, within my\r\nobservation, is a very poor one.  What she has done for him demands his\r\nconstant love and gratitude, not his ill-humour and caprice.  Careless\r\nfellow as I am, I am not so indifferent, Mrs. Bounderby, as to be\r\nregardless of this vice in your brother, or inclined to consider it a\r\nvenial offence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wood floated before her, for her eyes were suffused with tears.  They\r\nrose from a deep well, long concealed, and her heart was filled with\r\nacute pain that found no relief in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a word, it is to correct your brother in this, Mrs. Bounderby, that I\r\nmust aspire.  My better knowledge of his circumstances, and my direction\r\nand advice in extricating them\xe2\x80\x94rather valuable, I hope, as coming from a\r\nscapegrace on a much larger scale\xe2\x80\x94will give me some influence over him,\r\nand all I gain I shall certainly use towards this end.  I have said\r\nenough, and more than enough.  I seem to be protesting that I am a sort\r\nof good fellow, when, upon my honour, I have not the least intention to\r\nmake any protestation to that effect, and openly announce that I am\r\nnothing of the sort.  Yonder, among the trees,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, having lifted\r\nup his eyes and looked about; for he had watched her closely until now;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98is your brother himself; no doubt, just come down.  As he seems to be\r\nloitering in this direction, it may be as well, perhaps, to walk towards\r\nhim, and throw ourselves in his way.  He has been very silent and doleful\r\nof late.  Perhaps, his brotherly conscience is touched\xe2\x80\x94if there are such\r\nthings as consciences.  Though, upon my honour, I hear of them much too\r\noften to believe in them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe assisted her to rise, and she took his arm, and they advanced to meet\r\nthe whelp.  He was idly beating the branches as he lounged along: or he\r\nstooped viciously to rip the moss from the trees with his stick.  He was\r\nstartled when they came upon him while he was engaged in this latter\r\npastime, and his colour changed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Halloa!\xe2\x80\x99 he stammered; \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whose name, Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Harthouse, putting his hand upon his shoulder\r\nand turning him, so that they all three walked towards the house\r\ntogether, \xe2\x80\x98have you been carving on the trees?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whose name?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Oh!  You mean what girl\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature\xe2\x80\x99s on\r\nthe bark, Tom.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n         [Picture: Mr. Harthouse and Tom Gradgrind in the garden]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not much of that, Mr. Harthouse, unless some fair creature with a\r\nslashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me.  Or she\r\nmight be as ugly as she was rich, without any fear of losing me.  I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncarve her name as often as she liked.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid you are mercenary, Tom.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mercenary,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Who is not mercenary?  Ask my sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you so proved it to be a failing of mine, Tom?\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa,\r\nshowing no other sense of his discontent and ill-nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know whether the cap fits you, Loo,\xe2\x80\x99 returned her brother sulkily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it does, you can wear it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom is misanthropical to-day, as all bored people are now and then,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr. Harthouse.  \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe him, Mrs. Bounderby.  He knows much\r\nbetter.  I shall disclose some of his opinions of you, privately\r\nexpressed to me, unless he relents a little.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At all events, Mr. Harthouse,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, softening in his admiration of\r\nhis patron, but shaking his head sullenly too, \xe2\x80\x98you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell her that I\r\never praised her for being mercenary.  I may have praised her for being\r\nthe contrary, and I should do it again, if I had as good reason.\r\nHowever, never mind this now; it\xe2\x80\x99s not very interesting to you, and I am\r\nsick of the subject.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey walked on to the house, where Louisa quitted her visitor\xe2\x80\x99s arm and\r\nwent in.  He stood looking after her, as she ascended the steps, and\r\npassed into the shadow of the door; then put his hand upon her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder again, and invited him with a confidential nod to a walk in the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom, my fine fellow, I want to have a word with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey had stopped among a disorder of roses\xe2\x80\x94it was part of Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhumility to keep Nickits\xe2\x80\x99s roses on a reduced scale\xe2\x80\x94and Tom sat down on a\r\nterrace-parapet, plucking buds and picking them to pieces; while his\r\npowerful Familiar stood over him, with a foot upon the parapet, and his\r\nfigure easily resting on the arm supported by that knee.  They were just\r\nvisible from her window.  Perhaps she saw them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!  Mr. Harthouse,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom with a groan, \xe2\x80\x98I am hard up, and bothered\r\nout of my life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My good fellow, so am I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98You are the picture of independence.  Mr.\r\nHarthouse, I am in a horrible mess.  You have no idea what a state I have\r\ngot myself into\xe2\x80\x94what a state my sister might have got me out of, if she\r\nwould only have done it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took to biting the rosebuds now, and tearing them away from his teeth\r\nwith a hand that trembled like an infirm old man\xe2\x80\x99s.  After one\r\nexceedingly observant look at him, his companion relapsed into his\r\nlightest air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom, you are inconsiderate: you expect too much of your sister.  You\r\nhave had money of her, you dog, you know you have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mr. Harthouse, I know I have.  How else was I to get it?  Here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nold Bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a\r\nmonth, or something of that sort.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s my father drawing what he calls\r\na line, and tying me down to it from a baby, neck and heels.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nmother who never has anything of her own, except her complaints.  What\r\n_is_ a fellow to do for money, and where _am_ I to look for it, if not to\r\nmy sister?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was almost crying, and scattered the buds about by dozens.  Mr.\r\nHarthouse took him persuasively by the coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, my dear Tom, if your sister has not got it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not got it, Mr. Harthouse?  I don\xe2\x80\x99t say she has got it.  I may have\r\nwanted more than she was likely to have got.  But then she ought to get\r\nit.  She could get it.  It\xe2\x80\x99s of no use pretending to make a secret of\r\nmatters now, after what I have told you already; you know she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmarry old Bounderby for her own sake, or for his sake, but for my sake.\r\nThen why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she get what I want, out of him, for my sake?  She is\r\nnot obliged to say what she is going to do with it; she is sharp enough;\r\nshe could manage to coax it out of him, if she chose.  Then why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe choose, when I tell her of what consequence it is?  But no.  There\r\nshe sits in his company like a stone, instead of making herself agreeable\r\nand getting it easily.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you may call this, but I call\r\nit unnatural conduct.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a piece of ornamental water immediately below the parapet, on\r\nthe other side, into which Mr. James Harthouse had a very strong\r\ninclination to pitch Mr. Thomas Gradgrind junior, as the injured men of\r\nCoketown threatened to pitch their property into the Atlantic.  But he\r\npreserved his easy attitude; and nothing more solid went over the stone\r\nbalustrades than the accumulated rosebuds now floating about, a little\r\nsurface-island.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 said Harthouse, \xe2\x80\x98let me try to be your banker.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Tom, suddenly, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about bankers!\xe2\x80\x99  And\r\nvery white he looked, in contrast with the roses.  Very white.\r\n\r\nMr. Harthouse, as a thoroughly well-bred man, accustomed to the best\r\nsociety, was not to be surprised\xe2\x80\x94he could as soon have been affected\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nhe raised his eyelids a little more, as if they were lifted by a feeble\r\ntouch of wonder.  Albeit it was as much against the precepts of his\r\nschool to wonder, as it was against the doctrines of the Gradgrind\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the present need, Tom?  Three figures?  Out with them.  Say what\r\nthey are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Harthouse,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Tom, now actually crying; and his tears were\r\nbetter than his injuries, however pitiful a figure he made: \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nlate; the money is of no use to me at present.  I should have had it\r\nbefore to be of use to me.  But I am very much obliged to you; you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\ntrue friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA true friend!  \xe2\x80\x98Whelp, whelp!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Harthouse, lazily; \xe2\x80\x98what an\r\nAss you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I take your offer as a great kindness,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, grasping his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a great kindness, Mr. Harthouse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other, \xe2\x80\x98it may be of more use by and by.  And, my\r\ngood fellow, if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come\r\nthick upon you, I may show you better ways out of them than you can find\r\nfor yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, shaking his head dismally, and chewing rosebuds.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I had known you sooner, Mr. Harthouse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, you see, Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Harthouse in conclusion, himself tossing\r\nover a rose or two, as a contribution to the island, which was always\r\ndrifting to the wall as if it wanted to become a part of the mainland:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98every man is selfish in everything he does, and I am exactly like the\r\nrest of my fellow-creatures.  I am desperately intent;\xe2\x80\x99 the languor of\r\nhis desperation being quite tropical; \xe2\x80\x98on your softening towards your\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x94which you ought to do; and on your being a more loving and\r\nagreeable sort of brother\xe2\x80\x94which you ought to be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will be, Mr. Harthouse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No time like the present, Tom.  Begin at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly I will.  And my sister Loo shall say so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Having made which bargain, Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 said Harthouse, clapping him on the\r\nshoulder again, with an air which left him at liberty to infer\xe2\x80\x94as he did,\r\npoor fool\xe2\x80\x94that this condition was imposed upon him in mere careless good\r\nnature to lessen his sense of obligation, \xe2\x80\x98we will tear ourselves asunder\r\nuntil dinner-time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen Tom appeared before dinner, though his mind seemed heavy enough, his\r\nbody was on the alert; and he appeared before Mr. Bounderby came in.  \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be cross, Loo,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, giving her his hand, and kissing\r\nher.  \xe2\x80\x98I know you are fond of me, and you know I am fond of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter this, there was a smile upon Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s face that day, for some one\r\nelse.  Alas, for some one else!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So much the less is the whelp the only creature that she cares for,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthought James Harthouse, reversing the reflection of his first day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknowledge of her pretty face.  \xe2\x80\x98So much the less, so much the less.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nEXPLOSION\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next morning was too bright a morning for sleep, and James Harthouse\r\nrose early, and sat in the pleasant bay window of his dressing-room,\r\nsmoking the rare tobacco that had had so wholesome an influence on his\r\nyoung friend.  Reposing in the sunlight, with the fragrance of his\r\neastern pipe about him, and the dreamy smoke vanishing into the air, so\r\nrich and soft with summer odours, he reckoned up his advantages as an\r\nidle winner might count his gains.  He was not at all bored for the time,\r\nand could give his mind to it.\r\n\r\nHe had established a confidence with her, from which her husband was\r\nexcluded.  He had established a confidence with her, that absolutely\r\nturned upon her indifference towards her husband, and the absence, now\r\nand at all times, of any congeniality between them.  He had artfully, but\r\nplainly, assured her that he knew her heart in its last most delicate\r\nrecesses; he had come so near to her through its tenderest sentiment; he\r\nhad associated himself with that feeling; and the barrier behind which\r\nshe lived, had melted away.  All very odd, and very satisfactory!\r\n\r\nAnd yet he had not, even now, any earnest wickedness of purpose in him.\r\nPublicly and privately, it were much better for the age in which he\r\nlived, that he and the legion of whom he was one were designedly bad,\r\nthan indifferent and purposeless.  It is the drifting icebergs setting\r\nwith any current anywhere, that wreck the ships.\r\n\r\nWhen the Devil goeth about like a roaring lion, he goeth about in a shape\r\nby which few but savages and hunters are attracted.  But, when he is\r\ntrimmed, smoothed, and varnished, according to the mode; when he is\r\naweary of vice, and aweary of virtue, used up as to brimstone, and used\r\nup as to bliss; then, whether he take to the serving out of red tape, or\r\nto the kindling of red fire, he is the very Devil.\r\n\r\nSo James Harthouse reclined in the window, indolently smoking, and\r\nreckoning up the steps he had taken on the road by which he happened to\r\nbe travelling.  The end to which it led was before him, pretty plainly;\r\nbut he troubled himself with no calculations about it.  What will be,\r\nwill be.\r\n\r\nAs he had rather a long ride to take that day\xe2\x80\x94for there was a public\r\noccasion \xe2\x80\x98to do\xe2\x80\x99 at some distance, which afforded a tolerable opportunity\r\nof going in for the Gradgrind men\xe2\x80\x94he dressed early and went down to\r\nbreakfast.  He was anxious to see if she had relapsed since the previous\r\nevening.  No.  He resumed where he had left off.  There was a look of\r\ninterest for him again.\r\n\r\nHe got through the day as much (or as little) to his own satisfaction, as\r\nwas to be expected under the fatiguing circumstances; and came riding\r\nback at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock.  There was a sweep of some half-mile between the\r\nlodge and the house, and he was riding along at a foot pace over the\r\nsmooth gravel, once Nickits\xe2\x80\x99s, when Mr. Bounderby burst out of the\r\nshrubbery, with such violence as to make his horse shy across the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Harthouse!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98Have you heard?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heard what?\xe2\x80\x99 said Harthouse, soothing his horse, and inwardly favouring\r\nMr. Bounderby with no good wishes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you _haven\xe2\x80\x99t_ heard!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have heard you, and so has this brute.  I have heard nothing else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby, red and hot, planted himself in the centre of the path\r\nbefore the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head, to explode his bombshell with more effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Bank\xe2\x80\x99s robbed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Robbed last night, sir.  Robbed in an extraordinary manner.  Robbed with\r\na false key.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of much?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby, in his desire to make the most of it, really seemed\r\nmortified by being obliged to reply, \xe2\x80\x98Why, no; not of very much.  But it\r\nmight have been.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of how much?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! as a sum\xe2\x80\x94if you stick to a sum\xe2\x80\x94of not more than a hundred and fifty\r\npound,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, with impatience.  \xe2\x80\x98But it\xe2\x80\x99s not the sum; it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nfact.  It\xe2\x80\x99s the fact of the Bank being robbed, that\xe2\x80\x99s the important\r\ncircumstance.  I am surprised you don\xe2\x80\x99t see it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said James, dismounting, and giving his bridle to\r\nhis servant, \xe2\x80\x98I _do_ see it; and am as overcome as you can possibly\r\ndesire me to be, by the spectacle afforded to my mental view.\r\nNevertheless, I may be allowed, I hope, to congratulate you\xe2\x80\x94which I do\r\nwith all my soul, I assure you\xe2\x80\x94on your not having sustained a greater\r\nloss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bounderby, in a short, ungracious manner.  \xe2\x80\x98But I\r\ntell you what.  It might have been twenty thousand pound.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose it might.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose it might!  By the Lord, you _may_ suppose so.  By George!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Bounderby, with sundry menacing nods and shakes of his head.  \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nmight have been twice twenty.  There\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing what it would have\r\nbeen, or wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been, as it was, but for the fellows\xe2\x80\x99 being\r\ndisturbed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa had come up now, and Mrs. Sparsit, and Bitzer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s daughter knows pretty well what it might have\r\nbeen, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 blustered Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98Dropped, sir, as if she was\r\nshot when I told her!  Never knew her do such a thing before.  Does her\r\ncredit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe still looked faint and pale.  James Harthouse begged her to take his\r\narm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I am going to tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, irritably giving his arm\r\nto Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98If you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so mighty particular about the sum,\r\nI should have begun to tell you before.  You know this lady (for she _is_\r\na lady), Mrs. Sparsit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have already had the honour\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well.  And this young man, Bitzer, you saw him too on the same\r\noccasion?\xe2\x80\x99  Mr. Harthouse inclined his head in assent, and Bitzer\r\nknuckled his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well.  They live at the Bank.  You know they live at the Bank,\r\nperhaps?  Very well.  Yesterday afternoon, at the close of business\r\nhours, everything was put away as usual.  In the iron room that this\r\nyoung fellow sleeps outside of, there was never mind how much.  In the\r\nlittle safe in young Tom\xe2\x80\x99s closet, the safe used for petty purposes,\r\nthere was a hundred and fifty odd pound.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A hundred and fifty-four, seven, one,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Bounderby, stopping to wheel round upon him, \xe2\x80\x98let\xe2\x80\x99s have\r\nnone of _your_ interruptions.  It\xe2\x80\x99s enough to be robbed while you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsnoring because you\xe2\x80\x99re too comfortable, without being put right with\r\n_your_ four seven ones.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t snore, myself, when I was your age, let\r\nme tell you.  I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t victuals enough to snore.  And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t four seven\r\none.  Not if I knew it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBitzer knuckled his forehead again, in a sneaking manner, and seemed at\r\nonce particularly impressed and depressed by the instance last given of\r\nMr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s moral abstinence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A hundred and fifty odd pound,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98That sum of\r\nmoney, young Tom locked in his safe, not a very strong safe, but that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno matter now.  Everything was left, all right.  Some time in the night,\r\nwhile this young fellow snored\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Sparsit, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you say you have\r\nheard him snore?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot say that I have heard him\r\nprecisely snore, and therefore must not make that statement.  But on\r\nwinter evenings, when he has fallen asleep at his table, I have heard\r\nhim, what I should prefer to describe as partially choke.  I have heard\r\nhim on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be\r\nsometimes heard in Dutch clocks.  Not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, with a lofty\r\nsense of giving strict evidence, \xe2\x80\x98that I would convey any imputation on\r\nhis moral character.  Far from it.  I have always considered Bitzer a\r\nyoung man of the most upright principle; and to that I beg to bear my\r\ntestimony.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said the exasperated Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98while he was snoring, _or_\r\nchoking, _or_ Dutch-clocking, _or_ something _or_ other\xe2\x80\x94being asleep\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nfellows, somehow, whether previously concealed in the house or not\r\nremains to be seen, got to young Tom\xe2\x80\x99s safe, forced it, and abstracted\r\nthe contents.  Being then disturbed, they made off; letting themselves\r\nout at the main door, and double-locking it again (it was double-locked,\r\nand the key under Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s pillow) with a false key, which was\r\npicked up in the street near the Bank, about twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-day.  No\r\nalarm takes place, till this chap, Bitzer, turns out this morning, and\r\nbegins to open and prepare the offices for business.  Then, looking at\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s safe, he sees the door ajar, and finds the lock forced, and the\r\nmoney gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is Tom, by the by?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Harthouse, glancing round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has been helping the police,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98and stays behind at\r\nthe Bank.  I wish these fellows had tried to rob me when I was at his\r\ntime of life.  They would have been out of pocket if they had invested\r\neighteenpence in the job; I can tell \xe2\x80\x99em that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is anybody suspected?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suspected?  I should think there was somebody suspected.  Egod!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nBounderby, relinquishing Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s arm to wipe his heated head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Josiah Bounderby of Coketown is not to be plundered and nobody\r\nsuspected.  No, thank you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMight Mr. Harthouse inquire Who was suspected?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, stopping and facing about to confront them all,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not to be mentioned everywhere; it\xe2\x80\x99s not to be\r\nmentioned anywhere: in order that the scoundrels concerned (there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngang of \xe2\x80\x99em) may be thrown off their guard.  So take this in confidence.\r\nNow wait a bit.\xe2\x80\x99  Mr. Bounderby wiped his head again.  \xe2\x80\x98What should you\r\nsay to;\xe2\x80\x99 here he violently exploded: \xe2\x80\x98to a Hand being in it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope,\xe2\x80\x99 said Harthouse, lazily, \xe2\x80\x98not our friend Blackpot?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say Pool instead of Pot, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98and that\xe2\x80\x99s the man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa faintly uttered some word of incredulity and surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes!  I know!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, immediately catching at the sound.  \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nknow!  I am used to that.  I know all about it.  They are the finest\r\npeople in the world, these fellows are.  They have got the gift of the\r\ngab, they have.  They only want to have their rights explained to them,\r\nthey do.  But I tell you what.  Show me a dissatisfied Hand, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nshow you a man that\xe2\x80\x99s fit for anything bad, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnother of the popular fictions of Coketown, which some pains had been\r\ntaken to disseminate\xe2\x80\x94and which some people really believed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I am acquainted with these chaps,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98I can read \xe2\x80\x99em\r\noff, like books.  Mrs. Sparsit, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I appeal to you.  What warning did\r\nI give that fellow, the first time he set foot in the house, when the\r\nexpress object of his visit was to know how he could knock Religion over,\r\nand floor the Established Church?  Mrs. Sparsit, in point of high\r\nconnexions, you are on a level with the aristocracy,\xe2\x80\x94did I say, or did I\r\nnot say, to that fellow, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t hide the truth from me: you are not\r\nthe kind of fellow I like; you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to no good\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Assuredly, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98you did, in a highly impressive\r\nmanner, give him such an admonition.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When he shocked you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby; \xe2\x80\x98when he shocked your\r\nfeelings?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a meek shake of her head, \xe2\x80\x98he\r\ncertainly did so.  Though I do not mean to say but that my feelings may\r\nbe weaker on such points\xe2\x80\x94more foolish if the term is preferred\xe2\x80\x94than they\r\nmight have been, if I had always occupied my present position.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby stared with a bursting pride at Mr. Harthouse, as much as\r\nto say, \xe2\x80\x98I am the proprietor of this female, and she\xe2\x80\x99s worth your\r\nattention, I think.\xe2\x80\x99  Then, resumed his discourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can recall for yourself, Harthouse, what I said to him when you saw\r\nhim.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mince the matter with him.  I am never mealy with \xe2\x80\x99em.  I\r\nKNOW \xe2\x80\x99em.  Very well, sir.  Three days after that, he bolted.  Went off,\r\nnobody knows where: as my mother did in my infancy\xe2\x80\x94only with this\r\ndifference, that he is a worse subject than my mother, if possible.  What\r\ndid he do before he went?  What do you say;\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Bounderby, with his hat\r\nin his hand, gave a beat upon the crown at every little division of his\r\nsentences, as if it were a tambourine; \xe2\x80\x98to his being seen\xe2\x80\x94night after\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94watching the Bank?\xe2\x80\x94to his lurking about there\xe2\x80\x94after dark?\xe2\x80\x94To its\r\nstriking Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x94that he could be lurking for no good\xe2\x80\x94To her calling\r\nBitzer\xe2\x80\x99s attention to him, and their both taking notice of him\xe2\x80\x94And to its\r\nappearing on inquiry to-day\xe2\x80\x94that he was also noticed by the neighbours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHaving come to the climax, Mr. Bounderby, like an oriental dancer, put\r\nhis tambourine on his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suspicious,\xe2\x80\x99 said James Harthouse, \xe2\x80\x98certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think so, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, with a defiant nod.  \xe2\x80\x98I think so.  But\r\nthere are more of \xe2\x80\x99em in it.  There\xe2\x80\x99s an old woman.  One never hears of\r\nthese things till the mischief\xe2\x80\x99s done; all sorts of defects are found out\r\nin the stable door after the horse is stolen; there\xe2\x80\x99s an old woman turns\r\nup now.  An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a\r\nbroomstick, every now and then.  _She_ watches the place a whole day\r\nbefore this fellow begins, and on the night when you saw him, she steals\r\naway with him and holds a council with him\xe2\x80\x94I suppose, to make her report\r\non going off duty, and be damned to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was such a person in the room that night, and she shrunk from\r\nobservation, thought Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is not all of \xe2\x80\x99em, even as we already know \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby,\r\nwith many nods of hidden meaning.  \xe2\x80\x98But I have said enough for the\r\npresent.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll have the goodness to keep it quiet, and mention it to no\r\none.  It may take time, but we shall have \xe2\x80\x99em.  It\xe2\x80\x99s policy to give \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nline enough, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no objection to that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course, they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law, as\r\nnotice-boards observe,\xe2\x80\x99 replied James Harthouse, \xe2\x80\x98and serve them right.\r\nFellows who go in for Banks must take the consequences.  If there were no\r\nconsequences, we should all go in for Banks.\xe2\x80\x99  He had gently taken\r\nLouisa\xe2\x80\x99s parasol from her hand, and had put it up for her; and she walked\r\nunder its shade, though the sun did not shine there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For the present, Loo Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said her husband, \xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Sparsit\r\nto look after.  Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s nerves have been acted upon by this\r\nbusiness, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here a day or two.  So make her comfortable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you very much, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 that discreet lady observed, \xe2\x80\x98but pray do not\r\nlet My comfort be a consideration.  Anything will do for Me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt soon appeared that if Mrs. Sparsit had a failing in her association\r\nwith that domestic establishment, it was that she was so excessively\r\nregardless of herself and regardful of others, as to be a nuisance.  On\r\nbeing shown her chamber, she was so dreadfully sensible of its comforts\r\nas to suggest the inference that she would have preferred to pass the\r\nnight on the mangle in the laundry.  True, the Powlers and the Scadgerses\r\nwere accustomed to splendour, \xe2\x80\x98but it is my duty to remember,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs.\r\nSparsit was fond of observing with a lofty grace: particularly when any\r\nof the domestics were present, \xe2\x80\x98that what I was, I am no longer.\r\nIndeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98if I could altogether cancel the remembrance that Mr.\r\nSparsit was a Powler, or that I myself am related to the Scadgers family;\r\nor if I could even revoke the fact, and make myself a person of common\r\ndescent and ordinary connexions; I would gladly do so.  I should think\r\nit, under existing circumstances, right to do so.\xe2\x80\x99  The same Hermitical\r\nstate of mind led to her renunciation of made dishes and wines at dinner,\r\nuntil fairly commanded by Mr. Bounderby to take them; when she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed you are very good, sir;\xe2\x80\x99 and departed from a resolution of which\r\nshe had made rather formal and public announcement, to \xe2\x80\x98wait for the\r\nsimple mutton.\xe2\x80\x99  She was likewise deeply apologetic for wanting the salt;\r\nand, feeling amiably bound to bear out Mr. Bounderby to the fullest\r\nextent in the testimony he had borne to her nerves, occasionally sat back\r\nin her chair and silently wept; at which periods a tear of large\r\ndimensions, like a crystal ear-ring, might be observed (or rather, must\r\nbe, for it insisted on public notice) sliding down her Roman nose.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s greatest point, first and last, was her determination\r\nto pity Mr. Bounderby.  There were occasions when in looking at him she\r\nwas involuntarily moved to shake her head, as who would say, \xe2\x80\x98Alas, poor\r\nYorick!\xe2\x80\x99  After allowing herself to be betrayed into these evidences of\r\nemotion, she would force a lambent brightness, and would be fitfully\r\ncheerful, and would say, \xe2\x80\x98You have still good spirits, sir, I am thankful\r\nto find;\xe2\x80\x99 and would appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that Mr.\r\nBounderby bore up as he did.  One idiosyncrasy for which she often\r\napologized, she found it excessively difficult to conquer.  She had a\r\ncurious propensity to call Mrs. Bounderby \xe2\x80\x98Miss Gradgrind,\xe2\x80\x99 and yielded\r\nto it some three or four score times in the course of the evening.  Her\r\nrepetition of this mistake covered Mrs. Sparsit with modest confusion;\r\nbut indeed, she said, it seemed so natural to say Miss Gradgrind:\r\nwhereas, to persuade herself that the young lady whom she had had the\r\nhappiness of knowing from a child could be really and truly Mrs.\r\nBounderby, she found almost impossible.  It was a further singularity of\r\nthis remarkable case, that the more she thought about it, the more\r\nimpossible it appeared; \xe2\x80\x98the differences,\xe2\x80\x99 she observed, \xe2\x80\x98being such.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room after dinner, Mr. Bounderby tried the case of the\r\nrobbery, examined the witnesses, made notes of the evidence, found the\r\nsuspected persons guilty, and sentenced them to the extreme punishment of\r\nthe law.  That done, Bitzer was dismissed to town with instructions to\r\nrecommend Tom to come home by the mail-train.\r\n\r\nWhen candles were brought, Mrs. Sparsit murmured, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be low, sir.\r\nPray let me see you cheerful, sir, as I used to do.\xe2\x80\x99  Mr. Bounderby, upon\r\nwhom these consolations had begun to produce the effect of making him, in\r\na bull-headed blundering way, sentimental, sighed like some large\r\nsea-animal.  \xe2\x80\x98I cannot bear to see you so, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98Try\r\na hand at backgammon, sir, as you used to do when I had the honour of\r\nliving under your roof.\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t played backgammon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nBounderby, \xe2\x80\x98since that time.\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, soothingly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am aware that you have not.  I remember that Miss Gradgrind takes no\r\ninterest in the game.  But I shall be happy, sir, if you will\r\ncondescend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey played near a window, opening on the garden.  It was a fine night:\r\nnot moonlight, but sultry and fragrant.  Louisa and Mr. Harthouse\r\nstrolled out into the garden, where their voices could be heard in the\r\nstillness, though not what they said.  Mrs. Sparsit, from her place at\r\nthe backgammon board, was constantly straining her eyes to pierce the\r\nshadows without.  \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby; \xe2\x80\x98you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see a Fire, do you?\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98Oh dear no, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwas thinking of the dew.\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98What have you got to do with the dew, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not myself, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nfearful of Miss Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s taking cold.\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98She never takes cold,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98Really, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.  And was affected with\r\na cough in her throat.\r\n\r\nWhen the time drew near for retiring, Mr. Bounderby took a glass of\r\nwater.  \xe2\x80\x98Oh, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98Not your sherry warm, with\r\nlemon-peel and nutmeg?\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98Why, I have got out of the habit of taking it\r\nnow, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98The more\xe2\x80\x99s the pity, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned\r\nMrs. Sparsit; \xe2\x80\x98you are losing all your good old habits.  Cheer up, sir!\r\nIf Miss Gradgrind will permit me, I will offer to make it for you, as I\r\nhave often done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Gradgrind readily permitting Mrs. Sparsit to do anything she\r\npleased, that considerate lady made the beverage, and handed it to Mr.\r\nBounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98It will do you good, sir.  It will warm your heart.  It is\r\nthe sort of thing you want, and ought to take, sir.\xe2\x80\x99  And when Mr.\r\nBounderby said, \xe2\x80\x98Your health, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x99 she answered with great feeling,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir.  The same to you, and happiness also.\xe2\x80\x99  Finally, she\r\nwished him good night, with great pathos; and Mr. Bounderby went to bed,\r\nwith a maudlin persuasion that he had been crossed in something tender,\r\nthough he could not, for his life, have mentioned what it was.\r\n\r\nLong after Louisa had undressed and lain down, she watched and waited for\r\nher brother\xe2\x80\x99s coming home.  That could hardly be, she knew, until an hour\r\npast midnight; but in the country silence, which did anything but calm\r\nthe trouble of her thoughts, time lagged wearily.  At last, when the\r\ndarkness and stillness had seemed for hours to thicken one another, she\r\nheard the bell at the gate.  She felt as though she would have been glad\r\nthat it rang on until daylight; but it ceased, and the circles of its\r\nlast sound spread out fainter and wider in the air, and all was dead\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nShe waited yet some quarter of an hour, as she judged.  Then she arose,\r\nput on a loose robe, and went out of her room in the dark, and up the\r\nstaircase to her brother\xe2\x80\x99s room.  His door being shut, she softly opened\r\nit and spoke to him, approaching his bed with a noiseless step.\r\n\r\nShe kneeled down beside it, passed her arm over his neck, and drew his\r\nface to hers.  She knew that he only feigned to be asleep, but she said\r\nnothing to him.\r\n\r\nHe started by and by as if he were just then awakened, and asked who that\r\nwas, and what was the matter?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom, have you anything to tell me?  If ever you loved me in your life,\r\nand have anything concealed from every one besides, tell it to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean, Loo.  You have been dreaming.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear brother:\xe2\x80\x99 she laid her head down on his pillow, and her hair\r\nflowed over him as if she would hide him from every one but herself: \xe2\x80\x98is\r\nthere nothing that you have to tell me?  Is there nothing you can tell me\r\nif you will?  You can tell me nothing that will change me.  O Tom, tell\r\nme the truth!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean, Loo!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you lie here alone, my dear, in the melancholy night, so you must lie\r\nsomewhere one night, when even I, if I am living then, shall have left\r\nyou.  As I am here beside you, barefoot, unclothed, undistinguishable in\r\ndarkness, so must I lie through all the night of my decay, until I am\r\ndust.  In the name of that time, Tom, tell me the truth now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it you want to know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may be certain;\xe2\x80\x99 in the energy of her love she took him to her bosom\r\nas if he were a child; \xe2\x80\x98that I will not reproach you.  You may be certain\r\nthat I will be compassionate and true to you.  You may be certain that I\r\nwill save you at whatever cost.  O Tom, have you nothing to tell me?\r\nWhisper very softly.  Say only \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d and I shall understand you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe turned her ear to his lips, but he remained doggedly silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a word, Tom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can I say Yes, or how can I say No, when I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean?\r\nLoo, you are a brave, kind girl, worthy I begin to think of a better\r\nbrother than I am.  But I have nothing more to say.  Go to bed, go to\r\nbed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are tired,\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered presently, more in her usual way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I am quite tired out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have been so hurried and disturbed to-day.  Have any fresh\r\ndiscoveries been made?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only those you have heard of, from\xe2\x80\x94him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom, have you said to any one that we made a visit to those people, and\r\nthat we saw those three together?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.  Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you yourself particularly ask me to keep it quiet when you\r\nasked me to go there with you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.  But I did not know then what was going to happen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor I neither.  How could I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was very quick upon her with this retort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ought I to say, after what has happened,\xe2\x80\x99 said his sister, standing by\r\nthe bed\xe2\x80\x94she had gradually withdrawn herself and risen, \xe2\x80\x98that I made that\r\nvisit?  Should I say so?  Must I say so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good Heavens, Loo,\xe2\x80\x99 returned her brother, \xe2\x80\x98you are not in the habit of\r\nasking my advice.  Say what you like.  If you keep it to yourself, I\r\nshall keep it to _my_self.  If you disclose it, there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was too dark for either to see the other\xe2\x80\x99s face; but each seemed very\r\nattentive, and to consider before speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom, do you believe the man I gave the money to, is really implicated in\r\nthis crime?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He seemed to me an honest man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Another person may seem to you dishonest, and yet not be so.\xe2\x80\x99  There was\r\na pause, for he had hesitated and stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In short,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Tom, as if he had made up his mind, \xe2\x80\x98if you come to\r\nthat, perhaps I was so far from being altogether in his favour, that I\r\ntook him outside the door to tell him quietly, that I thought he might\r\nconsider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he had got from\r\nmy sister, and that I hoped he would make good use of it.  You remember\r\nwhether I took him out or not.  I say nothing against the man; he may be\r\na very good fellow, for anything I know; I hope he is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was he offended by what you said?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, he took it pretty well; he was civil enough.  Where are you, Loo?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe sat up in bed and kissed her.  \xe2\x80\x98Good night, my dear, good night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have nothing more to tell me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.  What should I have?  You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have me tell you a lie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have you do that to-night, Tom, of all the nights in your\r\nlife; many and much happier as I hope they will be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, my dear Loo.  I am so tired, that I am sure I wonder I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay anything to get to sleep.  Go to bed, go to bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nKissing her again, he turned round, drew the coverlet over his head, and\r\nlay as still as if that time had come by which she had adjured him.  She\r\nstood for some time at the bedside before she slowly moved away.  She\r\nstopped at the door, looked back when she had opened it, and asked him if\r\nhe had called her?  But he lay still, and she softly closed the door and\r\nreturned to her room.\r\n\r\nThen the wretched boy looked cautiously up and found her gone, crept out\r\nof bed, fastened his door, and threw himself upon his pillow again:\r\ntearing his hair, morosely crying, grudgingly loving her, hatefully but\r\nimpenitently spurning himself, and no less hatefully and unprofitably\r\nspurning all the good in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nHEARING THE LAST OF IT\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SPARSIT, lying by to recover the tone of her nerves in Mr.\r\nBounderby\xe2\x80\x99s retreat, kept such a sharp look-out, night and day, under her\r\nCoriolanian eyebrows, that her eyes, like a couple of lighthouses on an\r\niron-bound coast, might have warned all prudent mariners from that bold\r\nrock her Roman nose and the dark and craggy region in its neighbourhood,\r\nbut for the placidity of her manner.  Although it was hard to believe\r\nthat her retiring for the night could be anything but a form, so severely\r\nwide awake were those classical eyes of hers, and so impossible did it\r\nseem that her rigid nose could yield to any relaxing influence, yet her\r\nmanner of sitting, smoothing her uncomfortable, not to say, gritty\r\nmittens (they were constructed of a cool fabric like a meat-safe), or of\r\nambling to unknown places of destination with her foot in her cotton\r\nstirrup, was so perfectly serene, that most observers would have been\r\nconstrained to suppose her a dove, embodied by some freak of nature, in\r\nthe earthly tabernacle of a bird of the hook-beaked order.\r\n\r\nShe was a most wonderful woman for prowling about the house.  How she got\r\nfrom story to story was a mystery beyond solution.  A lady so decorous in\r\nherself, and so highly connected, was not to be suspected of dropping\r\nover the banisters or sliding down them, yet her extraordinary facility\r\nof locomotion suggested the wild idea.  Another noticeable circumstance\r\nin Mrs. Sparsit was, that she was never hurried.  She would shoot with\r\nconsummate velocity from the roof to the hall, yet would be in full\r\npossession of her breath and dignity on the moment of her arrival there.\r\nNeither was she ever seen by human vision to go at a great pace.\r\n\r\nShe took very kindly to Mr. Harthouse, and had some pleasant conversation\r\nwith him soon after her arrival.  She made him her stately curtsey in the\r\ngarden, one morning before breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It appears but yesterday, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98that I had the\r\nhonour of receiving you at the Bank, when you were so good as to wish to\r\nbe made acquainted with Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s address.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An occasion, I am sure, not to be forgotten by myself in the course of\r\nAges,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Harthouse, inclining his head to Mrs. Sparsit with the\r\nmost indolent of all possible airs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We live in a singular world, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have had the honour, by a coincidence of which I am proud, to have\r\nmade a remark, similar in effect, though not so epigrammatically\r\nexpressed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A singular world, I would say, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mrs. Sparsit; after\r\nacknowledging the compliment with a drooping of her dark eyebrows, not\r\naltogether so mild in its expression as her voice was in its dulcet\r\ntones; \xe2\x80\x98as regards the intimacies we form at one time, with individuals\r\nwe were quite ignorant of, at another.  I recall, sir, that on that\r\noccasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of Miss\r\nGradgrind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves.  I\r\navailed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity, and it is\r\nunnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate.  Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntalent for\xe2\x80\x94in fact for anything requiring accuracy\xe2\x80\x94with a combination of\r\nstrength of mind\xe2\x80\x94and Family\xe2\x80\x94is too habitually developed to admit of any\r\nquestion.\xe2\x80\x99  He was almost falling asleep over this compliment; it took\r\nhim so long to get through, and his mind wandered so much in the course\r\nof its execution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You found Miss Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x94I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery absurd of me\xe2\x80\x94as youthful as I described her?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs. Sparsit,\r\nsweetly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You drew her portrait perfectly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Harthouse.  \xe2\x80\x98Presented her\r\ndead image.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very engaging, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to\r\nrevolve over one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Highly so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It used to be considered,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98that Miss Gradgrind was\r\nwanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and\r\nstrikingly improved in that respect.  Ay, and indeed here _is_ Mr.\r\nBounderby!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a great many times, as\r\nif she had been talking and thinking of no one else.  \xe2\x80\x98How do you find\r\nyourself this morning, sir?  Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his\r\nload, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby\r\nsofter than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most\r\nother people from his wife downward.  So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with\r\nforced lightness of heart, \xe2\x80\x98You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say\r\nMiss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Bounderby\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x98If I waited to be taken care of by my wife, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I believe\r\nyou know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble _you_\r\nto take charge of the teapot.\xe2\x80\x99  Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her\r\nold position at table.\r\n\r\nThis again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental.  She was so\r\nhumble withal, that when Louisa appeared, she rose, protesting she never\r\ncould think of sitting in that place under existing circumstances, often\r\nas she had had the honour of making Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast, before\r\nMrs. Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x94she begged pardon, she meant to say Miss Bounderby\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nhoped to be excused, but she really could not get it right yet, though\r\nshe trusted to become familiar with it by and by\xe2\x80\x94had assumed her present\r\nposition.  It was only (she observed) because Miss Gradgrind happened to\r\nbe a little late, and Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s time was so very precious, and she\r\nknew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment,\r\nthat she had taken the liberty of complying with his request; long as his\r\nwill had been a law to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!  Stop where you are, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98stop where you\r\nare!  Mrs. Bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble, I\r\nbelieve.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, almost with severity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98because that is very unkind to Mrs. Bounderby.  And to be unkind is not\r\nto be you, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may set your mind at rest, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x94You can take it very quietly,\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t you, Loo?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, in a blustering way to his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course.  It is of no moment.  Why should it be of any importance to\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why should it be of any importance to any one, Mrs. Sparsit, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr. Bounderby, swelling with a sense of slight.  \xe2\x80\x98You attach too\r\nmuch importance to these things, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  By George, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be corrupted\r\nin some of your notions here.  You are old-fashioned, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.  You are\r\nbehind Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s children\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Louisa, coldly surprised.  \xe2\x80\x98What has\r\ngiven you offence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Offence!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98Do you suppose if there was any offence\r\ngiven me, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t name it, and request to have it corrected?  I am a\r\nstraightforward man, I believe.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t go beating about for\r\nside-winds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident, or too\r\ndelicate,\xe2\x80\x99 Louisa answered him composedly: \xe2\x80\x98I have never made that\r\nobjection to you, either as a child or as a woman.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nwhat you would have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98Nothing.  Otherwise, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Loo\r\nBounderby, know thoroughly well that I, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown,\r\nwould have it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, as he struck the table and made the teacups ring, with\r\na proud colour in her face that was a new change, Mr. Harthouse thought.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are incomprehensible this morning,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa.  \xe2\x80\x98Pray take no\r\nfurther trouble to explain yourself.  I am not curious to know your\r\nmeaning.  What does it matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNothing more was said on this theme, and Mr. Harthouse was soon idly gay\r\non indifferent subjects.  But from this day, the Sparsit action upon Mr.\r\nBounderby threw Louisa and James Harthouse more together, and\r\nstrengthened the dangerous alienation from her husband and confidence\r\nagainst him with another, into which she had fallen by degrees so fine\r\nthat she could not retrace them if she tried.  But whether she ever tried\r\nor no, lay hidden in her own closed heart.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit was so much affected on this particular occasion, that,\r\nassisting Mr. Bounderby to his hat after breakfast, and being then alone\r\nwith him in the hall, she imprinted a chaste kiss upon his hand, murmured\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My benefactor!\xe2\x80\x99 and retired, overwhelmed with grief.  Yet it is an\r\nindubitable fact, within the cognizance of this history, that five\r\nminutes after he had left the house in the self-same hat, the same\r\ndescendant of the Scadgerses and connexion by matrimony of the Powlers,\r\nshook her right-hand mitten at his portrait, made a contemptuous grimace\r\nat that work of art, and said \xe2\x80\x98Serve you right, you Noodle, and I am glad\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby had not been long gone, when Bitzer appeared.  Bitzer had\r\ncome down by train, shrieking and rattling over the long line of arches\r\nthat bestrode the wild country of past and present coal-pits, with an\r\nexpress from Stone Lodge.  It was a hasty note to inform Louisa that Mrs.\r\nGradgrind lay very ill.  She had never been well within her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknowledge; but, she had declined within the last few days, had continued\r\nsinking all through the night, and was now as nearly dead, as her limited\r\ncapacity of being in any state that implied the ghost of an intention to\r\nget out of it, allowed.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by the lightest of porters, fit colourless servitor at\r\nDeath\xe2\x80\x99s door when Mrs. Gradgrind knocked, Louisa rumbled to Coketown,\r\nover the coal-pits past and present, and was whirled into its smoky jaws.\r\nShe dismissed the messenger to his own devices, and rode away to her old\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nShe had seldom been there since her marriage.  Her father was usually\r\nsifting and sifting at his parliamentary cinder-heap in London (without\r\nbeing observed to turn up many precious articles among the rubbish), and\r\nwas still hard at it in the national dust-yard.  Her mother had taken it\r\nrather as a disturbance than otherwise, to be visited, as she reclined\r\nupon her sofa; young people, Louisa felt herself all unfit for; Sissy she\r\nhad never softened to again, since the night when the stroller\xe2\x80\x99s child\r\nhad raised her eyes to look at Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s intended wife.  She had no\r\ninducements to go back, and had rarely gone.\r\n\r\nNeither, as she approached her old home now, did any of the best\r\ninfluences of old home descend upon her.  The dreams of childhood\xe2\x80\x94its\r\nairy fables; its graceful, beautiful, humane, impossible adornments of\r\nthe world beyond: so good to be believed in once, so good to be\r\nremembered when outgrown, for then the least among them rises to the\r\nstature of a great Charity in the heart, suffering little children to\r\ncome into the midst of it, and to keep with their pure hands a garden in\r\nthe stony ways of this world, wherein it were better for all the children\r\nof Adam that they should oftener sun themselves, simple and trustful, and\r\nnot worldly-wise\xe2\x80\x94what had she to do with these?  Remembrances of how she\r\nhad journeyed to the little that she knew, by the enchanted roads of what\r\nshe and millions of innocent creatures had hoped and imagined; of how,\r\nfirst coming upon Reason through the tender light of Fancy, she had seen\r\nit a beneficent god, deferring to gods as great as itself; not a grim\r\nIdol, cruel and cold, with its victims bound hand to foot, and its big\r\ndumb shape set up with a sightless stare, never to be moved by anything\r\nbut so many calculated tons of leverage\xe2\x80\x94what had she to do with these?\r\nHer remembrances of home and childhood were remembrances of the drying up\r\nof every spring and fountain in her young heart as it gushed out.  The\r\ngolden waters were not there.  They were flowing for the fertilization of\r\nthe land where grapes are gathered from thorns, and figs from thistles.\r\n\r\nShe went, with a heavy, hardened kind of sorrow upon her, into the house\r\nand into her mother\xe2\x80\x99s room.  Since the time of her leaving home, Sissy\r\nhad lived with the rest of the family on equal terms.  Sissy was at her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s side; and Jane, her sister, now ten or twelve years old, was in\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThere was great trouble before it could be made known to Mrs. Gradgrind\r\nthat her eldest child was there.  She reclined, propped up, from mere\r\nhabit, on a couch: as nearly in her old usual attitude, as anything so\r\nhelpless could be kept in.  She had positively refused to take to her\r\nbed; on the ground that if she did, she would never hear the last of it.\r\n\r\nHer feeble voice sounded so far away in her bundle of shawls, and the\r\nsound of another voice addressing her seemed to take such a long time in\r\ngetting down to her ears, that she might have been lying at the bottom of\r\na well.  The poor lady was nearer Truth than she ever had been: which had\r\nmuch to do with it.\r\n\r\nOn being told that Mrs. Bounderby was there, she replied, at\r\ncross-purposes, that she had never called him by that name since he\r\nmarried Louisa; that pending her choice of an objectionable name, she had\r\ncalled him J; and that she could not at present depart from that\r\nregulation, not being yet provided with a permanent substitute.  Louisa\r\nhad sat by her for some minutes, and had spoken to her often, before she\r\narrived at a clear understanding who it was.  She then seemed to come to\r\nit all at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98and I hope you are going on\r\nsatisfactorily to yourself.  It was all your father\xe2\x80\x99s doing.  He set his\r\nheart upon it.  And he ought to know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to hear of you, mother; not of myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You want to hear of me, my dear?  That\xe2\x80\x99s something new, I am sure, when\r\nanybody wants to hear of me.  Not at all well, Louisa.  Very faint and\r\ngiddy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you in pain, dear mother?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a pain somewhere in the room,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t positively say that I have got it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter this strange speech, she lay silent for some time.  Louisa, holding\r\nher hand, could feel no pulse; but kissing it, could see a slight thin\r\nthread of life in fluttering motion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You very seldom see your sister,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98She grows like\r\nyou.  I wish you would look at her.  Sissy, bring her here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was brought, and stood with her hand in her sister\xe2\x80\x99s.  Louisa had\r\nobserved her with her arm round Sissy\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and she felt the difference\r\nof this approach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you see the likeness, Louisa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, mother.  I should think her like me.  But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh!  Yes, I always say so,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Gradgrind cried, with unexpected\r\nquickness.  \xe2\x80\x98And that reminds me.  I\xe2\x80\x94I want to speak to you, my dear.\r\nSissy, my good girl, leave us alone a minute.\xe2\x80\x99 Louisa had relinquished\r\nthe hand: had thought that her sister\xe2\x80\x99s was a better and brighter face\r\nthan hers had ever been: had seen in it, not without a rising feeling of\r\nresentment, even in that place and at that time, something of the\r\ngentleness of the other face in the room; the sweet face with the\r\ntrusting eyes, made paler than watching and sympathy made it, by the rich\r\ndark hair.\r\n\r\nLeft alone with her mother, Louisa saw her lying with an awful lull upon\r\nher face, like one who was floating away upon some great water, all\r\nresistance over, content to be carried down the stream.  She put the\r\nshadow of a hand to her lips again, and recalled her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were going to speak to me, mother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?  Yes, to be sure, my dear.  You know your father is almost always\r\naway now, and therefore I must write to him about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About what, mother?  Don\xe2\x80\x99t be troubled.  About what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must remember, my dear, that whenever I have said anything, on any\r\nsubject, I have never heard the last of it: and consequently, that I have\r\nlong left off saying anything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can hear you, mother.\xe2\x80\x99  But, it was only by dint of bending down to\r\nher ear, and at the same time attentively watching the lips as they\r\nmoved, that she could link such faint and broken sounds into any chain of\r\nconnexion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You learnt a great deal, Louisa, and so did your brother.  Ologies of\r\nall kinds from morning to night.  If there is any Ology left, of any\r\ndescription, that has not been worn to rags in this house, all I can say\r\nis, I hope I shall never hear its name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can hear you, mother, when you have strength to go on.\xe2\x80\x99  This, to keep\r\nher from floating away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But there is something\xe2\x80\x94not an Ology at all\xe2\x80\x94that your father has missed,\r\nor forgotten, Louisa.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is.  I have often sat with\r\nSissy near me, and thought about it.  I shall never get its name now.\r\nBut your father may.  It makes me restless.  I want to write to him, to\r\nfind out for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, what it is.  Give me a pen, give me a pen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEven the power of restlessness was gone, except from the poor head, which\r\ncould just turn from side to side.\r\n\r\nShe fancied, however, that her request had been complied with, and that\r\nthe pen she could not have held was in her hand.  It matters little what\r\nfigures of wonderful no-meaning she began to trace upon her wrappers.\r\nThe hand soon stopped in the midst of them; the light that had always\r\nbeen feeble and dim behind the weak transparency, went out; and even Mrs.\r\nGradgrind, emerged from the shadow in which man walketh and disquieteth\r\nhimself in vain, took upon her the dread solemnity of the sages and\r\npatriarchs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nMRS. SPARSIT\xe2\x80\x99S STAIRCASE\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SPARSIT\xe2\x80\x99S nerves being slow to recover their tone, the worthy woman\r\nmade a stay of some weeks in duration at Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s retreat, where,\r\nnotwithstanding her anchorite turn of mind based upon her becoming\r\nconsciousness of her altered station, she resigned herself with noble\r\nfortitude to lodging, as one may say, in clover, and feeding on the fat\r\nof the land.  During the whole term of this recess from the guardianship\r\nof the Bank, Mrs. Sparsit was a pattern of consistency; continuing to\r\ntake such pity on Mr. Bounderby to his face, as is rarely taken on man,\r\nand to call his portrait a Noodle to _its_ face, with the greatest\r\nacrimony and contempt.\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby, having got it into his explosive composition that Mrs.\r\nSparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he had that general\r\ncross upon him in his deserts (for he had not yet settled what it was),\r\nand further that Louisa would have objected to her as a frequent visitor\r\nif it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything\r\nhe chose to do, resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily.  So\r\nwhen her nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming\r\nsweetbreads in solitude, he said to her at the dinner-table, on the day\r\nbefore her departure, \xe2\x80\x98I tell you what, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; you shall come down here\r\nof a Saturday, while the fine weather lasts, and stay till Monday.\xe2\x80\x99  To\r\nwhich Mrs. Sparsit returned, in effect, though not of the Mahomedan\r\npersuasion: \xe2\x80\x98To hear is to obey.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow, Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she took an idea in the\r\nnature of an allegorical fancy, into her head.  Much watching of Louisa,\r\nand much consequent observation of her impenetrable demeanour, which\r\nkeenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s edge, must have given her as\r\nit were a lift, in the way of inspiration.  She erected in her mind a\r\nmighty Staircase, with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and\r\ndown those stairs, from day to day and hour to hour, she saw Louisa\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nIt became the business of Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s life, to look up at her\r\nstaircase, and to watch Louisa coming down.  Sometimes slowly, sometimes\r\nquickly, sometimes several steps at one bout, sometimes stopping, never\r\nturning back.  If she had once turned back, it might have been the death\r\nof Mrs. Sparsit in spleen and grief.\r\n\r\nShe had been descending steadily, to the day, and on the day, when Mr.\r\nBounderby issued the weekly invitation recorded above.  Mrs. Sparsit was\r\nin good spirits, and inclined to be conversational.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And pray, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98if I may venture to ask a question\r\nappertaining to any subject on which you show reserve\xe2\x80\x94which is indeed\r\nhardy in me, for I well know you have a reason for everything you do\xe2\x80\x94have\r\nyou received intelligence respecting the robbery?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, no; not yet.  Under the circumstances, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it\r\nyet.  Rome wasn\xe2\x80\x99t built in a day, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very true, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor yet in a week, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, indeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a gentle melancholy upon\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a similar manner, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98I can wait, you know.  If\r\nRomulus and Remus could wait, Josiah Bounderby can wait.  They were\r\nbetter off in their youth than I was, however.  They had a she-wolf for a\r\nnurse; I had only a she-wolf for a grandmother.  She didn\xe2\x80\x99t give any\r\nmilk, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; she gave bruises.  She was a regular Alderney at that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Sparsit sighed and shuddered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98I have not heard anything more about\r\nit.  It\xe2\x80\x99s in hand, though; and young Tom, who rather sticks to business\r\nat present\xe2\x80\x94something new for him; he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the schooling _I_ had\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nhelping.  My injunction is, Keep it quiet, and let it seem to blow over.\r\nDo what you like under the rose, but don\xe2\x80\x99t give a sign of what you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nabout; or half a hundred of \xe2\x80\x99em will combine together and get this fellow\r\nwho has bolted, out of reach for good.  Keep it quiet, and the thieves\r\nwill grow in confidence by little and little, and we shall have \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very sagacious indeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98Very interesting.  The\r\nold woman you mentioned, sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old woman I mentioned, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, cutting the matter\r\nshort, as it was nothing to boast about, \xe2\x80\x98is not laid hold of; but, she\r\nmay take her oath she will be, if that is any satisfaction to her\r\nvillainous old mind.  In the mean time, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I am of opinion, if you\r\nask me my opinion, that the less she is talked about, the better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe same evening, Mrs. Sparsit, in her chamber window, resting from her\r\npacking operations, looked towards her great staircase and saw Louisa\r\nstill descending.\r\n\r\nShe sat by Mr. Harthouse, in an alcove in the garden, talking very low;\r\nhe stood leaning over her, as they whispered together, and his face\r\nalmost touched her hair.  \xe2\x80\x98If not quite!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, straining\r\nher hawk\xe2\x80\x99s eyes to the utmost.  Mrs. Sparsit was too distant to hear a\r\nword of their discourse, or even to know that they were speaking softly,\r\notherwise than from the expression of their figures; but what they said\r\nwas this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You recollect the man, Mr. Harthouse?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, perfectly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His face, and his manner, and what he said?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perfectly.  And an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be.\r\nLengthy and prosy in the extreme.  It was knowing to hold forth, in the\r\nhumble-virtue school of eloquence; but, I assure you I thought at the\r\ntime, \xe2\x80\x9cMy good fellow, you are over-doing this!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Louisa\xe2\x80\x94as Tom says.\xe2\x80\x99  Which he never did say.  \xe2\x80\x98You know no good\r\nof the fellow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor of any other such person?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can I,\xe2\x80\x99 she returned, with more of her first manner on her than he\r\nhad lately seen, \xe2\x80\x98when I know nothing of them, men or women?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Louisa, then consent to receive the submissive representation of\r\nyour devoted friend, who knows something of several varieties of his\r\nexcellent fellow-creatures\xe2\x80\x94for excellent they are, I am quite ready to\r\nbelieve, in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to\r\nwhat they can get hold of.  This fellow talks.  Well; every fellow talks.\r\nHe professes morality.  Well; all sorts of humbugs profess morality.\r\nFrom the House of Commons to the House of Correction, there is a general\r\nprofession of morality, except among our people; it really is that\r\nexception which makes our people quite reviving.  You saw and heard the\r\ncase.  Here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my\r\nesteemed friend Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x94who, as we know, is not possessed of that\r\ndelicacy which would soften so tight a hand.  The member of the fluffy\r\nclasses was injured, exasperated, left the house grumbling, met somebody\r\nwho proposed to him to go in for some share in this Bank business, went\r\nin, put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before, and\r\nrelieved his mind extremely.  Really he would have been an uncommon,\r\ninstead of a common, fellow, if he had not availed himself of such an\r\nopportunity.  Or he may have originated it altogether, if he had the\r\ncleverness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I almost feel as though it must be bad in me,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Louisa, after\r\nsitting thoughtful awhile, \xe2\x80\x98to be so ready to agree with you, and to be\r\nso lightened in my heart by what you say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I only say what is reasonable; nothing worse.  I have talked it over\r\nwith my friend Tom more than once\xe2\x80\x94of course I remain on terms of perfect\r\nconfidence with Tom\xe2\x80\x94and he is quite of my opinion, and I am quite of his.\r\nWill you walk?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey strolled away, among the lanes beginning to be indistinct in the\r\ntwilight\xe2\x80\x94she leaning on his arm\xe2\x80\x94and she little thought how she was going\r\ndown, down, down, Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s staircase.\r\n\r\nNight and day, Mrs. Sparsit kept it standing.  When Louisa had arrived at\r\nthe bottom and disappeared in the gulf, it might fall in upon her if it\r\nwould; but, until then, there it was to be, a Building, before Mrs.\r\nSparsit\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.  And there Louisa always was, upon it.\r\n\r\nAnd always gliding down, down, down!\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit saw James Harthouse come and go; she heard of him here and\r\nthere; she saw the changes of the face he had studied; she, too, remarked\r\nto a nicety how and when it clouded, how and when it cleared; she kept\r\nher black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with no touch of\r\ncompunction, all absorbed in interest.  In the interest of seeing her,\r\never drawing, with no hand to stay her, nearer and nearer to the bottom\r\nof this new Giant\xe2\x80\x99s Staircase.\r\n\r\nWith all her deference for Mr. Bounderby as contradistinguished from his\r\nportrait, Mrs. Sparsit had not the smallest intention of interrupting the\r\ndescent.  Eager to see it accomplished, and yet patient, she waited for\r\nthe last fall, as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her\r\nhopes.  Hushed in expectancy, she kept her wary gaze upon the stairs; and\r\nseldom so much as darkly shook her right mitten (with her fist in it), at\r\nthe figure coming down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nLOWER AND LOWER\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE figure descended the great stairs, steadily, steadily; always\r\nverging, like a weight in deep water, to the black gulf at the bottom.\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind, apprised of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s decease, made an expedition from\r\nLondon, and buried her in a business-like manner.  He then returned with\r\npromptitude to the national cinder-heap, and resumed his sifting for the\r\nodds and ends he wanted, and his throwing of the dust about into the eyes\r\nof other people who wanted other odds and ends\xe2\x80\x94in fact resumed his\r\nparliamentary duties.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Mrs. Sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward.  Separated\r\nfrom her staircase, all the week, by the length of iron road dividing\r\nCoketown from the country house, she yet maintained her cat-like\r\nobservation of Louisa, through her husband, through her brother, through\r\nJames Harthouse, through the outsides of letters and packets, through\r\neverything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your foot on the last step, my lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, apostrophizing\r\nthe descending figure, with the aid of her threatening mitten, \xe2\x80\x98and all\r\nyour art shall never blind me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nArt or nature though, the original stock of Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s character or the\r\ngraft of circumstances upon it,\xe2\x80\x94her curious reserve did baffle, while it\r\nstimulated, one as sagacious as Mrs. Sparsit.  There were times when Mr.\r\nJames Harthouse was not sure of her.  There were times when he could not\r\nread the face he had studied so long; and when this lonely girl was a\r\ngreater mystery to him, than any woman of the world with a ring of\r\nsatellites to help her.\r\n\r\nSo the time went on; until it happened that Mr. Bounderby was called away\r\nfrom home by business which required his presence elsewhere, for three or\r\nfour days.  It was on a Friday that he intimated this to Mrs. Sparsit at\r\nthe Bank, adding: \xe2\x80\x98But you\xe2\x80\x99ll go down to-morrow, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, all the same.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll go down just as if I was there.  It will make no difference to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, reproachfully, \xe2\x80\x98let me beg you not to\r\nsay that.  Your absence will make a vast difference to me, sir, as I\r\nthink you very well know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, then you must get on in my absence as well as you can,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr. Bounderby, not displeased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98your will is to me a law, sir;\r\notherwise, it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands, not\r\nfeeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to Miss Gradgrind to\r\nreceive me, as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality.  But you\r\nshall say no more, sir.  I will go, upon your invitation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, when I invite you to my house, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, opening his\r\neyes, \xe2\x80\x98I should hope you want no other invitation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, indeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98I should hope not.  Say no\r\nmore, sir.  I would, sir, I could see you gay again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 blustered Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98there was wont to be an elasticity in you\r\nwhich I sadly miss.  Be buoyant, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby, under the influence of this difficult adjuration, backed\r\nup by her compassionate eye, could only scratch his head in a feeble and\r\nridiculous manner, and afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being\r\nheard to bully the small fry of business all the morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bitzer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit that afternoon, when her patron was gone on\r\nhis journey, and the Bank was closing, \xe2\x80\x98present my compliments to young\r\nMr. Thomas, and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop\r\nand walnut ketchup, with a glass of India ale?\xe2\x80\x99  Young Mr. Thomas being\r\nusually ready for anything in that way, returned a gracious answer, and\r\nfollowed on its heels.  \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Thomas,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98these plain\r\nviands being on table, I thought you might be tempted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Mrs. Sparsit,\xe2\x80\x99 said the whelp.  And gloomily fell to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs. Sparsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where may he be at present?\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light\r\nconversational manner, after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies\r\nfor being so uncommunicative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is shooting in Yorkshire,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Sent Loo a basket half as big\r\nas a church, yesterday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The kind of gentleman, now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly, \xe2\x80\x98whom one might\r\nwager to be a good shot!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Crack,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.\r\n\r\nHe had long been a down-looking young fellow, but this characteristic had\r\nso increased of late, that he never raised his eyes to any face for three\r\nseconds together.  Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching\r\nhis looks, if she were so inclined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98as\r\nindeed he is of most people.  May we expect to see him again shortly, Mr.\r\nTom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, _I_ expect to see him to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the whelp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good news!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Sparsit, blandly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have got an appointment with him to meet him in the evening at the\r\nstation here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, \xe2\x80\x98and I am going to dine with him afterwards, I\r\nbelieve.  He is not coming down to the country house for a week or so,\r\nbeing due somewhere else.  At least, he says so; but I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder\r\nif he was to stop here over Sunday, and stray that way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which reminds me!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98Would you remember a message to\r\nyour sister, Mr. Tom, if I was to charge you with one?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?  I\xe2\x80\x99ll try,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the reluctant whelp, \xe2\x80\x98if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a long un.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is merely my respectful compliments,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98and I fear\r\nI may not trouble her with my society this week; being still a little\r\nnervous, and better perhaps by my poor self.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!  If that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Tom, \xe2\x80\x98it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t much matter, even if I\r\nwas to forget it, for Loo\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to think of you unless she sees\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving paid for his entertainment with this agreeable compliment, he\r\nrelapsed into a hangdog silence until there was no more India ale left,\r\nwhen he said, \xe2\x80\x98Well, Mrs. Sparsit, I must be off!\xe2\x80\x99 and went off.\r\n\r\nNext day, Saturday, Mrs. Sparsit sat at her window all day long looking\r\nat the customers coming in and out, watching the postmen, keeping an eye\r\non the general traffic of the street, revolving many things in her mind,\r\nbut, above all, keeping her attention on her staircase.  The evening\r\ncome, she put on her bonnet and shawl, and went quietly out: having her\r\nreasons for hovering in a furtive way about the station by which a\r\npassenger would arrive from Yorkshire, and for preferring to peep into it\r\nround pillars and corners, and out of ladies\xe2\x80\x99 waiting-room windows, to\r\nappearing in its precincts openly.\r\n\r\nTom was in attendance, and loitered about until the expected train came\r\nin.  It brought no Mr. Harthouse.  Tom waited until the crowd had\r\ndispersed, and the bustle was over; and then referred to a posted list of\r\ntrains, and took counsel with porters.  That done, he strolled away idly,\r\nstopping in the street and looking up it and down it, and lifting his hat\r\noff and putting it on again, and yawning and stretching himself, and\r\nexhibiting all the symptoms of mortal weariness to be expected in one who\r\nhad still to wait until the next train should come in, an hour and forty\r\nminutes hence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a device to keep him out of the way,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit,\r\nstarting from the dull office window whence she had watched him last.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Harthouse is with his sister now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was the conception of an inspired moment, and she shot off with her\r\nutmost swiftness to work it out.  The station for the country house was\r\nat the opposite end of the town, the time was short, the road not easy;\r\nbut she was so quick in pouncing on a disengaged coach, so quick in\r\ndarting out of it, producing her money, seizing her ticket, and diving\r\ninto the train, that she was borne along the arches spanning the land of\r\ncoal-pits past and present, as if she had been caught up in a cloud and\r\nwhirled away.\r\n\r\nAll the journey, immovable in the air though never left behind; plain to\r\nthe dark eyes of her mind, as the electric wires which ruled a colossal\r\nstrip of music-paper out of the evening sky, were plain to the dark eyes\r\nof her body; Mrs. Sparsit saw her staircase, with the figure coming down.\r\nVery near the bottom now.  Upon the brink of the abyss.\r\n\r\nAn overcast September evening, just at nightfall, saw beneath its\r\ndrooping eyelids Mrs. Sparsit glide out of her carriage, pass down the\r\nwooden steps of the little station into a stony road, cross it into a\r\ngreen lane, and become hidden in a summer-growth of leaves and branches.\r\nOne or two late birds sleepily chirping in their nests, and a bat heavily\r\ncrossing and recrossing her, and the reek of her own tread in the thick\r\ndust that felt like velvet, were all Mrs. Sparsit heard or saw until she\r\nvery softly closed a gate.\r\n\r\nShe went up to the house, keeping within the shrubbery, and went round\r\nit, peeping between the leaves at the lower windows.  Most of them were\r\nopen, as they usually were in such warm weather, but there were no lights\r\nyet, and all was silent.  She tried the garden with no better effect.\r\nShe thought of the wood, and stole towards it, heedless of long grass and\r\nbriers: of worms, snails, and slugs, and all the creeping things that be.\r\nWith her dark eyes and her hook nose warily in advance of her, Mrs.\r\nSparsit softly crushed her way through the thick undergrowth, so intent\r\nupon her object that she probably would have done no less, if the wood\r\nhad been a wood of adders.\r\n\r\nHark!\r\n\r\nThe smaller birds might have tumbled out of their nests, fascinated by\r\nthe glittering of Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s eyes in the gloom, as she stopped and\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\nLow voices close at hand.  His voice and hers.  The appointment _was_ a\r\ndevice to keep the brother away!  There they were yonder, by the felled\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nBending low among the dewy grass, Mrs. Sparsit advanced closer to them.\r\nShe drew herself up, and stood behind a tree, like Robinson Crusoe in his\r\nambuscade against the savages; so near to them that at a spring, and that\r\nno great one, she could have touched them both.  He was there secretly,\r\nand had not shown himself at the house.  He had come on horseback, and\r\nmust have passed through the neighbouring fields; for his horse was tied\r\nto the meadow side of the fence, within a few paces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dearest love,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98what could I do?  Knowing you were alone,\r\nwas it possible that I could stay away?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may hang your head, to make yourself the more attractive; _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what they see in you when you hold it up,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mrs. Sparsit;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but you little think, my dearest love, whose eyes are on you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat she hung her head, was certain.  She urged him to go away, she\r\ncommanded him to go away; but she neither turned her face to him, nor\r\nraised it.  Yet it was remarkable that she sat as still as ever the\r\namiable woman in ambuscade had seen her sit, at any period in her life.\r\nHer hands rested in one another, like the hands of a statue; and even her\r\nmanner of speaking was not hurried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear child,\xe2\x80\x99 said Harthouse; Mrs. Sparsit saw with delight that his\r\narm embraced her; \xe2\x80\x98will you not bear with my society for a little while?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where, Louisa?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But we have so little time to make so much of, and I have come so far,\r\nand am altogether so devoted, and distracted.  There never was a slave at\r\nonce so devoted and ill-used by his mistress.  To look for your sunny\r\nwelcome that has warmed me into life, and to be received in your frozen\r\nmanner, is heart-rending.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I to say again, that I must be left to myself here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But we must meet, my dear Louisa.  Where shall we meet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey both started.  The listener started, guiltily, too; for she thought\r\nthere was another listener among the trees.  It was only rain, beginning\r\nto fall fast, in heavy drops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I ride up to the house a few minutes hence, innocently supposing\r\nthat its master is at home and will be charmed to receive me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your cruel commands are implicitly to be obeyed; though I am the most\r\nunfortunate fellow in the world, I believe, to have been insensible to\r\nall other women, and to have fallen prostrate at last under the foot of\r\nthe most beautiful, and the most engaging, and the most imperious.  My\r\ndearest Louisa, I cannot go myself, or let you go, in this hard abuse of\r\nyour power.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit saw him detain her with his encircling arm, and heard him\r\nthen and there, within her (Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s) greedy hearing, tell her how\r\nhe loved her, and how she was the stake for which he ardently desired to\r\nplay away all that he had in life.  The objects he had lately pursued,\r\nturned worthless beside her; such success as was almost in his grasp, he\r\nflung away from him like the dirt it was, compared with her.  Its\r\npursuit, nevertheless, if it kept him near her, or its renunciation if it\r\ntook him from her, or flight if she shared it, or secrecy if she\r\ncommanded it, or any fate, or every fate, all was alike to him, so that\r\nshe was true to him,\xe2\x80\x94the man who had seen how cast away she was, whom she\r\nhad inspired at their first meeting with an admiration, an interest, of\r\nwhich he had thought himself incapable, whom she had received into her\r\nconfidence, who was devoted to her and adored her.  All this, and more,\r\nin his hurry, and in hers, in the whirl of her own gratified malice, in\r\nthe dread of being discovered, in the rapidly increasing noise of heavy\r\nrain among the leaves, and a thunderstorm rolling up\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Sparsit\r\nreceived into her mind, set off with such an unavoidable halo of\r\nconfusion and indistinctness, that when at length he climbed the fence\r\nand led his horse away, she was not sure where they were to meet, or\r\nwhen, except that they had said it was to be that night.\r\n\r\nBut one of them yet remained in the darkness before her; and while she\r\ntracked that one she must be right.  \xe2\x80\x98Oh, my dearest love,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mrs.\r\nSparsit, \xe2\x80\x98you little think how well attended you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit saw her out of the wood, and saw her enter the house.  What\r\nto do next?  It rained now, in a sheet of water.  Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s white\r\nstockings were of many colours, green predominating; prickly things were\r\nin her shoes; caterpillars slung themselves, in hammocks of their own\r\nmaking, from various parts of her dress; rills ran from her bonnet, and\r\nher Roman nose.  In such condition, Mrs. Sparsit stood hidden in the\r\ndensity of the shrubbery, considering what next?\r\n\r\nLo, Louisa coming out of the house!  Hastily cloaked and muffled, and\r\nstealing away.  She elopes!  She falls from the lowermost stair, and is\r\nswallowed up in the gulf.\r\n\r\nIndifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick determined step, she\r\nstruck into a side-path parallel with the ride.  Mrs. Sparsit followed in\r\nthe shadow of the trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to\r\nkeep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness.\r\n\r\nWhen she stopped to close the side-gate without noise, Mrs. Sparsit\r\nstopped.  When she went on, Mrs. Sparsit went on.  She went by the way\r\nMrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony\r\nroad, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad.  A train for\r\nCoketown would come through presently, Mrs. Sparsit knew; so she\r\nunderstood Coketown to be her first place of destination.\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s limp and streaming state, no extensive precautions were\r\nnecessary to change her usual appearance; but, she stopped under the lee\r\nof the station wall, tumbled her shawl into a new shape, and put it on\r\nover her bonnet.  So disguised she had no fear of being recognized when\r\nshe followed up the railroad steps, and paid her money in the small\r\noffice.  Louisa sat waiting in a corner.  Mrs. Sparsit sat waiting in\r\nanother corner.  Both listened to the thunder, which was loud, and to the\r\nrain, as it washed off the roof, and pattered on the parapets of the\r\narches.  Two or three lamps were rained out and blown out; so, both saw\r\nthe lightning to advantage as it quivered and zigzagged on the iron\r\ntracks.\r\n\r\nThe seizure of the station with a fit of trembling, gradually deepening\r\nto a complaint of the heart, announced the train.  Fire and steam, and\r\nsmoke, and red light; a hiss, a crash, a bell, and a shriek; Louisa put\r\ninto one carriage, Mrs. Sparsit put into another: the little station a\r\ndesert speck in the thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nThough her teeth chattered in her head from wet and cold, Mrs. Sparsit\r\nexulted hugely.  The figure had plunged down the precipice, and she felt\r\nherself, as it were, attending on the body.  Could she, who had been so\r\nactive in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She will be at Coketown long before him,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98though\r\nhis horse is never so good.  Where will she wait for him?  And where will\r\nthey go together?  Patience.  We shall see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe tremendous rain occasioned infinite confusion, when the train stopped\r\nat its destination.  Gutters and pipes had burst, drains had overflowed,\r\nand streets were under water.  In the first instant of alighting, Mrs.\r\nSparsit turned her distracted eyes towards the waiting coaches, which\r\nwere in great request.  \xe2\x80\x98She will get into one,\xe2\x80\x99 she considered, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nwill be away before I can follow in another.  At all risks of being run\r\nover, I must see the number, and hear the order given to the coachman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, Mrs. Sparsit was wrong in her calculation.  Louisa got into no\r\ncoach, and was already gone.  The black eyes kept upon the\r\nrailroad-carriage in which she had travelled, settled upon it a moment\r\ntoo late.  The door not being opened after several minutes, Mrs. Sparsit\r\npassed it and repassed it, saw nothing, looked in, and found it empty.\r\nWet through and through: with her feet squelching and squashing in her\r\nshoes whenever she moved; with a rash of rain upon her classical visage;\r\nwith a bonnet like an over-ripe fig; with all her clothes spoiled; with\r\ndamp impressions of every button, string, and hook-and-eye she wore,\r\nprinted off upon her highly connected back; with a stagnant verdure on\r\nher general exterior, such as accumulates on an old park fence in a\r\nmouldy lane; Mrs. Sparsit had no resource but to burst into tears of\r\nbitterness and say, \xe2\x80\x98I have lost her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nDOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE national dustmen, after entertaining one another with a great many\r\nnoisy little fights among themselves, had dispersed for the present, and\r\nMr. Gradgrind was at home for the vacation.\r\n\r\nHe sat writing in the room with the deadly statistical clock, proving\r\nsomething no doubt\xe2\x80\x94probably, in the main, that the Good Samaritan was a\r\nBad Economist.  The noise of the rain did not disturb him much; but it\r\nattracted his attention sufficiently to make him raise his head\r\nsometimes, as if he were rather remonstrating with the elements.  When it\r\nthundered very loudly, he glanced towards Coketown, having it in his mind\r\nthat some of the tall chimneys might be struck by lightning.\r\n\r\nThe thunder was rolling into distance, and the rain was pouring down like\r\na deluge, when the door of his room opened.  He looked round the lamp\r\nupon his table, and saw, with amazement, his eldest daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Louisa!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father, I want to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the matter?  How strange you look!  And good Heaven,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nGradgrind, wondering more and more, \xe2\x80\x98have you come here exposed to this\r\nstorm?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe put her hands to her dress, as if she hardly knew.  \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99  Then she\r\nuncovered her head, and letting her cloak and hood fall where they might,\r\nstood looking at him: so colourless, so dishevelled, so defiant and\r\ndespairing, that he was afraid of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?  I conjure you, Louisa, tell me what is the matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe dropped into a chair before him, and put her cold hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father, you have trained me from my cradle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Louisa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I curse the hour in which I was born to such a destiny.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in doubt and dread, vacantly repeating: \xe2\x80\x98Curse the hour?\r\nCurse the hour?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How could you give me life, and take from me all the inappreciable\r\nthings that raise it from the state of conscious death?  Where are the\r\ngraces of my soul?  Where are the sentiments of my heart?  What have you\r\ndone, O father, what have you done, with the garden that should have\r\nbloomed once, in this great wilderness here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe struck herself with both her hands upon her bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it had ever been here, its ashes alone would save me from the void in\r\nwhich my whole life sinks.  I did not mean to say this; but, father, you\r\nremember the last time we conversed in this room?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had been so wholly unprepared for what he heard now, that it was with\r\ndifficulty he answered, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, Louisa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has risen to my lips now, would have risen to my lips then, if you\r\nhad given me a moment\xe2\x80\x99s help.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t reproach you, father.  What you\r\nhave never nurtured in me, you have never nurtured in yourself; but O! if\r\nyou had only done so long ago, or if you had only neglected me, what a\r\nmuch better and much happier creature I should have been this day!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, after all his care, he bowed his head upon his hand and\r\ngroaned aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father, if you had known, when we were last together here, what even I\r\nfeared while I strove against it\xe2\x80\x94as it has been my task from infancy to\r\nstrive against every natural prompting that has arisen in my heart; if\r\nyou had known that there lingered in my breast, sensibilities,\r\naffections, weaknesses capable of being cherished into strength, defying\r\nall the calculations ever made by man, and no more known to his\r\narithmetic than his Creator is,\xe2\x80\x94would you have given me to the husband\r\nwhom I am now sure that I hate?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x98No.  No, my poor child.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the frost and blight that have\r\nhardened and spoiled me?  Would you have robbed me\xe2\x80\x94for no one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenrichment\xe2\x80\x94only for the greater desolation of this world\xe2\x80\x94of the\r\nimmaterial part of my life, the spring and summer of my belief, my refuge\r\nfrom what is sordid and bad in the real things around me, my school in\r\nwhich I should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with\r\nthem, and to hope in my little sphere to make them better?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, no.  No, Louisa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet, father, if I had been stone blind; if I had groped my way by my\r\nsense of touch, and had been free, while I knew the shapes and surfaces\r\nof things, to exercise my fancy somewhat, in regard to them; I should\r\nhave been a million times wiser, happier, more loving, more contented,\r\nmore innocent and human in all good respects, than I am with the eyes I\r\nhave.  Now, hear what I have come to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe moved, to support her with his arm.  She rising as he did so, they\r\nstood close together: she, with a hand upon his shoulder, looking fixedly\r\nin his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With a hunger and thirst upon me, father, which have never been for a\r\nmoment appeased; with an ardent impulse towards some region where rules,\r\nand figures, and definitions were not quite absolute; I have grown up,\r\nbattling every inch of my way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never knew you were unhappy, my child.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father, I always knew it.  In this strife I have almost repulsed and\r\ncrushed my better angel into a demon.  What I have learned has left me\r\ndoubting, misbelieving, despising, regretting, what I have not learned;\r\nand my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by, and\r\nthat nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you so young, Louisa!\xe2\x80\x99 he said with pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I so young.  In this condition, father\xe2\x80\x94for I show you now, without\r\nfear or favour, the ordinary deadened state of my mind as I know it\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nproposed my husband to me.  I took him.  I never made a pretence to him\r\nor you that I loved him.  I knew, and, father, you knew, and he knew,\r\nthat I never did.  I was not wholly indifferent, for I had a hope of\r\nbeing pleasant and useful to Tom.  I made that wild escape into something\r\nvisionary, and have slowly found out how wild it was.  But Tom had been\r\nthe subject of all the little tenderness of my life; perhaps he became so\r\nbecause I knew so well how to pity him.  It matters little now, except as\r\nit may dispose you to think more leniently of his errors.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs her father held her in his arms, she put her other hand upon his other\r\nshoulder, and still looking fixedly in his face, went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I was irrevocably married, there rose up into rebellion against the\r\ntie, the old strife, made fiercer by all those causes of disparity which\r\narise out of our two individual natures, and which no general laws shall\r\never rule or state for me, father, until they shall be able to direct the\r\nanatomist where to strike his knife into the secrets of my soul.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Louisa!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, and said imploringly; for he well remembered what had\r\npassed between them in their former interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not reproach you, father, I make no complaint.  I am here with\r\nanother object.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What can I do, child?  Ask me what you will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am coming to it.  Father, chance then threw into my way a new\r\nacquaintance; a man such as I had had no experience of; used to the\r\nworld; light, polished, easy; making no pretences; avowing the low\r\nestimate of everything, that I was half afraid to form in secret;\r\nconveying to me almost immediately, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how or by what\r\ndegrees, that he understood me, and read my thoughts.  I could not find\r\nthat he was worse than I.  There seemed to be a near affinity between us.\r\nI only wondered it should be worth his while, who cared for nothing else,\r\nto care so much for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For you, Louisa!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer father might instinctively have loosened his hold, but that he felt\r\nher strength departing from her, and saw a wild dilating fire in the eyes\r\nsteadfastly regarding him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence.  It matters very\r\nlittle how he gained it.  Father, he did gain it.  What you know of the\r\nstory of my marriage, he soon knew, just as well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer father\xe2\x80\x99s face was ashy white, and he held her in both his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have done no worse, I have not disgraced you.  But if you ask me\r\nwhether I have loved him, or do love him, I tell you plainly, father,\r\nthat it may be so.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe took her hands suddenly from his shoulders, and pressed them both\r\nupon her side; while in her face, not like itself\xe2\x80\x94and in her figure,\r\ndrawn up, resolute to finish by a last effort what she had to say\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfeelings long suppressed broke loose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This night, my husband being away, he has been with me, declaring\r\nhimself my lover.  This minute he expects me, for I could release myself\r\nof his presence by no other means.  I do not know that I am sorry, I do\r\nnot know that I am ashamed, I do not know that I am degraded in my own\r\nesteem.  All that I know is, your philosophy and your teaching will not\r\nsave me.  Now, father, you have brought me to this.  Save me by some\r\nother means!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe tightened his hold in time to prevent her sinking on the floor, but\r\nshe cried out in a terrible voice, \xe2\x80\x98I shall die if you hold me!  Let me\r\nfall upon the ground!\xe2\x80\x99  And he laid her down there, and saw the pride of\r\nhis heart and the triumph of his system, lying, an insensible heap, at\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n                          END OF THE SECOND BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE THIRD\r\n_GARNERING_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nANOTHER THING NEEDFUL\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUISA awoke from a torpor, and her eyes languidly opened on her old bed\r\nat home, and her old room.  It seemed, at first, as if all that had\r\nhappened since the days when these objects were familiar to her were the\r\nshadows of a dream, but gradually, as the objects became more real to her\r\nsight, the events became more real to her mind.\r\n\r\nShe could scarcely move her head for pain and heaviness, her eyes were\r\nstrained and sore, and she was very weak.  A curious passive inattention\r\nhad such possession of her, that the presence of her little sister in the\r\nroom did not attract her notice for some time.  Even when their eyes had\r\nmet, and her sister had approached the bed, Louisa lay for minutes\r\nlooking at her in silence, and suffering her timidly to hold her passive\r\nhand, before she asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When was I brought to this room?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Last night, Louisa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who brought me here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sissy, I believe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you believe so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I found her here this morning.  She didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to my bedside to\r\nwake me, as she always does; and I went to look for her.  She was not in\r\nher own room either; and I went looking for her all over the house, until\r\nI found her here taking care of you and cooling your head.  Will you see\r\nfather? Sissy said I was to tell him when you woke.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a beaming face you have, Jane!\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, as her young\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x94timidly still\xe2\x80\x94bent down to kiss her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have I?  I am very glad you think so.  I am sure it must be Sissy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe arm Louisa had begun to twine around her neck, unbent itself.  \xe2\x80\x98You\r\ncan tell father if you will.\xe2\x80\x99  Then, staying her for a moment, she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was you who made my room so cheerful, and gave it this look of\r\nwelcome?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh no, Louisa, it was done before I came.  It was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa turned upon her pillow, and heard no more.  When her sister had\r\nwithdrawn, she turned her head back again, and lay with her face towards\r\nthe door, until it opened and her father entered.\r\n\r\nHe had a jaded anxious look upon him, and his hand, usually steady,\r\ntrembled in hers.  He sat down at the side of the bed, tenderly asking\r\nhow she was, and dwelling on the necessity of her keeping very quiet\r\nafter her agitation and exposure to the weather last night.  He spoke in\r\na subdued and troubled voice, very different from his usual dictatorial\r\nmanner; and was often at a loss for words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Louisa.  My poor daughter.\xe2\x80\x99  He was so much at a loss at that\r\nplace, that he stopped altogether.  He tried again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My unfortunate child.\xe2\x80\x99  The place was so difficult to get over, that he\r\ntried again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be hopeless for me, Louisa, to endeavour to tell you how\r\noverwhelmed I have been, and still am, by what broke upon me last night.\r\nThe ground on which I stand has ceased to be solid under my feet.  The\r\nonly support on which I leaned, and the strength of which it seemed, and\r\nstill does seem, impossible to question, has given way in an instant.  I\r\nam stunned by these discoveries.  I have no selfish meaning in what I\r\nsay; but I find the shock of what broke upon me last night, to be very\r\nheavy indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe could give him no comfort herein.  She had suffered the wreck of her\r\nwhole life upon the rock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not say, Louisa, that if you had by any happy chance undeceived\r\nme some time ago, it would have been better for us both; better for your\r\npeace, and better for mine.  For I am sensible that it may not have been\r\na part of my system to invite any confidence of that kind.  I had proved\r\nmy\xe2\x80\x94my system to myself, and I have rigidly administered it; and I must\r\nbear the responsibility of its failures.  I only entreat you to believe,\r\nmy favourite child, that I have meant to do right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said it earnestly, and to do him justice he had.  In gauging\r\nfathomless deeps with his little mean excise-rod, and in staggering over\r\nthe universe with his rusty stiff-legged compasses, he had meant to do\r\ngreat things.  Within the limits of his short tether he had tumbled\r\nabout, annihilating the flowers of existence with greater singleness of\r\npurpose than many of the blatant personages whose company he kept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am well assured of what you say, father.  I know I have been your\r\nfavourite child.  I know you have intended to make me happy.  I have\r\nnever blamed you, and I never shall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took her outstretched hand, and retained it in his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, I have remained all night at my table, pondering again and\r\nagain on what has so painfully passed between us.  When I consider your\r\ncharacter; when I consider that what has been known to me for hours, has\r\nbeen concealed by you for years; when I consider under what immediate\r\npressure it has been forced from you at last; I come to the conclusion\r\nthat I cannot but mistrust myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe might have added more than all, when he saw the face now looking at\r\nhim.  He did add it in effect, perhaps, as he softly moved her scattered\r\nhair from her forehead with his hand.  Such little actions, slight in\r\nanother man, were very noticeable in him; and his daughter received them\r\nas if they had been words of contrition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, slowly, and with hesitation, as well as with a\r\nwretched sense of happiness, \xe2\x80\x98if I see reason to mistrust myself for the\r\npast, Louisa, I should also mistrust myself for the present and the\r\nfuture.  To speak unreservedly to you, I do.  I am far from feeling\r\nconvinced now, however differently I might have felt only this time\r\nyesterday, that I am fit for the trust you repose in me; that I know how\r\nto respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me; that I have\r\nthe right instinct\xe2\x80\x94supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that\r\nnature\xe2\x80\x94how to help you, and to set you right, my child.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had turned upon her pillow, and lay with her face upon her arm, so\r\nthat he could not see it.  All her wildness and passion had subsided;\r\nbut, though softened, she was not in tears.  Her father was changed in\r\nnothing so much as in the respect that he would have been glad to see her\r\nin tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some persons hold,\xe2\x80\x99 he pursued, still hesitating, \xe2\x80\x98that there is a\r\nwisdom of the Head, and that there is a wisdom of the Heart.  I have not\r\nsupposed so; but, as I have said, I mistrust myself now.  I have supposed\r\nthe head to be all-sufficient.  It may not be all-sufficient; how can I\r\nventure this morning to say it is!  If that other kind of wisdom should\r\nbe what I have neglected, and should be the instinct that is wanted,\r\nLouisa\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe suggested it very doubtfully, as if he were half unwilling to admit it\r\neven now.  She made him no answer, lying before him on her bed, still\r\nhalf-dressed, much as he had seen her lying on the floor of his room last\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Louisa,\xe2\x80\x99 and his hand rested on her hair again, \xe2\x80\x98I have been absent from\r\nhere, my dear, a good deal of late; and though your sister\xe2\x80\x99s training has\r\nbeen pursued according to\xe2\x80\x94the system,\xe2\x80\x99 he appeared to come to that word\r\nwith great reluctance always, \xe2\x80\x98it has necessarily been modified by daily\r\nassociations begun, in her case, at an early age.  I ask you\xe2\x80\x94ignorantly\r\nand humbly, my daughter\xe2\x80\x94for the better, do you think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied, without stirring, \xe2\x80\x98if any harmony has been\r\nawakened in her young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to\r\ndiscord, let her thank Heaven for it, and go upon her happier way, taking\r\nit as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O my child, my child!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in a forlorn manner, \xe2\x80\x98I am an unhappy\r\nman to see you thus!  What avails it to me that you do not reproach me,\r\nif I so bitterly reproach myself!\xe2\x80\x99  He bent his head, and spoke low to\r\nher.  \xe2\x80\x98Louisa, I have a misgiving that some change may have been slowly\r\nworking about me in this house, by mere love and gratitude: that what the\r\nHead had left undone and could not do, the Heart may have been doing\r\nsilently.  Can it be so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe made him no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not too proud to believe it, Louisa.  How could I be arrogant, and\r\nyou before me!  Can it be so?  Is it so, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99  He looked upon her\r\nonce more, lying cast away there; and without another word went out of\r\nthe room.  He had not been long gone, when she heard a light tread near\r\nthe door, and knew that some one stood beside her.\r\n\r\nShe did not raise her head.  A dull anger that she should be seen in her\r\ndistress, and that the involuntary look she had so resented should come\r\nto this fulfilment, smouldered within her like an unwholesome fire.  All\r\nclosely imprisoned forces rend and destroy.  The air that would be\r\nhealthful to the earth, the water that would enrich it, the heat that\r\nwould ripen it, tear it when caged up.  So in her bosom even now; the\r\nstrongest qualities she possessed, long turned upon themselves, became a\r\nheap of obduracy, that rose against a friend.\r\n\r\nIt was well that soft touch came upon her neck, and that she understood\r\nherself to be supposed to have fallen asleep.  The sympathetic hand did\r\nnot claim her resentment.  Let it lie there, let it lie.\r\n\r\nIt lay there, warming into life a crowd of gentler thoughts; and she\r\nrested.  As she softened with the quiet, and the consciousness of being\r\nso watched, some tears made their way into her eyes.  The face touched\r\nhers, and she knew that there were tears upon it too, and she the cause\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nAs Louisa feigned to rouse herself, and sat up, Sissy retired, so that\r\nshe stood placidly near the bedside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope I have not disturbed you.  I have come to ask if you would let me\r\nstay with you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why should you stay with me?  My sister will miss you.  You are\r\neverything to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Sissy, shaking her head.  \xe2\x80\x98I would be something to you,\r\nif I might.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, almost sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whatever you want most, if I could be that.  At all events, I would like\r\nto try to be as near it as I can.  And however far off that may be, I\r\nwill never tire of trying.  Will you let me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My father sent you to ask me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sissy.  \xe2\x80\x98He told me that I might come in now, but he\r\nsent me away from the room this morning\xe2\x80\x94or at least\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe hesitated and stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At least, what?\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, with her searching eyes upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought it best myself that I should be sent away, for I felt very\r\nuncertain whether you would like to find me here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have I always hated you so much?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not, for I have always loved you, and have always wished that you\r\nshould know it.  But you changed to me a little, shortly before you left\r\nhome.  Not that I wondered at it.  You knew so much, and I knew so\r\nlittle, and it was so natural in many ways, going as you were among other\r\nfriends, that I had nothing to complain of, and was not at all hurt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer colour rose as she said it modestly and hurriedly.  Louisa understood\r\nthe loving pretence, and her heart smote her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I try?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sissy, emboldened to raise her hand to the neck that\r\nwas insensibly drooping towards her.\r\n\r\nLouisa, taking down the hand that would have embraced her in another\r\nmoment, held it in one of hers, and answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98First, Sissy, do you know what I am?  I am so proud and so hardened, so\r\nconfused and troubled, so resentful and unjust to every one and to\r\nmyself, that everything is stormy, dark, and wicked to me.  Does not that\r\nrepel you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am so unhappy, and all that should have made me otherwise is so laid\r\nwaste, that if I had been bereft of sense to this hour, and instead of\r\nbeing as learned as you think me, had to begin to acquire the simplest\r\ntruths, I could not want a guide to peace, contentment, honour, all the\r\ngood of which I am quite devoid, more abjectly than I do.  Does not that\r\nrepel you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the innocence of her brave affection, and the brimming up of her old\r\ndevoted spirit, the once deserted girl shone like a beautiful light upon\r\nthe darkness of the other.\r\n\r\nLouisa raised the hand that it might clasp her neck and join its fellow\r\nthere.  She fell upon her knees, and clinging to this stroller\xe2\x80\x99s child\r\nlooked up at her almost with veneration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Forgive me, pity me, help me!  Have compassion on my great need, and let\r\nme lay this head of mine upon a loving heart!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O lay it here!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Sissy.  \xe2\x80\x98Lay it here, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nVERY RIDICULOUS\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. JAMES HARTHOUSE passed a whole night and a day in a state of so much\r\nhurry, that the World, with its best glass in his eye, would scarcely\r\nhave recognized him during that insane interval, as the brother Jem of\r\nthe honourable and jocular member.  He was positively agitated.  He\r\nseveral times spoke with an emphasis, similar to the vulgar manner.  He\r\nwent in and went out in an unaccountable way, like a man without an\r\nobject.  He rode like a highwayman.  In a word, he was so horribly bored\r\nby existing circumstances, that he forgot to go in for boredom in the\r\nmanner prescribed by the authorities.\r\n\r\nAfter putting his horse at Coketown through the storm, as if it were a\r\nleap, he waited up all night: from time to time ringing his bell with the\r\ngreatest fury, charging the porter who kept watch with delinquency in\r\nwithholding letters or messages that could not fail to have been\r\nentrusted to him, and demanding restitution on the spot.  The dawn\r\ncoming, the morning coming, and the day coming, and neither message nor\r\nletter coming with either, he went down to the country house.  There, the\r\nreport was, Mr. Bounderby away, and Mrs. Bounderby in town.  Left for\r\ntown suddenly last evening.  Not even known to be gone until receipt of\r\nmessage, importing that her return was not to be expected for the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances he had nothing for it but to follow her to town.\r\nHe went to the house in town.  Mrs. Bounderby not there.  He looked in at\r\nthe Bank.  Mr. Bounderby away and Mrs. Sparsit away.  Mrs. Sparsit away?\r\nWho could have been reduced to sudden extremity for the company of that\r\ngriffin!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, who had his own reasons for being uneasy\r\nabout it.  \xe2\x80\x98She was off somewhere at daybreak this morning.  She\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nfull of mystery; I hate her.  So I do that white chap; he\xe2\x80\x99s always got\r\nhis blinking eyes upon a fellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where were you last night, Tom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where was I last night!\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Come!  I like that.  I was waiting\r\nfor you, Mr. Harthouse, till it came down as _I_ never saw it come down\r\nbefore.  Where was I too!  Where were you, you mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was prevented from coming\xe2\x80\x94detained.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Detained!\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Tom.  \xe2\x80\x98Two of us were detained.  I was detained\r\nlooking for you, till I lost every train but the mail.  It would have\r\nbeen a pleasant job to go down by that on such a night, and have to walk\r\nhome through a pond.  I was obliged to sleep in town after all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?  Why, in my own bed at Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you see your sister?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How the deuce,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Tom, staring, \xe2\x80\x98could I see my sister when she\r\nwas fifteen miles off?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCursing these quick retorts of the young gentleman to whom he was so true\r\na friend, Mr. Harthouse disembarrassed himself of that interview with the\r\nsmallest conceivable amount of ceremony, and debated for the hundredth\r\ntime what all this could mean?  He made only one thing clear.  It was,\r\nthat whether she was in town or out of town, whether he had been\r\npremature with her who was so hard to comprehend, or she had lost\r\ncourage, or they were discovered, or some mischance or mistake, at\r\npresent incomprehensible, had occurred, he must remain to confront his\r\nfortune, whatever it was.  The hotel where he was known to live when\r\ncondemned to that region of blackness, was the stake to which he was\r\ntied.  As to all the rest\xe2\x80\x94What will be, will be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So, whether I am waiting for a hostile message, or an assignation, or a\r\npenitent remonstrance, or an impromptu wrestle with my friend Bounderby\r\nin the Lancashire manner\xe2\x80\x94which would seem as likely as anything else in\r\nthe present state of affairs\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll dine,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. James Harthouse.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bounderby has the advantage in point of weight; and if anything of a\r\nBritish nature is to come off between us, it may be as well to be in\r\ntraining.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherefore he rang the bell, and tossing himself negligently on a sofa,\r\nordered \xe2\x80\x98Some dinner at six\xe2\x80\x94with a beefsteak in it,\xe2\x80\x99 and got through the\r\nintervening time as well as he could.  That was not particularly well;\r\nfor he remained in the greatest perplexity, and, as the hours went on,\r\nand no kind of explanation offered itself, his perplexity augmented at\r\ncompound interest.\r\n\r\nHowever, he took affairs as coolly as it was in human nature to do, and\r\nentertained himself with the facetious idea of the training more than\r\nonce.  \xe2\x80\x98It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bad,\xe2\x80\x99 he yawned at one time, \xe2\x80\x98to give the waiter\r\nfive shillings, and throw him.\xe2\x80\x99  At another time it occurred to him, \xe2\x80\x98Or\r\na fellow of about thirteen or fourteen stone might be hired by the hour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut these jests did not tell materially on the afternoon, or his\r\nsuspense; and, sooth to say, they both lagged fearfully.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible, even before dinner, to avoid often walking about in\r\nthe pattern of the carpet, looking out of the window, listening at the\r\ndoor for footsteps, and occasionally becoming rather hot when any steps\r\napproached that room.  But, after dinner, when the day turned to\r\ntwilight, and the twilight turned to night, and still no communication\r\nwas made to him, it began to be as he expressed it, \xe2\x80\x98like the Holy Office\r\nand slow torture.\xe2\x80\x99  However, still true to his conviction that\r\nindifference was the genuine high-breeding (the only conviction he had),\r\nhe seized this crisis as the opportunity for ordering candles and a\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\nHe had been trying in vain, for half an hour, to read this newspaper,\r\nwhen the waiter appeared and said, at once mysteriously and\r\napologetically:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, sir.  You\xe2\x80\x99re wanted, sir, if you please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA general recollection that this was the kind of thing the Police said to\r\nthe swell mob, caused Mr. Harthouse to ask the waiter in return, with\r\nbristling indignation, what the Devil he meant by \xe2\x80\x98wanted\xe2\x80\x99?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, sir.  Young lady outside, sir, wishes to see you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Outside?  Where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Outside this door, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGiving the waiter to the personage before mentioned, as a block-head duly\r\nqualified for that consignment, Mr. Harthouse hurried into the gallery.\r\nA young woman whom he had never seen stood there.  Plainly dressed, very\r\nquiet, very pretty.  As he conducted her into the room and placed a chair\r\nfor her, he observed, by the light of the candles, that she was even\r\nprettier than he had at first believed.  Her face was innocent and\r\nyouthful, and its expression remarkably pleasant.  She was not afraid of\r\nhim, or in any way disconcerted; she seemed to have her mind entirely\r\npreoccupied with the occasion of her visit, and to have substituted that\r\nconsideration for herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I speak to Mr. Harthouse?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, when they were alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To Mr. Harthouse.\xe2\x80\x99  He added in his mind, \xe2\x80\x98And you speak to him with the\r\nmost confiding eyes I ever saw, and the most earnest voice (though so\r\nquiet) I ever heard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I do not understand\xe2\x80\x94and I do not, sir\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94said Sissy, \xe2\x80\x98what your honour\r\nas a gentleman binds you to, in other matters:\xe2\x80\x99 the blood really rose in\r\nhis face as she began in these words: \xe2\x80\x98I am sure I may rely upon it to\r\nkeep my visit secret, and to keep secret what I am going to say.  I will\r\nrely upon it, if you will tell me I may so far trust\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am young, as you see; I am alone, as you see.  In coming to you, sir,\r\nI have no advice or encouragement beyond my own hope.\xe2\x80\x99  He thought, \xe2\x80\x98But\r\nthat is very strong,\xe2\x80\x99 as he followed the momentary upward glance of her\r\neyes.  He thought besides, \xe2\x80\x98This is a very odd beginning.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nwhere we are going.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sissy, \xe2\x80\x98you have already guessed whom I left just now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last\r\nfour-and-twenty hours (which have appeared as many years),\xe2\x80\x99 he returned,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98on a lady\xe2\x80\x99s account.  The hopes I have been encouraged to form that you\r\ncome from that lady, do not deceive me, I trust.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I left her within an hour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At her father\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Harthouse\xe2\x80\x99s face lengthened in spite of his coolness, and his\r\nperplexity increased.  \xe2\x80\x98Then I certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 he thought, \xe2\x80\x98do _not_ see\r\nwhere we are going.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She hurried there last night.  She arrived there in great agitation, and\r\nwas insensible all through the night.  I live at her father\xe2\x80\x99s, and was\r\nwith her.  You may be sure, sir, you will never see her again as long as\r\nyou live.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Harthouse drew a long breath; and, if ever man found himself in the\r\nposition of not knowing what to say, made the discovery beyond all\r\nquestion that he was so circumstanced.  The child-like ingenuousness with\r\nwhich his visitor spoke, her modest fearlessness, her truthfulness which\r\nput all artifice aside, her entire forgetfulness of herself in her\r\nearnest quiet holding to the object with which she had come; all this,\r\ntogether with her reliance on his easily given promise\xe2\x80\x94which in itself\r\nshamed him\xe2\x80\x94presented something in which he was so inexperienced, and\r\nagainst which he knew any of his usual weapons would fall so powerless;\r\nthat not a word could he rally to his relief.\r\n\r\nAt last he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So startling an announcement, so confidently made, and by such lips, is\r\nreally disconcerting in the last degree.  May I be permitted to inquire,\r\nif you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless\r\nwords, by the lady of whom we speak?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no charge from her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The drowning man catches at the straw.  With no disrespect for your\r\njudgment, and with no doubt of your sincerity, excuse my saying that I\r\ncling to the belief that there is yet hope that I am not condemned to\r\nperpetual exile from that lady\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is not the least hope.  The first object of my coming here, sir,\r\nis to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your\r\never speaking with her again, than there would be if she had died when\r\nshe came home last night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Must believe?  But if I can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94or if I should, by infirmity of nature, be\r\nobstinate\xe2\x80\x94and won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is still true.  There is no hope.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJames Harthouse looked at her with an incredulous smile upon his lips;\r\nbut her mind looked over and beyond him, and the smile was quite thrown\r\naway.\r\n\r\nHe bit his lip, and took a little time for consideration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!  If it should unhappily appear,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98after due pains and\r\nduty on my part, that I am brought to a position so desolate as this\r\nbanishment, I shall not become the lady\xe2\x80\x99s persecutor.  But you said you\r\nhad no commission from her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have only the commission of my love for her, and her love for me.  I\r\nhave no other trust, than that I have been with her since she came home,\r\nand that she has given me her confidence.  I have no further trust, than\r\nthat I know something of her character and her marriage.  O Mr.\r\nHarthouse, I think you had that trust too!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was touched in the cavity where his heart should have been\xe2\x80\x94in that\r\nnest of addled eggs, where the birds of heaven would have lived if they\r\nhad not been whistled away\xe2\x80\x94by the fervour of this reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not a moral sort of fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and I never make any\r\npretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow.  I am as immoral\r\nas need be.  At the same time, in bringing any distress upon the lady who\r\nis the subject of the present conversation, or in unfortunately\r\ncompromising her in any way, or in committing myself by any expression of\r\nsentiments towards her, not perfectly reconcilable with\xe2\x80\x94in fact with\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndomestic hearth; or in taking any advantage of her father\xe2\x80\x99s being a\r\nmachine, or of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s being a whelp, or of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s being a\r\nbear; I beg to be allowed to assure you that I have had no particularly\r\nevil intentions, but have glided on from one step to another with a\r\nsmoothness so perfectly diabolical, that I had not the slightest idea the\r\ncatalogue was half so long until I began to turn it over.  Whereas I\r\nfind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. James Harthouse, in conclusion, \xe2\x80\x98that it is really in\r\nseveral volumes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThough he said all this in his frivolous way, the way seemed, for that\r\nonce, a conscious polishing of but an ugly surface.  He was silent for a\r\nmoment; and then proceeded with a more self-possessed air, though with\r\ntraces of vexation and disappointment that would not be polished out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After what has been just now represented to me, in a manner I find it\r\nimpossible to doubt\xe2\x80\x94I know of hardly any other source from which I could\r\nhave accepted it so readily\xe2\x80\x94I feel bound to say to you, in whom the\r\nconfidence you have mentioned has been reposed, that I cannot refuse to\r\ncontemplate the possibility (however unexpected) of my seeing the lady no\r\nmore.  I am solely to blame for the thing having come to this\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94and, I\r\ncannot say,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, rather hard up for a general peroration, \xe2\x80\x98that I\r\nhave any sanguine expectation of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow, or\r\nthat I have any belief in any moral sort of fellow whatever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSissy\xe2\x80\x99s face sufficiently showed that her appeal to him was not finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You spoke,\xe2\x80\x99 he resumed, as she raised her eyes to him again, \xe2\x80\x98of your\r\nfirst object.  I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you oblige me by confiding it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Harthouse,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Sissy, with a blending of gentleness and\r\nsteadiness that quite defeated him, and with a simple confidence in his\r\nbeing bound to do what she required, that held him at a singular\r\ndisadvantage, \xe2\x80\x98the only reparation that remains with you, is to leave\r\nhere immediately and finally.  I am quite sure that you can mitigate in\r\nno other way the wrong and harm you have done.  I am quite sure that it\r\nis the only compensation you have left it in your power to make.  I do\r\nnot say that it is much, or that it is enough; but it is something, and\r\nit is necessary.  Therefore, though without any other authority than I\r\nhave given you, and even without the knowledge of any other person than\r\nyourself and myself, I ask you to depart from this place to-night, under\r\nan obligation never to return to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf she had asserted any influence over him beyond her plain faith in the\r\ntruth and right of what she said; if she had concealed the least doubt or\r\nirresolution, or had harboured for the best purpose any reserve or\r\npretence; if she had shown, or felt, the lightest trace of any\r\nsensitiveness to his ridicule or his astonishment, or any remonstrance he\r\nmight offer; he would have carried it against her at this point.  But he\r\ncould as easily have changed a clear sky by looking at it in surprise, as\r\naffect her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But do you know,\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, quite at a loss, \xe2\x80\x98the extent of what you\r\nask?  You probably are not aware that I am here on a public kind of\r\nbusiness, preposterous enough in itself, but which I have gone in for,\r\nand sworn by, and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate\r\nmanner?  You probably are not aware of that, but I assure you it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nfact.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt had no effect on Sissy, fact or no fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Besides which,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Harthouse, taking a turn or two across the\r\nroom, dubiously, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s so alarmingly absurd.  It would make a man so\r\nridiculous, after going in for these fellows, to back out in such an\r\nincomprehensible way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am quite sure,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Sissy, \xe2\x80\x98that it is the only reparation in\r\nyour power, sir.  I am quite sure, or I would not have come here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her face, and walked about again.  \xe2\x80\x98Upon my soul, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what to say.  So immensely absurd!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt fell to his lot, now, to stipulate for secrecy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I were to do such a very ridiculous thing,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, stopping again\r\npresently, and leaning against the chimney-piece, \xe2\x80\x98it could only be in\r\nthe most inviolable confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will trust to you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Sissy, \xe2\x80\x98and you will trust to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis leaning against the chimney-piece reminded him of the night with the\r\nwhelp.  It was the self-same chimney-piece, and somehow he felt as if\r\n_he_ were the whelp to-night.  He could make no way at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid, after looking down, and looking up, and laughing, and frowning, and\r\nwalking off, and walking back again.  \xe2\x80\x98But I see no way out of it.  What\r\nwill be, will be.  _This_ will be, I suppose.  I must take off myself, I\r\nimagine\xe2\x80\x94in short, I engage to do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSissy rose.  She was not surprised by the result, but she was happy in\r\nit, and her face beamed brightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will permit me to say,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. James Harthouse, \xe2\x80\x98that I doubt\r\nif any other ambassador, or ambassadress, could have addressed me with\r\nthe same success.  I must not only regard myself as being in a very\r\nridiculous position, but as being vanquished at all points.  Will you\r\nallow me the privilege of remembering my enemy\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_My_ name?\xe2\x80\x99 said the ambassadress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The only name I could possibly care to know, to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sissy Jupe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon my curiosity at parting.  Related to the family?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am only a poor girl,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Sissy.  \xe2\x80\x98I was separated from my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x94he was only a stroller\xe2\x80\x94and taken pity on by Mr. Gradgrind.  I have\r\nlived in the house ever since.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It wanted this to complete the defeat,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. James Harthouse,\r\nsinking, with a resigned air, on the sofa, after standing transfixed a\r\nlittle while.  \xe2\x80\x98The defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished.\r\nOnly a poor girl\xe2\x80\x94only a stroller\xe2\x80\x94only James Harthouse made nothing\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94only James Harthouse a Great Pyramid of failure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Great Pyramid put it into his head to go up the Nile.  He took a pen\r\nupon the instant, and wrote the following note (in appropriate\r\nhieroglyphics) to his brother:\r\n\r\n    Dear Jack,\xe2\x80\x94All up at Coketown.  Bored out of the place, and going in\r\n    for camels.\r\n\r\n                                                           Affectionately,\r\n                                                                      JEM.\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Send my fellow here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gone to bed, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell him to get up, and pack up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe wrote two more notes.  One, to Mr. Bounderby, announcing his\r\nretirement from that part of the country, and showing where he would be\r\nfound for the next fortnight.  The other, similar in effect, to Mr.\r\nGradgrind.  Almost as soon as the ink was dry upon their superscriptions,\r\nhe had left the tall chimneys of Coketown behind, and was in a railway\r\ncarriage, tearing and glaring over the dark landscape.\r\n\r\nThe moral sort of fellows might suppose that Mr. James Harthouse derived\r\nsome comfortable reflections afterwards, from this prompt retreat, as one\r\nof his few actions that made any amends for anything, and as a token to\r\nhimself that he had escaped the climax of a very bad business.  But it\r\nwas not so, at all.  A secret sense of having failed and been\r\nridiculous\xe2\x80\x94a dread of what other fellows who went in for similar sorts of\r\nthings, would say at his expense if they knew it\xe2\x80\x94so oppressed him, that\r\nwhat was about the very best passage in his life was the one of all\r\nothers he would not have owned to on any account, and the only one that\r\nmade him ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nVERY DECIDED\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE indefatigable Mrs. Sparsit, with a violent cold upon her, her voice\r\nreduced to a whisper, and her stately frame so racked by continual\r\nsneezes that it seemed in danger of dismemberment, gave chase to her\r\npatron until she found him in the metropolis; and there, majestically\r\nsweeping in upon him at his hotel in St. James\xe2\x80\x99s Street, exploded the\r\ncombustibles with which she was charged, and blew up.  Having executed\r\nher mission with infinite relish, this high-minded woman then fainted\r\naway on Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s coat-collar.\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off, and leave\r\nher to progress as she might through various stages of suffering on the\r\nfloor.  He next had recourse to the administration of potent\r\nrestoratives, such as screwing the patient\xe2\x80\x99s thumbs, smiting her hands,\r\nabundantly watering her face, and inserting salt in her mouth.  When\r\nthese attentions had recovered her (which they speedily did), he hustled\r\nher into a fast train without offering any other refreshment, and carried\r\nher back to Coketown more dead than alive.\r\n\r\nRegarded as a classical ruin, Mrs. Sparsit was an interesting spectacle\r\non her arrival at her journey\xe2\x80\x99s end; but considered in any other light,\r\nthe amount of damage she had by that time sustained was excessive, and\r\nimpaired her claims to admiration.  Utterly heedless of the wear and tear\r\nof her clothes and constitution, and adamant to her pathetic sneezes, Mr.\r\nBounderby immediately crammed her into a coach, and bore her off to Stone\r\nLodge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Tom Gradgrind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, bursting into his father-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom late at night; \xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99s a lady here\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x94you know Mrs.\r\nSparsit\xe2\x80\x94who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have missed my letter!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Gradgrind, surprised by the\r\napparition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Missed your letter, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 bawled Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98The present time is no\r\ntime for letters.  No man shall talk to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown\r\nabout letters, with his mind in the state it\xe2\x80\x99s in now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, in a tone of temperate remonstrance, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nspeak of a very special letter I have written to you, in reference to\r\nLouisa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom Gradgrind,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bounderby, knocking the flat of his hand several\r\ntimes with great vehemence on the table, \xe2\x80\x98I speak of a very special\r\nmessenger that has come to me, in reference to Louisa.  Mrs. Sparsit,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, stand forward!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat unfortunate lady hereupon essaying to offer testimony, without any\r\nvoice and with painful gestures expressive of an inflamed throat, became\r\nso aggravating and underwent so many facial contortions, that Mr.\r\nBounderby, unable to bear it, seized her by the arm and shook her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you can\xe2\x80\x99t get it out, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98leave _me_ to get it\r\nout.  This is not a time for a lady, however highly connected, to be\r\ntotally inaudible, and seemingly swallowing marbles.  Tom Gradgrind, Mrs.\r\nSparsit latterly found herself, by accident, in a situation to overhear a\r\nconversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious\r\ngentleman-friend, Mr. James Harthouse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!  Indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98And in that conversation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not necessary to repeat its tenor, Bounderby.  I know what\r\npassed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do?  Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, staring with all his might at his so\r\nquiet and assuasive father-in-law, \xe2\x80\x98you know where your daughter is at\r\nthe present time!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Undoubtedly.  She is here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Bounderby, let me beg you to restrain these loud out-breaks, on\r\nall accounts.  Louisa is here.  The moment she could detach herself from\r\nthat interview with the person of whom you speak, and whom I deeply\r\nregret to have been the means of introducing to you, Louisa hurried here,\r\nfor protection.  I myself had not been at home many hours, when I\r\nreceived her\xe2\x80\x94here, in this room.  She hurried by the train to town, she\r\nran from town to this house, through a raging storm, and presented\r\nherself before me in a state of distraction.  Of course, she has remained\r\nhere ever since.  Let me entreat you, for your own sake and for hers, to\r\nbe more quiet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby silently gazed about him for some moments, in every\r\ndirection except Mrs. Sparsit\xe2\x80\x99s direction; and then, abruptly turning\r\nupon the niece of Lady Scadgers, said to that wretched woman:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!  We shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think\r\nproper to offer, for going about the country at express pace, with no\r\nother luggage than a Cock-and-a-Bull, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98my nerves are at present too much shaken,\r\nand my health is at present too much impaired, in your service, to admit\r\nof my doing more than taking refuge in tears.\xe2\x80\x99  (Which she did.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98without making any observation to you\r\nthat may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family, what I\r\nhave got to add to that, is that there is something else in which it\r\nappears to me you may take refuge, namely, a coach.  And the coach in\r\nwhich we came here being at the door, you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me to hand you down to\r\nit, and pack you home to the Bank: where the best course for you to\r\npursue, will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear, and\r\ntake a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed.\xe2\x80\x99  With\r\nthese words, Mr. Bounderby extended his right hand to the weeping lady,\r\nand escorted her to the conveyance in question, shedding many plaintive\r\nsneezes by the way.  He soon returned alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, as you showed me in your face, Tom Gradgrind, that you wanted to\r\nspeak to me,\xe2\x80\x99 he resumed, \xe2\x80\x98here I am.  But, I am not in a very agreeable\r\nstate, I tell you plainly: not relishing this business, even as it is,\r\nand not considering that I am at any time as dutifully and submissively\r\ntreated by your daughter, as Josiah Bounderby of Coketown ought to be\r\ntreated by his wife.  You have your opinion, I dare say; and I have mine,\r\nI know.  If you mean to say anything to me to-night, that goes against\r\nthis candid remark, you had better let it alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind, it will be observed, being much softened, Mr. Bounderby\r\ntook particular pains to harden himself at all points.  It was his\r\namiable nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Gradgrind began in reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be too\r\ndear.  That, to start with.  When I begin to be dear to a man, I\r\ngenerally find that his intention is to come over me.  I am not speaking\r\nto you politely; but, as you are aware, I am _not_ polite.  If you like\r\npoliteness, you know where to get it.  You have your gentleman-friends,\r\nyou know, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll serve you with as much of the article as you want.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t keep it myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98we are all liable to mistakes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps I thought so.  But, I say we are all liable to mistakes and I\r\nshould feel sensible of your delicacy, and grateful for it, if you would\r\nspare me these references to Harthouse.  I shall not associate him in our\r\nconversation with your intimacy and encouragement; pray do not persist in\r\nconnecting him with mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never mentioned his name!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Gradgrind, with a patient, even a submissive,\r\nair.  And he sat for a little while pondering.  \xe2\x80\x98Bounderby, I see reason\r\nto doubt whether we have ever quite understood Louisa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who do you mean by We?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me say I, then,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, in answer to the coarsely blurted\r\nquestion; \xe2\x80\x98I doubt whether I have understood Louisa.  I doubt whether I\r\nhave been quite right in the manner of her education.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There you hit it,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98There I agree with you.  You\r\nhave found it out at last, have you?  Education!  I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what\r\neducation is\xe2\x80\x94To be tumbled out of doors, neck and crop, and put upon the\r\nshortest allowance of everything except blows.  That\xe2\x80\x99s what _I_ call\r\neducation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think your good sense will perceive,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Gradgrind remonstrated in\r\nall humility, \xe2\x80\x98that whatever the merits of such a system may be, it would\r\nbe difficult of general application to girls.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it at all, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the obstinate Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 sighed Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98we will not enter into the question.  I\r\nassure you I have no desire to be controversial.  I seek to repair what\r\nis amiss, if I possibly can; and I hope you will assist me in a good\r\nspirit, Bounderby, for I have been very much distressed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, yet,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, with determined obstinacy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and therefore I won\xe2\x80\x99t make any promises.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the course of a few hours, my dear Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Gradgrind\r\nproceeded, in the same depressed and propitiatory manner, \xe2\x80\x98I appear to\r\nmyself to have become better informed as to Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s character, than in\r\nprevious years.  The enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me, and\r\nthe discovery is not mine.  I think there are\xe2\x80\x94Bounderby, you will be\r\nsurprised to hear me say this\xe2\x80\x94I think there are qualities in Louisa,\r\nwhich\xe2\x80\x94which have been harshly neglected, and\xe2\x80\x94and a little perverted.\r\nAnd\xe2\x80\x94and I would suggest to you, that\xe2\x80\x94that if you would kindly meet me in\r\na timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while\xe2\x80\x94and to\r\nencourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwould be the better for the happiness of all of us.  Louisa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nGradgrind, shading his face with his hand, \xe2\x80\x98has always been my favourite\r\nchild.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe blustrous Bounderby crimsoned and swelled to such an extent on\r\nhearing these words, that he seemed to be, and probably was, on the brink\r\nof a fit.  With his very ears a bright purple shot with crimson, he pent\r\nup his indignation, however, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d like to keep her here for a time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x94I had intended to recommend, my dear Bounderby, that you should allow\r\nLouisa to remain here on a visit, and be attended by Sissy (I mean of\r\ncourse Cecilia Jupe), who understands her, and in whom she trusts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I gather from all this, Tom Gradgrind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, standing up with\r\nhis hands in his pockets, \xe2\x80\x98that you are of opinion that there\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\npeople call some incompatibility between Loo Bounderby and myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fear there is at present a general incompatibility between Louisa,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94and almost all the relations in which I have placed her,\xe2\x80\x99 was her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s sorrowful reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, look you here, Tom Gradgrind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby the flushed,\r\nconfronting him with his legs wide apart, his hands deeper in his\r\npockets, and his hair like a hayfield wherein his windy anger was\r\nboisterous.  \xe2\x80\x98You have said your say; I am going to say mine.  I am a\r\nCoketown man.  I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  I know the bricks of\r\nthis town, and I know the works of this town, and I know the chimneys of\r\nthis town, and I know the smoke of this town, and I know the Hands of\r\nthis town.  I know \xe2\x80\x99em all pretty well.  They\xe2\x80\x99re real.  When a man tells\r\nme anything about imaginative qualities, I always tell that man, whoever\r\nhe is, that I know what he means.  He means turtle soup and venison, with\r\na gold spoon, and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what your daughter wants.  Since you are of opinion that she ought\r\nto have what she wants, I recommend you to provide it for her.  Because,\r\nTom Gradgrind, she will never have it from me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98I hoped, after my entreaty, you would\r\nhave taken a different tone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just wait a bit,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Bounderby; \xe2\x80\x98you have said your say, I\r\nbelieve.  I heard you out; hear me out, if you please.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nyourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency, because,\r\nalthough I am sorry to see Tom Gradgrind reduced to his present position,\r\nI should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that.  Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan incompatibility of some sort or another, I am given to understand by\r\nyou, between your daughter and me.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll give _you_ to understand, in\r\nreply to that, that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the\r\nfirst magnitude\xe2\x80\x94to be summed up in this\xe2\x80\x94that your daughter don\xe2\x80\x99t properly\r\nknow her husband\xe2\x80\x99s merits, and is not impressed with such a sense as\r\nwould become her, by George! of the honour of his alliance.  That\xe2\x80\x99s plain\r\nspeaking, I hope.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98this is unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98I am glad to hear you say so.  Because when\r\nTom Gradgrind, with his new lights, tells me that what I say is\r\nunreasonable, I am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible.  With\r\nyour permission I am going on.  You know my origin; and you know that for\r\na good many years of my life I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a shoeing-horn, in consequence\r\nof not having a shoe.  Yet you may believe or not, as you think proper,\r\nthat there are ladies\xe2\x80\x94born ladies\xe2\x80\x94belonging to families\xe2\x80\x94Families!\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nnext to worship the ground I walk on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe discharged this like a Rocket, at his father-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whereas your daughter,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98is far from being a born\r\nlady.  That you know, yourself.  Not that I care a pinch of candle-snuff\r\nabout such things, for you are very well aware I don\xe2\x80\x99t; but that such is\r\nthe fact, and you, Tom Gradgrind, can\xe2\x80\x99t change it.  Why do I say this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not, I fear,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Gradgrind, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x98to spare me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear me out,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98and refrain from cutting in till your\r\nturn comes round.  I say this, because highly connected females have been\r\nastonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself,\r\nand to witness her insensibility.  They have wondered how I have suffered\r\nit.  And I wonder myself now, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t suffer it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Gradgrind, rising, \xe2\x80\x98the less we say to-night\r\nthe better, I think.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On the contrary, Tom Gradgrind, the more we say to-night, the better, I\r\nthink.  That is,\xe2\x80\x99 the consideration checked him, \xe2\x80\x98till I have said all I\r\nmean to say, and then I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how soon we stop.  I come to a\r\nquestion that may shorten the business.  What do you mean by the proposal\r\nyou made just now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do I mean, Bounderby?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By your visiting proposition,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, with an inflexible jerk\r\nof the hayfield.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean that I hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner,\r\nfor allowing Louisa a period of repose and reflection here, which may\r\ntend to a gradual alteration for the better in many respects.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To a softening down of your ideas of the incompatibility?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nBounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you put it in those terms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What made you think of this?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have already said, I fear Louisa has not been understood.  Is it\r\nasking too much, Bounderby, that you, so far her elder, should aid in\r\ntrying to set her right?  You have accepted a great charge of her; for\r\nbetter for worse, for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby may have been annoyed by the repetition of his own words to\r\nStephen Blackpool, but he cut the quotation short with an angry start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be told about that.  I know what I took\r\nher for, as well as you do.  Never you mind what I took her for; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy look out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was merely going on to remark, Bounderby, that we may all be more or\r\nless in the wrong, not even excepting you; and that some yielding on your\r\npart, remembering the trust you have accepted, may not only be an act of\r\ntrue kindness, but perhaps a debt incurred towards Louisa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think differently,\xe2\x80\x99 blustered Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98I am going to finish this\r\nbusiness according to my own opinions.  Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make a\r\nquarrel of it with you, Tom Gradgrind.  To tell you the truth, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject.\r\nAs to your gentleman-friend, he may take himself off, wherever he likes\r\nbest.  If he falls in my way, I shall tell him my mind; if he don\xe2\x80\x99t fall\r\nin my way, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t, for it won\xe2\x80\x99t be worth my while to do it.  As to your\r\ndaughter, whom I made Loo Bounderby, and might have done better by\r\nleaving Loo Gradgrind, if she don\xe2\x80\x99t come home to-morrow, by twelve\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock at noon, I shall understand that she prefers to stay away, and I\r\nshall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\ncharge of her for the future.  What I shall say to people in general, of\r\nthe incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law, will be this.\r\nI am Josiah Bounderby, and I had my bringing-up; she\xe2\x80\x99s the daughter of\r\nTom Gradgrind, and she had her bringing-up; and the two horses wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npull together.  I am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man, I\r\nbelieve; and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a\r\nwoman rather out of the common, also, who, in the long run, would come up\r\nto my mark.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this, Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr.\r\nGradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98before you commit yourself to such a decision.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I always come to a decision,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, tossing his hat on: \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nwhatever I do, I do at once.  I should be surprised at Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naddressing such a remark to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, knowing what he\r\nknows of him, if I could be surprised by anything Tom Gradgrind did,\r\nafter his making himself a party to sentimental humbug.  I have given you\r\nmy decision, and I have got no more to say.  Good night!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Bounderby went home to his town house to bed.  At five minutes\r\npast twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock next day, he directed Mrs. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s property to be\r\ncarefully packed up and sent to Tom Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s; advertised his country\r\nretreat for sale by private contract; and resumed a bachelor life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nLOST\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE robbery at the Bank had not languished before, and did not cease to\r\noccupy a front place in the attention of the principal of that\r\nestablishment now.  In boastful proof of his promptitude and activity, as\r\na remarkable man, and a self-made man, and a commercial wonder more\r\nadmirable than Venus, who had risen out of the mud instead of the sea, he\r\nliked to show how little his domestic affairs abated his business ardour.\r\nConsequently, in the first few weeks of his resumed bachelorhood, he even\r\nadvanced upon his usual display of bustle, and every day made such a rout\r\nin renewing his investigations into the robbery, that the officers who\r\nhad it in hand almost wished it had never been committed.\r\n\r\nThey were at fault too, and off the scent.  Although they had been so\r\nquiet since the first outbreak of the matter, that most people really did\r\nsuppose it to have been abandoned as hopeless, nothing new occurred.  No\r\nimplicated man or woman took untimely courage, or made a self-betraying\r\nstep.  More remarkable yet, Stephen Blackpool could not be heard of, and\r\nthe mysterious old woman remained a mystery.\r\n\r\nThings having come to this pass, and showing no latent signs of stirring\r\nbeyond it, the upshot of Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s investigations was, that he\r\nresolved to hazard a bold burst.  He drew up a placard, offering Twenty\r\nPounds reward for the apprehension of Stephen Blackpool, suspected of\r\ncomplicity in the robbery of Coketown Bank on such a night; he described\r\nthe said Stephen Blackpool by dress, complexion, estimated height, and\r\nmanner, as minutely as he could; he recited how he had left the town, and\r\nin what direction he had been last seen going; he had the whole printed\r\nin great black letters on a staring broadsheet; and he caused the walls\r\nto be posted with it in the dead of night, so that it should strike upon\r\nthe sight of the whole population at one blow.\r\n\r\nThe factory-bells had need to ring their loudest that morning to disperse\r\nthe groups of workers who stood in the tardy daybreak, collected round\r\nthe placards, devouring them with eager eyes.  Not the least eager of the\r\neyes assembled, were the eyes of those who could not read.  These people,\r\nas they listened to the friendly voice that read aloud\xe2\x80\x94there was always\r\nsome such ready to help them\xe2\x80\x94stared at the characters which meant so much\r\nwith a vague awe and respect that would have been half ludicrous, if any\r\naspect of public ignorance could ever be otherwise than threatening and\r\nfull of evil.  Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter\r\nof these placards, among turning spindles, rattling looms, and whirling\r\nwheels, for hours afterwards; and when the Hands cleared out again into\r\nthe streets, there were still as many readers as before.\r\n\r\nSlackbridge, the delegate, had to address his audience too that night;\r\nand Slackbridge had obtained a clean bill from the printer, and had\r\nbrought it in his pocket.  Oh, my friends and fellow-countrymen, the\r\ndown-trodden operatives of Coketown, oh, my fellow-brothers and\r\nfellow-workmen and fellow-citizens and fellow-men, what a to-do was\r\nthere, when Slackbridge unfolded what he called \xe2\x80\x98that damning document,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand held it up to the gaze, and for the execration of the working-man\r\ncommunity!  \xe2\x80\x98Oh, my fellow-men, behold of what a traitor in the camp of\r\nthose great spirits who are enrolled upon the holy scroll of Justice and\r\nof Union, is appropriately capable!  Oh, my prostrate friends, with the\r\ngalling yoke of tyrants on your necks and the iron foot of despotism\r\ntreading down your fallen forms into the dust of the earth, upon which\r\nright glad would your oppressors be to see you creeping on your bellies\r\nall the days of your lives, like the serpent in the garden\xe2\x80\x94oh, my\r\nbrothers, and shall I as a man not add, my sisters too, what do you say,\r\n_now_, of Stephen Blackpool, with a slight stoop in his shoulders and\r\nabout five foot seven in height, as set forth in this degrading and\r\ndisgusting document, this blighting bill, this pernicious placard, this\r\nabominable advertisement; and with what majesty of denouncement will you\r\ncrush the viper, who would bring this stain and shame upon the God-like\r\nrace that happily has cast him out for ever!  Yes, my compatriots,\r\nhappily cast him out and sent him forth!  For you remember how he stood\r\nhere before you on this platform; you remember how, face to face and foot\r\nto foot, I pursued him through all his intricate windings; you remember\r\nhow he sneaked and slunk, and sidled, and splitted of straws, until, with\r\nnot an inch of ground to which to cling, I hurled him out from amongst\r\nus: an object for the undying finger of scorn to point at, and for the\r\navenging fire of every free and thinking mind to scorch and scar!  And\r\nnow, my friends\xe2\x80\x94my labouring friends, for I rejoice and triumph in that\r\nstigma\xe2\x80\x94my friends whose hard but honest beds are made in toil, and whose\r\nscanty but independent pots are boiled in hardship; and now, I say, my\r\nfriends, what appellation has that dastard craven taken to himself, when,\r\nwith the mask torn from his features, he stands before us in all his\r\nnative deformity, a What?  A thief!  A plunderer!  A proscribed fugitive,\r\nwith a price upon his head; a fester and a wound upon the noble character\r\nof the Coketown operative!  Therefore, my band of brothers in a sacred\r\nbond, to which your children and your children\xe2\x80\x99s children yet unborn have\r\nset their infant hands and seals, I propose to you on the part of the\r\nUnited Aggregate Tribunal, ever watchful for your welfare, ever zealous\r\nfor your benefit, that this meeting does Resolve: That Stephen Blackpool,\r\nweaver, referred to in this placard, having been already solemnly\r\ndisowned by the community of Coketown Hands, the same are free from the\r\nshame of his misdeeds, and cannot as a class be reproached with his\r\ndishonest actions!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus Slackbridge; gnashing and perspiring after a prodigious sort.  A few\r\nstern voices called out \xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 and a score or two hailed, with assenting\r\ncries of \xe2\x80\x98Hear, hear!\xe2\x80\x99 the caution from one man, \xe2\x80\x98Slackbridge, y\xe2\x80\x99or over\r\nhetter in\xe2\x80\x99t; y\xe2\x80\x99or a goen too fast!\xe2\x80\x99  But these were pigmies against an\r\narmy; the general assemblage subscribed to the gospel according to\r\nSlackbridge, and gave three cheers for him, as he sat demonstratively\r\npanting at them.\r\n\r\nThese men and women were yet in the streets, passing quietly to their\r\nhomes, when Sissy, who had been called away from Louisa some minutes\r\nbefore, returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is it?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is Mr. Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sissy, timid of the name, \xe2\x80\x98and your brother\r\nMr. Tom, and a young woman who says her name is Rachael, and that you\r\nknow her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do they want, Sissy dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They want to see you.  Rachael has been crying, and seems angry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, for he was present, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot refuse to see them,\r\nfor a reason that will explain itself.  Shall they come in here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he answered in the affirmative, Sissy went away to bring them.  She\r\nreappeared with them directly.  Tom was last; and remained standing in\r\nthe obscurest part of the room, near the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Bounderby,\xe2\x80\x99 said her husband, entering with a cool nod, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndisturb you, I hope.  This is an unseasonable hour, but here is a young\r\nwoman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary.\r\nTom Gradgrind, as your son, young Tom, refuses for some obstinate reason\r\nor other to say anything at all about those statements, good or bad, I am\r\nobliged to confront her with your daughter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have seen me once before, young lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael, standing in\r\nfront of Louisa.\r\n\r\nTom coughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have seen me, young lady,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Rachael, as she did not answer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98once before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTom coughed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRachael cast her eyes proudly towards Mr. Bounderby, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Will you\r\nmake it known, young lady, where, and who was there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I went to the house where Stephen Blackpool lodged, on the night of his\r\ndischarge from his work, and I saw you there.  He was there too; and an\r\nold woman who did not speak, and whom I could scarcely see, stood in a\r\ndark corner.  My brother was with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so, young Tom?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Bounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I promised my sister I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99  Which Louisa hastily confirmed.  \xe2\x80\x98And\r\nbesides,\xe2\x80\x99 said the whelp bitterly, \xe2\x80\x98she tells her own story so precious\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94and so full\xe2\x80\x94that what business had I to take it out of her mouth!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say, young lady, if you please,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Rachael, \xe2\x80\x98why, in an evil hour,\r\nyou ever came to Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s that night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I felt compassion for him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, her colour deepening, \xe2\x80\x98and I\r\nwished to know what he was going to do, and wished to offer him\r\nassistance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98Much flattered and obliged.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you offer him,\xe2\x80\x99 asked Rachael, \xe2\x80\x98a bank-note?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; but he refused it, and would only take two pounds in gold.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRachael cast her eyes towards Mr. Bounderby again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, certainly!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98If you put the question whether your\r\nridiculous and improbable account was true or not, I am bound to say it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfirmed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Young lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael, \xe2\x80\x98Stephen Blackpool is now named as a thief in\r\npublic print all over this town, and where else!  There have been a\r\nmeeting to-night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way.\r\nStephen!  The honestest lad, the truest lad, the best!\xe2\x80\x99  Her indignation\r\nfailed her, and she broke off sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very, very sorry,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, young lady, young lady,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Rachael, \xe2\x80\x98I hope you may be, but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know!  I can\xe2\x80\x99t say what you may ha\xe2\x80\x99 done!  The like of you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow us, don\xe2\x80\x99t care for us, don\xe2\x80\x99t belong to us.  I am not sure why you\r\nmay ha\xe2\x80\x99 come that night.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell but what you may ha\xe2\x80\x99 come wi\xe2\x80\x99 some\r\naim of your own, not mindin to what trouble you brought such as the poor\r\nlad.  I said then, Bless you for coming; and I said it of my heart, you\r\nseemed to take so pitifully to him; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa could not reproach her for her unjust suspicions; she was so\r\nfaithful to her idea of the man, and so afflicted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael through her sobs, \xe2\x80\x98that the poor lad was\r\nso grateful, thinkin you so good to him\xe2\x80\x94when I mind that he put his hand\r\nover his hard-worken face to hide the tears that you brought up there\xe2\x80\x94Oh,\r\nI hope you may be sorry, and ha\xe2\x80\x99 no bad cause to be it; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a pretty article,\xe2\x80\x99 growled the whelp, moving uneasily in his dark\r\ncorner, \xe2\x80\x98to come here with these precious imputations!  You ought to be\r\nbundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself, and you would be by\r\nrights.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said nothing in reply; and her low weeping was the only sound that\r\nwas heard, until Mr. Bounderby spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98you know what you have engaged to do.  You had better\r\ngive your mind to that; not this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Deed, I am loath,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Rachael, drying her eyes, \xe2\x80\x98that any here\r\nshould see me like this; but I won\xe2\x80\x99t be seen so again.  Young lady, when\r\nI had read what\xe2\x80\x99s put in print of Stephen\xe2\x80\x94and what has just as much truth\r\nin it as if it had been put in print of you\xe2\x80\x94I went straight to the Bank\r\nto say I knew where Stephen was, and to give a sure and certain promise\r\nthat he should be here in two days.  I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t meet wi\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Bounderby\r\nthen, and your brother sent me away, and I tried to find you, but you was\r\nnot to be found, and I went back to work.  Soon as I come out of the Mill\r\nto-night, I hastened to hear what was said of Stephen\xe2\x80\x94for I know wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\npride he will come back to shame it!\xe2\x80\x94and then I went again to seek Mr.\r\nBounderby, and I found him, and I told him every word I knew; and he\r\nbelieved no word I said, and brought me here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So far, that\xe2\x80\x99s true enough,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Mr. Bounderby, with his hands in\r\nhis pockets and his hat on.  \xe2\x80\x98But I have known you people before to-day,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll observe, and I know you never die for want of talking.  Now, I\r\nrecommend you not so much to mind talking just now, as doing.  You have\r\nundertaken to do something; all I remark upon that at present is, do it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have written to Stephen by the post that went out this afternoon, as I\r\nhave written to him once before sin\xe2\x80\x99 he went away,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael; \xe2\x80\x98and he\r\nwill be here, at furthest, in two days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something.  You are not aware perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr.\r\nBounderby, \xe2\x80\x98that you yourself have been looked after now and then, not\r\nbeing considered quite free from suspicion in this business, on account\r\nof most people being judged according to the company they keep.  The\r\npost-office hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been forgotten either.  What I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you is, that no\r\nletter to Stephen Blackpool has ever got into it.  Therefore, what has\r\nbecome of yours, I leave you to guess.  Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re mistaken, and\r\nnever wrote any.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been gone from here, young lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael, turning\r\nappealingly to Louisa, \xe2\x80\x98as much as a week, when he sent me the only\r\nletter I have had from him, saying that he was forced to seek work in\r\nanother name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, by George!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bounderby, shaking his head, with a whistle, \xe2\x80\x98he\r\nchanges his name, does he!  That\xe2\x80\x99s rather unlucky, too, for such an\r\nimmaculate chap.  It\xe2\x80\x99s considered a little suspicious in Courts of\r\nJustice, I believe, when an Innocent happens to have many names.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael, with the tears in her eyes again, \xe2\x80\x98what, young\r\nlady, in the name of Mercy, was left the poor lad to do!  The masters\r\nagainst him on one hand, the men against him on the other, he only wantin\r\nto work hard in peace, and do what he felt right.  Can a man have no soul\r\nof his own, no mind of his own?  Must he go wrong all through wi\xe2\x80\x99 this\r\nside, or must he go wrong all through wi\xe2\x80\x99 that, or else be hunted like a\r\nhare?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, indeed, I pity him from my heart,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Louisa; \xe2\x80\x98and I hope\r\nthat he will clear himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You need have no fear of that, young lady.  He is sure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All the surer, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98for your refusing to\r\ntell where he is?  Eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He shall not, through any act of mine, come back wi\xe2\x80\x99 the unmerited\r\nreproach of being brought back.  He shall come back of his own accord to\r\nclear himself, and put all those that have injured his good character,\r\nand he not here for its defence, to shame.  I have told him what has been\r\ndone against him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael, throwing off all distrust as a rock\r\nthrows off the sea, \xe2\x80\x98and he will be here, at furthest, in two days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Notwithstanding which,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98if he can be laid hold of\r\nany sooner, he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself.  As\r\nto you, I have nothing against you; what you came and told me turns out\r\nto be true, and I have given you the means of proving it to be true, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it.  I wish you good night all!  I must be off to look\r\na little further into this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTom came out of his corner when Mr. Bounderby moved, moved with him, kept\r\nclose to him, and went away with him.  The only parting salutation of\r\nwhich he delivered himself was a sulky \xe2\x80\x98Good night, father!\xe2\x80\x99  With a\r\nbrief speech, and a scowl at his sister, he left the house.\r\n\r\nSince his sheet-anchor had come home, Mr. Gradgrind had been sparing of\r\nspeech.  He still sat silent, when Louisa mildly said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rachael, you will not distrust me one day, when you know me better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It goes against me,\xe2\x80\x99 Rachael answered, in a gentler manner, \xe2\x80\x98to mistrust\r\nany one; but when I am so mistrusted\xe2\x80\x94when we all are\xe2\x80\x94I cannot keep such\r\nthings quite out of my mind.  I ask your pardon for having done you an\r\ninjury.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think what I said now.  Yet I might come to think it\r\nagain, wi\xe2\x80\x99 the poor lad so wronged.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you tell him in your letter,\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sissy, \xe2\x80\x98that suspicion seemed\r\nto have fallen upon him, because he had been seen about the Bank at\r\nnight?  He would then know what he would have to explain on coming back,\r\nand would be ready.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, dear,\xe2\x80\x99 she returned; \xe2\x80\x98but I can\xe2\x80\x99t guess what can have ever taken\r\nhim there.  He never used to go there.  It was never in his way.  His way\r\nwas the same as mine, and not near it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSissy had already been at her side asking her where she lived, and\r\nwhether she might come to-morrow night, to inquire if there were news of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I doubt,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael, \xe2\x80\x98if he can be here till next day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I will come next night too,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sissy.\r\n\r\nWhen Rachael, assenting to this, was gone, Mr. Gradgrind lifted up his\r\nhead, and said to his daughter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Louisa, my dear, I have never, that I know of, seen this man.  Do you\r\nbelieve him to be implicated?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I have believed it, father, though with great difficulty.  I do\r\nnot believe it now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is to say, you once persuaded yourself to believe it, from knowing\r\nhim to be suspected.  His appearance and manner; are they so honest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very honest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And her confidence not to be shaken!  I ask myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind,\r\nmusing, \xe2\x80\x98does the real culprit know of these accusations?  Where is he?\r\nWho is he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis hair had latterly began to change its colour.  As he leaned upon his\r\nhand again, looking gray and old, Louisa, with a face of fear and pity,\r\nhurriedly went over to him, and sat close at his side.  Her eyes by\r\naccident met Sissy\xe2\x80\x99s at the moment.  Sissy flushed and started, and\r\nLouisa put her finger on her lip.\r\n\r\nNext night, when Sissy returned home and told Louisa that Stephen was not\r\ncome, she told it in a whisper.  Next night again, when she came home\r\nwith the same account, and added that he had not been heard of, she spoke\r\nin the same low frightened tone.  From the moment of that interchange of\r\nlooks, they never uttered his name, or any reference to him, aloud; nor\r\never pursued the subject of the robbery, when Mr. Gradgrind spoke of it.\r\n\r\nThe two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out, and\r\nStephen Blackpool was not come, and remained unheard of.  On the fourth\r\nday, Rachael, with unabated confidence, but considering her despatch to\r\nhave miscarried, went up to the Bank, and showed her letter from him with\r\nhis address, at a working colony, one of many, not upon the main road,\r\nsixty miles away.  Messengers were sent to that place, and the whole town\r\nlooked for Stephen to be brought in next day.\r\n\r\nDuring this whole time the whelp moved about with Mr. Bounderby like his\r\nshadow, assisting in all the proceedings.  He was greatly excited,\r\nhorribly fevered, bit his nails down to the quick, spoke in a hard\r\nrattling voice, and with lips that were black and burnt up.  At the hour\r\nwhen the suspected man was looked for, the whelp was at the station;\r\noffering to wager that he had made off before the arrival of those who\r\nwere sent in quest of him, and that he would not appear.\r\n\r\nThe whelp was right.  The messengers returned alone.  Rachael\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nhad gone, Rachael\xe2\x80\x99s letter had been delivered.  Stephen Blackpool had\r\ndecamped in that same hour; and no soul knew more of him.  The only doubt\r\nin Coketown was, whether Rachael had written in good faith, believing\r\nthat he really would come back, or warning him to fly.  On this point\r\nopinion was divided.\r\n\r\nSix days, seven days, far on into another week.  The wretched whelp\r\nplucked up a ghastly courage, and began to grow defiant.  \xe2\x80\x98_Was_ the\r\nsuspected fellow the thief?  A pretty question!  If not, where was the\r\nman, and why did he not come back?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhere was the man, and why did he not come back?  In the dead of night\r\nthe echoes of his own words, which had rolled Heaven knows how far away\r\nin the daytime, came back instead, and abided by him until morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nFOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nDAY and night again, day and night again.  No Stephen Blackpool.  Where\r\nwas the man, and why did he not come back?\r\n\r\nEvery night, Sissy went to Rachael\xe2\x80\x99s lodging, and sat with her in her\r\nsmall neat room.  All day, Rachael toiled as such people must toil,\r\nwhatever their anxieties.  The smoke-serpents were indifferent who was\r\nlost or found, who turned out bad or good; the melancholy mad elephants,\r\nlike the Hard Fact men, abated nothing of their set routine, whatever\r\nhappened.  Day and night again, day and night again.  The monotony was\r\nunbroken.  Even Stephen Blackpool\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance was falling into the\r\ngeneral way, and becoming as monotonous a wonder as any piece of\r\nmachinery in Coketown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I misdoubt,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael, \xe2\x80\x98if there is as many as twenty left in all\r\nthis place, who have any trust in the poor dear lad now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said it to Sissy, as they sat in her lodging, lighted only by the\r\nlamp at the street corner.  Sissy had come there when it was already\r\ndark, to await her return from work; and they had since sat at the window\r\nwhere Rachael had found her, wanting no brighter light to shine on their\r\nsorrowful talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been mercifully brought about, that I was to have you to\r\nspeak to,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Rachael, \xe2\x80\x98times are, when I think my mind would not\r\nhave kept right.  But I get hope and strength through you; and you\r\nbelieve that though appearances may rise against him, he will be proved\r\nclear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do believe so,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Sissy, \xe2\x80\x98with my whole heart.  I feel so\r\ncertain, Rachael, that the confidence you hold in yours against all\r\ndiscouragement, is not like to be wrong, that I have no more doubt of him\r\nthan if I had known him through as many years of trial as you have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachel, with a tremble in her voice, \xe2\x80\x98have known\r\nhim through them all, to be, according to his quiet ways, so faithful to\r\neverything honest and good, that if he was never to be heard of more, and\r\nI was to live to be a hundred years old, I could say with my last breath,\r\nGod knows my heart.  I have never once left trusting Stephen Blackpool!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We all believe, up at the Lodge, Rachael, that he will be freed from\r\nsuspicion, sooner or later.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The better I know it to be so believed there, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and the kinder I feel it that you come away from there, purposely to\r\ncomfort me, and keep me company, and be seen wi\xe2\x80\x99 me when I am not yet\r\nfree from all suspicion myself, the more grieved I am that I should ever\r\nhave spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady.  And yet I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mistrust her now, Rachael?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now that you have brought us more together, no.  But I can\xe2\x80\x99t at all\r\ntimes keep out of my mind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer voice so sunk into a low and slow communing with herself, that Sissy,\r\nsitting by her side, was obliged to listen with attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t at all times keep out of my mind, mistrustings of some one.  I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t think who \xe2\x80\x99tis, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think how or why it may be done, but I\r\nmistrust that some one has put Stephen out of the way.  I mistrust that\r\nby his coming back of his own accord, and showing himself innocent before\r\nthem all, some one would be confounded, who\xe2\x80\x94to prevent that\xe2\x80\x94has stopped\r\nhim, and put him out of the way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is a dreadful thought,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sissy, turning pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It _is_ a dreadful thought to think he may be murdered.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSissy shuddered, and turned paler yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When it makes its way into my mind, dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael, \xe2\x80\x98and it will\r\ncome sometimes, though I do all I can to keep it out, wi\xe2\x80\x99 counting on to\r\nhigh numbers as I work, and saying over and over again pieces that I knew\r\nwhen I were a child\xe2\x80\x94I fall into such a wild, hot hurry, that, however\r\ntired I am, I want to walk fast, miles and miles.  I must get the better\r\nof this before bed-time.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk home wi\xe2\x80\x99 you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He might fall ill upon the journey back,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sissy, faintly offering a\r\nworn-out scrap of hope; \xe2\x80\x98and in such a case, there are many places on the\r\nroad where he might stop.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he is in none of them.  He has been sought for in all, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True,\xe2\x80\x99 was Sissy\xe2\x80\x99s reluctant admission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99d walk the journey in two days.  If he was footsore and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwalk, I sent him, in the letter he got, the money to ride, lest he should\r\nhave none of his own to spare.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let us hope that to-morrow will bring something better, Rachael.  Come\r\ninto the air!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer gentle hand adjusted Rachael\xe2\x80\x99s shawl upon her shining black hair in\r\nthe usual manner of her wearing it, and they went out.  The night being\r\nfine, little knots of Hands were here and there lingering at street\r\ncorners; but it was supper-time with the greater part of them, and there\r\nwere but few people in the streets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re not so hurried now, Rachael, and your hand is cooler.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I get better, dear, if I can only walk, and breathe a little fresh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Times when I can\xe2\x80\x99t, I turn weak and confused.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you must not begin to fail, Rachael, for you may be wanted at any\r\ntime to stand by Stephen.  To-morrow is Saturday.  If no news comes\r\nto-morrow, let us walk in the country on Sunday morning, and strengthen\r\nyou for another week.  Will you go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were by this time in the street where Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s house stood.\r\nThe way to Sissy\xe2\x80\x99s destination led them past the door, and they were\r\ngoing straight towards it.  Some train had newly arrived in Coketown,\r\nwhich had put a number of vehicles in motion, and scattered a\r\nconsiderable bustle about the town.  Several coaches were rattling before\r\nthem and behind them as they approached Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s, and one of the\r\nlatter drew up with such briskness as they were in the act of passing the\r\nhouse, that they looked round involuntarily.  The bright gaslight over\r\nMr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s steps showed them Mrs. Sparsit in the coach, in an\r\necstasy of excitement, struggling to open the door; Mrs. Sparsit seeing\r\nthem at the same moment, called to them to stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a coincidence,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, as she was released by the\r\ncoachman.  \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a Providence!  Come out, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x99 then said Mrs. Sparsit,\r\nto some one inside, \xe2\x80\x98come out, or we\xe2\x80\x99ll have you dragged out!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHereupon, no other than the mysterious old woman descended.  Whom Mrs.\r\nSparsit incontinently collared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Leave her alone, everybody!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Sparsit, with great energy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let nobody touch her.  She belongs to me.  Come in, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x99 then said\r\nMrs. Sparsit, reversing her former word of command.  \xe2\x80\x98Come in, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, or\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll have you dragged in!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of a matron of classical deportment, seizing an ancient\r\nwoman by the throat, and hauling her into a dwelling-house, would have\r\nbeen under any circumstances, sufficient temptation to all true English\r\nstragglers so blest as to witness it, to force a way into that\r\ndwelling-house and see the matter out.  But when the phenomenon was\r\nenhanced by the notoriety and mystery by this time associated all over\r\nthe town with the Bank robbery, it would have lured the stragglers in,\r\nwith an irresistible attraction, though the roof had been expected to\r\nfall upon their heads.  Accordingly, the chance witnesses on the ground,\r\nconsisting of the busiest of the neighbours to the number of some\r\nfive-and-twenty, closed in after Sissy and Rachael, as they closed in\r\nafter Mrs. Sparsit and her prize; and the whole body made a disorderly\r\nirruption into Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s dining-room, where the people behind lost\r\nnot a moment\xe2\x80\x99s time in mounting on the chairs, to get the better of the\r\npeople in front.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fetch Mr. Bounderby down!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98Rachael, young woman;\r\nyou know who this is?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Pegler,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think it is!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Sparsit, exulting.  \xe2\x80\x98Fetch Mr.\r\nBounderby.  Stand away, everybody!\xe2\x80\x99  Here old Mrs. Pegler, muffling\r\nherself up, and shrinking from observation, whispered a word of entreaty.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, aloud.  \xe2\x80\x98I have told you twenty\r\ntimes, coming along, that I will _not_ leave you till I have handed you\r\nover to him myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby now appeared, accompanied by Mr. Gradgrind and the whelp,\r\nwith whom he had been holding conference up-stairs.  Mr. Bounderby looked\r\nmore astonished than hospitable, at sight of this uninvited party in his\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now!\xe2\x80\x99 said he.  \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Sparsit, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 explained that worthy woman, \xe2\x80\x98I trust it is my good fortune to\r\nproduce a person you have much desired to find.  Stimulated by my wish to\r\nrelieve your mind, sir, and connecting together such imperfect clues to\r\nthe part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside,\r\nas have been afforded by the young woman, Rachael, fortunately now\r\npresent to identify, I have had the happiness to succeed, and to bring\r\nthat person with me\xe2\x80\x94I need not say most unwillingly on her part.  It has\r\nnot been, sir, without some trouble that I have effected this; but\r\ntrouble in your service is to me a pleasure, and hunger, thirst, and cold\r\na real gratification.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Sparsit ceased; for Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s visage exhibited an\r\nextraordinary combination of all possible colours and expressions of\r\ndiscomfiture, as old Mrs. Pegler was disclosed to his view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, what do you mean by this?\xe2\x80\x99 was his highly unexpected demand, in\r\ngreat warmth.  \xe2\x80\x98I ask you, what do you mean by this, Mrs. Sparsit,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you mind your own business, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 roared Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98How\r\ndare you go and poke your officious nose into my family affairs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis allusion to her favourite feature overpowered Mrs. Sparsit.  She sat\r\ndown stiffly in a chair, as if she were frozen; and with a fixed stare at\r\nMr. Bounderby, slowly grated her mittens against one another, as if they\r\nwere frozen too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Josiah!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Pegler, trembling.  \xe2\x80\x98My darling boy!  I am\r\nnot to blame.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault, Josiah.  I told this lady over and over\r\nagain, that I knew she was doing what would not be agreeable to you, but\r\nshe would do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you let her bring you for?  Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you knock her cap off, or\r\nher tooth out, or scratch her, or do something or other to her?\xe2\x80\x99 asked\r\nBounderby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My own boy!  She threatened me that if I resisted her, I should be\r\nbrought by constables, and it was better to come quietly than make that\r\nstir in such a\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Pegler glanced timidly but proudly round the\r\nwalls\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98such a fine house as this.  Indeed, indeed, it is not my fault!\r\nMy dear, noble, stately boy!  I have always lived quiet, and secret,\r\nJosiah, my dear.  I have never broken the condition once.  I have never\r\nsaid I was your mother.  I have admired you at a distance; and if I have\r\ncome to town sometimes, with long times between, to take a proud peep at\r\nyou, I have done it unbeknown, my love, and gone away again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby, with his hands in his pockets, walked in impatient\r\nmortification up and down at the side of the long dining-table, while the\r\nspectators greedily took in every syllable of Mrs. Pegler\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, and\r\nat each succeeding syllable became more and more round-eyed.  Mr.\r\nBounderby still walking up and down when Mrs. Pegler had done, Mr.\r\nGradgrind addressed that maligned old lady:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am surprised, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 he observed with severity, \xe2\x80\x98that in your old age\r\nyou have the face to claim Mr. Bounderby for your son, after your\r\nunnatural and inhuman treatment of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Me_ unnatural!\xe2\x80\x99 cried poor old Mrs. Pegler.  \xe2\x80\x98_Me_ inhuman!  To my dear\r\nboy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98Yes; dear in his self-made prosperity,\r\nmadam, I dare say.  Not very dear, however, when you deserted him in his\r\ninfancy, and left him to the brutality of a drunken grandmother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_I_ deserted my Josiah!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Pegler, clasping her hands.  \xe2\x80\x98Now,\r\nLord forgive you, sir, for your wicked imaginations, and for your scandal\r\nagainst the memory of my poor mother, who died in my arms before Josiah\r\nwas born.  May you repent of it, sir, and live to know better!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was so very earnest and injured, that Mr. Gradgrind, shocked by the\r\npossibility which dawned upon him, said in a gentler tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you deny, then, madam, that you left your son to\xe2\x80\x94to be brought up in\r\nthe gutter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Josiah in the gutter!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Pegler.  \xe2\x80\x98No such a thing, sir.\r\nNever!  For shame on you!  My dear boy knows, and will give _you_ to\r\nknow, that though he come of humble parents, he come of parents that\r\nloved him as dear as the best could, and never thought it hardship on\r\nthemselves to pinch a bit that he might write and cipher beautiful, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve his books at home to show it!  Aye, have I!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Pegler, with\r\nindignant pride.  \xe2\x80\x98And my dear boy knows, and will give _you_ to know,\r\nsir, that after his beloved father died, when he was eight years old, his\r\nmother, too, could pinch a bit, as it was her duty and her pleasure and\r\nher pride to do it, to help him out in life, and put him \xe2\x80\x99prentice.  And\r\na steady lad he was, and a kind master he had to lend him a hand, and\r\nwell he worked his own way forward to be rich and thriving.  And _I_\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngive you to know, sir\xe2\x80\x94for this my dear boy won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94that though his mother\r\nkept but a little village shop, he never forgot her, but pensioned me on\r\nthirty pound a year\xe2\x80\x94more than I want, for I put by out of it\xe2\x80\x94only making\r\nthe condition that I was to keep down in my own part, and make no boasts\r\nabout him, and not trouble him.  And I never have, except with looking at\r\nhim once a year, when he has never knowed it.  And it\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x99 said poor\r\nold Mrs. Pegler, in affectionate championship, \xe2\x80\x98that I _should_ keep down\r\nin my own part, and I have no doubts that if I was here I should do a\r\nmany unbefitting things, and I am well contented, and I can keep my pride\r\nin my Josiah to myself, and I can love for love\xe2\x80\x99s own sake!  And I am\r\nashamed of you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Pegler, lastly, \xe2\x80\x98for your slanders and\r\nsuspicions.  And I never stood here before, nor never wanted to stand\r\nhere when my dear son said no.  And I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here now, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen for being brought here.  And for shame upon you, Oh, for shame, to\r\naccuse me of being a bad mother to my son, with my son standing here to\r\ntell you so different!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe bystanders, on and off the dining-room chairs, raised a murmur of\r\nsympathy with Mrs. Pegler, and Mr. Gradgrind felt himself innocently\r\nplaced in a very distressing predicament, when Mr. Bounderby, who had\r\nnever ceased walking up and down, and had every moment swelled larger and\r\nlarger, and grown redder and redder, stopped short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98how I come to be favoured\r\nwith the attendance of the present company, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t inquire.  When\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re quite satisfied, perhaps they\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good as to disperse;\r\nwhether they\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied or not, perhaps they\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good as to\r\ndisperse.  I\xe2\x80\x99m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs, I\r\nhave not undertaken to do it, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not a going to do it.  Therefore\r\nthose who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the\r\nsubject, will be disappointed\xe2\x80\x94particularly Tom Gradgrind, and he can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow it too soon.  In reference to the Bank robbery, there has been a\r\nmistake made, concerning my mother.  If there hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nover-officiousness it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been made, and I hate\r\nover-officiousness at all times, whether or no. Good evening!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Bounderby carried it off in these terms, holding the door\r\nopen for the company to depart, there was a blustering sheepishness upon\r\nhim, at once extremely crestfallen and superlatively absurd.  Detected as\r\nthe Bully of humility, who had built his windy reputation upon lies, and\r\nin his boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him as if\r\nhe had advanced the mean claim (there is no meaner) to tack himself on to\r\na pedigree, he cut a most ridiculous figure.  With the people filing off\r\nat the door he held, who he knew would carry what had passed to the whole\r\ntown, to be given to the four winds, he could not have looked a Bully\r\nmore shorn and forlorn, if he had had his ears cropped.  Even that\r\nunlucky female, Mrs. Sparsit, fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into\r\nthe Slough of Despond, was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man\r\nand self-made Humbug, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.\r\n\r\nRachael and Sissy, leaving Mrs. Pegler to occupy a bed at her son\xe2\x80\x99s for\r\nthat night, walked together to the gate of Stone Lodge and there parted.\r\nMr. Gradgrind joined them before they had gone very far, and spoke with\r\nmuch interest of Stephen Blackpool; for whom he thought this signal\r\nfailure of the suspicions against Mrs. Pegler was likely to work well.\r\n\r\nAs to the whelp; throughout this scene as on all other late occasions, he\r\nhad stuck close to Bounderby.  He seemed to feel that as long as\r\nBounderby could make no discovery without his knowledge, he was so far\r\nsafe.  He never visited his sister, and had only seen her once since she\r\nwent home: that is to say on the night when he still stuck close to\r\nBounderby, as already related.\r\n\r\nThere was one dim unformed fear lingering about his sister\xe2\x80\x99s mind, to\r\nwhich she never gave utterance, which surrounded the graceless and\r\nungrateful boy with a dreadful mystery.  The same dark possibility had\r\npresented itself in the same shapeless guise, this very day, to Sissy,\r\nwhen Rachael spoke of some one who would be confounded by Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn, having put him out of the way.  Louisa had never spoken of\r\nharbouring any suspicion of her brother in connexion with the robbery,\r\nshe and Sissy had held no confidence on the subject, save in that one\r\ninterchange of looks when the unconscious father rested his gray head on\r\nhis hand; but it was understood between them, and they both knew it.\r\nThis other fear was so awful, that it hovered about each of them like a\r\nghostly shadow; neither daring to think of its being near herself, far\r\nless of its being near the other.\r\n\r\nAnd still the forced spirit which the whelp had plucked up, throve with\r\nhim.  If Stephen Blackpool was not the thief, let him show himself.  Why\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\r\n\r\nAnother night.  Another day and night.  No Stephen Blackpool.  Where was\r\nthe man, and why did he not come back?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nTHE STARLIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Sunday was a bright Sunday in autumn, clear and cool, when early in\r\nthe morning Sissy and Rachael met, to walk in the country.\r\n\r\nAs Coketown cast ashes not only on its own head but on the\r\nneighbourhood\xe2\x80\x99s too\xe2\x80\x94after the manner of those pious persons who do\r\npenance for their own sins by putting other people into sackcloth\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\ncustomary for those who now and then thirsted for a draught of pure air,\r\nwhich is not absolutely the most wicked among the vanities of life, to\r\nget a few miles away by the railroad, and then begin their walk, or their\r\nlounge in the fields.  Sissy and Rachael helped themselves out of the\r\nsmoke by the usual means, and were put down at a station about midway\r\nbetween the town and Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s retreat.\r\n\r\nThough the green landscape was blotted here and there with heaps of coal,\r\nit was green elsewhere, and there were trees to see, and there were larks\r\nsinging (though it was Sunday), and there were pleasant scents in the\r\nair, and all was over-arched by a bright blue sky.  In the distance one\r\nway, Coketown showed as a black mist; in another distance hills began to\r\nrise; in a third, there was a faint change in the light of the horizon\r\nwhere it shone upon the far-off sea.  Under their feet, the grass was\r\nfresh; beautiful shadows of branches flickered upon it, and speckled it;\r\nhedgerows were luxuriant; everything was at peace.  Engines at pits\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmouths, and lean old horses that had worn the circle of their daily\r\nlabour into the ground, were alike quiet; wheels had ceased for a short\r\nspace to turn; and the great wheel of earth seemed to revolve without the\r\nshocks and noises of another time.\r\n\r\nThey walked on across the fields and down the shady lanes, sometimes\r\ngetting over a fragment of a fence so rotten that it dropped at a touch\r\nof the foot, sometimes passing near a wreck of bricks and beams overgrown\r\nwith grass, marking the site of deserted works.  They followed paths and\r\ntracks, however slight.  Mounds where the grass was rank and high, and\r\nwhere brambles, dock-weed, and such-like vegetation, were confusedly\r\nheaped together, they always avoided; for dismal stories were told in\r\nthat country of the old pits hidden beneath such indications.\r\n\r\nThe sun was high when they sat down to rest.  They had seen no one, near\r\nor distant, for a long time; and the solitude remained unbroken.  \xe2\x80\x98It is\r\nso still here, Rachael, and the way is so untrodden, that I think we must\r\nbe the first who have been here all the summer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Sissy said it, her eyes were attracted by another of those rotten\r\nfragments of fence upon the ground.  She got up to look at it.  \xe2\x80\x98And yet\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.  This has not been broken very long.  The wood is quite\r\nfresh where it gave way.  Here are footsteps too.\xe2\x80\x94O Rachael!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe ran back, and caught her round the neck.  Rachael had already started\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.  There is a hat lying in the grass.\xe2\x80\x99  They went forward\r\ntogether.  Rachael took it up, shaking from head to foot.  She broke into\r\na passion of tears and lamentations: Stephen Blackpool was written in his\r\nown hand on the inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O the poor lad, the poor lad!  He has been made away with.  He is lying\r\nmurdered here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there\xe2\x80\x94has the hat any blood upon it?\xe2\x80\x99 Sissy faltered.\r\n\r\nThey were afraid to look; but they did examine it, and found no mark of\r\nviolence, inside or out.  It had been lying there some days, for rain and\r\ndew had stained it, and the mark of its shape was on the grass where it\r\nhad fallen.  They looked fearfully about them, without moving, but could\r\nsee nothing more.  \xe2\x80\x98Rachael,\xe2\x80\x99 Sissy whispered, \xe2\x80\x98I will go on a little by\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had unclasped her hand, and was in the act of stepping forward, when\r\nRachael caught her in both arms with a scream that resounded over the\r\nwide landscape.  Before them, at their very feet, was the brink of a\r\nblack ragged chasm hidden by the thick grass.  They sprang back, and fell\r\nupon their knees, each hiding her face upon the other\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, my good Lord!  He\xe2\x80\x99s down there!  Down there!\xe2\x80\x99  At first this, and her\r\nterrific screams, were all that could be got from Rachael, by any tears,\r\nby any prayers, by any representations, by any means.  It was impossible\r\nto hush her; and it was deadly necessary to hold her, or she would have\r\nflung herself down the shaft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rachael, dear Rachael, good Rachael, for the love of Heaven, not these\r\ndreadful cries!  Think of Stephen, think of Stephen, think of Stephen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy an earnest repetition of this entreaty, poured out in all the agony of\r\nsuch a moment, Sissy at last brought her to be silent, and to look at her\r\nwith a tearless face of stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rachael, Stephen may be living.  You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave him lying maimed at\r\nthe bottom of this dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, no!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t stir from here, for his sake!  Let me go and listen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe shuddered to approach the pit; but she crept towards it on her hands\r\nand knees, and called to him as loud as she could call.  She listened,\r\nbut no sound replied.  She called again and listened; still no answering\r\nsound.  She did this, twenty, thirty times.  She took a little clod of\r\nearth from the broken ground where he had stumbled, and threw it in.  She\r\ncould not hear it fall.\r\n\r\nThe wide prospect, so beautiful in its stillness but a few minutes ago,\r\nalmost carried despair to her brave heart, as she rose and looked all\r\nround her, seeing no help.  \xe2\x80\x98Rachael, we must lose not a moment.  We must\r\ngo in different directions, seeking aid.  You shall go by the way we have\r\ncome, and I will go forward by the path.  Tell any one you see, and every\r\none what has happened.  Think of Stephen, think of Stephen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe knew by Rachael\xe2\x80\x99s face that she might trust her now.  And after\r\nstanding for a moment to see her running, wringing her hands as she ran,\r\nshe turned and went upon her own search; she stopped at the hedge to tie\r\nher shawl there as a guide to the place, then threw her bonnet aside, and\r\nran as she had never run before.\r\n\r\nRun, Sissy, run, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name!  Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop for breath.  Run, run!\r\nQuickening herself by carrying such entreaties in her thoughts, she ran\r\nfrom field to field, and lane to lane, and place to place, as she had\r\nnever run before; until she came to a shed by an engine-house, where two\r\nmen lay in the shade, asleep on straw.\r\n\r\nFirst to wake them, and next to tell them, all so wild and breathless as\r\nshe was, what had brought her there, were difficulties; but they no\r\nsooner understood her than their spirits were on fire like hers.  One of\r\nthe men was in a drunken slumber, but on his comrade\xe2\x80\x99s shouting to him\r\nthat a man had fallen down the Old Hell Shaft, he started out to a pool\r\nof dirty water, put his head in it, and came back sober.\r\n\r\nWith these two men she ran to another half-a-mile further, and with that\r\none to another, while they ran elsewhere.  Then a horse was found; and\r\nshe got another man to ride for life or death to the railroad, and send a\r\nmessage to Louisa, which she wrote and gave him.  By this time a whole\r\nvillage was up: and windlasses, ropes, poles, candles, lanterns, all\r\nthings necessary, were fast collecting and being brought into one place,\r\nto be carried to the Old Hell Shaft.\r\n\r\nIt seemed now hours and hours since she had left the lost man lying in\r\nthe grave where he had been buried alive.  She could not bear to remain\r\naway from it any longer\xe2\x80\x94it was like deserting him\xe2\x80\x94and she hurried swiftly\r\nback, accompanied by half-a-dozen labourers, including the drunken man\r\nwhom the news had sobered, and who was the best man of all.  When they\r\ncame to the Old Hell Shaft, they found it as lonely as she had left it.\r\nThe men called and listened as she had done, and examined the edge of the\r\nchasm, and settled how it had happened, and then sat down to wait until\r\nthe implements they wanted should come up.\r\n\r\nEvery sound of insects in the air, every stirring of the leaves, every\r\nwhisper among these men, made Sissy tremble, for she thought it was a cry\r\nat the bottom of the pit.  But the wind blew idly over it, and no sound\r\narose to the surface, and they sat upon the grass, waiting and waiting.\r\nAfter they had waited some time, straggling people who had heard of the\r\naccident began to come up; then the real help of implements began to\r\narrive.  In the midst of this, Rachael returned; and with her party there\r\nwas a surgeon, who brought some wine and medicines.  But, the expectation\r\namong the people that the man would be found alive was very slight\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nThere being now people enough present to impede the work, the sobered man\r\nput himself at the head of the rest, or was put there by the general\r\nconsent, and made a large ring round the Old Hell Shaft, and appointed\r\nmen to keep it.  Besides such volunteers as were accepted to work, only\r\nSissy and Rachael were at first permitted within this ring; but, later in\r\nthe day, when the message brought an express from Coketown, Mr. Gradgrind\r\nand Louisa, and Mr. Bounderby, and the whelp, were also there.\r\n\r\nThe sun was four hours lower than when Sissy and Rachael had first sat\r\ndown upon the grass, before a means of enabling two men to descend\r\nsecurely was rigged with poles and ropes.  Difficulties had arisen in the\r\nconstruction of this machine, simple as it was; requisites had been found\r\nwanting, and messages had had to go and return.  It was five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in\r\nthe afternoon of the bright autumnal Sunday, before a candle was sent\r\ndown to try the air, while three or four rough faces stood crowded close\r\ntogether, attentively watching it: the man at the windlass lowering as\r\nthey were told.  The candle was brought up again, feebly burning, and\r\nthen some water was cast in.  Then the bucket was hooked on; and the\r\nsobered man and another got in with lights, giving the word \xe2\x80\x98Lower away!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the rope went out, tight and strained, and the windlass creaked, there\r\nwas not a breath among the one or two hundred men and women looking on,\r\nthat came as it was wont to come.  The signal was given and the windlass\r\nstopped, with abundant rope to spare.  Apparently so long an interval\r\nensued with the men at the windlass standing idle, that some women\r\nshrieked that another accident had happened!  But the surgeon who held\r\nthe watch, declared five minutes not to have elapsed yet, and sternly\r\nadmonished them to keep silence.  He had not well done speaking, when the\r\nwindlass was reversed and worked again.  Practised eyes knew that it did\r\nnot go as heavily as it would if both workmen had been coming up, and\r\nthat only one was returning.\r\n\r\nThe rope came in tight and strained; and ring after ring was coiled upon\r\nthe barrel of the windlass, and all eyes were fastened on the pit.  The\r\nsobered man was brought up and leaped out briskly on the grass.  There\r\nwas an universal cry of \xe2\x80\x98Alive or dead?\xe2\x80\x99 and then a deep, profound hush.\r\n\r\nWhen he said \xe2\x80\x98Alive!\xe2\x80\x99 a great shout arose and many eyes had tears in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he\xe2\x80\x99s hurt very bad,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, as soon as he could make himself\r\nheard again.  \xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s doctor?  He\xe2\x80\x99s hurt so very bad, sir, that we donno\r\nhow to get him up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey all consulted together, and looked anxiously at the surgeon, as he\r\nasked some questions, and shook his head on receiving the replies.  The\r\nsun was setting now; and the red light in the evening sky touched every\r\nface there, and caused it to be distinctly seen in all its rapt suspense.\r\n\r\nThe consultation ended in the men returning to the windlass, and the\r\npitman going down again, carrying the wine and some other small matters\r\nwith him.  Then the other man came up.  In the meantime, under the\r\nsurgeon\xe2\x80\x99s directions, some men brought a hurdle, on which others made a\r\nthick bed of spare clothes covered with loose straw, while he himself\r\ncontrived some bandages and slings from shawls and handkerchiefs.  As\r\nthese were made, they were hung upon an arm of the pitman who had last\r\ncome up, with instructions how to use them: and as he stood, shown by the\r\nlight he carried, leaning his powerful loose hand upon one of the poles,\r\nand sometimes glancing down the pit, and sometimes glancing round upon\r\nthe people, he was not the least conspicuous figure in the scene.  It was\r\ndark now, and torches were kindled.\r\n\r\nIt appeared from the little this man said to those about him, which was\r\nquickly repeated all over the circle, that the lost man had fallen upon a\r\nmass of crumbled rubbish with which the pit was half choked up, and that\r\nhis fall had been further broken by some jagged earth at the side.  He\r\nlay upon his back with one arm doubled under him, and according to his\r\nown belief had hardly stirred since he fell, except that he had moved his\r\nfree hand to a side pocket, in which he remembered to have some bread and\r\nmeat (of which he had swallowed crumbs), and had likewise scooped up a\r\nlittle water in it now and then.  He had come straight away from his\r\nwork, on being written to, and had walked the whole journey; and was on\r\nhis way to Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s country house after dark, when he fell.  He\r\nwas crossing that dangerous country at such a dangerous time, because he\r\nwas innocent of what was laid to his charge, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rest from\r\ncoming the nearest way to deliver himself up.  The Old Hell Shaft, the\r\npitman said, with a curse upon it, was worthy of its bad name to the\r\nlast; for though Stephen could speak now, he believed it would soon be\r\nfound to have mangled the life out of him.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, this man, still taking his last hurried charges from\r\nhis comrades and the surgeon after the windlass had begun to lower him,\r\ndisappeared into the pit.  The rope went out as before, the signal was\r\nmade as before, and the windlass stopped.  No man removed his hand from\r\nit now.  Every one waited with his grasp set, and his body bent down to\r\nthe work, ready to reverse and wind in.  At length the signal was given,\r\nand all the ring leaned forward.\r\n\r\nFor, now, the rope came in, tightened and strained to its utmost as it\r\nappeared, and the men turned heavily, and the windlass complained.  It\r\nwas scarcely endurable to look at the rope, and think of its giving way.\r\nBut, ring after ring was coiled upon the barrel of the windlass safely,\r\nand the connecting chains appeared, and finally the bucket with the two\r\nmen holding on at the sides\xe2\x80\x94a sight to make the head swim, and oppress\r\nthe heart\xe2\x80\x94and tenderly supporting between them, slung and tied within,\r\nthe figure of a poor, crushed, human creature.\r\n\r\nA low murmur of pity went round the throng, and the women wept aloud, as\r\nthis form, almost without form, was moved very slowly from its iron\r\ndeliverance, and laid upon the bed of straw.  At first, none but the\r\nsurgeon went close to it.  He did what he could in its adjustment on the\r\ncouch, but the best that he could do was to cover it.  That gently done,\r\nhe called to him Rachael and Sissy.  And at that time the pale, worn,\r\npatient face was seen looking up at the sky, with the broken right hand\r\nlying bare on the outside of the covering garments, as if waiting to be\r\ntaken by another hand.\r\n\r\nThey gave him drink, moistened his face with water, and administered some\r\ndrops of cordial and wine.  Though he lay quite motionless looking up at\r\nthe sky, he smiled and said, \xe2\x80\x98Rachael.\xe2\x80\x99  She stooped down on the grass at\r\nhis side, and bent over him until her eyes were between his and the sky,\r\nfor he could not so much as turn them to look at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rachael, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe took his hand.  He smiled again and said, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let \xe2\x80\x99t go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou\xe2\x80\x99rt in great pain, my own dear Stephen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ha\xe2\x80\x99 been, but not now.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 been\xe2\x80\x94dreadful, and dree, and long, my\r\ndear\xe2\x80\x94but \xe2\x80\x99tis ower now.  Ah, Rachael, aw a muddle!  Fro\xe2\x80\x99 first to last, a\r\nmuddle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe spectre of his old look seemed to pass as he said the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ha\xe2\x80\x99 fell into th\xe2\x80\x99 pit, my dear, as have cost wi\xe2\x80\x99in the knowledge o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nold fok now livin, hundreds and hundreds o\xe2\x80\x99 men\xe2\x80\x99s lives\xe2\x80\x94fathers, sons,\r\nbrothers, dear to thousands an\xe2\x80\x99 thousands, an\xe2\x80\x99 keeping \xe2\x80\x99em fro\xe2\x80\x99 want and\r\nhunger.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 fell into a pit that ha\xe2\x80\x99 been wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 Firedamp crueller\r\nthan battle.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 read on \xe2\x80\x99t in the public petition, as onny one may\r\nread, fro\xe2\x80\x99 the men that works in pits, in which they ha\xe2\x80\x99 pray\xe2\x80\x99n and\r\npray\xe2\x80\x99n the lawmakers for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake not to let their work be murder to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, but to spare \xe2\x80\x99em for th\xe2\x80\x99 wives and children that they loves as well\r\nas gentlefok loves theirs.  When it were in work, it killed wi\xe2\x80\x99out need;\r\nwhen \xe2\x80\x99tis let alone, it kills wi\xe2\x80\x99out need.  See how we die an\xe2\x80\x99 no need,\r\none way an\xe2\x80\x99 another\xe2\x80\x94in a muddle\xe2\x80\x94every day!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe faintly said it, without any anger against any one.  Merely as the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thy little sister, Rachael, thou hast not forgot her.  Thou\xe2\x80\x99rt not like\r\nto forget her now, and me so nigh her.  Thou know\xe2\x80\x99st\xe2\x80\x94poor, patient,\r\nsuff\xe2\x80\x99rin, dear\xe2\x80\x94how thou didst work for her, seet\xe2\x80\x99n all day long in her\r\nlittle chair at thy winder, and how she died, young and misshapen, awlung\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 sickly air as had\xe2\x80\x99n no need to be, an\xe2\x80\x99 awlung o\xe2\x80\x99 working people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmiserable homes.  A muddle!  Aw a muddle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa approached him; but he could not see her, lying with his face\r\nturned up to the night sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If aw th\xe2\x80\x99 things that tooches us, my dear, was not so muddled, I\r\nshould\xe2\x80\x99n ha\xe2\x80\x99 had\xe2\x80\x99n need to coom heer.  If we was not in a muddle among\r\nourseln, I should\xe2\x80\x99n ha\xe2\x80\x99 been, by my own fellow weavers and workin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbrothers, so mistook.  If Mr. Bounderby had ever know\xe2\x80\x99d me right\xe2\x80\x94if he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\never know\xe2\x80\x99d me at aw\xe2\x80\x94he would\xe2\x80\x99n ha\xe2\x80\x99 took\xe2\x80\x99n offence wi\xe2\x80\x99 me.  He would\xe2\x80\x99n\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 suspect\xe2\x80\x99n me.  But look up yonder, Rachael!  Look aboove!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFollowing his eyes, she saw that he was gazing at a star.\r\n\r\n      [Picture: Stephen Blackpool recovered from the Old Hell Shaft]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It ha\xe2\x80\x99 shined upon me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said reverently, \xe2\x80\x98in my pain and trouble down\r\nbelow.  It ha\xe2\x80\x99 shined into my mind.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 look\xe2\x80\x99n at \xe2\x80\x99t and thowt o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthee, Rachael, till the muddle in my mind have cleared awa, above a bit,\r\nI hope.  If soom ha\xe2\x80\x99 been wantin\xe2\x80\x99 in unnerstan\xe2\x80\x99in me better, I, too, ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbeen wantin\xe2\x80\x99 in unnerstan\xe2\x80\x99in them better.  When I got thy letter, I\r\neasily believen that what the yoong ledy sen and done to me, and what her\r\nbrother sen and done to me, was one, and that there were a wicked plot\r\nbetwixt \xe2\x80\x99em.  When I fell, I were in anger wi\xe2\x80\x99 her, an\xe2\x80\x99 hurryin on t\xe2\x80\x99 be\r\nas onjust t\xe2\x80\x99 her as oothers was t\xe2\x80\x99 me.  But in our judgments, like as in\r\nour doins, we mun bear and forbear.  In my pain an\xe2\x80\x99 trouble, lookin up\r\nyonder,\xe2\x80\x94wi\xe2\x80\x99 it shinin on me\xe2\x80\x94I ha\xe2\x80\x99 seen more clear, and ha\xe2\x80\x99 made it my\r\ndyin prayer that aw th\xe2\x80\x99 world may on\xe2\x80\x99y coom toogether more, an\xe2\x80\x99 get a\r\nbetter unnerstan\xe2\x80\x99in o\xe2\x80\x99 one another, than when I were in \xe2\x80\x99t my own weak\r\nseln.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa hearing what he said, bent over him on the opposite side to\r\nRachael, so that he could see her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ha\xe2\x80\x99 heard?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, after a few moments\xe2\x80\x99 silence.  \xe2\x80\x98I ha\xe2\x80\x99 not\r\nforgot you, ledy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Stephen, I have heard you.  And your prayer is mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ha\xe2\x80\x99 a father.  Will yo tak\xe2\x80\x99 a message to him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, with dread.  \xe2\x80\x98Shall I bring him to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If yo please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa returned with her father.  Standing hand-in-hand, they both looked\r\ndown upon the solemn countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, yo will clear me an\xe2\x80\x99 mak my name good wi\xe2\x80\x99 aw men.  This I leave to\r\nyo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind was troubled and asked how?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 was the reply: \xe2\x80\x98yor son will tell yo how.  Ask him.  I mak no\r\ncharges: I leave none ahint me: not a single word.  I ha\xe2\x80\x99 seen an\xe2\x80\x99 spok\xe2\x80\x99n\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 yor son, one night.  I ask no more o\xe2\x80\x99 yo than that yo clear me\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ntrust to yo to do \xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe bearers being now ready to carry him away, and the surgeon being\r\nanxious for his removal, those who had torches or lanterns, prepared to\r\ngo in front of the litter.  Before it was raised, and while they were\r\narranging how to go, he said to Rachael, looking upward at the star:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Often as I coom to myseln, and found it shinin\xe2\x80\x99 on me down there in my\r\ntrouble, I thowt it were the star as guided to Our Saviour\xe2\x80\x99s home.  I\r\nawmust think it be the very star!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey lifted him up, and he was overjoyed to find that they were about to\r\ntake him in the direction whither the star seemed to him to lead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rachael, beloved lass!  Don\xe2\x80\x99t let go my hand.  We may walk toogether\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99night, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will hold thy hand, and keep beside thee, Stephen, all the way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless thee!  Will soombody be pleased to coover my face!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey carried him very gently along the fields, and down the lanes, and\r\nover the wide landscape; Rachael always holding the hand in hers.  Very\r\nfew whispers broke the mournful silence.  It was soon a funeral\r\nprocession.  The star had shown him where to find the God of the poor;\r\nand through humility, and sorrow, and forgiveness, he had gone to his\r\nRedeemer\xe2\x80\x99s rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nWHELP-HUNTING\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE the ring formed round the Old Hell Shaft was broken, one figure\r\nhad disappeared from within it.  Mr. Bounderby and his shadow had not\r\nstood near Louisa, who held her father\xe2\x80\x99s arm, but in a retired place by\r\nthemselves.  When Mr. Gradgrind was summoned to the couch, Sissy,\r\nattentive to all that happened, slipped behind that wicked shadow\xe2\x80\x94a sight\r\nin the horror of his face, if there had been eyes there for any sight but\r\none\xe2\x80\x94and whispered in his ear.  Without turning his head, he conferred\r\nwith her a few moments, and vanished.  Thus the whelp had gone out of the\r\ncircle before the people moved.\r\n\r\nWhen the father reached home, he sent a message to Mr. Bounderby\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\ndesiring his son to come to him directly.  The reply was, that Mr.\r\nBounderby having missed him in the crowd, and seeing nothing of him\r\nsince, had supposed him to be at Stone Lodge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe, father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, \xe2\x80\x98he will not come back to town\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x99  Mr. Gradgrind turned away, and said no more.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, he went down to the Bank himself as soon as it was\r\nopened, and seeing his son\xe2\x80\x99s place empty (he had not the courage to look\r\nin at first) went back along the street to meet Mr. Bounderby on his way\r\nthere.  To whom he said that, for reasons he would soon explain, but\r\nentreated not then to be asked for, he had found it necessary to employ\r\nhis son at a distance for a little while.  Also, that he was charged with\r\nthe duty of vindicating Stephen Blackpool\xe2\x80\x99s memory, and declaring the\r\nthief.  Mr. Bounderby quite confounded, stood stock-still in the street\r\nafter his father-in-law had left him, swelling like an immense\r\nsoap-bubble, without its beauty.\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind went home, locked himself in his room, and kept it all that\r\nday.  When Sissy and Louisa tapped at his door, he said, without opening\r\nit, \xe2\x80\x98Not now, my dears; in the evening.\xe2\x80\x99  On their return in the evening,\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x98I am not able yet\xe2\x80\x94to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99  He ate nothing all day, and had\r\nno candle after dark; and they heard him walking to and fro late at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nBut, in the morning he appeared at breakfast at the usual hour, and took\r\nhis usual place at the table.  Aged and bent he looked, and quite bowed\r\ndown; and yet he looked a wiser man, and a better man, than in the days\r\nwhen in this life he wanted nothing\xe2\x80\x94but Facts.  Before he left the room,\r\nhe appointed a time for them to come to him; and so, with his gray head\r\ndrooping, went away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, when they kept their appointment, \xe2\x80\x98you have\r\nthree young children left.  They will be different, I will be different\r\nyet, with Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s help.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe gave her hand to Sissy, as if she meant with her help too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your wretched brother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98Do you think he had\r\nplanned this robbery, when he went with you to the lodging?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fear so, father.  I know he had wanted money very much, and had spent\r\na great deal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The poor man being about to leave the town, it came into his evil brain\r\nto cast suspicion on him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it must have flashed upon him while he sat there, father.  For I\r\nasked him to go there with me.  The visit did not originate with him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He had some conversation with the poor man.  Did he take him aside?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He took him out of the room.  I asked him afterwards, why he had done\r\nso, and he made a plausible excuse; but since last night, father, and\r\nwhen I remember the circumstances by its light, I am afraid I can imagine\r\ntoo truly what passed between them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me know,\xe2\x80\x99 said her father, \xe2\x80\x98if your thoughts present your guilty\r\nbrother in the same dark view as mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fear, father,\xe2\x80\x99 hesitated Louisa, \xe2\x80\x98that he must have made some\r\nrepresentation to Stephen Blackpool\xe2\x80\x94perhaps in my name, perhaps in his\r\nown\xe2\x80\x94which induced him to do in good faith and honesty, what he had never\r\ndone before, and to wait about the Bank those two or three nights before\r\nhe left the town.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Too plain!\xe2\x80\x99 returned the father.  \xe2\x80\x98Too plain!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe shaded his face, and remained silent for some moments.  Recovering\r\nhimself, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now, how is he to be found?  How is he to be saved from justice?  In\r\nthe few hours that I can possibly allow to elapse before I publish the\r\ntruth, how is he to be found by us, and only by us?  Ten thousand pounds\r\ncould not effect it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sissy has effected it, father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes to where she stood, like a good fairy in his house,\r\nand said in a tone of softened gratitude and grateful kindness, \xe2\x80\x98It is\r\nalways you, my child!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We had our fears,\xe2\x80\x99 Sissy explained, glancing at Louisa, \xe2\x80\x98before\r\nyesterday; and when I saw you brought to the side of the litter last\r\nnight, and heard what passed (being close to Rachael all the time), I\r\nwent to him when no one saw, and said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look at me.  See\r\nwhere your father is.  Escape at once, for his sake and your own!\xe2\x80\x9d  He\r\nwas in a tremble before I whispered to him, and he started and trembled\r\nmore then, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere can I go?  I have very little money, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know who will hide me!\xe2\x80\x9d  I thought of father\xe2\x80\x99s old circus.  I have\r\nnot forgotten where Mr. Sleary goes at this time of year, and I read of\r\nhim in a paper only the other day.  I told him to hurry there, and tell\r\nhis name, and ask Mr. Sleary to hide him till I came.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get to him\r\nbefore the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  And I saw him shrink away among the\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank Heaven!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed his father.  \xe2\x80\x98He may be got abroad yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was the more hopeful as the town to which Sissy had directed him was\r\nwithin three hours\xe2\x80\x99 journey of Liverpool, whence he could be swiftly\r\ndispatched to any part of the world.  But, caution being necessary in\r\ncommunicating with him\xe2\x80\x94for there was a greater danger every moment of his\r\nbeing suspected now, and nobody could be sure at heart but that Mr.\r\nBounderby himself, in a bullying vein of public zeal, might play a Roman\r\npart\xe2\x80\x94it was consented that Sissy and Louisa should repair to the place in\r\nquestion, by a circuitous course, alone; and that the unhappy father,\r\nsetting forth in an opposite direction, should get round to the same\r\nbourne by another and wider route.  It was further agreed that he should\r\nnot present himself to Mr. Sleary, lest his intentions should be\r\nmistrusted, or the intelligence of his arrival should cause his son to\r\ntake flight anew; but, that the communication should be left to Sissy and\r\nLouisa to open; and that they should inform the cause of so much misery\r\nand disgrace, of his father\xe2\x80\x99s being at hand and of the purpose for which\r\nthey had come.  When these arrangements had been well considered and were\r\nfully understood by all three, it was time to begin to carry them into\r\nexecution.  Early in the afternoon, Mr. Gradgrind walked direct from his\r\nown house into the country, to be taken up on the line by which he was to\r\ntravel; and at night the remaining two set forth upon their different\r\ncourse, encouraged by not seeing any face they knew.\r\n\r\nThe two travelled all night, except when they were left, for odd numbers\r\nof minutes, at branch-places, up illimitable flights of steps, or down\r\nwells\xe2\x80\x94which was the only variety of those branches\xe2\x80\x94and, early in the\r\nmorning, were turned out on a swamp, a mile or two from the town they\r\nsought.  From this dismal spot they were rescued by a savage old\r\npostilion, who happened to be up early, kicking a horse in a fly: and so\r\nwere smuggled into the town by all the back lanes where the pigs lived:\r\nwhich, although not a magnificent or even savoury approach, was, as is\r\nusual in such cases, the legitimate highway.\r\n\r\nThe first thing they saw on entering the town was the skeleton of\r\nSleary\xe2\x80\x99s Circus.  The company had departed for another town more than\r\ntwenty miles off, and had opened there last night.  The connection\r\nbetween the two places was by a hilly turnpike-road, and the travelling\r\non that road was very slow.  Though they took but a hasty breakfast, and\r\nno rest (which it would have been in vain to seek under such anxious\r\ncircumstances), it was noon before they began to find the bills of\r\nSleary\xe2\x80\x99s Horse-riding on barns and walls, and one o\xe2\x80\x99clock when they\r\nstopped in the market-place.\r\n\r\nA Grand Morning Performance by the Riders, commencing at that very hour,\r\nwas in course of announcement by the bellman as they set their feet upon\r\nthe stones of the street.  Sissy recommended that, to avoid making\r\ninquiries and attracting attention in the town, they should present\r\nthemselves to pay at the door.  If Mr. Sleary were taking the money, he\r\nwould be sure to know her, and would proceed with discretion.  If he were\r\nnot, he would be sure to see them inside; and, knowing what he had done\r\nwith the fugitive, would proceed with discretion still.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they repaired, with fluttering hearts, to the well-remembered\r\nbooth.  The flag with the inscription SLEARY\xe2\x80\x99S HORSE-RIDING was there;\r\nand the Gothic niche was there; but Mr. Sleary was not there.  Master\r\nKidderminster, grown too maturely turfy to be received by the wildest\r\ncredulity as Cupid any more, had yielded to the invincible force of\r\ncircumstances (and his beard), and, in the capacity of a man who made\r\nhimself generally useful, presided on this occasion over the\r\nexchequer\xe2\x80\x94having also a drum in reserve, on which to expend his leisure\r\nmoments and superfluous forces.  In the extreme sharpness of his look out\r\nfor base coin, Mr. Kidderminster, as at present situated, never saw\r\nanything but money; so Sissy passed him unrecognised, and they went in.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Japan, on a steady old white horse stencilled with black\r\nspots, was twirling five wash-hand basins at once, as it is the favourite\r\nrecreation of that monarch to do.  Sissy, though well acquainted with his\r\nRoyal line, had no personal knowledge of the present Emperor, and his\r\nreign was peaceful.  Miss Josephine Sleary, in her celebrated graceful\r\nEquestrian Tyrolean Flower Act, was then announced by a new clown (who\r\nhumorously said Cauliflower Act), and Mr. Sleary appeared, leading her\r\nin.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleary had only made one cut at the Clown with his long whip-lash,\r\nand the Clown had only said, \xe2\x80\x98If you do it again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll throw the horse at\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x99 when Sissy was recognised both by father and daughter.  But they\r\ngot through the Act with great self-possession; and Mr. Sleary, saving\r\nfor the first instant, conveyed no more expression into his locomotive\r\neye than into his fixed one.  The performance seemed a little long to\r\nSissy and Louisa, particularly when it stopped to afford the Clown an\r\nopportunity of telling Mr. Sleary (who said \xe2\x80\x98Indeed, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 to all his\r\nobservations in the calmest way, and with his eye on the house) about two\r\nlegs sitting on three legs looking at one leg, when in came four legs,\r\nand laid hold of one leg, and up got two legs, caught hold of three legs,\r\nand threw \xe2\x80\x99em at four legs, who ran away with one leg.  For, although an\r\ningenious Allegory relating to a butcher, a three-legged stool, a dog,\r\nand a leg of mutton, this narrative consumed time; and they were in great\r\nsuspense.  At last, however, little fair-haired Josephine made her\r\ncurtsey amid great applause; and the Clown, left alone in the ring, had\r\njust warmed himself, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Now _I_\xe2\x80\x99ll have a turn!\xe2\x80\x99 when Sissy was\r\ntouched on the shoulder, and beckoned out.\r\n\r\nShe took Louisa with her; and they were received by Mr. Sleary in a very\r\nlittle private apartment, with canvas sides, a grass floor, and a wooden\r\nceiling all aslant, on which the box company stamped their approbation,\r\nas if they were coming through.  \xe2\x80\x98Thethilia,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Sleary, who had\r\nbrandy and water at hand, \xe2\x80\x98it doth me good to thee you.  You wath alwayth\r\na favourite with uth, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve done uth credith thinth the old timeth\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m thure.  You mutht thee our people, my dear, afore we thpeak of\r\nbithnith, or they\xe2\x80\x99ll break their hearth\xe2\x80\x94ethpethially the women.

Childerth, and thee hath\r\ngot a boy, and though he\xe2\x80\x99th only three yearth old, he thtickth on to any\r\npony you can bring againtht him.  He\xe2\x80\x99th named The Little Wonder of\r\nThcolathtic Equitation; and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t hear of that boy at Athley\xe2\x80\x99th,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll hear of him at Parith.  And you recollect Kidderminthter, that\r\nwath thought to be rather thweet upon yourthelf?  Well.  He\xe2\x80\x99th married\r\ntoo.  Married a widder.  Old enough to be hith mother.  Thee wath\r\nTightrope, thee wath, and now thee\xe2\x80\x99th nothing\xe2\x80\x94on accounth of fat.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got two children, tho we\xe2\x80\x99re thtrong in the Fairy bithnith and the\r\nNurthery dodge.

And you remember Emma Gordon, my dear, ath wath\r\na\xe2\x80\x99motht a mother to you?  Of courthe you do; I needn\xe2\x80\x99t athk.  Well!\r\nEmma, thee lotht her huthband.  He wath throw\xe2\x80\x99d a heavy back-fall off a\r\nElephant in a thort of a Pagoda thing ath the Thultan of the Indieth, and\r\nhe never got the better of it; and thee married a thecond time\xe2\x80\x94married a\r\nCheethemonger ath fell in love with her from the front\xe2\x80\x94and he\xe2\x80\x99th a\r\nOvertheer and makin\xe2\x80\x99 a fortun.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThese various changes, Mr. Sleary, very short of breath now, related with\r\ngreat heartiness, and with a wonderful kind of innocence, considering\r\nwhat a bleary and brandy-and-watery old veteran he was.  Afterwards he\r\nbrought in Josephine, and E. W. B. Childers (rather deeply lined in the\r\njaws by daylight), and the Little Wonder of Scholastic Equitation, and in\r\na word, all the company.  Amazing creatures they were in Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\nso white and pink of complexion, so scant of dress, and so demonstrative\r\nof leg; but it was very agreeable to see them crowding about Sissy, and\r\nvery natural in Sissy to be unable to refrain from tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!  Now Thethilia hath kithd all the children, and hugged all the\r\nwomen, and thaken handth all round with all the men, clear, every one of\r\nyou, and ring in the band for the thecond part!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were gone, he continued in a low tone.  \xe2\x80\x98Now, Thethilia,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t athk to know any thecreth, but I thuppothe I may conthider thith\r\nto be Mith Thquire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is his sister.  Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And t\xe2\x80\x99other on\xe2\x80\x99th daughter.  That\xe2\x80\x99h what I mean.  Hope I thee you well,\r\nmith.  And I hope the Thquire\xe2\x80\x99th well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My father will be here soon,\xe2\x80\x99 said Louisa, anxious to bring him to the\r\npoint.  \xe2\x80\x98Is my brother safe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thafe and thound!\xe2\x80\x99 he replied.  \xe2\x80\x98I want you jutht to take a peep at the\r\nRing, mith, through here.  Thethilia, you know the dodgeth; find a\r\nthpy-hole for yourthelf.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey each looked through a chink in the boards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99h Jack the Giant Killer\xe2\x80\x94piethe of comic infant bithnith,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nSleary.  \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99th a property-houthe, you thee, for Jack to hide in;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99th my Clown with a thauthepan-lid and a thpit, for Jack\xe2\x80\x99th\r\nthervant; there\xe2\x80\x99th little Jack himthelf in a thplendid thoot of armour;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99th two comic black thervanth twithe ath big ath the houthe, to\r\nthtand by it and to bring it in and clear it; and the Giant (a very\r\necthpenthive bathket one), he an\xe2\x80\x99t on yet.  Now, do you thee \xe2\x80\x99em all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 they both said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look at \xe2\x80\x99em again,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sleary, \xe2\x80\x98look at \xe2\x80\x99em well.  You thee em all?\r\nVery good.  Now, mith;\xe2\x80\x99 he put a form for them to sit on; \xe2\x80\x98I have my\r\nopinionth, and the Thquire your father hath hith.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know\r\nwhat your brother\xe2\x80\x99th been up to; ith better for me not to know.  All I\r\nthay ith, the Thquire hath thtood by Thethilia, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll thtand by the\r\nThquire.  Your brother ith one them black thervanth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa uttered an exclamation, partly of distress, partly of\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ith a fact,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sleary, \xe2\x80\x98and even knowin\xe2\x80\x99 it, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put your\r\nfinger on him.  Let the Thquire come.  I thall keep your brother here\r\nafter the performanth.  I thant undreth him, nor yet wath hith paint off.\r\nLet the Thquire come here after the performanth, or come here yourthelf\r\nafter the performanth, and you thall find your brother, and have the\r\nwhole plathe to talk to him in.  Never mind the lookth of him, ath long\r\nath he\xe2\x80\x99th well hid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa, with many thanks and with a lightened load, detained Mr. Sleary\r\nno longer then.  She left her love for her brother, with her eyes full of\r\ntears; and she and Sissy went away until later in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind arrived within an hour afterwards.  He too had encountered\r\nno one whom he knew; and was now sanguine with Sleary\xe2\x80\x99s assistance, of\r\ngetting his disgraced son to Liverpool in the night.  As neither of the\r\nthree could be his companion without almost identifying him under any\r\ndisguise, he prepared a letter to a correspondent whom he could trust,\r\nbeseeching him to ship the bearer off at any cost, to North or South\r\nAmerica, or any distant part of the world to which he could be the most\r\nspeedily and privately dispatched.\r\n\r\nThis done, they walked about, waiting for the Circus to be quite vacated;\r\nnot only by the audience, but by the company and by the horses.  After\r\nwatching it a long time, they saw Mr. Sleary bring out a chair and sit\r\ndown by the side-door, smoking; as if that were his signal that they\r\nmight approach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your thervant, Thquire,\xe2\x80\x99 was his cautious salutation as they passed in.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you want me you\xe2\x80\x99ll find me here.  You muthn\xe2\x80\x99t mind your thon having a\r\ncomic livery on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey all three went in; and Mr. Gradgrind sat down forlorn, on the\r\nClown\xe2\x80\x99s performing chair in the middle of the ring.  On one of the back\r\nbenches, remote in the subdued light and the strangeness of the place,\r\nsat the villainous whelp, sulky to the last, whom he had the misery to\r\ncall his son.\r\n\r\nIn a preposterous coat, like a beadle\xe2\x80\x99s, with cuffs and flaps exaggerated\r\nto an unspeakable extent; in an immense waistcoat, knee-breeches, buckled\r\nshoes, and a mad cocked hat; with nothing fitting him, and everything of\r\ncoarse material, moth-eaten and full of holes; with seams in his black\r\nface, where fear and heat had started through the greasy composition\r\ndaubed all over it; anything so grimly, detestably, ridiculously shameful\r\nas the whelp in his comic livery, Mr. Gradgrind never could by any other\r\nmeans have believed in, weighable and measurable fact though it was.  And\r\none of his model children had come to this!\r\n\r\nAt first the whelp would not draw any nearer, but persisted in remaining\r\nup there by himself.  Yielding at length, if any concession so sullenly\r\nmade can be called yielding, to the entreaties of Sissy\xe2\x80\x94for Louisa he\r\ndisowned altogether\xe2\x80\x94he came down, bench by bench, until he stood in the\r\nsawdust, on the verge of the circle, as far as possible, within its\r\nlimits from where his father sat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How was this done?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How was what done?\xe2\x80\x99 moodily answered the son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This robbery,\xe2\x80\x99 said the father, raising his voice upon the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I forced the safe myself over night, and shut it up ajar before I went\r\naway.  I had had the key that was found, made long before.  I dropped it\r\nthat morning, that it might be supposed to have been used.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nthe money all at once.  I pretended to put my balance away every night,\r\nbut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.  Now you know all about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If a thunderbolt had fallen on me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the father, \xe2\x80\x98it would have\r\nshocked me less than this!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why,\xe2\x80\x99 grumbled the son.  \xe2\x80\x98So many people are employed in\r\nsituations of trust; so many people, out of so many, will be dishonest.\r\nI have heard you talk, a hundred times, of its being a law.  How can _I_\r\nhelp laws?  You have comforted others with such things, father.  Comfort\r\nyourself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe father buried his face in his hands, and the son stood in his\r\ndisgraceful grotesqueness, biting straw: his hands, with the black partly\r\nworn away inside, looking like the hands of a monkey.  The evening was\r\nfast closing in; and from time to time, he turned the whites of his eyes\r\nrestlessly and impatiently towards his father.  They were the only parts\r\nof his face that showed any life or expression, the pigment upon it was\r\nso thick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must be got to Liverpool, and sent abroad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose I must.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t be more miserable anywhere,\xe2\x80\x99 whimpered the\r\nwhelp, \xe2\x80\x98than I have been here, ever since I can remember.  That\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind went to the door, and returned with Sleary, to whom he\r\nsubmitted the question, How to get this deplorable object away?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking of it, Thquire.  There\xe2\x80\x99th not muth time to\r\nlothe, tho you muth thay yeth or no.  Ith over twenty mileth to the rail.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99th a coath in half an hour, that goeth _to_ the rail, \xe2\x80\x98purpothe to\r\ncath the mail train.  That train will take him right to Liverpool.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But look at him,\xe2\x80\x99 groaned Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98Will any coach\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that he thould go in the comic livery,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sleary.  \xe2\x80\x98Thay\r\nthe word, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a Jothkin of him, out of the wardrobe, in five\r\nminutes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A Jothkin\xe2\x80\x94a Carter.  Make up your mind quick, Thquire.  There\xe2\x80\x99ll be beer\r\nto feth.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met with nothing but beer ath\xe2\x80\x99ll ever clean a comic\r\nblackamoor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind rapidly assented; Mr. Sleary rapidly turned out from a box,\r\na smock frock, a felt hat, and other essentials; the whelp rapidly\r\nchanged clothes behind a screen of baize; Mr. Sleary rapidly brought\r\nbeer, and washed him white again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sleary, \xe2\x80\x98come along to the coath, and jump up behind; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nwith you there, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll thuppothe you one of my people.  Thay\r\nfarewell to your family, and tharp\xe2\x80\x99th the word.\xe2\x80\x99  With which he\r\ndelicately retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is your letter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind.  \xe2\x80\x98All necessary means will be\r\nprovided for you.  Atone, by repentance and better conduct, for the\r\nshocking action you have committed, and the dreadful consequences to\r\nwhich it has led.  Give me your hand, my poor boy, and may God forgive\r\nyou as I do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their\r\npathetic tone.  But, when Louisa opened her arms, he repulsed her afresh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not you.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have anything to say to you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Tom, Tom, do we end so, after all my love!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After all your love!\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, obdurately.  \xe2\x80\x98Pretty love!  Leaving\r\nold Bounderby to himself, and packing my best friend Mr. Harthouse off,\r\nand going home just when I was in the greatest danger.  Pretty love that!\r\nComing out with every word about our having gone to that place, when you\r\nsaw the net was gathering round me.  Pretty love that!  You have\r\nregularly given me up.  You never cared for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tharp\xe2\x80\x99th the word!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sleary, at the door.\r\n\r\nThey all confusedly went out: Louisa crying to him that she forgave him,\r\nand loved him still, and that he would one day be sorry to have left her\r\nso, and glad to think of these her last words, far away: when some one\r\nran against them.  Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy, who were both before him\r\nwhile his sister yet clung to his shoulder, stopped and recoiled.\r\n\r\nFor, there was Bitzer, out of breath, his thin lips parted, his thin\r\nnostrils distended, his white eyelashes quivering, his colourless face\r\nmore colourless than ever, as if he ran himself into a white heat, when\r\nother people ran themselves into a glow.  There he stood, panting and\r\nheaving, as if he had never stopped since the night, now long ago, when\r\nhe had run them down before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to interfere with your plans,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bitzer, shaking his head,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but I can\xe2\x80\x99t allow myself to be done by horse-riders.  I must have young\r\nMr. Tom; he mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be got away by horse-riders; here he is in a smock\r\nfrock, and I must have him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy the collar, too, it seemed.  For, so he took possession of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY went back into the booth, Sleary shutting the door to keep intruders\r\nout.  Bitzer, still holding the paralysed culprit by the collar, stood in\r\nthe Ring, blinking at his old patron through the darkness of the\r\ntwilight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bitzer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, broken down, and miserably submissive to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x98have you a heart?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The circulation, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bitzer, smiling at the oddity of the\r\nquestion, \xe2\x80\x98couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be carried on without one.  No man, sir, acquainted\r\nwith the facts established by Harvey relating to the circulation of the\r\nblood, can doubt that I have a heart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it accessible,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98to any compassionate\r\ninfluence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is accessible to Reason, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the excellent young man.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And to nothing else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey stood looking at each other; Mr. Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s face as white as the\r\npursuer\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What motive\xe2\x80\x94even what motive in reason\xe2\x80\x94can you have for preventing the\r\nescape of this wretched youth,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98and crushing his\r\nmiserable father?  See his sister here.  Pity us!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bitzer, in a very business-like and logical manner,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98since you ask me what motive I have in reason, for taking young Mr. Tom\r\nback to Coketown, it is only reasonable to let you know.  I have\r\nsuspected young Mr. Tom of this bank-robbery from the first.  I had had\r\nmy eye upon him before that time, for I knew his ways.  I have kept my\r\nobservations to myself, but I have made them; and I have got ample proofs\r\nagainst him now, besides his running away, and besides his own\r\nconfession, which I was just in time to overhear.  I had the pleasure of\r\nwatching your house yesterday morning, and following you here.  I am\r\ngoing to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, in order to deliver him\r\nover to Mr. Bounderby.  Sir, I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby\r\nwill then promote me to young Mr. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s situation.  And I wish to have\r\nhis situation, sir, for it will be a rise to me, and will do me good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If this is solely a question of self-interest with you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Gradgrind\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bitzer; \xe2\x80\x98but I am\r\nsure you know that the whole social system is a question of\r\nself-interest.  What you must always appeal to, is a person\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself-interest.  It\xe2\x80\x99s your only hold.  We are so constituted.  I was\r\nbrought up in that catechism when I was very young, sir, as you are\r\naware.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What sum of money,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98will you set against your\r\nexpected promotion?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bitzer, \xe2\x80\x98for hinting at the proposal; but I\r\nwill not set any sum against it.  Knowing that your clear head would\r\npropose that alternative, I have gone over the calculations in my mind;\r\nand I find that to compound a felony, even on very high terms indeed,\r\nwould not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the\r\nBank.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bitzer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, stretching out his hands as though he would\r\nhave said, See how miserable I am!  \xe2\x80\x98Bitzer, I have but one chance left\r\nto soften you.  You were many years at my school.  If, in remembrance of\r\nthe pains bestowed upon you there, you can persuade yourself in any\r\ndegree to disregard your present interest and release my son, I entreat\r\nand pray you to give him the benefit of that remembrance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I really wonder, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined the old pupil in an argumentative\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x98to find you taking a position so untenable.  My schooling was\r\npaid for; it was a bargain; and when I came away, the bargain ended.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was a fundamental principle of the Gradgrind philosophy that\r\neverything was to be paid for.  Nobody was ever on any account to give\r\nanybody anything, or render anybody help without purchase.  Gratitude was\r\nto be abolished, and the virtues springing from it were not to be.  Every\r\ninch of the existence of mankind, from birth to death, was to be a\r\nbargain across a counter.  And if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to Heaven that way, it\r\nwas not a politico-economical place, and we had no business there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny,\xe2\x80\x99 added Bitzer, \xe2\x80\x98that my schooling was cheap.  But that\r\ncomes right, sir.  I was made in the cheapest market, and have to dispose\r\nof myself in the dearest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was a little troubled here, by Louisa and Sissy crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t do that,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s of no use doing that: it only\r\nworries.  You seem to think that I have some animosity against young Mr.\r\nTom; whereas I have none at all.  I am only going, on the reasonable\r\ngrounds I have mentioned, to take him back to Coketown.  If he was to\r\nresist, I should set up the cry of Stop thief!  But, he won\xe2\x80\x99t resist, you\r\nmay depend upon it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Sleary, who with his mouth open and his rolling eye as immovably\r\njammed in his head as his fixed one, had listened to these doctrines with\r\nprofound attention, here stepped forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thquire, you know perfectly well, and your daughter knowth perfectly\r\nwell (better than you, becauthe I thed it to her), that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat your thon had done, and that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to know\xe2\x80\x94I thed it wath\r\nbetter not, though I only thought, then, it wath thome thkylarking.\r\nHowever, thith young man having made it known to be a robbery of a bank,\r\nwhy, that\xe2\x80\x99h a theriouth thing; muth too theriouth a thing for me to\r\ncompound, ath thith young man hath very properly called it.\r\nConthequently, Thquire, you muthn\xe2\x80\x99t quarrel with me if I take thith young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99th thide, and thay he\xe2\x80\x99th right and there\xe2\x80\x99th no help for it.  But I\r\ntell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do, Thquire; I\xe2\x80\x99ll drive your thon and thith young man\r\nover to the rail, and prevent expothure here.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t conthent to do\r\nmore, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFresh lamentations from Louisa, and deeper affliction on Mr. Gradgrind\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart, followed this desertion of them by their last friend.  But, Sissy\r\nglanced at him with great attention; nor did she in her own breast\r\nmisunderstand him.  As they were all going out again, he favoured her\r\nwith one slight roll of his movable eye, desiring her to linger behind.\r\nAs he locked the door, he said excitedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Thquire thtood by you, Thethilia, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll thtand by the Thquire.\r\nMore than that: thith ith a prethiouth rathcal, and belongth to that\r\nbluthtering Cove that my people nearly pitht out o\xe2\x80\x99 winder.  It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a\r\ndark night; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a horthe that\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything but thpeak; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\npony that\xe2\x80\x99ll go fifteen mile an hour with Childerth driving of him; I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a dog that\xe2\x80\x99ll keep a man to one plathe four-and-twenty hourth.  Get a\r\nword with the young Thquire.  Tell him, when he theeth our horthe begin\r\nto danthe, not to be afraid of being thpilt, but to look out for a\r\npony-gig coming up.  Tell him, when he theeth that gig clothe by, to jump\r\ndown, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll take him off at a rattling pathe.  If my dog leth thith\r\nyoung man thtir a peg on foot, I give him leave to go.  And if my horthe\r\never thtirth from that thpot where he beginth a danthing, till the\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know him?\xe2\x80\x94Tharp\xe2\x80\x99th the word!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe word was so sharp, that in ten minutes Mr. Childers, sauntering about\r\nthe market-place in a pair of slippers, had his cue, and Mr. Sleary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nequipage was ready.  It was a fine sight, to behold the learned dog\r\nbarking round it, and Mr. Sleary instructing him, with his one\r\npracticable eye, that Bitzer was the object of his particular attentions.\r\nSoon after dark they all three got in and started; the learned dog (a\r\nformidable creature) already pinning Bitzer with his eye, and sticking\r\nclose to the wheel on his side, that he might be ready for him in the\r\nevent of his showing the slightest disposition to alight.\r\n\r\nThe other three sat up at the inn all night in great suspense.  At eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning Mr. Sleary and the dog reappeared: both in high\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, Thquire!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Sleary, \xe2\x80\x98your thon may be aboard-a-thip by\r\nthith time.  Childerth took him off, an hour and a half after we left\r\nthere latht night.  The horthe danthed the polka till he wath dead beat\r\n(he would have walthed if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been in harneth), and then I gave him\r\nthe word and he went to thleep comfortable.  When that prethiouth young\r\nRathcal thed he\xe2\x80\x99d go for\xe2\x80\x99ard afoot, the dog hung on to hith\r\nneck-hankercher with all four legth in the air and pulled him down and\r\nrolled him over.  Tho he come back into the drag, and there he that,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99till I turned the horthe\xe2\x80\x99th head, at half-patht thixth thith morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind overwhelmed him with thanks, of course; and hinted as\r\ndelicately as he could, at a handsome remuneration in money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want money mythelf, Thquire; but Childerth ith a family man, and\r\nif you wath to like to offer him a five-pound note, it mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nunactheptable.  Likewithe if you wath to thtand a collar for the dog, or\r\na thet of bellth for the horthe, I thould be very glad to take \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nBrandy and water I alwayth take.\xe2\x80\x99  He had already called for a glass, and\r\nnow called for another.  \xe2\x80\x98If you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think it going too far,\r\nThquire, to make a little thpread for the company at about three and\r\nthixth ahead, not reckoning Luth, it would make \xe2\x80\x99em happy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll these little tokens of his gratitude, Mr. Gradgrind very willingly\r\nundertook to render.  Though he thought them far too slight, he said, for\r\nsuch a service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, Thquire; then, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only give a Horthe-riding, a\r\nbethpeak, whenever you can, you\xe2\x80\x99ll more than balanthe the account.  Now,\r\nThquire, if your daughter will ethcuthe me, I thould like one parting\r\nword with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLouisa and Sissy withdrew into an adjoining room; Mr. Sleary, stirring\r\nand drinking his brandy and water as he stood, went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thquire,\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be told that dogth ith wonderful animalth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Their instinct,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98is surprising.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whatever you call it\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m bletht if _I_ know what to call it\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94said\r\nSleary, \xe2\x80\x98it ith athtonithing.  The way in whith a dog\xe2\x80\x99ll find you\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndithtanthe he\xe2\x80\x99ll come!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His scent,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gradgrind, \xe2\x80\x98being so fine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m bletht if I know what to call it,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Sleary, shaking his\r\nhead, \xe2\x80\x98but I have had dogth find me, Thquire, in a way that made me think\r\nwhether that dog hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone to another dog, and thed, \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t happen\r\nto know a perthon of the name of Thleary, do you?  Perthon of the name of\r\nThleary, in the Horthe-Riding way\xe2\x80\x94thtout man\xe2\x80\x94game eye?\xe2\x80\x9d  And whether that\r\ndog mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have thed, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t thay I know him mythelf, but I\r\nknow a dog that I think would be likely to be acquainted with him.\xe2\x80\x9d  And\r\nwhether that dog mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought it over, and thed, \xe2\x80\x9cThleary,\r\nThleary!  O yeth, to be thure!  A friend of mine menthioned him to me at\r\none time.  I can get you hith addreth directly.\xe2\x80\x9d  In conthequenth of my\r\nbeing afore the public, and going about tho muth, you thee, there mutht\r\nbe a number of dogth acquainted with me, Thquire, that _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind seemed to be quite confounded by this speculation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any way,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sleary, after putting his lips to his brandy and water,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ith fourteen month ago, Thquire, thinthe we wath at Chethter.  We wath\r\ngetting up our Children in the Wood one morning, when there cometh into\r\nour Ring, by the thtage door, a dog.  He had travelled a long way, he\r\nwath in a very bad condithon, he wath lame, and pretty well blind.  He\r\nwent round to our children, one after another, as if he wath a theeking\r\nfor a child he know\xe2\x80\x99d; and then he come to me, and throwd hithelf up\r\nbehind, and thtood on hith two forelegth, weak ath he wath, and then he\r\nwagged hith tail and died.  Thquire, that dog wath Merrylegth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sissy\xe2\x80\x99s father\xe2\x80\x99s dog!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thethilia\xe2\x80\x99th father\xe2\x80\x99th old dog.  Now, Thquire, I can take my oath, from\r\nmy knowledge of that dog, that that man wath dead\xe2\x80\x94and buried\xe2\x80\x94afore that\r\ndog come back to me.  Joth\xe2\x80\x99phine and Childerth and me talked it over a\r\nlong time, whether I thould write or not.  But we agreed, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.  There\xe2\x80\x99th\r\nnothing comfortable to tell; why unthettle her mind, and make her\r\nunhappy?\xe2\x80\x9d  Tho, whether her father bathely detherted her; or whether he\r\nbroke hith own heart alone, rather than pull her down along with him;\r\nnever will be known, now, Thquire, till\xe2\x80\x94no, not till we know how the\r\ndogth findth uth out!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She keeps the bottle that he sent her for, to this hour; and she will\r\nbelieve in his affection to the last moment of her life,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nGradgrind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It theemth to prethent two thingth to a perthon, don\xe2\x80\x99t it, Thquire?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr. Sleary, musing as he looked down into the depths of his brandy\r\nand water: \xe2\x80\x98one, that there ith a love in the world, not all\r\nThelf-interetht after all, but thomething very different; t\xe2\x80\x99other, that\r\nit hath a way of ith own of calculating or not calculating, whith\r\nthomehow or another ith at leatht ath hard to give a name to, ath the\r\nwayth of the dogth ith!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gradgrind looked out of window, and made no reply.  Mr. Sleary\r\nemptied his glass and recalled the ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thethilia my dear, kith me and good-bye!  Mith Thquire, to thee you\r\ntreating of her like a thithter, and a thithter that you trutht and\r\nhonour with all your heart and more, ith a very pretty thight to me.  I\r\nhope your brother may live to be better detherving of you, and a greater\r\ncomfort to you.  Thquire, thake handth, firtht and latht!  Don\xe2\x80\x99t be croth\r\nwith uth poor vagabondth.  People mutht be amuthed.  They can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nalwayth a learning, nor yet they can\xe2\x80\x99t be alwayth a working, they an\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmade for it.  You _mutht_ have uth, Thquire.  Do the withe thing and the\r\nkind thing too, and make the betht of uth; not the wurtht!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I never thought before,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Sleary, putting his head in at the\r\ndoor again to say it, \xe2\x80\x98that I wath tho muth of a Cackler!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nFINAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is a dangerous thing to see anything in the sphere of a vain\r\nblusterer, before the vain blusterer sees it himself.  Mr. Bounderby felt\r\nthat Mrs. Sparsit had audaciously anticipated him, and presumed to be\r\nwiser than he.  Inappeasably indignant with her for her triumphant\r\ndiscovery of Mrs. Pegler, he turned this presumption, on the part of a\r\nwoman in her dependent position, over and over in his mind, until it\r\naccumulated with turning like a great snowball.  At last he made the\r\ndiscovery that to discharge this highly connected female\xe2\x80\x94to have it in\r\nhis power to say, \xe2\x80\x98She was a woman of family, and wanted to stick to me,\r\nbut I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it, and got rid of her\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94would be to get the utmost\r\npossible amount of crowning glory out of the connection, and at the same\r\ntime to punish Mrs. Sparsit according to her deserts.\r\n\r\nFilled fuller than ever, with this great idea, Mr. Bounderby came in to\r\nlunch, and sat himself down in the dining-room of former days, where his\r\nportrait was.  Mrs. Sparsit sat by the fire, with her foot in her cotton\r\nstirrup, little thinking whither she was posting.\r\n\r\nSince the Pegler affair, this gentlewoman had covered her pity for Mr.\r\nBounderby with a veil of quiet melancholy and contrition.  In virtue\r\nthereof, it had become her habit to assume a woful look, which woful look\r\nshe now bestowed upon her patron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bounderby, in a very short,\r\nrough way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98do not bite my nose off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bite your nose off, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98_Your_ nose!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmeaning, as Mrs. Sparsit conceived, that it was too developed a nose for\r\nthe purpose.  After which offensive implication, he cut himself a crust\r\nof bread, and threw the knife down with a noise.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit took her foot out of her stirrup, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Bounderby,\r\nsir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr. Bounderby.  \xe2\x80\x98What are you staring at?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I ask, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, \xe2\x80\x98have you been ruffled this\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I inquire, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the injured woman, \xe2\x80\x98whether _I_ am the\r\nunfortunate cause of your having lost your temper?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, \xe2\x80\x98I am not come here to\r\nbe bullied.  A female may be highly connected, but she can\xe2\x80\x99t be permitted\r\nto bother and badger a man in my position, and I am not going to put up\r\nwith it.\xe2\x80\x99  (Mr. Bounderby felt it necessary to get on: foreseeing that if\r\nhe allowed of details, he would be beaten.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit first elevated, then knitted, her Coriolanian eyebrows;\r\ngathered up her work into its proper basket; and rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, majestically.  \xe2\x80\x98It is apparent to me that I am in your\r\nway at present.  I will retire to my own apartment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Allow me to open the door, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir; I can do it for myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better allow me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, passing her, and\r\ngetting his hand upon the lock; \xe2\x80\x98because I can take the opportunity of\r\nsaying a word to you, before you go.  Mrs. Sparsit, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I rather think\r\nyou are cramped here, do you know?  It appears to me, that, under my\r\nhumble roof, there\xe2\x80\x99s hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in\r\nother people\xe2\x80\x99s affairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Sparsit gave him a look of the darkest scorn, and said with great\r\npoliteness, \xe2\x80\x98Really, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been thinking it over, you see, since the late affairs have\r\nhappened, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby; \xe2\x80\x98and it appears to my poor judgment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!  Pray, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Sparsit interposed, with sprightly cheerfulness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t disparage your judgment.  Everybody knows how unerring Mr.\r\nBounderby\xe2\x80\x99s judgment is.  Everybody has had proofs of it.  It must be the\r\ntheme of general conversation.  Disparage anything in yourself but your\r\njudgment, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sparsit, laughing.\r\n\r\nMr. Bounderby, very red and uncomfortable, resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It appears to me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I say, that a different sort of establishment\r\naltogether would bring out a lady of _your_ powers.  Such an\r\nestablishment as your relation, Lady Scadgers\xe2\x80\x99s, now.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\r\nyou might find some affairs there, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, to interfere with?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It never occurred to me before, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit; \xe2\x80\x98but now\r\nyou mention it, should think it highly probable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then suppose you try, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bounderby, laying an envelope with a\r\ncheque in it in her little basket.  \xe2\x80\x98You can take your own time for\r\ngoing, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; but perhaps in the meanwhile, it will be more agreeable to\r\na lady of your powers of mind, to eat her meals by herself, and not to be\r\nintruded upon.  I really ought to apologise to you\xe2\x80\x94being only Josiah\r\nBounderby of Coketown\xe2\x80\x94for having stood in your light so long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t name it, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Sparsit.  \xe2\x80\x98If that portrait\r\ncould speak, sir\xe2\x80\x94but it has the advantage over the original of not\r\npossessing the power of committing itself and disgusting others,\xe2\x80\x94it would\r\ntestify, that a long period has elapsed since I first habitually\r\naddressed it as the picture of a Noodle.  Nothing that a Noodle does, can\r\nawaken surprise or indignation; the proceedings of a Noodle can only\r\ninspire contempt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus saying, Mrs. Sparsit, with her Roman features like a medal struck to\r\ncommemorate her scorn of Mr. Bounderby, surveyed him fixedly from head to\r\nfoot, swept disdainfully past him, and ascended the staircase.  Mr.\r\nBounderby closed the door, and stood before the fire; projecting himself\r\nafter his old explosive manner into his portrait\xe2\x80\x94and into futurity.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nInto how much of futurity?  He saw Mrs. Sparsit fighting out a daily\r\nfight at the points of all the weapons in the female armoury, with the\r\ngrudging, smarting, peevish, tormenting Lady Scadgers, still laid up in\r\nbed with her mysterious leg, and gobbling her insufficient income down by\r\nabout the middle of every quarter, in a mean little airless lodging, a\r\nmere closet for one, a mere crib for two; but did he see more?  Did he\r\ncatch any glimpse of himself making a show of Bitzer to strangers, as the\r\nrising young man, so devoted to his master\xe2\x80\x99s great merits, who had won\r\nyoung Tom\xe2\x80\x99s place, and had almost captured young Tom himself, in the\r\ntimes when by various rascals he was spirited away?  Did he see any faint\r\nreflection of his own image making a vain-glorious will, whereby\r\nfive-and-twenty Humbugs, past five-and-fifty years of age, each taking\r\nupon himself the name, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, should for ever dine\r\nin Bounderby Hall, for ever lodge in Bounderby buildings, for ever attend\r\na Bounderby chapel, for ever go to sleep under a Bounderby chaplain, for\r\never be supported out of a Bounderby estate, and for ever nauseate all\r\nhealthy stomachs, with a vast amount of Bounderby balderdash and bluster?\r\nHad he any prescience of the day, five years to come, when Josiah\r\nBounderby of Coketown was to die of a fit in the Coketown street, and\r\nthis same precious will was to begin its long career of quibble, plunder,\r\nfalse pretences, vile example, little service and much law?  Probably\r\nnot.  Yet the portrait was to see it all out.\r\n\r\nHere was Mr. Gradgrind on the same day, and in the same hour, sitting\r\nthoughtful in his own room.  How much of futurity did _he_ see?  Did he\r\nsee himself, a white-haired decrepit man, bending his hitherto inflexible\r\ntheories to appointed circumstances; making his facts and figures\r\nsubservient to Faith, Hope, and Charity; and no longer trying to grind\r\nthat Heavenly trio in his dusty little mills?  Did he catch sight of\r\nhimself, therefore much despised by his late political associates?  Did\r\nhe see them, in the era of its being quite settled that the national\r\ndustmen have only to do with one another, and owe no duty to an\r\nabstraction called a People, \xe2\x80\x98taunting the honourable gentleman\xe2\x80\x99 with\r\nthis and with that and with what not, five nights a-week, until the small\r\nhours of the morning?  Probably he had that much foreknowledge, knowing\r\nhis men.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nHere was Louisa on the night of the same day, watching the fire as in\r\ndays of yore, though with a gentler and a humbler face.  How much of the\r\nfuture might arise before _her_ vision?  Broadsides in the streets,\r\nsigned with her father\xe2\x80\x99s name, exonerating the late Stephen Blackpool,\r\nweaver, from misplaced suspicion, and publishing the guilt of his own\r\nson, with such extenuation as his years and temptation (he could not\r\nbring himself to add, his education) might beseech; were of the Present.\r\nSo, Stephen Blackpool\xe2\x80\x99s tombstone, with her father\xe2\x80\x99s record of his death,\r\nwas almost of the Present, for she knew it was to be.  These things she\r\ncould plainly see.  But, how much of the Future?\r\n\r\nA working woman, christened Rachael, after a long illness once again\r\nappearing at the ringing of the Factory bell, and passing to and fro at\r\nthe set hours, among the Coketown Hands; a woman of pensive beauty,\r\nalways dressed in black, but sweet-tempered and serene, and even\r\ncheerful; who, of all the people in the place, alone appeared to have\r\ncompassion on a degraded, drunken wretch of her own sex, who was\r\nsometimes seen in the town secretly begging of her, and crying to her; a\r\nwoman working, ever working, but content to do it, and preferring to do\r\nit as her natural lot, until she should be too old to labour any more?\r\nDid Louisa see this?  Such a thing was to be.\r\n\r\nA lonely brother, many thousands of miles away, writing, on paper blotted\r\nwith tears, that her words had too soon come true, and that all the\r\ntreasures in the world would be cheaply bartered for a sight of her dear\r\nface?  At length this brother coming nearer home, with hope of seeing\r\nher, and being delayed by illness; and then a letter, in a strange hand,\r\nsaying \xe2\x80\x98he died in hospital, of fever, such a day, and died in penitence\r\nand love of you: his last word being your name\xe2\x80\x99?  Did Louisa see these\r\nthings?  Such things were to be.\r\n\r\nHerself again a wife\xe2\x80\x94a mother\xe2\x80\x94lovingly watchful of her children, ever\r\ncareful that they should have a childhood of the mind no less than a\r\nchildhood of the body, as knowing it to be even a more beautiful thing,\r\nand a possession, any hoarded scrap of which, is a blessing and happiness\r\nto the wisest?  Did Louisa see this?  Such a thing was never to be.\r\n\r\nBut, happy Sissy\xe2\x80\x99s happy children loving her; all children loving her;\r\nshe, grown learned in childish lore; thinking no innocent and pretty\r\nfancy ever to be despised; trying hard to know her humbler\r\nfellow-creatures, and to beautify their lives of machinery and reality\r\nwith those imaginative graces and delights, without which the heart of\r\ninfancy will wither up, the sturdiest physical manhood will be morally\r\nstark death, and the plainest national prosperity figures can show, will\r\nbe the Writing on the Wall,\xe2\x80\x94she holding this course as part of no\r\nfantastic vow, or bond, or brotherhood, or sisterhood, or pledge, or\r\ncovenant, or fancy dress, or fancy fair; but simply as a duty to be\r\ndone,\xe2\x80\x94did Louisa see these things of herself?  These things were to be.\r\n\r\nDear reader!  It rests with you and me, whether, in our two fields of\r\naction, similar things shall be or not.  Let them be!  We shall sit with\r\nlighter bosoms on the hearth, to see the ashes of our fires turn gray and\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n{0}  _Reprinted Pieces_ was released as a separate eText by Project\r\nGutenberg, and is not included in this eText.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HARD TIMES***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 786-0.txt or 786-0.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/7/8/786\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
