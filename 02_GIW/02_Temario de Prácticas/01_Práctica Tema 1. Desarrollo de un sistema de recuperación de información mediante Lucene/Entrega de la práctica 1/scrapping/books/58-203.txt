There were no servants present, and the\r\ngentlemen, with chairs closely approaching, seemed to be discussing\r\nsome subject with great earnestness.\r\n\r\nFor convenience sake, we have said, hitherto, two _gentlemen_. One of\r\nthe parties, however, when critically examined, did not seem, strictly\r\nspeaking, to come under the species. He was a short, thick-set man,\r\nwith coarse, commonplace features, and that swaggering air of\r\npretension which marks a low man who is trying to elbow his way upward\r\nin the world. He was much over-dressed, in a gaudy vest of many colors,\r\na blue neckerchief, bedropped gayly with yellow spots, and arranged\r\nwith a flaunting tie, quite in keeping with the general air of the man.\r\nHis hands, large and coarse, were plentifully bedecked with rings; and\r\nhe wore a heavy gold watch-chain, with a bundle of seals of portentous\r\nsize, and a great variety of colors, attached to it,\xe2\x80\x94which, in the\r\nardor of conversation, he was in the habit of flourishing and jingling\r\nwith evident satisfaction. His conversation was in free and easy\r\ndefiance of Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Grammar,[1] and was garnished at convenient\r\nintervals with various profane expressions, which not even the desire\r\nto be graphic in our account shall induce us to transcribe.\r\n\r\n [1] English Grammar (1795), by Lindley Murray (1745-1826), the most\r\n authoritative American grammarian of his day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis companion, Mr. Shelby, had the appearance of a gentleman; and the\r\narrangements of the house, and the general air of the housekeeping,\r\nindicated easy, and even opulent circumstances. As we before stated,\r\nthe two were in the midst of an earnest conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the way I should arrange the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make trade that way\xe2\x80\x94I positively can\xe2\x80\x99t, Mr. Shelby,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nother, holding up a glass of wine between his eye and the light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the fact is, Haley, Tom is an uncommon fellow; he is certainly\r\nworth that sum anywhere,\xe2\x80\x94steady, honest, capable, manages my whole farm\r\nlike a clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean honest, as niggers go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, helping himself to a\r\nglass of brandy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I mean, really, Tom is a good, steady, sensible, pious fellow. He\r\ngot religion at a camp-meeting, four years ago; and I believe he really\r\n_did_ get it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve trusted him, since then, with everything I\r\nhave,\xe2\x80\x94money, house, horses,\xe2\x80\x94and let him come and go round the country;\r\nand I always found him true and square in everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome folks don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there is pious niggers Shelby,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley,\r\nwith a candid flourish of his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cbut _I do_. I had a fellow, now,\r\nin this yer last lot I took to Orleans\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98t was as good as a meetin, now,\r\nreally, to hear that critter pray; and he was quite gentle and quiet\r\nlike. He fetched me a good sum, too, for I bought him cheap of a man\r\nthat was \xe2\x80\x99bliged to sell out; so I realized six hundred on him. Yes, I\r\nconsider religion a valeyable thing in a nigger, when it\xe2\x80\x99s the genuine\r\narticle, and no mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s got the real article, if ever a fellow had,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the\r\nother. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, last fall, I let him go to Cincinnati alone, to do\r\nbusiness for me, and bring home five hundred dollars. \xe2\x80\x98Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 says I to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x98I trust you, because I think you\xe2\x80\x99re a Christian\xe2\x80\x94I know you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cheat.\xe2\x80\x99 Tom comes back, sure enough; I knew he would. Some low\r\nfellows, they say, said to him\xe2\x80\x94Tom, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you make tracks for\r\nCanada?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99Ah, master trusted me, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94they told me about\r\nit. I am sorry to part with Tom, I must say. You ought to let him cover\r\nthe whole balance of the debt; and you would, Haley, if you had any\r\nconscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got just as much conscience as any man in business can\r\nafford to keep,\xe2\x80\x94just a little, you know, to swear by, as \xe2\x80\x99t were,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe trader, jocularly; \xe2\x80\x9cand, then, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to do anything in reason\r\nto \xe2\x80\x99blige friends; but this yer, you see, is a leetle too hard on a\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x94a leetle too hard.\xe2\x80\x9d The trader sighed contemplatively, and\r\npoured out some more brandy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Haley, how will you trade?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, after an\r\nuneasy interval of silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you a boy or gal that you could throw in with Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHum!\xe2\x80\x94none that I could well spare; to tell the truth, it\xe2\x80\x99s only hard\r\nnecessity makes me willing to sell at all. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like parting with\r\nany of my hands, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the door opened, and a small quadroon boy, between four and five\r\nyears of age, entered the room. There was something in his appearance\r\nremarkably beautiful and engaging. His black hair, fine as floss silk,\r\nhung in glossy curls about his round, dimpled face, while a pair of\r\nlarge dark eyes, full of fire and softness, looked out from beneath the\r\nrich, long lashes, as he peered curiously into the apartment. A gay\r\nrobe of scarlet and yellow plaid, carefully made and neatly fitted, set\r\noff to advantage the dark and rich style of his beauty; and a certain\r\ncomic air of assurance, blended with bashfulness, showed that he had\r\nbeen not unused to being petted and noticed by his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHulloa, Jim Crow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, whistling, and snapping a bunch of\r\nraisins towards him, \xe2\x80\x9cpick that up, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child scampered, with all his little strength, after the prize,\r\nwhile his master laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Jim Crow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. The child came up, and the master\r\npatted the curly head, and chucked him under the chin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Jim, show this gentleman how you can dance and sing.\xe2\x80\x9d The boy\r\ncommenced one of those wild, grotesque songs common among the negroes,\r\nin a rich, clear voice, accompanying his singing with many comic\r\nevolutions of the hands, feet, and whole body, all in perfect time to\r\nthe music.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, throwing him a quarter of an orange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Jim, walk like old Uncle Cudjoe, when he has the rheumatism,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid his master.\r\n\r\nInstantly the flexible limbs of the child assumed the appearance of\r\ndeformity and distortion, as, with his back humped up, and his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstick in his hand, he hobbled about the room, his childish face drawn\r\ninto a doleful pucker, and spitting from right to left, in imitation of\r\nan old man.\r\n\r\nBoth gentlemen laughed uproariously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Jim,\xe2\x80\x9d said his master, \xe2\x80\x9cshow us how old Elder Robbins leads the\r\npsalm.\xe2\x80\x9d The boy drew his chubby face down to a formidable length, and\r\ncommenced toning a psalm tune through his nose, with imperturbable\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! bravo! what a young \xe2\x80\x99un!\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley; \xe2\x80\x9cthat chap\xe2\x80\x99s a case,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll promise. Tell you what,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, suddenly clapping his hand on\r\nMr. Shelby\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cfling in that chap, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll settle the\r\nbusiness\xe2\x80\x94I will. Come, now, if that ain\xe2\x80\x99t doing the thing up about the\r\nrightest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the door was pushed gently open, and a young quadroon\r\nwoman, apparently about twenty-five, entered the room.\r\n\r\nThere needed only a glance from the child to her, to identify her as\r\nits mother. There was the same rich, full, dark eye, with its long\r\nlashes; the same ripples of silky black hair. The brown of her\r\ncomplexion gave way on the cheek to a perceptible flush, which deepened\r\nas she saw the gaze of the strange man fixed upon her in bold and\r\nundisguised admiration. Her dress was of the neatest possible fit, and\r\nset off to advantage her finely moulded shape;\xe2\x80\x94a delicately formed hand\r\nand a trim foot and ankle were items of appearance that did not escape\r\nthe quick eye of the trader, well used to run up at a glance the points\r\nof a fine female article.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Eliza?\xe2\x80\x9d said her master, as she stopped and looked hesitatingly\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was looking for Harry, please, sir;\xe2\x80\x9d and the boy bounded toward her,\r\nshowing his spoils, which he had gathered in the skirt of his robe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, take him away then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby; and hastily she withdrew,\r\ncarrying the child on her arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jupiter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader, turning to him in admiration, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan article, now! You might make your fortune on that ar gal in Orleans,\r\nany day. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over a thousand, in my day, paid down for gals not a\r\nbit handsomer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make my fortune on her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, dryly; and,\r\nseeking to turn the conversation, he uncorked a bottle of fresh wine,\r\nand asked his companion\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital, sir,\xe2\x80\x94first chop!\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader; then turning, and slapping\r\nhis hand familiarly on Shelby\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, he added\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, how will you trade about the gal?\xe2\x80\x94what shall I say for\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99ll you take?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Haley, she is not to be sold,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shelby. \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife would not\r\npart with her for her weight in gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay! women always say such things, cause they ha\xe2\x80\x99nt no sort of\r\ncalculation. Just show \xe2\x80\x99em how many watches, feathers, and trinkets,\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s weight in gold would buy, and that alters the case, _I_ reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, Haley, this must not be spoken of; I say no, and I mean\r\nno,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shelby, decidedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me have the boy, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must\r\nown I\xe2\x80\x99ve come down pretty handsomely for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth can you want with the child?\xe2\x80\x9d said Shelby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a friend that\xe2\x80\x99s going into this yer branch of the\r\nbusiness\xe2\x80\x94wants to buy up handsome boys to raise for the market. Fancy\r\narticles entirely\xe2\x80\x94sell for waiters, and so on, to rich \xe2\x80\x99uns, that can\r\npay for handsome \xe2\x80\x99uns. It sets off one of yer great places\xe2\x80\x94a real\r\nhandsome boy to open door, wait, and tend. They fetch a good sum; and\r\nthis little devil is such a comical, musical concern, he\xe2\x80\x99s just the\r\narticle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not sell him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, thoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact\r\nis, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m a humane man, and I hate to take the boy from his mother,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, you do?\xe2\x80\x94La! yes\xe2\x80\x94something of that ar natur. I understand,\r\nperfectly. It is mighty onpleasant getting on with women, sometimes, I\r\nal\xe2\x80\x99ays hates these yer screechin,\xe2\x80\x99 screamin\xe2\x80\x99 times. They are _mighty_\r\nonpleasant; but, as I manages business, I generally avoids \xe2\x80\x99em, sir.\r\nNow, what if you get the girl off for a day, or a week, or so; then the\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x99s done quietly,\xe2\x80\x94all over before she comes home. Your wife might\r\nget her some ear-rings, or a new gown, or some such truck, to make up\r\nwith her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor bless ye, yes! These critters ain\xe2\x80\x99t like white folks, you know;\r\nthey gets over things, only manage right. Now, they say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley,\r\nassuming a candid and confidential air, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this kind o\xe2\x80\x99 trade is\r\nhardening to the feelings; but I never found it so. Fact is, I never\r\ncould do things up the way some fellers manage the business. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em as would pull a woman\xe2\x80\x99s child out of her arms, and set him up to\r\nsell, and she screechin\xe2\x80\x99 like mad all the time;\xe2\x80\x94very bad policy\xe2\x80\x94damages\r\nthe article\xe2\x80\x94makes \xe2\x80\x99em quite unfit for service sometimes. I knew a real\r\nhandsome gal once, in Orleans, as was entirely ruined by this sort o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhandling. The fellow that was trading for her didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her baby; and\r\nshe was one of your real high sort, when her blood was up. I tell you,\r\nshe squeezed up her child in her arms, and talked, and went on real\r\nawful. It kinder makes my blood run cold to think of \xe2\x80\x99t; and when they\r\ncarried off the child, and locked her up, she jest went ravin\xe2\x80\x99 mad, and\r\ndied in a week. Clear waste, sir, of a thousand dollars, just for want\r\nof management,\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s where \xe2\x80\x99t is. It\xe2\x80\x99s always best to do the humane\r\nthing, sir; that\xe2\x80\x99s been _my_ experience.\xe2\x80\x9d And the trader leaned back in\r\nhis chair, and folded his arm, with an air of virtuous decision,\r\napparently considering himself a second Wilberforce.\r\n\r\nThe subject appeared to interest the gentleman deeply; for while Mr.\r\nShelby was thoughtfully peeling an orange, Haley broke out afresh, with\r\nbecoming diffidence, but as if actually driven by the force of truth to\r\nsay a few words more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t look well, now, for a feller to be praisin\xe2\x80\x99 himself; but I\r\nsay it jest because it\xe2\x80\x99s the truth. I believe I\xe2\x80\x99m reckoned to bring in\r\nabout the finest droves of niggers that is brought in,\xe2\x80\x94at least, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen told so; if I have once, I reckon I have a hundred times,\xe2\x80\x94all in\r\ngood case,\xe2\x80\x94fat and likely, and I lose as few as any man in the\r\nbusiness. And I lays it all to my management, sir; and humanity, sir, I\r\nmay say, is the great pillar of _my_ management.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Shelby did not know what to say, and so he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been laughed at for my notions, sir, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talked\r\nto. They an\xe2\x80\x99t pop\xe2\x80\x99lar, and they an\xe2\x80\x99t common; but I stuck to \xe2\x80\x99em, sir;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve stuck to \xe2\x80\x99em, and realized well on \xe2\x80\x99em; yes, sir, they have paid\r\ntheir passage, I may say,\xe2\x80\x9d and the trader laughed at his joke.\r\n\r\nThere was something so piquant and original in these elucidations of\r\nhumanity, that Mr. Shelby could not help laughing in company. Perhaps\r\nyou laugh too, dear reader; but you know humanity comes out in a\r\nvariety of strange forms now-a-days, and there is no end to the odd\r\nthings that humane people will say and do.\r\n\r\nMr. Shelby\xe2\x80\x99s laugh encouraged the trader to proceed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s strange, now, but I never could beat this into people\xe2\x80\x99s heads.\r\nNow, there was Tom Loker, my old partner, down in Natchez; he was a\r\nclever fellow, Tom was, only the very devil with niggers,\xe2\x80\x94on principle\r\n\xe2\x80\x99t was, you see, for a better hearted feller never broke bread; \xe2\x80\x99t was\r\nhis _system_, sir. I used to talk to Tom. \xe2\x80\x98Why, Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 I used to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98when your gals takes on and cry, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 crackin on\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nover the head, and knockin\xe2\x80\x99 on \xe2\x80\x99em round? It\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous,\xe2\x80\x99 says I,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and don\xe2\x80\x99t do no sort o\xe2\x80\x99 good. Why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see no harm in their\r\ncryin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x99it\xe2\x80\x99s natur,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98and if natur can\xe2\x80\x99t blow off one\r\nway, it will another. Besides, Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98it jest spiles your gals;\r\nthey get sickly, and down in the mouth; and sometimes they gets\r\nugly,\xe2\x80\x94particular yallow gals do,\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s the devil and all gettin\xe2\x80\x99 on\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em broke in. Now,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98why can\xe2\x80\x99t you kinder coax \xe2\x80\x99em up, and\r\nspeak \xe2\x80\x99em fair? Depend on it, Tom, a little humanity, thrown in along,\r\ngoes a heap further than all your jawin\xe2\x80\x99 and crackin\xe2\x80\x99; and it pays\r\nbetter,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98depend on \xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99 But Tom couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the hang on \xe2\x80\x99t;\r\nand he spiled so many for me, that I had to break off with him, though\r\nhe was a good-hearted fellow, and as fair a business hand as is goin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you find your ways of managing do the business better than\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, sir, I may say so. You see, when I any ways can, I takes a\r\nleetle care about the onpleasant parts, like selling young uns and\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x94get the gals out of the way\xe2\x80\x94out of sight, out of mind, you\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x94and when it\xe2\x80\x99s clean done, and can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, they naturally\r\ngets used to it. \xe2\x80\x99Tan\xe2\x80\x99t, you know, as if it was white folks, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrought up in the way of \xe2\x80\x99spectin\xe2\x80\x99 to keep their children and wives,\r\nand all that. Niggers, you know, that\xe2\x80\x99s fetched up properly, ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nkind of \xe2\x80\x99spectations of no kind; so all these things comes easier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid mine are not properly brought up, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99pose not; you Kentucky folks spile your niggers. You mean well by\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, but \xe2\x80\x99tan\xe2\x80\x99t no real kindness, arter all. Now, a nigger, you see,\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s got to be hacked and tumbled round the world, and sold to Tom,\r\nand Dick, and the Lord knows who, \xe2\x80\x99tan\xe2\x80\x99t no kindness to be givin\xe2\x80\x99 on\r\nhim notions and expectations, and bringin\xe2\x80\x99 on him up too well, for the\r\nrough and tumble comes all the harder on him arter. Now, I venture to\r\nsay, your niggers would be quite chop-fallen in a place where some of\r\nyour plantation niggers would be singing and whooping like all\r\npossessed. Every man, you know, Mr. Shelby, naturally thinks well of\r\nhis own ways; and I think I treat niggers just about as well as it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\never worth while to treat \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a happy thing to be satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, with a slight\r\nshrug, and some perceptible feelings of a disagreeable nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, after they had both silently picked their nuts for\r\na season, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll think the matter over, and talk with my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeantime, Haley, if you want the matter carried on in the quiet way\r\nyou speak of, you\xe2\x80\x99d best not let your business in this neighborhood be\r\nknown. It will get out among my boys, and it will not be a particularly\r\nquiet business getting away any of my fellows, if they know it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npromise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! certainly, by all means, mum! of course. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99m in\r\na devil of a hurry, and shall want to know, as soon as possible, what I\r\nmay depend on,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, rising and putting on his overcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, call up this evening, between six and seven, and you shall have\r\nmy answer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, and the trader bowed himself out of the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to have been able to kick the fellow down the steps,\xe2\x80\x9d said he\r\nto himself, as he saw the door fairly closed, \xe2\x80\x9cwith his impudent\r\nassurance; but he knows how much he has me at advantage. If anybody had\r\never said to me that I should sell Tom down south to one of those\r\nrascally traders, I should have said, \xe2\x80\x99Is thy servant a dog, that he\r\nshould do this thing?\xe2\x80\x99 And now it must come, for aught I see. And\r\nEliza\xe2\x80\x99s child, too! I know that I shall have some fuss with wife about\r\nthat; and, for that matter, about Tom, too. So much for being in\r\ndebt,\xe2\x80\x94heigho! The fellow sees his advantage, and means to push it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps the mildest form of the system of slavery is to be seen in the\r\nState of Kentucky. The general prevalence of agricultural pursuits of a\r\nquiet and gradual nature, not requiring those periodic seasons of hurry\r\nand pressure that are called for in the business of more southern\r\ndistricts, makes the task of the negro a more healthful and reasonable\r\none; while the master, content with a more gradual style of\r\nacquisition, has not those temptations to hardheartedness which always\r\novercome frail human nature when the prospect of sudden and rapid gain\r\nis weighed in the balance, with no heavier counterpoise than the\r\ninterests of the helpless and unprotected.\r\n\r\nWhoever visits some estates there, and witnesses the good-humored\r\nindulgence of some masters and mistresses, and the affectionate loyalty\r\nof some slaves, might be tempted to dream the oft-fabled poetic legend\r\nof a patriarchal institution, and all that; but over and above the\r\nscene there broods a portentous shadow\xe2\x80\x94the shadow of _law_. So long as\r\nthe law considers all these human beings, with beating hearts and\r\nliving affections, only as so many _things_ belonging to a master,\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nlong as the failure, or misfortune, or imprudence, or death of the\r\nkindest owner, may cause them any day to exchange a life of kind\r\nprotection and indulgence for one of hopeless misery and toil,\xe2\x80\x94so long\r\nit is impossible to make anything beautiful or desirable in the best\r\nregulated administration of slavery.\r\n\r\nMr. Shelby was a fair average kind of man, good-natured and kindly, and\r\ndisposed to easy indulgence of those around him, and there had never\r\nbeen a lack of anything which might contribute to the physical comfort\r\nof the negroes on his estate. He had, however, speculated largely and\r\nquite loosely; had involved himself deeply, and his notes to a large\r\namount had come into the hands of Haley; and this small piece of\r\ninformation is the key to the preceding conversation.\r\n\r\nNow, it had so happened that, in approaching the door, Eliza had caught\r\nenough of the conversation to know that a trader was making offers to\r\nher master for somebody.\r\n\r\nShe would gladly have stopped at the door to listen, as she came out;\r\nbut her mistress just then calling, she was obliged to hasten away.\r\n\r\nStill she thought she heard the trader make an offer for her boy;\xe2\x80\x94could\r\nshe be mistaken? Her heart swelled and throbbed, and she involuntarily\r\nstrained him so tight that the little fellow looked up into her face in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEliza, girl, what ails you today?\xe2\x80\x9d said her mistress, when Eliza had\r\nupset the wash-pitcher, knocked down the workstand, and finally was\r\nabstractedly offering her mistress a long nightgown in place of the\r\nsilk dress she had ordered her to bring from the wardrobe.\r\n\r\nEliza started. \xe2\x80\x9cO, missis!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, raising her eyes; then, bursting\r\ninto tears, she sat down in a chair, and began sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Eliza child, what ails you?\xe2\x80\x9d said her mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! missis, missis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s been a trader talking with\r\nmaster in the parlor! I heard him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, silly child, suppose there has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, missis, _do_ you suppose mas\xe2\x80\x99r would sell my Harry?\xe2\x80\x9d And the poor\r\ncreature threw herself into a chair, and sobbed convulsively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSell him! No, you foolish girl! You know your master never deals with\r\nthose southern traders, and never means to sell any of his servants, as\r\nlong as they behave well. Why, you silly child, who do you think would\r\nwant to buy your Harry? Do you think all the world are set on him as\r\nyou are, you goosie? Come, cheer up, and hook my dress. There now, put\r\nmy back hair up in that pretty braid you learnt the other day, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t go listening at doors any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but, missis, _you_ never would give your consent\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, child! to be sure, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. What do you talk so for? I\r\nwould as soon have one of my own children sold. But really, Eliza, you\r\nare getting altogether too proud of that little fellow. A man can\xe2\x80\x99t put\r\nhis nose into the door, but you think he must be coming to buy him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReassured by her mistress\xe2\x80\x99 confident tone, Eliza proceeded nimbly and\r\nadroitly with her toilet, laughing at her own fears, as she proceeded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby was a woman of high class, both intellectually and morally.\r\nTo that natural magnanimity and generosity of mind which one often\r\nmarks as characteristic of the women of Kentucky, she added high moral\r\nand religious sensibility and principle, carried out with great energy\r\nand ability into practical results. Her husband, who made no\r\nprofessions to any particular religious character, nevertheless\r\nreverenced and respected the consistency of hers, and stood, perhaps, a\r\nlittle in awe of her opinion. Certain it was that he gave her unlimited\r\nscope in all her benevolent efforts for the comfort, instruction, and\r\nimprovement of her servants, though he never took any decided part in\r\nthem himself. In fact, if not exactly a believer in the doctrine of the\r\nefficiency of the extra good works of saints, he really seemed somehow\r\nor other to fancy that his wife had piety and benevolence enough for\r\ntwo\xe2\x80\x94to indulge a shadowy expectation of getting into heaven through her\r\nsuperabundance of qualities to which he made no particular pretension.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest load on his mind, after his conversation with the trader,\r\nlay in the foreseen necessity of breaking to his wife the arrangement\r\ncontemplated,\xe2\x80\x94meeting the importunities and opposition which he knew he\r\nshould have reason to encounter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby, being entirely ignorant of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassments,\r\nand knowing only the general kindliness of his temper, had been quite\r\nsincere in the entire incredulity with which she had met Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspicions. In fact, she dismissed the matter from her mind, without a\r\nsecond thought; and being occupied in preparations for an evening\r\nvisit, it passed out of her thoughts entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nThe Mother\r\n\r\n\r\nEliza had been brought up by her mistress, from girlhood, as a petted\r\nand indulged favorite.\r\n\r\nThe traveller in the south must often have remarked that peculiar air\r\nof refinement, that softness of voice and manner, which seems in many\r\ncases to be a particular gift to the quadroon and mulatto women. These\r\nnatural graces in the quadroon are often united with beauty of the most\r\ndazzling kind, and in almost every case with a personal appearance\r\nprepossessing and agreeable. Eliza, such as we have described her, is\r\nnot a fancy sketch, but taken from remembrance, as we saw her, years\r\nago, in Kentucky. Safe under the protecting care of her mistress, Eliza\r\nhad reached maturity without those temptations which make beauty so\r\nfatal an inheritance to a slave. She had been married to a bright and\r\ntalented young mulatto man, who was a slave on a neighboring estate,\r\nand bore the name of George Harris.\r\n\r\nThis young man had been hired out by his master to work in a bagging\r\nfactory, where his adroitness and ingenuity caused him to be considered\r\nthe first hand in the place. He had invented a machine for the cleaning\r\nof the hemp, which, considering the education and circumstances of the\r\ninventor, displayed quite as much mechanical genius as Whitney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncotton-gin.[1]\r\n\r\n [2] A machine of this description was really the invention of a young\r\n colored man in Kentucky. [Mrs. Stowe\xe2\x80\x99s note.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was possessed of a handsome person and pleasing manners, and was a\r\ngeneral favorite in the factory. Nevertheless, as this young man was in\r\nthe eye of the law not a man, but a thing, all these superior\r\nqualifications were subject to the control of a vulgar, narrow-minded,\r\ntyrannical master. This same gentleman, having heard of the fame of\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s invention, took a ride over to the factory, to see what this\r\nintelligent chattel had been about. He was received with great\r\nenthusiasm by the employer, who congratulated him on possessing so\r\nvaluable a slave.\r\n\r\nHe was waited upon over the factory, shown the machinery by George,\r\nwho, in high spirits, talked so fluently, held himself so erect, looked\r\nso handsome and manly, that his master began to feel an uneasy\r\nconsciousness of inferiority. What business had his slave to be\r\nmarching round the country, inventing machines, and holding up his head\r\namong gentlemen? He\xe2\x80\x99d soon put a stop to it. He\xe2\x80\x99d take him back, and\r\nput him to hoeing and digging, and \xe2\x80\x9csee if he\xe2\x80\x99d step about so smart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAccordingly, the manufacturer and all hands concerned were astounded\r\nwhen he suddenly demanded George\xe2\x80\x99s wages, and announced his intention\r\nof taking him home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mr. Harris,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the manufacturer, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t this rather\r\nsudden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if it is?\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t the man _mine_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe would be willing, sir, to increase the rate of compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo object at all, sir. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to hire any of my hands out,\r\nunless I\xe2\x80\x99ve a mind to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, sir, he seems peculiarly adapted to this business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDare say he may be; never was much adapted to anything that I set him\r\nabout, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut only think of his inventing this machine,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed one of the\r\nworkmen, rather unluckily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes! a machine for saving work, is it? He\xe2\x80\x99d invent that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nbound; let a nigger alone for that, any time. They are all labor-saving\r\nmachines themselves, every one of \xe2\x80\x99em. No, he shall tramp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge had stood like one transfixed, at hearing his doom thus suddenly\r\npronounced by a power that he knew was irresistible. He folded his\r\narms, tightly pressed in his lips, but a whole volcano of bitter\r\nfeelings burned in his bosom, and sent streams of fire through his\r\nveins. He breathed short, and his large dark eyes flashed like live\r\ncoals; and he might have broken out into some dangerous ebullition, had\r\nnot the kindly manufacturer touched him on the arm, and said, in a low\r\ntone,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive way, George; go with him for the present. We\xe2\x80\x99ll try to help you,\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tyrant observed the whisper, and conjectured its import, though he\r\ncould not hear what was said; and he inwardly strengthened himself in\r\nhis determination to keep the power he possessed over his victim.\r\n\r\nGeorge was taken home, and put to the meanest drudgery of the farm. He\r\nhad been able to repress every disrespectful word; but the flashing\r\neye, the gloomy and troubled brow, were part of a natural language that\r\ncould not be repressed,\xe2\x80\x94indubitable signs, which showed too plainly\r\nthat the man could not become a thing.\r\n\r\nIt was during the happy period of his employment in the factory that\r\nGeorge had seen and married his wife. During that period,\xe2\x80\x94being much\r\ntrusted and favored by his employer,\xe2\x80\x94he had free liberty to come and go\r\nat discretion. The marriage was highly approved of by Mrs. Shelby, who,\r\nwith a little womanly complacency in match-making, felt pleased to\r\nunite her handsome favorite with one of her own class who seemed in\r\nevery way suited to her; and so they were married in her mistress\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngreat parlor, and her mistress herself adorned the bride\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful\r\nhair with orange-blossoms, and threw over it the bridal veil, which\r\ncertainly could scarce have rested on a fairer head; and there was no\r\nlack of white gloves, and cake and wine,\xe2\x80\x94of admiring guests to praise\r\nthe bride\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, and her mistress\xe2\x80\x99 indulgence and liberality. For a\r\nyear or two Eliza saw her husband frequently, and there was nothing to\r\ninterrupt their happiness, except the loss of two infant children, to\r\nwhom she was passionately attached, and whom she mourned with a grief\r\nso intense as to call for gentle remonstrance from her mistress, who\r\nsought, with maternal anxiety, to direct her naturally passionate\r\nfeelings within the bounds of reason and religion.\r\n\r\nAfter the birth of little Harry, however, she had gradually become\r\ntranquillized and settled; and every bleeding tie and throbbing nerve,\r\nonce more entwined with that little life, seemed to become sound and\r\nhealthful, and Eliza was a happy woman up to the time that her husband\r\nwas rudely torn from his kind employer, and brought under the iron sway\r\nof his legal owner.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer, true to his word, visited Mr. Harris a week or two\r\nafter George had been taken away, when, as he hoped, the heat of the\r\noccasion had passed away, and tried every possible inducement to lead\r\nhim to restore him to his former employment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself to talk any longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, doggedly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know my own business, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not presume to interfere with it, sir. I only thought that you\r\nmight think it for your interest to let your man to us on the terms\r\nproposed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I understand the matter well enough. I saw your winking and\r\nwhispering, the day I took him out of the factory; but you don\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nit over me that way. It\xe2\x80\x99s a free country, sir; the man\xe2\x80\x99s _mine_, and I\r\ndo what I please with him,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so fell George\xe2\x80\x99s last hope;\xe2\x80\x94nothing before him but a life of toil\r\nand drudgery, rendered more bitter by every little smarting vexation\r\nand indignity which tyrannical ingenuity could devise.\r\n\r\nA very humane jurist once said, The worst use you can put a man to is\r\nto hang him. No; there is another use that a man can be put to that is\r\nWORSE!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nThe Husband and Father\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby had gone on her visit, and Eliza stood in the verandah,\r\nrather dejectedly looking after the retreating carriage, when a hand\r\nwas laid on her shoulder. She turned, and a bright smile lighted up her\r\nfine eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, is it you? How you frightened me! Well; I am so glad you \xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncome! Missis is gone to spend the afternoon; so come into my little\r\nroom, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the time all to ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaying this, she drew him into a neat little apartment opening on the\r\nverandah, where she generally sat at her sewing, within call of her\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow glad I am!\xe2\x80\x94why don\xe2\x80\x99t you smile?\xe2\x80\x94and look at Harry\xe2\x80\x94how he grows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe boy stood shyly regarding his father through his curls, holding\r\nclose to the skirts of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s dress. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEliza, lifting his long curls and kissing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish he\xe2\x80\x99d never been born!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I\xe2\x80\x99d never\r\nbeen born myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSurprised and frightened, Eliza sat down, leaned her head on her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, Eliza, it\xe2\x80\x99s too bad for me to make you feel so, poor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, fondly; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s too bad: O, how I wish you never had seen me\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nmight have been happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge! George! how can you talk so? What dreadful thing has happened,\r\nor is going to happen? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very happy, till lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we have, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. Then drawing his child on his knee, he\r\ngazed intently on his glorious dark eyes, and passed his hands through\r\nhis long curls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust like you, Eliza; and you are the handsomest woman I ever saw, and\r\nthe best one I ever wish to see; but, oh, I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d never seen you,\r\nnor you me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, George, how can you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Eliza, it\xe2\x80\x99s all misery, misery, misery! My life is bitter as\r\nwormwood; the very life is burning out of me. I\xe2\x80\x99m a poor, miserable,\r\nforlorn drudge; I shall only drag you down with me, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe use of our trying to do anything, trying to know anything, trying\r\nto be anything? What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of living? I wish I was dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, now, dear George, that is really wicked! I know how you feel about\r\nlosing your place in the factory, and you have a hard master; but pray\r\nbe patient, and perhaps something\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatient!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, interrupting her; \xe2\x80\x9chaven\xe2\x80\x99t I been patient? Did I\r\nsay a word when he came and took me away, for no earthly reason, from\r\nthe place where everybody was kind to me? I\xe2\x80\x99d paid him truly every cent\r\nof my earnings,\xe2\x80\x94and they all say I worked well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it _is_ dreadful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, after all, he is your\r\nmaster, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy master! and who made him my master? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I think of\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nright has he to me? I\xe2\x80\x99m a man as much as he is. I\xe2\x80\x99m a better man than\r\nhe is. I know more about business than he does; I am a better manager\r\nthan he is; I can read better than he can; I can write a better\r\nhand,\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned it all myself, and no thanks to him,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nlearned it in spite of him; and now what right has he to make a\r\ndray-horse of me?\xe2\x80\x94to take me from things I can do, and do better than\r\nhe can, and put me to work that any horse can do? He tries to do it; he\r\nsays he\xe2\x80\x99ll bring me down and humble me, and he puts me to just the\r\nhardest, meanest and dirtiest work, on purpose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, George! George! you frighten me! Why, I never heard you talk so;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ll do something dreadful. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at your\r\nfeelings, at all; but oh, do be careful\xe2\x80\x94do, do\xe2\x80\x94for my sake\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nHarry\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been careful, and I have been patient, but it\xe2\x80\x99s growing worse\r\nand worse; flesh and blood can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it any longer;\xe2\x80\x94every chance he\r\ncan get to insult and torment me, he takes. I thought I could do my\r\nwork well, and keep on quiet, and have some time to read and learn out\r\nof work hours; but the more he sees I can do, the more he loads on. He\r\nsays that though I don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything, he sees I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the devil in\r\nme, and he means to bring it out; and one of these days it will come\r\nout in a way that he won\xe2\x80\x99t like, or I\xe2\x80\x99m mistaken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO dear! what shall we do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, mournfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cas I was busy loading stones\r\ninto a cart, that young Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Tom stood there, slashing his whip so\r\nnear the horse that the creature was frightened. I asked him to stop,\r\nas pleasant as I could,\xe2\x80\x94he just kept right on. I begged him again, and\r\nthen he turned on me, and began striking me. I held his hand, and then\r\nhe screamed and kicked and ran to his father, and told him that I was\r\nfighting him. He came in a rage, and said he\xe2\x80\x99d teach me who was my\r\nmaster; and he tied me to a tree, and cut switches for young master,\r\nand told him that he might whip me till he was tired;\xe2\x80\x94and he did do it!\r\nIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t make him remember it, some time!\xe2\x80\x9d and the brow of the young\r\nman grew dark, and his eyes burned with an expression that made his\r\nyoung wife tremble. \xe2\x80\x9cWho made this man my master? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to\r\nknow!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, mournfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI always thought that I must obey my\r\nmaster and mistress, or I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a Christian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some sense in it, in your case; they have brought you up like\r\na child, fed you, clothed you, indulged you, and taught you, so that\r\nyou have a good education; that is some reason why they should claim\r\nyou. But I have been kicked and cuffed and sworn at, and at the best\r\nonly let alone; and what do I owe? I\xe2\x80\x99ve paid for all my keeping a\r\nhundred times over. I _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ bear it. No, I _won\xe2\x80\x99t_!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nclenching his hand with a fierce frown.\r\n\r\nEliza trembled, and was silent. She had never seen her husband in this\r\nmood before; and her gentle system of ethics seemed to bend like a reed\r\nin the surges of such passions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know poor little Carlo, that you gave me,\xe2\x80\x9d added George; \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ncreature has been about all the comfort that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had. He has slept\r\nwith me nights, and followed me around days, and kind o\xe2\x80\x99 looked at me\r\nas if he understood how I felt. Well, the other day I was just feeding\r\nhim with a few old scraps I picked up by the kitchen door, and Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\r\ncame along, and said I was feeding him up at his expense, and that he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to have every nigger keeping his dog, and ordered me to\r\ntie a stone to his neck and throw him in the pond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, George, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo it? not I!\xe2\x80\x94but he did. Mas\xe2\x80\x99r and Tom pelted the poor drowning\r\ncreature with stones. Poor thing! he looked at me so mournful, as if he\r\nwondered why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t save him. I had to take a flogging because I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it myself. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Mas\xe2\x80\x99r will find out that I\xe2\x80\x99m one\r\nthat whipping won\xe2\x80\x99t tame. My day will come yet, if he don\xe2\x80\x99t look out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do? O, George, don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything wicked; if you\r\nonly trust in God, and try to do right, he\xe2\x80\x99ll deliver you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI an\xe2\x80\x99t a Christian like you, Eliza; my heart\xe2\x80\x99s full of bitterness; I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t trust in God. Why does he let things be so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, George, we must have faith. Mistress says that when all things go\r\nwrong to us, we must believe that God is doing the very best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s easy to say for people that are sitting on their sofas and\r\nriding in their carriages; but let \xe2\x80\x99em be where I am, I guess it would\r\ncome some harder. I wish I could be good; but my heart burns, and can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe reconciled, anyhow. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t in my place,\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t now, if I\r\ntell you all I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know the whole yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can be coming now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, lately Mas\xe2\x80\x99r has been saying that he was a fool to let me marry\r\noff the place; that he hates Mr. Shelby and all his tribe, because they\r\nare proud, and hold their heads up above him, and that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got proud\r\nnotions from you; and he says he won\xe2\x80\x99t let me come here any more, and\r\nthat I shall take a wife and settle down on his place. At first he only\r\nscolded and grumbled these things; but yesterday he told me that I\r\nshould take Mina for a wife, and settle down in a cabin with her, or he\r\nwould sell me down river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94but you were married to _me_, by the minister, as much as if you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen a white man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know a slave can\xe2\x80\x99t be married? There is no law in this\r\ncountry for that; I can\xe2\x80\x99t hold you for my wife, if he chooses to part\r\nus. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d never seen you,\xe2\x80\x94why I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d never been\r\nborn; it would have been better for us both,\xe2\x80\x94it would have been better\r\nfor this poor child if he had never been born. All this may happen to\r\nhim yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, but master is so kind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but who knows?\xe2\x80\x94he may die\xe2\x80\x94and then he may be sold to nobody knows\r\nwho. What pleasure is it that he is handsome, and smart, and bright? I\r\ntell you, Eliza, that a sword will pierce through your soul for every\r\ngood and pleasant thing your child is or has; it will make him worth\r\ntoo much for you to keep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words smote heavily on Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s heart; the vision of the trader came\r\nbefore her eyes, and, as if some one had struck her a deadly blow, she\r\nturned pale and gasped for breath. She looked nervously out on the\r\nverandah, where the boy, tired of the grave conversation, had retired,\r\nand where he was riding triumphantly up and down on Mr. Shelby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwalking-stick. She would have spoken to tell her husband her fears, but\r\nchecked herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x94he has enough to bear, poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell him; besides, it an\xe2\x80\x99t true; Missis never deceives us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, Eliza, my girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said the husband, mournfully, \xe2\x80\x9cbear up, now; and\r\ngood-by, for I\xe2\x80\x99m going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing, George! Going where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Canada,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, straightening himself up; \xe2\x80\x9cand when I\xe2\x80\x99m there,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll buy you; that\xe2\x80\x99s all the hope that\xe2\x80\x99s left us. You have a kind\r\nmaster, that won\xe2\x80\x99t refuse to sell you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy you and the boy;\xe2\x80\x94God\r\nhelping me, I will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, dreadful! if you should be taken?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be taken, Eliza; I\xe2\x80\x99ll _die_ first! I\xe2\x80\x99ll be free, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t kill yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo need of that. They will kill me, fast enough; they never will get\r\nme down the river alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, George, for my sake, do be careful! Don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything wicked; don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlay hands on yourself, or anybody else! You are tempted too much\xe2\x80\x94too\r\nmuch; but don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94go you must\xe2\x80\x94but go carefully, prudently; pray God to\r\nhelp you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Eliza, hear my plan. Mas\xe2\x80\x99r took it into his head to send\r\nme right by here, with a note to Mr. Symmes, that lives a mile past. I\r\nbelieve he expected I should come here to tell you what I have. It\r\nwould please him, if he thought it would aggravate \xe2\x80\x99Shelby\xe2\x80\x99s folks,\xe2\x80\x99 as\r\nhe calls \xe2\x80\x99em. I\xe2\x80\x99m going home quite resigned, you understand, as if all\r\nwas over. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some preparations made,\xe2\x80\x94and there are those that\r\nwill help me; and, in the course of a week or so, I shall be among the\r\nmissing, some day. Pray for me, Eliza; perhaps the good Lord will hear\r\n_you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, pray yourself, George, and go trusting in him; then you won\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nanything wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, _good-by_,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, holding Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and gazing\r\ninto her eyes, without moving. They stood silent; then there were last\r\nwords, and sobs, and bitter weeping,\xe2\x80\x94such parting as those may make\r\nwhose hope to meet again is as the spider\xe2\x80\x99s web,\xe2\x80\x94and the husband and\r\nwife were parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nAn Evening in Uncle Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Cabin\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cabin of Uncle Tom was a small log building, close adjoining to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe house,\xe2\x80\x9d as the negro _par excellence_ designates his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndwelling. In front it had a neat garden-patch, where, every summer,\r\nstrawberries, raspberries, and a variety of fruits and vegetables,\r\nflourished under careful tending. The whole front of it was covered by\r\na large scarlet bignonia and a native multiflora rose, which,\r\nentwisting and interlacing, left scarce a vestige of the rough logs to\r\nbe seen. Here, also, in summer, various brilliant annuals, such as\r\nmarigolds, petunias, four-o\xe2\x80\x99clocks, found an indulgent corner in which\r\nto unfold their splendors, and were the delight and pride of Aunt\r\nChloe\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\nLet us enter the dwelling. The evening meal at the house is over, and\r\nAunt Chloe, who presided over its preparation as head cook, has left to\r\ninferior officers in the kitchen the business of clearing away and\r\nwashing dishes, and come out into her own snug territories, to \xe2\x80\x9cget her\r\nole man\xe2\x80\x99s supper\xe2\x80\x9d; therefore, doubt not that it is her you see by the\r\nfire, presiding with anxious interest over certain frizzling items in a\r\nstew-pan, and anon with grave consideration lifting the cover of a\r\nbake-kettle, from whence steam forth indubitable intimations of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csomething good.\xe2\x80\x9d A round, black, shining face is hers, so glossy as to\r\nsuggest the idea that she might have been washed over with white of\r\neggs, like one of her own tea rusks. Her whole plump countenance beams\r\nwith satisfaction and contentment from under her well-starched checked\r\nturban, bearing on it, however, if we must confess it, a little of that\r\ntinge of self-consciousness which becomes the first cook of the\r\nneighborhood, as Aunt Chloe was universally held and acknowledged to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nA cook she certainly was, in the very bone and centre of her soul. Not\r\na chicken or turkey or duck in the barn-yard but looked grave when they\r\nsaw her approaching, and seemed evidently to be reflecting on their\r\nlatter end; and certain it was that she was always meditating on\r\ntrussing, stuffing and roasting, to a degree that was calculated to\r\ninspire terror in any reflecting fowl living. Her corn-cake, in all its\r\nvarieties of hoe-cake, dodgers, muffins, and other species too numerous\r\nto mention, was a sublime mystery to all less practised compounders;\r\nand she would shake her fat sides with honest pride and merriment, as\r\nshe would narrate the fruitless efforts that one and another of her\r\ncompeers had made to attain to her elevation.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of company at the house, the arranging of dinners and\r\nsuppers \xe2\x80\x9cin style,\xe2\x80\x9d awoke all the energies of her soul; and no sight\r\nwas more welcome to her than a pile of travelling trunks launched on\r\nthe verandah, for then she foresaw fresh efforts and fresh triumphs.\r\n\r\nJust at present, however, Aunt Chloe is looking into the bake-pan; in\r\nwhich congenial operation we shall leave her till we finish our picture\r\nof the cottage.\r\n\r\nIn one corner of it stood a bed, covered neatly with a snowy spread;\r\nand by the side of it was a piece of carpeting, of some considerable\r\nsize. On this piece of carpeting Aunt Chloe took her stand, as being\r\ndecidedly in the upper walks of life; and it and the bed by which it\r\nlay, and the whole corner, in fact, were treated with distinguished\r\nconsideration, and made, so far as possible, sacred from the marauding\r\ninroads and desecrations of little folks. In fact, that corner was the\r\n_drawing-room_ of the establishment. In the other corner was a bed of\r\nmuch humbler pretensions, and evidently designed for _use_. The wall\r\nover the fireplace was adorned with some very brilliant scriptural\r\nprints, and a portrait of General Washington, drawn and colored in a\r\nmanner which would certainly have astonished that hero, if ever he\r\nhappened to meet with its like.\r\n\r\nOn a rough bench in the corner, a couple of woolly-headed boys, with\r\nglistening black eyes and fat shining cheeks, were busy in\r\nsuperintending the first walking operations of the baby, which, as is\r\nusually the case, consisted in getting up on its feet, balancing a\r\nmoment, and then tumbling down,\xe2\x80\x94each successive failure being violently\r\ncheered, as something decidedly clever.\r\n\r\nA table, somewhat rheumatic in its limbs, was drawn out in front of the\r\nfire, and covered with a cloth, displaying cups and saucers of a\r\ndecidedly brilliant pattern, with other symptoms of an approaching\r\nmeal. At this table was seated Uncle Tom, Mr. Shelby\xe2\x80\x99s best hand, who,\r\nas he is to be the hero of our story, we must daguerreotype for our\r\nreaders. He was a large, broad-chested, powerfully-made man, of a full\r\nglossy black, and a face whose truly African features were\r\ncharacterized by an expression of grave and steady good sense, united\r\nwith much kindliness and benevolence. There was something about his\r\nwhole air self-respecting and dignified, yet united with a confiding\r\nand humble simplicity.\r\n\r\nHe was very busily intent at this moment on a slate lying before him,\r\non which he was carefully and slowly endeavoring to accomplish a copy\r\nof some letters, in which operation he was overlooked by young Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\r\nGeorge, a smart, bright boy of thirteen, who appeared fully to realize\r\nthe dignity of his position as instructor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that way, Uncle Tom,\xe2\x80\x94not that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, briskly, as Uncle Tom\r\nlaboriously brought up the tail of his _g_ the wrong side out; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nmakes a _q_, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa sakes, now, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Tom, looking with a respectful,\r\nadmiring air, as his young teacher flourishingly scrawled _q_\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\n_g_\xe2\x80\x99s innumerable for his edification; and then, taking the pencil in\r\nhis big, heavy fingers, he patiently recommenced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow easy white folks al\xe2\x80\x99us does things!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, pausing\r\nwhile she was greasing a griddle with a scrap of bacon on her fork, and\r\nregarding young Master George with pride. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way he can write, now!\r\nand read, too! and then to come out here evenings and read his lessons\r\nto us,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s mighty interestin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Aunt Chloe, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting mighty hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that\r\ncake in the skillet almost done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMose done, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, lifting the lid and peeping\r\nin,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbrowning beautiful\xe2\x80\x94a real lovely brown. Ah! let me alone for dat.\r\nMissis let Sally try to make some cake, t\xe2\x80\x99 other day, jes to _larn_\r\nher, she said. \xe2\x80\x98O, go way, Missis,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98it really hurts my\r\nfeelin\xe2\x80\x99s, now, to see good vittles spilt dat ar way! Cake ris all to\r\none side\xe2\x80\x94no shape at all; no more than my shoe; go way!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with this final expression of contempt for Sally\xe2\x80\x99s greenness, Aunt\r\nChloe whipped the cover off the bake-kettle, and disclosed to view a\r\nneatly-baked pound-cake, of which no city confectioner need to have\r\nbeen ashamed. This being evidently the central point of the\r\nentertainment, Aunt Chloe began now to bustle about earnestly in the\r\nsupper department.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere you, Mose and Pete! get out de way, you niggers! Get away, Polly,\r\nhoney,\xe2\x80\x94mammy\xe2\x80\x99ll give her baby some fin, by and by. Now, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George,\r\nyou jest take off dem books, and set down now with my old man, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake up de sausages, and have de first griddle full of cakes on your\r\nplates in less dan no time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey wanted me to come to supper in the house,\xe2\x80\x9d said George; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nknew what was what too well for that, Aunt Chloe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you did\xe2\x80\x94so you did, honey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, heaping the smoking\r\nbatter-cakes on his plate; \xe2\x80\x9cyou know\xe2\x80\x99d your old aunty\xe2\x80\x99d keep the best\r\nfor you. O, let you alone for dat! Go way!\xe2\x80\x9d And, with that, aunty gave\r\nGeorge a nudge with her finger, designed to be immensely facetious, and\r\nturned again to her griddle with great briskness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow for the cake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George, when the activity of the griddle\r\ndepartment had somewhat subsided; and, with that, the youngster\r\nflourished a large knife over the article in question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa bless you, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, with earnestness,\r\ncatching his arm, \xe2\x80\x9cyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be for cuttin\xe2\x80\x99 it wid dat ar great\r\nheavy knife! Smash all down\xe2\x80\x94spile all de pretty rise of it. Here, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a thin old knife, I keeps sharp a purpose. Dar now, see! comes\r\napart light as a feather! Now eat away\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t get anything to beat\r\ndat ar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Lincon says,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, speaking with his mouth full, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\ntheir Jinny is a better cook than you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDem Lincons an\xe2\x80\x99t much count, no way!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, contemptuously;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, set along side _our_ folks. They \xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99spectable folks enough in\r\na kinder plain way; but, as to gettin\xe2\x80\x99 up anything in style, they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbegin to have a notion on \xe2\x80\x99t. Set Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Lincon, now, alongside Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\r\nShelby! Good Lor! and Missis Lincon,\xe2\x80\x94can she kinder sweep it into a\r\nroom like my missis,\xe2\x80\x94so kinder splendid, yer know! O, go way! don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell me nothin\xe2\x80\x99 of dem Lincons!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Aunt Chloe tossed her head as one\r\nwho hoped she did know something of the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, though, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you say,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Jinny was a\r\npretty fair cook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI may say dat. Good, plain, common\r\ncookin\xe2\x80\x99, Jinny\xe2\x80\x99ll do;\xe2\x80\x94make a good pone o\xe2\x80\x99 bread,\xe2\x80\x94bile her taters\r\n_far_,\xe2\x80\x94her corn cakes isn\xe2\x80\x99t extra, not extra now, Jinny\xe2\x80\x99s corn cakes\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t, but then they\xe2\x80\x99s far,\xe2\x80\x94but, Lor, come to de higher branches, and\r\nwhat _can_ she do? Why, she makes pies\xe2\x80\x94sartin she does; but what kinder\r\ncrust? Can she make your real flecky paste, as melts in your mouth, and\r\nlies all up like a puff? Now, I went over thar when Miss Mary was gwine\r\nto be married, and Jinny she jest showed me de weddin\xe2\x80\x99 pies. Jinny and\r\nI is good friends, ye know. I never said nothin\xe2\x80\x99; but go \xe2\x80\x99long, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\r\nGeorge! Why, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep a wink for a week, if I had a batch of\r\npies like dem ar. Why, dey wan\xe2\x80\x99t no \xe2\x80\x99count \xe2\x80\x99t all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose Jinny thought they were ever so nice,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThought so!\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t she? Thar she was, showing em, as innocent\xe2\x80\x94ye see,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s jest here, Jinny _don\xe2\x80\x99t know_. Lor, the family an\xe2\x80\x99t nothing!

Ah, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George, you\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know half \xe2\x80\x99your privileges in yer family and bringin\xe2\x80\x99 up!\xe2\x80\x9d Here\r\nAunt Chloe sighed, and rolled up her eyes with emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure, Aunt Chloe, I understand my pie and pudding privileges,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid George. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk Tom Lincon if I don\xe2\x80\x99t crow over him, every time I\r\nmeet him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Chloe sat back in her chair, and indulged in a hearty guffaw of\r\nlaughter, at this witticism of young Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s, laughing till the tears\r\nrolled down her black, shining cheeks, and varying the exercise with\r\nplayfully slapping and poking Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Georgey, and telling him to go way,\r\nand that he was a case\xe2\x80\x94that he was fit to kill her, and that he sartin\r\nwould kill her, one of these days; and, between each of these\r\nsanguinary predictions, going off into a laugh, each longer and\r\nstronger than the other, till George really began to think that he was\r\na very dangerously witty fellow, and that it became him to be careful\r\nhow he talked \xe2\x80\x9cas funny as he could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so ye telled Tom, did ye? O, Lor! what young uns will be up ter!\r\nYe crowed over Tom? O, Lor! Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George, if ye wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a hornbug\r\nlaugh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cI says to him, \xe2\x80\x98Tom, you ought to see some of Aunt\r\nChloe\xe2\x80\x99s pies; they\xe2\x80\x99re the right sort,\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity, now, Tom couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, on whose benevolent heart\r\nthe idea of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s benighted condition seemed to make a strong\r\nimpression. \xe2\x80\x9cYe oughter just ask him here to dinner, some o\xe2\x80\x99 these\r\ntimes, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George,\xe2\x80\x9d she added; \xe2\x80\x9cit would look quite pretty of ye. Ye\r\nknow, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George, ye oughtenter feel \xe2\x80\x99bove nobody, on \xe2\x80\x99count yer\r\nprivileges, \xe2\x80\x99cause all our privileges is gi\xe2\x80\x99n to us; we ought al\xe2\x80\x99ays to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99member that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, looking quite serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I mean to ask Tom here, some day next week,\xe2\x80\x9d said George; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyou do your prettiest, Aunt Chloe, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make him stare. Won\xe2\x80\x99t we\r\nmake him eat so he won\xe2\x80\x99t get over it for a fortnight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94sartin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, delighted; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll see. Lor! to\r\nthink of some of our dinners! Yer mind dat ar great chicken pie I made\r\nwhen we guv de dinner to General Knox? I and Missis, we come pretty\r\nnear quarrelling about dat ar crust. What does get into ladies\r\nsometimes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but, sometimes, when a body has de heaviest\r\nkind o\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99sponsibility on \xe2\x80\x99em, as ye may say, and is all kinder\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9dseris\xe2\x80\x99_ and taken up, dey takes dat ar time to be hangin\xe2\x80\x99 round and\r\nkinder interferin\xe2\x80\x99! Now, Missis, she wanted me to do dis way, and she\r\nwanted me to do dat way; and, finally, I got kinder sarcy, and, says I,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Now, Missis, do jist look at dem beautiful white hands o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn with\r\nlong fingers, and all a sparkling with rings, like my white lilies when\r\nde dew \xe2\x80\x99s on \xe2\x80\x99em; and look at my great black stumpin hands. Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nye think dat de Lord must have meant _me_ to make de pie-crust, and you\r\nto stay in de parlor? Dar! I was jist so sarcy, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did mother say?\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay?\xe2\x80\x94why, she kinder larfed in her eyes\xe2\x80\x94dem great handsome eyes o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhern; and, says she, \xe2\x80\x98Well, Aunt Chloe, I think you are about in the\r\nright on \xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 says she; and she went off in de parlor. She oughter\r\ncracked me over de head for bein\xe2\x80\x99 so sarcy; but dar\xe2\x80\x99s whar \xe2\x80\x99t is\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t do nothin\xe2\x80\x99 with ladies in de kitchen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you made out well with that dinner,\xe2\x80\x94I remember everybody said\r\nso,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I? And wan\xe2\x80\x99t I behind de dinin\xe2\x80\x99-room door dat bery day? and\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t I see de General pass his plate three times for some more dat\r\nbery pie?\xe2\x80\x94and, says he, \xe2\x80\x98You must have an uncommon cook, Mrs. Shelby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nLor! I was fit to split myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd de Gineral, he knows what cookin\xe2\x80\x99 is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, drawing\r\nherself up with an air. \xe2\x80\x9cBery nice man, de Gineral! He comes of one of\r\nde bery _fustest_ families in Old Virginny! He knows what\xe2\x80\x99s what, now,\r\nas well as I do\xe2\x80\x94de Gineral. Ye see, there\xe2\x80\x99s _pints_ in all pies, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\r\nGeorge; but tan\xe2\x80\x99t everybody knows what they is, or as orter be. But the\r\nGineral, he knows; I knew by his \xe2\x80\x99marks he made. Yes, he knows what de\r\npints is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time, Master George had arrived at that pass to which even a\r\nboy can come (under uncommon circumstances, when he really could not\r\neat another morsel), and, therefore, he was at leisure to notice the\r\npile of woolly heads and glistening eyes which were regarding their\r\noperations hungrily from the opposite corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, you Mose, Pete,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, breaking off liberal bits, and\r\nthrowing it at them; \xe2\x80\x9cyou want some, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Come, Aunt Chloe, bake\r\nthem some cakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd George and Tom moved to a comfortable seat in the chimney-corner,\r\nwhile Aunte Chloe, after baking a goodly pile of cakes, took her baby\r\non her lap, and began alternately filling its mouth and her own, and\r\ndistributing to Mose and Pete, who seemed rather to prefer eating\r\ntheirs as they rolled about on the floor under the table, tickling each\r\nother, and occasionally pulling the baby\xe2\x80\x99s toes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! go long, will ye?\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, giving now and then a kick, in\r\na kind of general way, under the table, when the movement became too\r\nobstreperous. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t ye be decent when white folks comes to see ye?\r\nStop dat ar, now, will ye? Better mind yerselves, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll take ye down\r\na button-hole lower, when Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George is gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat meaning was couched under this terrible threat, it is difficult to\r\nsay; but certain it is that its awful indistinctness seemed to produce\r\nvery little impression on the young sinners addressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, now!\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are so full of tickle all the while,\r\nthey can\xe2\x80\x99t behave theirselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the boys emerged from under the table, and, with hands and faces\r\nwell plastered with molasses, began a vigorous kissing of the baby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet along wid ye!\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, pushing away their woolly heads.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99ll all stick together, and never get clar, if ye do dat fashion. Go\r\nlong to de spring and wash yerselves!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, seconding her\r\nexhortations by a slap, which resounded very formidably, but which\r\nseemed only to knock out so much more laugh from the young ones, as\r\nthey tumbled precipitately over each other out of doors, where they\r\nfairly screamed with merriment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid ye ever see such aggravating young uns?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, rather\r\ncomplacently, as, producing an old towel, kept for such emergencies,\r\nshe poured a little water out of the cracked tea-pot on it, and began\r\nrubbing off the molasses from the baby\xe2\x80\x99s face and hands; and, having\r\npolished her till she shone, she set her down in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s lap, while she\r\nbusied herself in clearing away supper. The baby employed the intervals\r\nin pulling Tom\xe2\x80\x99s nose, scratching his face, and burying her fat hands\r\nin his woolly hair, which last operation seemed to afford her special\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAint she a peart young un?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, holding her from him to take a\r\nfull-length view; then, getting up, he set her on his broad shoulder,\r\nand began capering and dancing with her, while Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George snapped at\r\nher with his pocket-handkerchief, and Mose and Pete, now returned\r\nagain, roared after her like bears, till Aunt Chloe declared that they\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfairly took her head off\xe2\x80\x9d with their noise. As, according to her own\r\nstatement, this surgical operation was a matter of daily occurrence in\r\nthe cabin, the declaration no whit abated the merriment, till every one\r\nhad roared and tumbled and danced themselves down to a state of\r\ncomposure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, I hopes you\xe2\x80\x99re done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, who had been busy in\r\npulling out a rude box of a trundle-bed; \xe2\x80\x9cand now, you Mose and you\r\nPete, get into thar; for we\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to have the meetin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO mother, we don\xe2\x80\x99t wanter. We wants to sit up to meetin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x94meetin\xe2\x80\x99s is\r\nso curis. We likes \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, Aunt Chloe, shove it under, and let \xe2\x80\x99em sit up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\r\nGeorge, decisively, giving a push to the rude machine.\r\n\r\nAunt Chloe, having thus saved appearances, seemed highly delighted to\r\npush the thing under, saying, as she did so, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, mebbe \xe2\x80\x99t will do\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em some good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe house now resolved itself into a committee of the whole, to\r\nconsider the accommodations and arrangements for the meeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we\xe2\x80\x99s to do for cheers, now, _I_ declar I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt\r\nChloe. As the meeting had been held at Uncle Tom\xe2\x80\x99s weekly, for an\r\nindefinite length of time, without any more \xe2\x80\x9ccheers,\xe2\x80\x9d there seemed some\r\nencouragement to hope that a way would be discovered at present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Uncle Peter sung both de legs out of dat oldest cheer, last week,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsuggested Mose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go long! I\xe2\x80\x99ll boun\xe2\x80\x99 you pulled \xe2\x80\x99em out; some o\xe2\x80\x99 your shines,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAunt Chloe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99ll stand, if it only keeps jam up agin de wall!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDen Uncle Peter mus\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t sit in it, cause he al\xe2\x80\x99ays hitches when he\r\ngets a singing. He hitched pretty nigh across de room, t\xe2\x80\x99 other night,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Pete.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lor! get him in it, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mose, \xe2\x80\x9cand den he\xe2\x80\x99d begin, \xe2\x80\x98Come\r\nsaints\xe2\x80\x94and sinners, hear me tell,\xe2\x80\x99 and den down he\xe2\x80\x99d go,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Mose\r\nimitated precisely the nasal tones of the old man, tumbling on the\r\nfloor, to illustrate the supposed catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, be decent, can\xe2\x80\x99t ye?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe; \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99t yer shamed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r George, however, joined the offender in the laugh, and declared\r\ndecidedly that Mose was a \xe2\x80\x9cbuster.\xe2\x80\x9d So the maternal admonition seemed\r\nrather to fail of effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ole man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to tote in them ar\r\nbar\xe2\x80\x99ls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother\xe2\x80\x99s bar\xe2\x80\x99ls is like dat ar widder\xe2\x80\x99s, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George was reading\r\n\xe2\x80\x99bout, in de good book,\xe2\x80\x94dey never fails,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mose, aside to Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure one on \xe2\x80\x99em caved in last week,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pete, \xe2\x80\x9cand let \xe2\x80\x99em all\r\ndown in de middle of de singin\xe2\x80\x99; dat ar was failin\xe2\x80\x99, warnt it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this aside between Mose and Pete, two empty casks had been\r\nrolled into the cabin, and being secured from rolling, by stones on\r\neach side, boards were laid across them, which arrangement, together\r\nwith the turning down of certain tubs and pails, and the disposing of\r\nthe rickety chairs, at last completed the preparation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r George is such a beautiful reader, now, I know he\xe2\x80\x99ll stay to\r\nread for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98pears like \xe2\x80\x99t will be so much more\r\ninterestin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge very readily consented, for your boy is always ready for\r\nanything that makes him of importance.\r\n\r\nThe room was soon filled with a motley assemblage, from the old\r\ngray-headed patriarch of eighty, to the young girl and lad of fifteen.\r\nA little harmless gossip ensued on various themes, such as where old\r\nAunt Sally got her new red headkerchief, and how \xe2\x80\x9cMissis was a going to\r\ngive Lizzy that spotted muslin gown, when she\xe2\x80\x99d got her new berage made\r\nup;\xe2\x80\x9d and how Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Shelby was thinking of buying a new sorrel colt,\r\nthat was going to prove an addition to the glories of the place. A few\r\nof the worshippers belonged to families hard by, who had got permission\r\nto attend, and who brought in various choice scraps of information,\r\nabout the sayings and doings at the house and on the place, which\r\ncirculated as freely as the same sort of small change does in higher\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the singing commenced, to the evident delight of all\r\npresent. Not even all the disadvantage of nasal intonation could\r\nprevent the effect of the naturally fine voices, in airs at once wild\r\nand spirited. The words were sometimes the well-known and common hymns\r\nsung in the churches about, and sometimes of a wilder, more indefinite\r\ncharacter, picked up at camp-meetings.\r\n\r\nThe chorus of one of them, which ran as follows, was sung with great\r\nenergy and unction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDie on the field of battle,\r\nDie on the field of battle,\r\nGlory in my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother special favorite had oft repeated the words\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to glory,\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t you come along with me?\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see the angels beck\xe2\x80\x99ning, and a calling me away?\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see the golden city and the everlasting day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were others, which made incessant mention of \xe2\x80\x9cJordan\xe2\x80\x99s banks,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cCanaan\xe2\x80\x99s fields,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cNew Jerusalem;\xe2\x80\x9d for the negro mind,\r\nimpassioned and imaginative, always attaches itself to hymns and\r\nexpressions of a vivid and pictorial nature; and, as they sung, some\r\nlaughed, and some cried, and some clapped hands, or shook hands\r\nrejoicingly with each other, as if they had fairly gained the other\r\nside of the river.\r\n\r\nVarious exhortations, or relations of experience, followed, and\r\nintermingled with the singing. One old gray-headed woman, long past\r\nwork, but much revered as a sort of chronicle of the past, rose, and\r\nleaning on her staff, said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell, chil\xe2\x80\x99en! Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m mighty glad to\r\nhear ye all and see ye all once more, \xe2\x80\x99cause I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\ngone to glory; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve done got ready, chil\xe2\x80\x99en; \xe2\x80\x99pears like I\xe2\x80\x99d got my\r\nlittle bundle all tied up, and my bonnet on, jest a waitin\xe2\x80\x99 for the\r\nstage to come along and take me home; sometimes, in the night, I think\r\nI hear the wheels a rattlin\xe2\x80\x99, and I\xe2\x80\x99m lookin\xe2\x80\x99 out all the time; now,\r\nyou jest be ready too, for I tell ye all, chil\xe2\x80\x99en,\xe2\x80\x9d she said striking\r\nher staff hard on the floor, \xe2\x80\x9cdat ar _glory_ is a mighty thing! It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmighty thing, chil\xe2\x80\x99en,\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99no nothing about it,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s _wonderful_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd the old creature sat down, with streaming tears, as wholly\r\novercome, while the whole circle struck up\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Canaan, bright Canaan\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m bound for the land of Canaan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r George, by request, read the last chapters of Revelation, often\r\ninterrupted by such exclamations as \xe2\x80\x9cThe _sakes_ now!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOnly hear\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cJest think on \xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIs all that a comin\xe2\x80\x99 sure enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge, who was a bright boy, and well trained in religious things by\r\nhis mother, finding himself an object of general admiration, threw in\r\nexpositions of his own, from time to time, with a commendable\r\nseriousness and gravity, for which he was admired by the young and\r\nblessed by the old; and it was agreed, on all hands, that \xe2\x80\x9ca minister\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lay it off better than he did; that \xe2\x80\x99t was reely \xe2\x80\x99mazin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncle Tom was a sort of patriarch in religious matters, in the\r\nneighborhood. Having, naturally, an organization in which the _morale_\r\nwas strongly predominant, together with a greater breadth and\r\ncultivation of mind than obtained among his companions, he was looked\r\nup to with great respect, as a sort of minister among them; and the\r\nsimple, hearty, sincere style of his exhortations might have edified\r\neven better educated persons. But it was in prayer that he especially\r\nexcelled. Nothing could exceed the touching simplicity, the childlike\r\nearnestness, of his prayer, enriched with the language of Scripture,\r\nwhich seemed so entirely to have wrought itself into his being, as to\r\nhave become a part of himself, and to drop from his lips unconsciously;\r\nin the language of a pious old negro, he \xe2\x80\x9cprayed right up.\xe2\x80\x9d And so much\r\ndid his prayer always work on the devotional feelings of his audiences,\r\nthat there seemed often a danger that it would be lost altogether in\r\nthe abundance of the responses which broke out everywhere around him.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this scene was passing in the cabin of the man, one quite\r\notherwise passed in the halls of the master.\r\n\r\nThe trader and Mr. Shelby were seated together in the dining room\r\nafore-named, at a table covered with papers and writing utensils.\r\n\r\nMr. Shelby was busy in counting some bundles of bills, which, as they\r\nwere counted, he pushed over to the trader, who counted them likewise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll fair,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader; \xe2\x80\x9cand now for signing these yer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Shelby hastily drew the bills of sale towards him, and signed them,\r\nlike a man that hurries over some disagreeable business, and then\r\npushed them over with the money. Haley produced, from a well-worn\r\nvalise, a parchment, which, after looking over it a moment, he handed\r\nto Mr. Shelby, who took it with a gesture of suppressed eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, now, the thing\xe2\x80\x99s _done_!\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader, getting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s _done_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, in a musing tone; and, fetching a long\r\nbreath, he repeated, _\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s done!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYer don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to feel much pleased with it, \xe2\x80\x99pears to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ntrader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember that you promised, on\r\nyour honor, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell Tom, without knowing what sort of hands\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s going into.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99ve just done it sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCircumstances, you well know, _obliged_ me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shelby, haughtily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, you know, they may \xe2\x80\x99blige _me_, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowsomever, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the very best I can in gettin\xe2\x80\x99 Tom a good berth;\r\nas to my treatin\xe2\x80\x99 on him bad, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be a grain afeard. If there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanything that I thank the Lord for, it is that I\xe2\x80\x99m never noways cruel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter the expositions which the trader had previously given of his\r\nhumane principles, Mr. Shelby did not feel particularly reassured by\r\nthese declarations; but, as they were the best comfort the case\r\nadmitted of, he allowed the trader to depart in silence, and betook\r\nhimself to a solitary cigar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nShowing the Feelings of Living Property on Changing Owners\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Shelby had retired to their apartment for the night. He\r\nwas lounging in a large easy-chair, looking over some letters that had\r\ncome in the afternoon mail, and she was standing before her mirror,\r\nbrushing out the complicated braids and curls in which Eliza had\r\narranged her hair; for, noticing her pale cheeks and haggard eyes, she\r\nhad excused her attendance that night, and ordered her to bed. The\r\nemployment, naturally enough, suggested her conversation with the girl\r\nin the morning; and turning to her husband, she said, carelessly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the by, Arthur, who was that low-bred fellow that you lugged in to\r\nour dinner-table today?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaley is his name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shelby, turning himself rather uneasily in\r\nhis chair, and continuing with his eyes fixed on a letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaley! Who is he, and what may be his business here, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99s a man that I transacted some business with, last time I was\r\nat Natchez,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he presumed on it to make himself quite at home, and call and dine\r\nhere, ay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I invited him; I had some accounts with him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shelby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he a negro-trader?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, noticing a certain\r\nembarrassment in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear, what put that into your head?\xe2\x80\x9d said Shelby, looking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x94only Eliza came in here, after dinner, in a great worry,\r\ncrying and taking on, and said you were talking with a trader, and that\r\nshe heard him make an offer for her boy\xe2\x80\x94the ridiculous little goose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, returning to his paper, which he\r\nseemed for a few moments quite intent upon, not perceiving that he was\r\nholding it bottom upwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will have to come out,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, mentally; \xe2\x80\x9cas well now as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told Eliza,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, as she continued brushing her hair,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat she was a little fool for her pains, and that you never had\r\nanything to do with that sort of persons. Of course, I knew you never\r\nmeant to sell any of our people,\xe2\x80\x94least of all, to such a fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Emily,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cso I have always felt and said; but\r\nthe fact is that my business lies so that I cannot get on without. I\r\nshall have to sell some of my hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo that creature? Impossible! Mr. Shelby, you cannot be serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say that I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to sell\r\nTom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! our Tom?\xe2\x80\x94that good, faithful creature!\xe2\x80\x94been your faithful\r\nservant from a boy! O, Mr. Shelby!\xe2\x80\x94and you have promised him his\r\nfreedom, too,\xe2\x80\x94you and I have spoken to him a hundred times of it. Well,\r\nI can believe anything now,\xe2\x80\x94I can believe _now_ that you could sell\r\nlittle Harry, poor Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s only child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, in a tone\r\nbetween grief and indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, since you must know all, it is so. I have agreed to sell Tom and\r\nHarry both; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I am to be rated, as if I were a\r\nmonster, for doing what every one does every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why, of all others, choose these?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy sell\r\nthem, of all on the place, if you must sell at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause they will bring the highest sum of any,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s why. I could\r\nchoose another, if you say so. The fellow made me a high bid on Eliza,\r\nif that would suit you any better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, vehemently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to it, a moment,\xe2\x80\x94out of regard to your feelings,\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t;\xe2\x80\x94so give me some credit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, recollecting herself, \xe2\x80\x9cforgive me. I have\r\nbeen hasty. I was surprised, and entirely unprepared for this;\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nsurely you will allow me to intercede for these poor creatures. Tom is\r\na noble-hearted, faithful fellow, if he is black. I do believe, Mr.\r\nShelby, that if he were put to it, he would lay down his life for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x94I dare say;\xe2\x80\x94but what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of all this?\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not make a pecuniary sacrifice? I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to bear my part of the\r\ninconvenience. O, Mr. Shelby, I have tried\xe2\x80\x94tried most faithfully, as a\r\nChristian woman should\xe2\x80\x94to do my duty to these poor, simple, dependent\r\ncreatures. I have cared for them, instructed them, watched over them,\r\nand know all their little cares and joys, for years; and how can I ever\r\nhold up my head again among them, if, for the sake of a little paltry\r\ngain, we sell such a faithful, excellent, confiding creature as poor\r\nTom, and tear from him in a moment all we have taught him to love and\r\nvalue? I have taught them the duties of the family, of parent and\r\nchild, and husband and wife; and how can I bear to have this open\r\nacknowledgment that we care for no tie, no duty, no relation, however\r\nsacred, compared with money? I have talked with Eliza about her boy\xe2\x80\x94her\r\nduty to him as a Christian mother, to watch over him, pray for him, and\r\nbring him up in a Christian way; and now what can I say, if you tear\r\nhim away, and sell him, soul and body, to a profane, unprincipled man,\r\njust to save a little money? I have told her that one soul is worth\r\nmore than all the money in the world; and how will she believe me when\r\nshe sees us turn round and sell her child?\xe2\x80\x94sell him, perhaps, to\r\ncertain ruin of body and soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you feel so about it,\xe2\x80\x94indeed I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nrespect your feelings, too, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to share them to\r\ntheir full extent; but I tell you now, solemnly, it\xe2\x80\x99s of no use\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp myself. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to tell you this Emily; but, in plain words,\r\nthere is no choice between selling these two and selling everything.\r\nEither they must go, or _all_ must. Haley has come into possession of a\r\nmortgage, which, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t clear off with him directly, will take\r\neverything before it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve raked, and scraped, and borrowed, and all\r\nbut begged,\xe2\x80\x94and the price of these two was needed to make up the\r\nbalance, and I had to give them up. Haley fancied the child; he agreed\r\nto settle the matter that way, and no other. I was in his power, and\r\n_had_ to do it. If you feel so to have them sold, would it be any\r\nbetter to have _all_ sold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby stood like one stricken. Finally, turning to her toilet,\r\nshe rested her face in her hands, and gave a sort of groan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is God\xe2\x80\x99s curse on slavery!\xe2\x80\x94a bitter, bitter, most accursed\r\nthing!\xe2\x80\x94a curse to the master and a curse to the slave! I was a fool to\r\nthink I could make anything good out of such a deadly evil. It is a sin\r\nto hold a slave under laws like ours,\xe2\x80\x94I always felt it was,\xe2\x80\x94I always\r\nthought so when I was a girl,\xe2\x80\x94I thought so still more after I joined\r\nthe church; but I thought I could gild it over,\xe2\x80\x94I thought, by kindness,\r\nand care, and instruction, I could make the condition of mine better\r\nthan freedom\xe2\x80\x94fool that I was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, wife, you are getting to be an abolitionist, quite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbolitionist! if they knew all I know about slavery, they _might_\r\ntalk! We don\xe2\x80\x99t need them to tell us; you know I never thought that\r\nslavery was right\xe2\x80\x94never felt willing to own slaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, therein you differ from many wise and pious men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nShelby. \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember Mr. B.\xe2\x80\x98s sermon, the other Sunday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear such sermons; I never wish to hear Mr. B. in our\r\nchurch again. Ministers can\xe2\x80\x99t help the evil, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t cure it,\r\nany more than we can,\xe2\x80\x94but defend it!\xe2\x80\x94it always went against my common\r\nsense. And I think you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think much of that sermon, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shelby, \xe2\x80\x9cI must say these ministers sometimes carry\r\nmatters further than we poor sinners would exactly dare to do. We men\r\nof the world must wink pretty hard at various things, and get used to a\r\ndeal that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the exact thing. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t quite fancy, when women\r\nand ministers come out broad and square, and go beyond us in matters of\r\neither modesty or morals, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact. But now, my dear, I trust you\r\nsee the necessity of the thing, and you see that I have done the very\r\nbest that circumstances would allow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, hurriedly and abstractedly fingering\r\nher gold watch,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t any jewelry of any amount,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\nthoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x9cbut would not this watch do something?\xe2\x80\x94it was an\r\nexpensive one, when it was bought. If I could only at least save\r\nEliza\xe2\x80\x99s child, I would sacrifice anything I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, very sorry, Emily,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry this takes\r\nhold of you so; but it will do no good. The fact is, Emily, the thing\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndone; the bills of sale are already signed, and in Haley\xe2\x80\x99s hands; and\r\nyou must be thankful it is no worse. That man has had it in his power\r\nto ruin us all,\xe2\x80\x94and now he is fairly off. If you knew the man as I do,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d think that we had had a narrow escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he so hard, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, not a cruel man, exactly, but a man of leather,\xe2\x80\x94a man alive to\r\nnothing but trade and profit,\xe2\x80\x94cool, and unhesitating, and unrelenting,\r\nas death and the grave. He\xe2\x80\x99d sell his own mother at a good\r\npercentage\xe2\x80\x94not wishing the old woman any harm, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this wretch owns that good, faithful Tom, and Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, the fact is that this goes rather hard with me; it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nthing I hate to think of. Haley wants to drive matters, and take\r\npossession tomorrow. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get out my horse bright and early,\r\nand be off. I can\xe2\x80\x99t see Tom, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact; and you had better arrange\r\na drive somewhere, and carry Eliza off. Let the thing be done when she\r\nis out of sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be in no sense accomplice or help in\r\nthis cruel business. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see poor old Tom, God help him, in his\r\ndistress! They shall see, at any rate, that their mistress can feel for\r\nand with them. As to Eliza, I dare not think about it. The Lord forgive\r\nus! What have we done, that this cruel necessity should come on us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was one listener to this conversation whom Mr. and Mrs. Shelby\r\nlittle suspected.\r\n\r\nCommunicating with their apartment was a large closet, opening by a\r\ndoor into the outer passage. When Mrs. Shelby had dismissed Eliza for\r\nthe night, her feverish and excited mind had suggested the idea of this\r\ncloset; and she had hidden herself there, and, with her ear pressed\r\nclose against the crack of the door, had lost not a word of the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nWhen the voices died into silence, she rose and crept stealthily away.\r\nPale, shivering, with rigid features and compressed lips, she looked an\r\nentirely altered being from the soft and timid creature she had been\r\nhitherto. She moved cautiously along the entry, paused one moment at\r\nher mistress\xe2\x80\x99 door, and raised her hands in mute appeal to Heaven, and\r\nthen turned and glided into her own room. It was a quiet, neat\r\napartment, on the same floor with her mistress. There was a pleasant\r\nsunny window, where she had often sat singing at her sewing; there a\r\nlittle case of books, and various little fancy articles, ranged by\r\nthem, the gifts of Christmas holidays; there was her simple wardrobe in\r\nthe closet and in the drawers:\xe2\x80\x94here was, in short, her home; and, on\r\nthe whole, a happy one it had been to her. But there, on the bed, lay\r\nher slumbering boy, his long curls falling negligently around his\r\nunconscious face, his rosy mouth half open, his little fat hands thrown\r\nout over the bedclothes, and a smile spread like a sunbeam over his\r\nwhole face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor boy! poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza; \xe2\x80\x9cthey have sold you! but your\r\nmother will save you yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo tear dropped over that pillow; in such straits as these, the heart\r\nhas no tears to give,\xe2\x80\x94it drops only blood, bleeding itself away in\r\nsilence. She took a piece of paper and a pencil, and wrote, hastily,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Missis! dear Missis! don\xe2\x80\x99t think me ungrateful,\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t think hard of\r\nme, any way,\xe2\x80\x94I heard all you and master said tonight. I am going to try\r\nto save my boy\xe2\x80\x94you will not blame me! God bless and reward you for all\r\nyour kindness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHastily folding and directing this, she went to a drawer and made up a\r\nlittle package of clothing for her boy, which she tied with a\r\nhandkerchief firmly round her waist; and, so fond is a mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nremembrance, that, even in the terrors of that hour, she did not forget\r\nto put in the little package one or two of his favorite toys, reserving\r\na gayly painted parrot to amuse him, when she should be called on to\r\nawaken him. It was some trouble to arouse the little sleeper; but,\r\nafter some effort, he sat up, and was playing with his bird, while his\r\nmother was putting on her bonnet and shawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as she drew near the bed, with\r\nhis little coat and cap.\r\n\r\nHis mother drew near, and looked so earnestly into his eyes, that he at\r\nonce divined that something unusual was the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cmustn\xe2\x80\x99t speak loud, or they will hear us. A\r\nwicked man was coming to take little Harry away from his mother, and\r\ncarry him \xe2\x80\x99way off in the dark; but mother won\xe2\x80\x99t let him\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\nput on her little boy\xe2\x80\x99s cap and coat, and run off with him, so the ugly\r\nman can\xe2\x80\x99t catch him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaying these words, she had tied and buttoned on the child\xe2\x80\x99s simple\r\noutfit, and, taking him in her arms, she whispered to him to be very\r\nstill; and, opening a door in her room which led into the outer\r\nverandah, she glided noiselessly out.\r\n\r\nIt was a sparkling, frosty, starlight night, and the mother wrapped the\r\nshawl close round her child, as, perfectly quiet with vague terror, he\r\nclung round her neck.\r\n\r\nOld Bruno, a great Newfoundland, who slept at the end of the porch,\r\nrose, with a low growl, as she came near. She gently spoke his name,\r\nand the animal, an old pet and playmate of hers, instantly, wagging his\r\ntail, prepared to follow her, though apparently revolving much, in this\r\nsimple dog\xe2\x80\x99s head, what such an indiscreet midnight promenade might\r\nmean. Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed\r\nto embarrass him considerably; for he often stopped, as Eliza glided\r\nforward, and looked wistfully, first at her and then at the house, and\r\nthen, as if reassured by reflection, he pattered along after her again.\r\nA few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, and\r\nEliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane.\r\n\r\nThe prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\xe2\x80\x99s had, in the order of hymn-singing,\r\nbeen protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged\r\nhimself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that,\r\nalthough it was now between twelve and one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, he and his worthy\r\nhelpmeet were not yet asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord! what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily\r\ndrawing the curtain. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sakes alive, if it an\xe2\x80\x99t Lizy! Get on your\r\nclothes, old man, quick!\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s old Bruno, too, a pawin round; what on\r\nairth! I\xe2\x80\x99m gwine to open the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light\r\nof the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the\r\nhaggard face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless you!\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s come over ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m running away\xe2\x80\x94Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe\xe2\x80\x94carrying off my child\xe2\x80\x94Master\r\nsold him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Eliza comes to tell Uncle Tom that he is sold, and that\r\nshe is running away to save her child.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSold him?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sold him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, firmly; \xe2\x80\x9cI crept into the closet by\r\nMistress\xe2\x80\x99 door tonight, and I heard Master tell Missis that he had sold\r\nmy Harry, and you, Uncle Tom, both, to a trader; and that he was going\r\noff this morning on his horse, and that the man was to take possession\r\ntoday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes\r\ndilated, like a man in a dream. Slowly and gradually, as its meaning\r\ncame over him, he collapsed, rather than seated himself, on his old\r\nchair, and sunk his head down upon his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe good Lord have pity on us!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe. \xe2\x80\x9cO! it don\xe2\x80\x99t seem as\r\nif it was true! What has he done, that Mas\xe2\x80\x99r should sell _him_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done anything,\xe2\x80\x94it isn\xe2\x80\x99t for that. Master don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sell,\r\nand Missis she\xe2\x80\x99s always good. I heard her plead and beg for us; but he\r\ntold her \xe2\x80\x99t was no use; that he was in this man\xe2\x80\x99s debt, and that this\r\nman had got the power over him; and that if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay him off\r\nclear, it would end in his having to sell the place and all the people,\r\nand move off. Yes, I heard him say there was no choice between selling\r\nthese two and selling all, the man was driving him so hard. Master said\r\nhe was sorry; but oh, Missis\xe2\x80\x94you ought to have heard her talk! If she\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99t a Christian and an angel, there never was one. I\xe2\x80\x99m a wicked girl\r\nto leave her so; but, then, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. She said, herself, one\r\nsoul was worth more than the world; and this boy has a soul, and if I\r\nlet him be carried off, who knows what\xe2\x80\x99ll become of it? It must be\r\nright: but, if it an\xe2\x80\x99t right, the Lord forgive me, for I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\ndoing it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, old man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you go, too? Will you wait\r\nto be toted down river, where they kill niggers with hard work and\r\nstarving? I\xe2\x80\x99d a heap rather die than go there, any day! There\xe2\x80\x99s time\r\nfor ye,\xe2\x80\x94be off with Lizy,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pass to come and go any time.\r\nCome, bustle up, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get your things together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom slowly raised his head, and looked sorrowfully but quietly around,\r\nand said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94I an\xe2\x80\x99t going. Let Eliza go\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s her right! I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the\r\none to say no\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98tan\xe2\x80\x99t in _natur_ for her to stay; but you heard what she\r\nsaid! If I must be sold, or all the people on the place, and everything\r\ngo to rack, why, let me be sold. I s\xe2\x80\x99pose I can bar it as well as any\r\non \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, while something like a sob and a sigh shook his\r\nbroad, rough chest convulsively. \xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r always found me on the spot\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nalways will. I never have broke trust, nor used my pass no ways\r\ncontrary to my word, and I never will. It\xe2\x80\x99s better for me alone to go,\r\nthan to break up the place and sell all. Mas\xe2\x80\x99r an\xe2\x80\x99t to blame, Chloe,\r\nand he\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of you and the poor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere he turned to the rough trundle bed full of little woolly heads,\r\nand broke fairly down. He leaned over the back of the chair, and\r\ncovered his face with his large hands. Sobs, heavy, hoarse and loud,\r\nshook the chair, and great tears fell through his fingers on the floor;\r\njust such tears, sir, as you dropped into the coffin where lay your\r\nfirst-born son; such tears, woman, as you shed when you heard the cries\r\nof your dying babe. For, sir, he was a man,\xe2\x80\x94and you are but another\r\nman. And, woman, though dressed in silk and jewels, you are but a\r\nwoman, and, in life\xe2\x80\x99s great straits and mighty griefs, ye feel but one\r\nsorrow!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, as she stood in the door, \xe2\x80\x9cI saw my husband only\r\nthis afternoon, and I little knew then what was to come. They have\r\npushed him to the very last standing place, and he told me, today, that\r\nhe was going to run away. Do try, if you can, to get word to him. Tell\r\nhim how I went, and why I went; and tell him I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try and find\r\nCanada. You must give my love to him, and tell him, if I never see him\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x9d she turned away, and stood with her back to them for a moment,\r\nand then added, in a husky voice, \xe2\x80\x9ctell him to be as good as he can,\r\nand try and meet me in the kingdom of heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall Bruno in there,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cShut the door on him, poor beast! He\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t go with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few last words and tears, a few simple adieus and blessings, and\r\nclasping her wondering and affrighted child in her arms, she glided\r\nnoiselessly away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nDiscovery\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Shelby, after their protracted discussion of the night\r\nbefore, did not readily sink to repose, and, in consequence, slept\r\nsomewhat later than usual, the ensuing morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what keeps Eliza,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, after giving her bell\r\nrepeated pulls, to no purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. Shelby was standing before his dressing-glass, sharpening his\r\nrazor; and just then the door opened, and a colored boy entered, with\r\nhis shaving-water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndy,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mistress, \xe2\x80\x9cstep to Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s door, and tell her I have\r\nrung for her three times. Poor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, to herself, with a\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\nAndy soon returned, with eyes very wide in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, Missis! Lizy\xe2\x80\x99s drawers is all open, and her things all lying\r\nevery which way; and I believe she\xe2\x80\x99s just done clared out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe truth flashed upon Mr. Shelby and his wife at the same moment. He\r\nexclaimed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she suspected it, and she\xe2\x80\x99s off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord be thanked!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby. \xe2\x80\x9cI trust she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWife, you talk like a fool! Really, it will be something pretty\r\nawkward for me, if she is. Haley saw that I hesitated about selling\r\nthis child, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll think I connived at it, to get him out of the\r\nway. It touches my honor!\xe2\x80\x9d And Mr. Shelby left the room hastily.\r\n\r\nThere was great running and ejaculating, and opening and shutting of\r\ndoors, and appearance of faces in all shades of color in different\r\nplaces, for about a quarter of an hour. One person only, who might have\r\nshed some light on the matter, was entirely silent, and that was the\r\nhead cook, Aunt Chloe. Silently, and with a heavy cloud settled down\r\nover her once joyous face, she proceeded making out her breakfast\r\nbiscuits, as if she heard and saw nothing of the excitement around her.\r\n\r\nVery soon, about a dozen young imps were roosting, like so many crows,\r\non the verandah railings, each one determined to be the first one to\r\napprize the strange Mas\xe2\x80\x99r of his ill luck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be rael mad, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Won\xe2\x80\x99t_ he swar!\xe2\x80\x9d said little black Jake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for he _does_ swar,\xe2\x80\x9d said woolly-headed Mandy. \xe2\x80\x9cI hearn him\r\nyesterday, at dinner. I hearn all about it then, \xe2\x80\x99cause I got into the\r\ncloset where Missis keeps the great jugs, and I hearn every word.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nMandy, who had never in her life thought of the meaning of a word she\r\nhad heard, more than a black cat, now took airs of superior wisdom, and\r\nstrutted about, forgetting to state that, though actually coiled up\r\namong the jugs at the time specified, she had been fast asleep all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhen, at last, Haley appeared, booted and spurred, he was saluted with\r\nthe bad tidings on every hand. The young imps on the verandah were not\r\ndisappointed in their hope of hearing him \xe2\x80\x9cswar,\xe2\x80\x9d which he did with a\r\nfluency and fervency which delighted them all amazingly, as they ducked\r\nand dodged hither and thither, to be out of the reach of his\r\nriding-whip; and, all whooping off together, they tumbled, in a pile of\r\nimmeasurable giggle, on the withered turf under the verandah, where\r\nthey kicked up their heels and shouted to their full satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had the little devils!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Haley, between his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you ha\xe2\x80\x99nt got \xe2\x80\x99em, though!\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy, with a triumphant flourish,\r\nand making a string of indescribable mouths at the unfortunate trader\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nback, when he was fairly beyond hearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say now, Shelby, this yer \xe2\x80\x99s a most extro\xe2\x80\x99rnary business!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHaley, as he abruptly entered the parlor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems that gal \xe2\x80\x99s off,\r\nwith her young un.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Haley, Mrs. Shelby is present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, bowing slightly, with a still\r\nlowering brow; \xe2\x80\x9cbut still I say, as I said before, this yer\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsing\xe2\x80\x99lar report. Is it true, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, \xe2\x80\x9cif you wish to communicate with me, you must\r\nobserve something of the decorum of a gentleman. Andy, take Mr. Haley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhat and riding-whip. Take a seat, sir. Yes, sir; I regret to say that\r\nthe young woman, excited by overhearing, or having reported to her,\r\nsomething of this business, has taken her child in the night, and made\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did expect fair dealing in this matter, I confess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, turning sharply round upon him, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat am\r\nI to understand by that remark? If any man calls my honor in question,\r\nI have but one answer for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trader cowered at this, and in a somewhat lower tone said that \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nwas plaguy hard on a fellow, that had made a fair bargain, to be gulled\r\nthat way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Haley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, \xe2\x80\x9cif I did not think you had some cause\r\nfor disappointment, I should not have borne from you the rude and\r\nunceremonious style of your entrance into my parlor this morning. I say\r\nthus much, however, since appearances call for it, that I shall allow\r\nof no insinuations cast upon me, as if I were at all partner to any\r\nunfairness in this matter. Moreover, I shall feel bound to give you\r\nevery assistance, in the use of horses, servants, &c., in the recovery\r\nof your property. So, in short, Haley,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, suddenly dropping from\r\nthe tone of dignified coolness to his ordinary one of easy frankness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe best way for you is to keep good-natured and eat some breakfast,\r\nand we will then see what is to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby now rose, and said her engagements would prevent her being\r\nat the breakfast-table that morning; and, deputing a very respectable\r\nmulatto woman to attend to the gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s coffee at the side-board,\r\nshe left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld lady don\xe2\x80\x99t like your humble servant, over and above,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley,\r\nwith an uneasy effort to be very familiar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not accustomed to hear my wife spoken of with such freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Shelby, dryly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg pardon; of course, only a joke, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, forcing a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome jokes are less agreeable than others,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Shelby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevilish free, now I\xe2\x80\x99ve signed those papers, cuss him!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Haley\r\nto himself; \xe2\x80\x9cquite grand, since yesterday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever did fall of any prime minister at court occasion wider surges of\r\nsensation than the report of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s fate among his compeers on the\r\nplace. It was the topic in every mouth, everywhere; and nothing was\r\ndone in the house or in the field, but to discuss its probable results.\r\nEliza\xe2\x80\x99s flight\xe2\x80\x94an unprecedented event on the place\xe2\x80\x94was also a great\r\naccessory in stimulating the general excitement.\r\n\r\nBlack Sam, as he was commonly called, from his being about three shades\r\nblacker than any other son of ebony on the place, was revolving the\r\nmatter profoundly in all its phases and bearings, with a\r\ncomprehensiveness of vision and a strict lookout to his own personal\r\nwell-being, that would have done credit to any white patriot in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an ill wind dat blow nowhar,\xe2\x80\x94dat ar a fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam,\r\nsententiously, giving an additional hoist to his pantaloons, and\r\nadroitly substituting a long nail in place of a missing\r\nsuspender-button, with which effort of mechanical genius he seemed\r\nhighly delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s an ill wind blows nowhar,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, dar, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndown\xe2\x80\x94wal, course der\xe2\x80\x99s room for some nigger to be up\xe2\x80\x94and why not dis\r\nnigger?\xe2\x80\x94dat\xe2\x80\x99s de idee. Tom, a ridin\xe2\x80\x99 round de country\xe2\x80\x94boots\r\nblacked\xe2\x80\x94pass in his pocket\xe2\x80\x94all grand as Cuffee\xe2\x80\x94but who he? Now, why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Sam?\xe2\x80\x94dat\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloo, Sam\xe2\x80\x94O Sam! Mas\xe2\x80\x99r wants you to cotch Bill and Jerry,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAndy, cutting short Sam\xe2\x80\x99s soliloquy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh! what\xe2\x80\x99s afoot now, young un?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose, that Lizy\xe2\x80\x99s cut stick, and clared out,\r\nwith her young un?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou teach your granny!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, with infinite contempt; \xe2\x80\x9cknowed it a\r\nheap sight sooner than you did; this nigger an\xe2\x80\x99t so green, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, anyhow, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r wants Bill and Jerry geared right up; and you and\r\nI \xe2\x80\x99s to go with Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Haley, to look arter her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, now! dat\xe2\x80\x99s de time o\xe2\x80\x99 day!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Sam dat\xe2\x80\x99s called for\r\nin dese yer times. He\xe2\x80\x99s de nigger. See if I don\xe2\x80\x99t cotch her, now;\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99ll see what Sam can do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but, Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d better think twice; for Missis don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant her cotched, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll be in yer wool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, opening his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cHow you know dat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeard her say so, my own self, dis blessed mornin\xe2\x80\x99, when I bring in\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s shaving-water. She sent me to see why Lizy didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to dress\r\nher; and when I telled her she was off, she jest ris up, and ses she,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Lord be praised;\xe2\x80\x99 and Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, he seemed rael mad, and ses he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wife, you talk like a fool.\xe2\x80\x99 But Lor! she\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him to! I knows\r\nwell enough how that\xe2\x80\x99ll be,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s allers best to stand Missis\xe2\x80\x99 side the\r\nfence, now I tell yer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlack Sam, upon this, scratched his woolly pate, which, if it did not\r\ncontain very profound wisdom, still contained a great deal of a\r\nparticular species much in demand among politicians of all complexions\r\nand countries, and vulgarly denominated \xe2\x80\x9cknowing which side the bread\r\nis buttered;\xe2\x80\x9d so, stopping with grave consideration, he again gave a\r\nhitch to his pantaloons, which was his regularly organized method of\r\nassisting his mental perplexities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDer an\xe2\x80\x99t no saying\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94never\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98bout no kind o\xe2\x80\x99 thing in _dis_ yer world,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, at last. Sam spoke like a philosopher, emphasizing _this_\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nif he had had a large experience in different sorts of worlds, and\r\ntherefore had come to his conclusions advisedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, sartin I\xe2\x80\x99d a said that Missis would a scoured the varsal world\r\nafter Lizy,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sam, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy; \xe2\x80\x9cbut can\xe2\x80\x99t ye see through a ladder, ye black\r\nnigger? Missis don\xe2\x80\x99t want dis yer Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Haley to get Lizy\xe2\x80\x99s boy; dat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nde go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, with an indescribable intonation, known only to those\r\nwho have heard it among the negroes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell yer more \xe2\x80\x99n all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy; \xe2\x80\x9cI specs you\xe2\x80\x99d better be\r\nmaking tracks for dem hosses,\xe2\x80\x94mighty sudden, too,\xe2\x80\x94-for I hearn Missis\r\n\xe2\x80\x99quirin\xe2\x80\x99 arter yer,\xe2\x80\x94so you\xe2\x80\x99ve stood foolin\xe2\x80\x99 long enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam, upon this, began to bestir himself in real earnest, and after a\r\nwhile appeared, bearing down gloriously towards the house, with Bill\r\nand Jerry in a full canter, and adroitly throwing himself off before\r\nthey had any idea of stopping, he brought them up alongside of the\r\nhorse-post like a tornado. Haley\xe2\x80\x99s horse, which was a skittish young\r\ncolt, winced, and bounced, and pulled hard at his halter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, ho!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9cskeery, ar ye?\xe2\x80\x9d and his black visage lighted up\r\nwith a curious, mischievous gleam. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll fix ye now!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nThere was a large beech-tree overshadowing the place, and the small,\r\nsharp, triangular beech-nuts lay scattered thickly on the ground. With\r\none of these in his fingers, Sam approached the colt, stroked and\r\npatted, and seemed apparently busy in soothing his agitation. On\r\npretence of adjusting the saddle, he adroitly slipped under it the\r\nsharp little nut, in such a manner that the least weight brought upon\r\nthe saddle would annoy the nervous sensibilities of the animal, without\r\nleaving any perceptible graze or wound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDar!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rolling his eyes with an approving grin; \xe2\x80\x9cme fix \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mrs. Shelby appeared on the balcony, beckoning to him.\r\nSam approached with as good a determination to pay court as did ever\r\nsuitor after a vacant place at St. James\xe2\x80\x99 or Washington.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you been loitering so, Sam? I sent Andy to tell you to\r\nhurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless you, Missis!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9chorses won\xe2\x80\x99t be cotched all in a\r\nminit; they\xe2\x80\x99d done clared out way down to the south pasture, and the\r\nLord knows whar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSam, how often must I tell you not to say \xe2\x80\x98Lord bless you, and the\r\nLord knows,\xe2\x80\x99 and such things? It\xe2\x80\x99s wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Lord bless my soul! I done forgot, Missis! I won\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing of\r\nde sort no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Sam, you just _have_ said it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I? O, Lord! I mean\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go fur to say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be _careful_, Sam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust let me get my breath, Missis, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll start fair. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bery\r\ncareful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sam, you are to go with Mr. Haley, to show him the road, and\r\nhelp him. Be careful of the horses, Sam; you know Jerry was a little\r\nlame last week; _don\xe2\x80\x99t ride them too fast_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby spoke the last words with a low voice, and strong emphasis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet dis child alone for dat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, rolling up his eyes with a\r\nvolume of meaning. \xe2\x80\x9cLord knows! High! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t say dat!\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nsuddenly catching his breath, with a ludicrous flourish of\r\napprehension, which made his mistress laugh, spite of herself. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nMissis, I\xe2\x80\x99ll look out for de hosses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Andy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, returning to his stand under the beech-trees,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou see I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x99t all surprised if dat ar gen\xe2\x80\x99lman\xe2\x80\x99s crittur\r\nshould gib a fling, by and by, when he comes to be a gettin\xe2\x80\x99 up. You\r\nknow, Andy, critturs _will_ do such things;\xe2\x80\x9d and therewith Sam poked\r\nAndy in the side, in a highly suggestive manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy, with an air of instant appreciation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you see, Andy, Missis wants to make time,\xe2\x80\x94dat ar\xe2\x80\x99s clar to der\r\nmost or\xe2\x80\x99nary \xe2\x80\x99bserver. I jis make a little for her. Now, you see, get\r\nall dese yer hosses loose, caperin\xe2\x80\x99 permiscus round dis yer lot and\r\ndown to de wood dar, and I spec Mas\xe2\x80\x99r won\xe2\x80\x99t be off in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndy grinned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYer see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9cyer see, Andy, if any such thing should happen as\r\nthat Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Haley\xe2\x80\x99s horse _should_ begin to act contrary, and cut up,\r\nyou and I jist lets go of our\xe2\x80\x99n to help him, and _we\xe2\x80\x99ll help him_\xe2\x80\x94oh\r\nyes!\xe2\x80\x9d And Sam and Andy laid their heads back on their shoulders, and\r\nbroke into a low, immoderate laugh, snapping their fingers and\r\nflourishing their heels with exquisite delight.\r\n\r\nAt this instant, Haley appeared on the verandah. Somewhat mollified by\r\ncertain cups of very good coffee, he came out smiling and talking, in\r\ntolerably restored humor. Sam and Andy, clawing for certain fragmentary\r\npalm-leaves, which they were in the habit of considering as hats, flew\r\nto the horseposts, to be ready to \xe2\x80\x9chelp Mas\xe2\x80\x99r.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s palm-leaf had been ingeniously disentangled from all pretensions\r\nto braid, as respects its brim; and the slivers starting apart, and\r\nstanding upright, gave it a blazing air of freedom and defiance, quite\r\nequal to that of any Fejee chief; while the whole brim of Andy\xe2\x80\x99s being\r\ndeparted bodily, he rapped the crown on his head with a dexterous\r\nthump, and looked about well pleased, as if to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWho says I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngot a hat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, \xe2\x80\x9clook alive now; we must lose no time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of him, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, putting Haley\xe2\x80\x99s rein in his hand,\r\nand holding his stirrup, while Andy was untying the other two horses.\r\n\r\nThe instant Haley touched the saddle, the mettlesome creature bounded\r\nfrom the earth with a sudden spring, that threw his master sprawling,\r\nsome feet off, on the soft, dry turf. Sam, with frantic ejaculations,\r\nmade a dive at the reins, but only succeeded in brushing the blazing\r\npalm-leaf afore-named into the horse\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, which by no means tended\r\nto allay the confusion of his nerves. So, with great vehemence, he\r\noverturned Sam, and, giving two or three contemptuous snorts,\r\nflourished his heels vigorously in the air, and was soon prancing away\r\ntowards the lower end of the lawn, followed by Bill and Jerry, whom\r\nAndy had not failed to let loose, according to contract, speeding them\r\noff with various direful ejaculations. And now ensued a miscellaneous\r\nscene of confusion. Sam and Andy ran and shouted,\xe2\x80\x94dogs barked here and\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x94and Mike, Mose, Mandy, Fanny, and all the smaller specimens on\r\nthe place, both male and female, raced, clapped hands, whooped, and\r\nshouted, with outrageous officiousness and untiring zeal.\r\n\r\nHaley\xe2\x80\x99s horse, which was a white one, and very fleet and spirited,\r\nappeared to enter into the spirit of the scene with great gusto; and\r\nhaving for his coursing ground a lawn of nearly half a mile in extent,\r\ngently sloping down on every side into indefinite woodland, he appeared\r\nto take infinite delight in seeing how near he could allow his pursuers\r\nto approach him, and then, when within a hand\xe2\x80\x99s breadth, whisk off with\r\na start and a snort, like a mischievous beast as he was and career far\r\ndown into some alley of the wood-lot. Nothing was further from Sam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind than to have any one of the troop taken until such season as\r\nshould seem to him most befitting,\xe2\x80\x94and the exertions that he made were\r\ncertainly most heroic. Like the sword of Coeur De Lion, which always\r\nblazed in the front and thickest of the battle, Sam\xe2\x80\x99s palm-leaf was to\r\nbe seen everywhere when there was the least danger that a horse could\r\nbe caught; there he would bear down full tilt, shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cNow for it!\r\ncotch him! cotch him!\xe2\x80\x9d in a way that would set everything to\r\nindiscriminate rout in a moment.\r\n\r\nHaley ran up and down, and cursed and swore and stamped\r\nmiscellaneously. Mr. Shelby in vain tried to shout directions from the\r\nbalcony, and Mrs. Shelby from her chamber window alternately laughed\r\nand wondered,\xe2\x80\x94not without some inkling of what lay at the bottom of all\r\nthis confusion.\r\n\r\nAt last, about twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Sam appeared triumphant, mounted on\r\nJerry, with Haley\xe2\x80\x99s horse by his side, reeking with sweat, but with\r\nflashing eyes and dilated nostrils, showing that the spirit of freedom\r\nhad not yet entirely subsided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s cotched!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf \xe2\x80\x99t hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for me,\r\nthey might a bust themselves, all on \xe2\x80\x99em; but I cotched him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Haley, in no amiable mood. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for you,\r\nthis never would have happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless us, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, in a tone of the deepest concern,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand me that has been racin\xe2\x80\x99 and chasin\xe2\x80\x99 till the sweat jest pours off\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve lost me near three hours, with your\r\ncursed nonsense. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s be off, and have no more fooling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, in a deprecating tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you mean to\r\nkill us all clar, horses and all. Here we are all just ready to drop\r\ndown, and the critters all in a reek of sweat. Why, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r won\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nof startin\xe2\x80\x99 on now till arter dinner. Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s hoss wants rubben down;\r\nsee how he splashed hisself; and Jerry limps too; don\xe2\x80\x99t think Missis\r\nwould be willin\xe2\x80\x99 to have us start dis yer way, no how. Lord bless you,\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r, we can ketch up, if we do stop. Lizy never was no great of a\r\nwalker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby, who, greatly to her amusement, had overheard this\r\nconversation from the verandah, now resolved to do her part. She came\r\nforward, and, courteously expressing her concern for Haley\xe2\x80\x99s accident,\r\npressed him to stay to dinner, saying that the cook should bring it on\r\nthe table immediately.\r\n\r\nThus, all things considered, Haley, with rather an equivocal grace,\r\nproceeded to the parlor, while Sam, rolling his eyes after him with\r\nunutterable meaning, proceeded gravely with the horses to the\r\nstable-yard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid yer see him, Andy? _did_ yer see him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, when he had got\r\nfairly beyond the shelter of the barn, and fastened the horse to a\r\npost. \xe2\x80\x9cO, Lor, if it warn\xe2\x80\x99t as good as a meetin\xe2\x80\x99, now, to see him a\r\ndancin\xe2\x80\x99 and kickin\xe2\x80\x99 and swarin\xe2\x80\x99 at us. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I hear him? Swar away,\r\nole fellow (says I to myself ); will yer have yer hoss now, or wait\r\ntill you cotch him? (says I). Lor, Andy, I think I can see him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd Sam and Andy leaned up against the barn and laughed to their\r\nhearts\xe2\x80\x99 content.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYer oughter seen how mad he looked, when I brought the hoss up. Lord,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d a killed me, if he durs\xe2\x80\x99 to; and there I was a standin\xe2\x80\x99 as\r\ninnercent and as humble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, I seed you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy; \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99t you an old hoss, Sam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather specks I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9cdid yer see Missis up stars at the\r\nwinder? I seed her laughin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure, I was racin\xe2\x80\x99 so, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yer see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, proceeding gravely to wash down Haley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npony, \xe2\x80\x9cI \xe2\x80\x99se \xe2\x80\x99quired what yer may call a habit _o\xe2\x80\x99 bobservation_, Andy.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very \xe2\x80\x99portant habit, Andy; and I \xe2\x80\x99commend yer to be cultivatin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nit, now yer young. Hist up that hind foot, Andy. Yer see, Andy, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_bobservation_ makes all de difference in niggers. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I see which\r\nway the wind blew dis yer mornin\xe2\x80\x99? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I see what Missis wanted,\r\nthough she never let on? Dat ar\xe2\x80\x99s bobservation, Andy. I \xe2\x80\x99spects it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat you may call a faculty. Faculties is different in different\r\npeoples, but cultivation of \xe2\x80\x99em goes a great way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t helped your bobservation dis mornin\xe2\x80\x99, yer wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave seen your way so smart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99s a promisin\xe2\x80\x99 child, der an\xe2\x80\x99t no manner o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndoubt. I thinks lots of yer, Andy; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel no ways ashamed to\r\ntake idees from you. We oughtenter overlook nobody, Andy, cause the\r\nsmartest on us gets tripped up sometimes. And so, Andy, let\xe2\x80\x99s go up to\r\nthe house now. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be boun\xe2\x80\x99 Missis\xe2\x80\x99ll give us an uncommon good bite,\r\ndis yer time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nThe Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Struggle\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive of a human creature more wholly desolate\r\nand forlorn than Eliza, when she turned her footsteps from Uncle Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\nHer husband\xe2\x80\x99s suffering and dangers, and the danger of her child, all\r\nblended in her mind, with a confused and stunning sense of the risk she\r\nwas running, in leaving the only home she had ever known, and cutting\r\nloose from the protection of a friend whom she loved and revered. Then\r\nthere was the parting from every familiar object,\xe2\x80\x94the place where she\r\nhad grown up, the trees under which she had played, the groves where\r\nshe had walked many an evening in happier days, by the side of her\r\nyoung husband,\xe2\x80\x94everything, as it lay in the clear, frosty starlight,\r\nseemed to speak reproachfully to her, and ask her whither could she go\r\nfrom a home like that?\r\n\r\nBut stronger than all was maternal love, wrought into a paroxysm of\r\nfrenzy by the near approach of a fearful danger. Her boy was old enough\r\nto have walked by her side, and, in an indifferent case, she would only\r\nhave led him by the hand; but now the bare thought of putting him out\r\nof her arms made her shudder, and she strained him to her bosom with a\r\nconvulsive grasp, as she went rapidly forward.\r\n\r\nThe frosty ground creaked beneath her feet, and she trembled at the\r\nsound; every quaking leaf and fluttering shadow sent the blood backward\r\nto her heart, and quickened her footsteps. She wondered within herself\r\nat the strength that seemed to be come upon her; for she felt the\r\nweight of her boy as if it had been a feather, and every flutter of\r\nfear seemed to increase the supernatural power that bore her on, while\r\nfrom her pale lips burst forth, in frequent ejaculations, the prayer to\r\na Friend above\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLord, help! Lord, save me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf it were _your_ Harry, mother, or your Willie, that were going to be\r\ntorn from you by a brutal trader, tomorrow morning,\xe2\x80\x94if you had seen the\r\nman, and heard that the papers were signed and delivered, and you had\r\nonly from twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock till morning to make good your escape,\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nfast could _you_ walk? How many miles could you make in those few brief\r\nhours, with the darling at your bosom,\xe2\x80\x94the little sleepy head on your\r\nshoulder,\xe2\x80\x94the small, soft arms trustingly holding on to your neck?\r\n\r\nFor the child slept. At first, the novelty and alarm kept him waking;\r\nbut his mother so hurriedly repressed every breath or sound, and so\r\nassured him that if he were only still she would certainly save him,\r\nthat he clung quietly round her neck, only asking, as he found himself\r\nsinking to sleep,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to keep awake, do I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my darling; sleep, if you want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, mother, if I do get asleep, you won\xe2\x80\x99t let him get me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! so may God help me!\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother, with a paler cheek, and a\r\nbrighter light in her large dark eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re _sure_, an\xe2\x80\x99t you, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, _sure_!\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, in a voice that startled herself; for\r\nit seemed to her to come from a spirit within, that was no part of her;\r\nand the boy dropped his little weary head on her shoulder, and was soon\r\nasleep. How the touch of those warm arms, the gentle breathings that\r\ncame in her neck, seemed to add fire and spirit to her movements! It\r\nseemed to her as if strength poured into her in electric streams, from\r\nevery gentle touch and movement of the sleeping, confiding child.\r\nSublime is the dominion of the mind over the body, that, for a time,\r\ncan make flesh and nerve impregnable, and string the sinews like steel,\r\nso that the weak become so mighty.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the farm, the grove, the wood-lot, passed by her\r\ndizzily, as she walked on; and still she went, leaving one familiar\r\nobject after another, slacking not, pausing not, till reddening\r\ndaylight found her many a long mile from all traces of any familiar\r\nobjects upon the open highway.\r\n\r\nShe had often been, with her mistress, to visit some connections, in\r\nthe little village of T\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, not far from the Ohio river, and knew the\r\nroad well. To go thither, to escape across the Ohio river, were the\r\nfirst hurried outlines of her plan of escape; beyond that, she could\r\nonly hope in God.\r\n\r\nWhen horses and vehicles began to move along the highway, with that\r\nalert perception peculiar to a state of excitement, and which seems to\r\nbe a sort of inspiration, she became aware that her headlong pace and\r\ndistracted air might bring on her remark and suspicion. She therefore\r\nput the boy on the ground, and, adjusting her dress and bonnet, she\r\nwalked on at as rapid a pace as she thought consistent with the\r\npreservation of appearances. In her little bundle she had provided a\r\nstore of cakes and apples, which she used as expedients for quickening\r\nthe speed of the child, rolling the apple some yards before them, when\r\nthe boy would run with all his might after it; and this ruse, often\r\nrepeated, carried them over many a half-mile.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, they came to a thick patch of woodland, through which\r\nmurmured a clear brook. As the child complained of hunger and thirst,\r\nshe climbed over the fence with him; and, sitting down behind a large\r\nrock which concealed them from the road, she gave him a breakfast out\r\nof her little package. The boy wondered and grieved that she could not\r\neat; and when, putting his arms round her neck, he tried to wedge some\r\nof his cake into her mouth, it seemed to her that the rising in her\r\nthroat would choke her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Harry darling! mother can\xe2\x80\x99t eat till you are safe! We must go\r\non\xe2\x80\x94on\xe2\x80\x94till we come to the river!\xe2\x80\x9d And she hurried again into the road,\r\nand again constrained herself to walk regularly and composedly forward.\r\n\r\nShe was many miles past any neighborhood where she was personally\r\nknown. If she should chance to meet any who knew her, she reflected\r\nthat the well-known kindness of the family would be of itself a blind\r\nto suspicion, as making it an unlikely supposition that she could be a\r\nfugitive. As she was also so white as not to be known as of colored\r\nlineage, without a critical survey, and her child was white also, it\r\nwas much easier for her to pass on unsuspected.\r\n\r\nOn this presumption, she stopped at noon at a neat farmhouse, to rest\r\nherself, and buy some dinner for her child and self; for, as the danger\r\ndecreased with the distance, the supernatural tension of the nervous\r\nsystem lessened, and she found herself both weary and hungry.\r\n\r\nThe good woman, kindly and gossipping, seemed rather pleased than\r\notherwise with having somebody come in to talk with; and accepted,\r\nwithout examination, Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s statement, that she \xe2\x80\x9cwas going on a little\r\npiece, to spend a week with her friends,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94all which she hoped in her\r\nheart might prove strictly true.\r\n\r\nAn hour before sunset, she entered the village of T\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, by the Ohio\r\nriver, weary and foot-sore, but still strong in heart. Her first glance\r\nwas at the river, which lay, like Jordan, between her and the Canaan of\r\nliberty on the other side.\r\n\r\nIt was now early spring, and the river was swollen and turbulent; great\r\ncakes of floating ice were swinging heavily to and fro in the turbid\r\nwaters. Owing to the peculiar form of the shore on the Kentucky side,\r\nthe land bending far out into the water, the ice had been lodged and\r\ndetained in great quantities, and the narrow channel which swept round\r\nthe bend was full of ice, piled one cake over another, thus forming a\r\ntemporary barrier to the descending ice, which lodged, and formed a\r\ngreat, undulating raft, filling up the whole river, and extending\r\nalmost to the Kentucky shore.\r\n\r\nEliza stood, for a moment, contemplating this unfavorable aspect of\r\nthings, which she saw at once must prevent the usual ferry-boat from\r\nrunning, and then turned into a small public house on the bank, to make\r\na few inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe hostess, who was busy in various fizzing and stewing operations\r\nover the fire, preparatory to the evening meal, stopped, with a fork in\r\nher hand, as Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s sweet and plaintive voice arrested her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there any ferry or boat, that takes people over to B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman; \xe2\x80\x9cthe boats has stopped running.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEliza\xe2\x80\x99s look of dismay and disappointment struck the woman, and she\r\nsaid, inquiringly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay be you\xe2\x80\x99re wanting to get over?\xe2\x80\x94anybody sick? Ye seem mighty\r\nanxious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a child that\xe2\x80\x99s very dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza. \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard of\r\nit till last night, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve walked quite a piece today, in hopes to\r\nget to the ferry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, that\xe2\x80\x99s onlucky,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, whose motherly sympathies\r\nwere much aroused; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m re\xe2\x80\x99lly consarned for ye. Solomon!\xe2\x80\x9d she called,\r\nfrom the window, towards a small back building. A man, in leather apron\r\nand very dirty hands, appeared at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Sol,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, \xe2\x80\x9cis that ar man going to tote them bar\xe2\x80\x99ls\r\nover tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said he should try, if \xe2\x80\x99t was any way prudent,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a man a piece down here, that\xe2\x80\x99s going over with some truck\r\nthis evening, if he durs\xe2\x80\x99 to; he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in here to supper tonight, so\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d better set down and wait. That\xe2\x80\x99s a sweet little fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nthe woman, offering him a cake.\r\n\r\nBut the child, wholly exhausted, cried with weariness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow! he isn\xe2\x80\x99t used to walking, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve hurried him on so,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Eliza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, take him into this room,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, opening into a small\r\nbed-room, where stood a comfortable bed. Eliza laid the weary boy upon\r\nit, and held his hands in hers till he was fast asleep. For her there\r\nwas no rest. As a fire in her bones, the thought of the pursuer urged\r\nher on; and she gazed with longing eyes on the sullen, surging waters\r\nthat lay between her and liberty.\r\n\r\nHere we must take our leave of her for the present, to follow the\r\ncourse of her pursuers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Mrs. Shelby had promised that the dinner should be hurried on\r\ntable, yet it was soon seen, as the thing has often been seen before,\r\nthat it required more than one to make a bargain. So, although the\r\norder was fairly given out in Haley\xe2\x80\x99s hearing, and carried to Aunt\r\nChloe by at least half a dozen juvenile messengers, that dignitary only\r\ngave certain very gruff snorts, and tosses of her head, and went on\r\nwith every operation in an unusually leisurely and circumstantial\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nFor some singular reason, an impression seemed to reign among the\r\nservants generally that Missis would not be particularly disobliged by\r\ndelay; and it was wonderful what a number of counter accidents occurred\r\nconstantly, to retard the course of things. One luckless wight\r\ncontrived to upset the gravy; and then gravy had to be got up _de\r\nnovo_, with due care and formality, Aunt Chloe watching and stirring\r\nwith dogged precision, answering shortly, to all suggestions of haste,\r\nthat she \xe2\x80\x9cwarn\xe2\x80\x99t a going to have raw gravy on the table, to help\r\nnobody\xe2\x80\x99s catchings.\xe2\x80\x9d One tumbled down with the water, and had to go to\r\nthe spring for more; and another precipitated the butter into the path\r\nof events; and there was from time to time giggling news brought into\r\nthe kitchen that \xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r Haley was mighty oneasy, and that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsit in his cheer no ways, but was a walkin\xe2\x80\x99 and stalkin\xe2\x80\x99 to the winders\r\nand through the porch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSarves him right!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll get wus nor\r\noneasy, one of these days, if he don\xe2\x80\x99t mend his ways. _His_ master\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe sending for him, and then see how he\xe2\x80\x99ll look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll go to torment, and no mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Jake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe desarves it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, grimly; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s broke a many, many,\r\nmany hearts,\xe2\x80\x94I tell ye all!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, stopping, with a fork uplifted\r\nin her hands; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s like what Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George reads in Ravelations,\xe2\x80\x94souls\r\na callin\xe2\x80\x99 under the altar! and a callin\xe2\x80\x99 on the Lord for vengeance on\r\nsich!\xe2\x80\x94and by and by the Lord he\xe2\x80\x99ll hear \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94so he will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Chloe, who was much revered in the kitchen, was listened to with\r\nopen mouth; and, the dinner being now fairly sent in, the whole kitchen\r\nwas at leisure to gossip with her, and to listen to her remarks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSich\xe2\x80\x99ll be burnt up forever, and no mistake; won\xe2\x80\x99t ther?\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to see it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be boun\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Jake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChil\xe2\x80\x99en!\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice, that made them all start. It was Uncle Tom,\r\nwho had come in, and stood listening to the conversation at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChil\xe2\x80\x99en!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afeard you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what ye\xe2\x80\x99re sayin\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nForever is a _dre\xe2\x80\x99ful_ word, chil\xe2\x80\x99en; it\xe2\x80\x99s awful to think on \xe2\x80\x99t. You\r\noughtenter wish that ar to any human crittur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t to anybody but the soul-drivers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy; \xe2\x80\x9cnobody can\r\nhelp wishing it to them, they \xe2\x80\x99s so awful wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t natur herself kinder cry out on \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndey tear der suckin\xe2\x80\x99 baby right off his mother\xe2\x80\x99s breast, and sell him,\r\nand der little children as is crying and holding on by her\r\nclothes,\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t dey pull \xe2\x80\x99em off and sells \xe2\x80\x99em? Don\xe2\x80\x99t dey tear wife and\r\nhusband apart?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, beginning to cry, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it\xe2\x80\x99s jest\r\ntakin\xe2\x80\x99 the very life on \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x94and all the while does they feel one bit,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t dey drink and smoke, and take it oncommon easy? Lor, if the devil\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t get them, what\xe2\x80\x99s he good for?\xe2\x80\x9d And Aunt Chloe covered her face\r\nwith her checked apron, and began to sob in good earnest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray for them that \xe2\x80\x99spitefully use you, the good book says,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray for \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe; \xe2\x80\x9cLor, it\xe2\x80\x99s too tough! I can\xe2\x80\x99t pray for\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s natur, Chloe, and natur \xe2\x80\x99s strong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrace is stronger; besides, you oughter think what an awful state a\r\npoor crittur\xe2\x80\x99s soul \xe2\x80\x99s in that\xe2\x80\x99ll do them ar things,\xe2\x80\x94you oughter thank\r\nGod that you an\xe2\x80\x99t _like_ him, Chloe. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99d rather be sold, ten\r\nthousand times over, than to have all that ar poor crittur\xe2\x80\x99s got to\r\nanswer for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo \xe2\x80\x99d I, a heap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jake. \xe2\x80\x9cLor, _shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ we cotch it, Andy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndy shrugged his shoulders, and gave an acquiescent whistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad Mas\xe2\x80\x99r didn\xe2\x80\x99t go off this morning, as he looked to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat ar hurt me more than sellin\xe2\x80\x99, it did. Mebbe it might have been\r\nnatural for him, but \xe2\x80\x99t would have come desp\xe2\x80\x99t hard on me, as has known\r\nhim from a baby; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, and I begin ter feel sort o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreconciled to the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s will now. Mas\xe2\x80\x99r couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help hisself; he did\r\nright, but I\xe2\x80\x99m feared things will be kinder goin\xe2\x80\x99 to rack, when I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngone Mas\xe2\x80\x99r can\xe2\x80\x99t be spected to be a pryin\xe2\x80\x99 round everywhar, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone, a keepin\xe2\x80\x99 up all the ends. The boys all means well, but they \xe2\x80\x99s\r\npowerful car\xe2\x80\x99less. That ar troubles me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bell here rang, and Tom was summoned to the parlor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d said his master, kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to notice that I give this\r\ngentleman bonds to forfeit a thousand dollars if you are not on the\r\nspot when he wants you; he\xe2\x80\x99s going today to look after his other\r\nbusiness, and you can have the day to yourself. Go anywhere you like,\r\nboy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mind yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t come it over your\r\nmaster with any o\xe2\x80\x99 yer nigger tricks; for I\xe2\x80\x99ll take every cent out of\r\nhim, if you an\xe2\x80\x99t thar. If he\xe2\x80\x99d hear to me, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust any on\r\nye\xe2\x80\x94slippery as eels!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom,\xe2\x80\x94and he stood very straight,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI was jist eight years\r\nold when ole Missis put you into my arms, and you wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a year old.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thar,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98Tom, that\xe2\x80\x99s to be _your_ young Mas\xe2\x80\x99r; take good care\r\non him,\xe2\x80\x99 says she. And now I jist ask you, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, have I ever broke\r\nword to you, or gone contrary to you, \xe2\x80\x99specially since I was a\r\nChristian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Shelby was fairly overcome, and the tears rose to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Lord knows you say but the truth; and if I\r\nwas able to help it, all the world shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd sure as I am a Christian woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall be\r\nredeemed as soon as I can any way bring together means. Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nto Haley, \xe2\x80\x9ctake good account of who you sell him to, and let me know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, yes, for that matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader, \xe2\x80\x9cI may bring him up in a\r\nyear, not much the wuss for wear, and trade him back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll trade with you then, and make it for your advantage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nShelby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader, \xe2\x80\x9call \xe2\x80\x99s equal with me; li\xe2\x80\x99ves trade \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nup as down, so I does a good business. All I want is a livin\xe2\x80\x99, you\r\nknow, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; that\xe2\x80\x99s all any on us wants, I, s\xe2\x80\x99pose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Shelby both felt annoyed and degraded by the familiar\r\nimpudence of the trader, and yet both saw the absolute necessity of\r\nputting a constraint on their feelings. The more hopelessly sordid and\r\ninsensible he appeared, the greater became Mrs. Shelby\xe2\x80\x99s dread of his\r\nsucceeding in recapturing Eliza and her child, and of course the\r\ngreater her motive for detaining him by every female artifice. She\r\ntherefore graciously smiled, assented, chatted familiarly, and did all\r\nshe could to make time pass imperceptibly.\r\n\r\nAt two o\xe2\x80\x99clock Sam and Andy brought the horses up to the posts,\r\napparently greatly refreshed and invigorated by the scamper of the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nSam was there new oiled from dinner, with an abundance of zealous and\r\nready officiousness. As Haley approached, he was boasting, in\r\nflourishing style, to Andy, of the evident and eminent success of the\r\noperation, now that he had \xe2\x80\x9cfarly come to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour master, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose, don\xe2\x80\x99t keep no dogs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, thoughtfully,\r\nas he prepared to mount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaps on \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, triumphantly; \xe2\x80\x9cthar\xe2\x80\x99s Bruno\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a roarer!\r\nand, besides that, \xe2\x80\x99bout every nigger of us keeps a pup of some natur\r\nor uther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley,\xe2\x80\x94and he said something else, too, with regard to the\r\nsaid dogs, at which Sam muttered,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see no use cussin\xe2\x80\x99 on \xe2\x80\x99em, no way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your master don\xe2\x80\x99t keep no dogs (I pretty much know he don\xe2\x80\x99t) for\r\ntrackin\xe2\x80\x99 out niggers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam knew exactly what he meant, but he kept on a look of earnest and\r\ndesperate simplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur dogs all smells round considable sharp. I spect they\xe2\x80\x99s the kind,\r\nthough they han\xe2\x80\x99t never had no practice. They \xe2\x80\x99s _far_ dogs, though, at\r\nmost anything, if you\xe2\x80\x99d get \xe2\x80\x99em started. Here, Bruno,\xe2\x80\x9d he called,\r\nwhistling to the lumbering Newfoundland, who came pitching tumultuously\r\ntoward them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go hang!\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, getting up. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, tumble up now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam tumbled up accordingly, dexterously contriving to tickle Andy as he\r\ndid so, which occasioned Andy to split out into a laugh, greatly to\r\nHaley\xe2\x80\x99s indignation, who made a cut at him with his riding-whip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI \xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99stonished at yer, Andy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, with awful gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nyer\xe2\x80\x99s a seris bisness, Andy. Yer mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be a makin\xe2\x80\x99 game. This yer\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99t no way to help Mas\xe2\x80\x99r.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall take the straight road to the river,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, decidedly,\r\nafter they had come to the boundaries of the estate. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the way of\r\nall of \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x94they makes tracks for the underground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSartin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9cdat\xe2\x80\x99s de idee. Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Haley hits de thing right in\r\nde middle. Now, der\xe2\x80\x99s two roads to de river,\xe2\x80\x94de dirt road and der\r\npike,\xe2\x80\x94which Mas\xe2\x80\x99r mean to take?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndy looked up innocently at Sam, surprised at hearing this new\r\ngeographical fact, but instantly confirmed what he said, by a vehement\r\nreiteration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCause,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather be \xe2\x80\x99clined to \xe2\x80\x99magine that Lizy \xe2\x80\x99d take\r\nde dirt road, bein\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s the least travelled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaley, notwithstanding that he was a very old bird, and naturally\r\ninclined to be suspicious of chaff, was rather brought up by this view\r\nof the case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf yer warn\xe2\x80\x99t both on yer such cussed liars, now!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\ncontemplatively as he pondered a moment.\r\n\r\nThe pensive, reflective tone in which this was spoken appeared to amuse\r\nAndy prodigiously, and he drew a little behind, and shook so as\r\napparently to run a great risk of failing off his horse, while Sam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface was immovably composed into the most doleful gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r can do as he\xe2\x80\x99d ruther, go de straight road,\r\nif Mas\xe2\x80\x99r thinks best,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all one to us. Now, when I study \xe2\x80\x99pon it, I\r\nthink de straight road de best, _deridedly_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would naturally go a lonesome way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, thinking aloud,\r\nand not minding Sam\xe2\x80\x99s remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDar an\xe2\x80\x99t no sayin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9cgals is pecular; they never does\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99 ye thinks they will; mose gen\xe2\x80\x99lly the contrary. Gals is nat\xe2\x80\x99lly\r\nmade contrary; and so, if you thinks they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone one road, it is\r\nsartin you\xe2\x80\x99d better go t\xe2\x80\x99 other, and then you\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to find \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nNow, my private \xe2\x80\x99pinion is, Lizy took der road; so I think we\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\ntake de straight one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis profound generic view of the female sex did not seem to dispose\r\nHaley particularly to the straight road, and he announced decidedly\r\nthat he should go the other, and asked Sam when they should come to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little piece ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, giving a wink to Andy with the eye\r\nwhich was on Andy\xe2\x80\x99s side of the head; and he added, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nstudded on de matter, and I\xe2\x80\x99m quite clar we ought not to go dat ar way.\r\nI nebber been over it no way. It\xe2\x80\x99s despit lonesome, and we might lose\r\nour way,\xe2\x80\x94whar we\xe2\x80\x99d come to, de Lord only knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I think on \xe2\x80\x99t, I think I hearn \xe2\x80\x99em tell that dat ar road was all\r\nfenced up and down by der creek, and thar, an\xe2\x80\x99t it, Andy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t certain; he\xe2\x80\x99d only \xe2\x80\x9chearn tell\xe2\x80\x9d about that road, but never\r\nbeen over it. In short, he was strictly noncommittal.\r\n\r\nHaley, accustomed to strike the balance of probabilities between lies\r\nof greater or lesser magnitude, thought that it lay in favor of the\r\ndirt road aforesaid. The mention of the thing he thought he perceived\r\nwas involuntary on Sam\xe2\x80\x99s part at first, and his confused attempts to\r\ndissuade him he set down to a desperate lying on second thoughts, as\r\nbeing unwilling to implicate Liza.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, Sam indicated the road, Haley plunged briskly into it,\r\nfollowed by Sam and Andy.\r\n\r\nNow, the road, in fact, was an old one, that had formerly been a\r\nthoroughfare to the river, but abandoned for many years after the\r\nlaying of the new pike. It was open for about an hour\xe2\x80\x99s ride, and after\r\nthat it was cut across by various farms and fences. Sam knew this fact\r\nperfectly well,\xe2\x80\x94indeed, the road had been so long closed up, that Andy\r\nhad never heard of it. He therefore rode along with an air of dutiful\r\nsubmission, only groaning and vociferating occasionally that \xe2\x80\x99t was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdesp\xe2\x80\x99t rough, and bad for Jerry\xe2\x80\x99s foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I jest give yer warning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, \xe2\x80\x9cI know yer; yer won\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nme to turn off this road, with all yer fussin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94so you shet up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r will go his own way!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, with rueful submission, at the\r\nsame time winking most portentously to Andy, whose delight was now very\r\nnear the explosive point.\r\n\r\nSam was in wonderful spirits,\xe2\x80\x94professed to keep a very brisk\r\nlookout,\xe2\x80\x94at one time exclaiming that he saw \xe2\x80\x9ca gal\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet\xe2\x80\x9d on the top\r\nof some distant eminence, or calling to Andy \xe2\x80\x9cif that thar wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Lizy\xe2\x80\x99 down in the hollow;\xe2\x80\x9d always making these exclamations in some\r\nrough or craggy part of the road, where the sudden quickening of speed\r\nwas a special inconvenience to all parties concerned, and thus keeping\r\nHaley in a state of constant commotion.\r\n\r\nAfter riding about an hour in this way, the whole party made a\r\nprecipitate and tumultuous descent into a barn-yard belonging to a\r\nlarge farming establishment. Not a soul was in sight, all the hands\r\nbeing employed in the fields; but, as the barn stood conspicuously and\r\nplainly square across the road, it was evident that their journey in\r\nthat direction had reached a decided finale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWan\xe2\x80\x99t dat ar what I telled Mas\xe2\x80\x99r?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, with an air of injured\r\ninnocence. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does strange gentleman spect to know more about a\r\ncountry dan de natives born and raised?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou rascal!\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, \xe2\x80\x9cyou knew all about this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell yer I _knowd_, and yer wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe me? I telled\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r \xe2\x80\x99t was all shet up, and fenced up, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t spect we could\r\nget through,\xe2\x80\x94Andy heard me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was all too true to be disputed, and the unlucky man had to pocket\r\nhis wrath with the best grace he was able, and all three faced to the\r\nright about, and took up their line of march for the highway.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of all the various delays, it was about three-quarters\r\nof an hour after Eliza had laid her child to sleep in the village\r\ntavern that the party came riding into the same place. Eliza was\r\nstanding by the window, looking out in another direction, when Sam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquick eye caught a glimpse of her. Haley and Andy were two yards\r\nbehind. At this crisis, Sam contrived to have his hat blown off, and\r\nuttered a loud and characteristic ejaculation, which startled her at\r\nonce; she drew suddenly back; the whole train swept by the window,\r\nround to the front door.\r\n\r\nA thousand lives seemed to be concentrated in that one moment to Eliza.\r\nHer room opened by a side door to the river. She caught her child, and\r\nsprang down the steps towards it. The trader caught a full glimpse of\r\nher just as she was disappearing down the bank; and throwing himself\r\nfrom his horse, and calling loudly on Sam and Andy, he was after her\r\nlike a hound after a deer. In that dizzy moment her feet to her scarce\r\nseemed to touch the ground, and a moment brought her to the water\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nedge. Right on behind they came; and, nerved with strength such as God\r\ngives only to the desperate, with one wild cry and flying leap, she\r\nvaulted sheer over the turbid current by the shore, on to the raft of\r\nice beyond. It was a desperate leap\xe2\x80\x94impossible to anything but madness\r\nand despair; and Haley, Sam, and Andy, instinctively cried out, and\r\nlifted up their hands, as she did it.\r\n\r\nThe huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted pitched and\r\ncreaked as her weight came on it, but she staid there not a moment.\r\nWith wild cries and desperate energy she leaped to another and still\r\nanother cake; stumbling\xe2\x80\x94leaping\xe2\x80\x94slipping\xe2\x80\x94springing upwards again! Her\r\nshoes are gone\xe2\x80\x94her stockings cut from her feet\xe2\x80\x94while blood marked every\r\nstep; but she saw nothing, felt nothing, till dimly, as in a dream, she\r\nsaw the Ohio side, and a man helping her up the bank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYer a brave gal, now, whoever ye ar!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, with an oath.\r\n\r\nEliza recognized the voice and face for a man who owned a farm not far\r\nfrom her old home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Mr. Symmes!\xe2\x80\x94save me\xe2\x80\x94do save me\xe2\x80\x94do hide me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Elia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if \xe2\x80\x99tan\xe2\x80\x99t Shelby\xe2\x80\x99s gal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child!\xe2\x80\x94this boy!\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99d sold him! There is his Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\npointing to the Kentucky shore. \xe2\x80\x9cO, Mr. Symmes, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a little\r\nboy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, as he roughly, but kindly, drew her up the\r\nsteep bank. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, you\xe2\x80\x99re a right brave gal. I like grit, wherever I\r\nsee it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they had gained the top of the bank, the man paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to do something for ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut then there\xe2\x80\x99s nowhar\r\nI could take ye. The best I can do is to tell ye to go _thar_,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, pointing to a large white house which stood by itself, off the main\r\nstreet of the village. \xe2\x80\x9cGo thar; they\xe2\x80\x99re kind folks. Thar\xe2\x80\x99s no kind o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndanger but they\xe2\x80\x99ll help you,\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re up to all that sort o\xe2\x80\x99 thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo \xe2\x80\x99casion, no \xe2\x80\x99casion in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve done\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nof no \xe2\x80\x99count.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, oh, surely, sir, you won\xe2\x80\x99t tell any one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to thunder, gal! What do you take a feller for? In course not,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the man. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, go along like a likely, sensible gal, as you\r\nare. You\xe2\x80\x99ve arnt your liberty, and you shall have it, for all me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman folded her child to her bosom, and walked firmly and swiftly\r\naway. The man stood and looked after her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShelby, now, mebbe won\xe2\x80\x99t think this yer the most neighborly thing in\r\nthe world; but what\xe2\x80\x99s a feller to do? If he catches one of my gals in\r\nthe same fix, he\xe2\x80\x99s welcome to pay back. Somehow I never could see no\r\nkind o\xe2\x80\x99 critter a strivin\xe2\x80\x99 and pantin\xe2\x80\x99, and trying to clar theirselves,\r\nwith the dogs arter \xe2\x80\x99em and go agin \xe2\x80\x99em. Besides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see no kind\r\nof \xe2\x80\x99casion for me to be hunter and catcher for other folks, neither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spoke this poor, heathenish Kentuckian, who had not been instructed\r\nin his constitutional relations, and consequently was betrayed into\r\nacting in a sort of Christianized manner, which, if he had been better\r\nsituated and more enlightened, he would not have been left to do.\r\n\r\nHaley had stood a perfectly amazed spectator of the scene, till Eliza\r\nhad disappeared up the bank, when he turned a blank, inquiring look on\r\nSam and Andy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ar was a tolable fair stroke of business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gal \xe2\x80\x99s got seven devils in her, I believe!\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley. \xe2\x80\x9cHow like\r\na wildcat she jumped!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, scratching his head, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99scuse us\r\ntrying dat ar road. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think I feel spry enough for dat ar, no way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand Sam gave a hoarse chuckle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ laugh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader, with a growl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless you, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, giving way\r\nto the long pent-up delight of his soul. \xe2\x80\x9cShe looked so curi\xe2\x80\x99s, a\r\nleapin\xe2\x80\x99 and springin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94ice a crackin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and only to hear her,\xe2\x80\x94plump! ker\r\nchunk! ker splash! Spring! Lord! how she goes it!\xe2\x80\x9d and Sam and Andy\r\nlaughed till the tears rolled down their cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make ye laugh t\xe2\x80\x99 other side yer mouths!\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader, laying\r\nabout their heads with his riding-whip.\r\n\r\nBoth ducked, and ran shouting up the bank, and were on their horses\r\nbefore he was up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-evening, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, with much gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cI berry much spect\r\nMissis be anxious \xe2\x80\x99bout Jerry. Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Haley won\xe2\x80\x99t want us no longer.\r\nMissis wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of our ridin\xe2\x80\x99 the critters over Lizy\xe2\x80\x99s bridge\r\ntonight;\xe2\x80\x9d and, with a facetious poke into Andy\xe2\x80\x99s ribs, he started off,\r\nfollowed by the latter, at full speed,\xe2\x80\x94their shouts of laughter coming\r\nfaintly on the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nEliza\xe2\x80\x99s Escape\r\n\r\n\r\nEliza made her desperate retreat across the river just in the dusk of\r\ntwilight. The gray mist of evening, rising slowly from the river,\r\nenveloped her as she disappeared up the bank, and the swollen current\r\nand floundering masses of ice presented a hopeless barrier between her\r\nand her pursuer. Haley therefore slowly and discontentedly returned to\r\nthe little tavern, to ponder further what was to be done. The woman\r\nopened to him the door of a little parlor, covered with a rag carpet,\r\nwhere stood a table with a very shining black oil-cloth, sundry lank,\r\nhigh-backed wood chairs, with some plaster images in resplendent colors\r\non the mantel-shelf, above a very dimly-smoking grate; a long hard-wood\r\nsettle extended its uneasy length by the chimney, and here Haley sat\r\nhim down to meditate on the instability of human hopes and happiness in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I want with the little cuss, now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nI should have got myself treed like a coon, as I am, this yer way?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nHaley relieved himself by repeating over a not very select litany of\r\nimprecations on himself, which, though there was the best possible\r\nreason to consider them as true, we shall, as a matter of taste, omit.\r\n\r\nHe was startled by the loud and dissonant voice of a man who was\r\napparently dismounting at the door. He hurried to the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the land! if this yer an\xe2\x80\x99t the nearest, now, to what I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard\r\nfolks call Providence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley. \xe2\x80\x9cI do b\xe2\x80\x99lieve that ar\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Loker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaley hastened out. Standing by the bar, in the corner of the room, was\r\na brawny, muscular man, full six feet in height, and broad in\r\nproportion. He was dressed in a coat of buffalo-skin, made with the\r\nhair outward, which gave him a shaggy and fierce appearance, perfectly\r\nin keeping with the whole air of his physiognomy. In the head and face\r\nevery organ and lineament expressive of brutal and unhesitating\r\nviolence was in a state of the highest possible development. Indeed,\r\ncould our readers fancy a bull-dog come unto man\xe2\x80\x99s estate, and walking\r\nabout in a hat and coat, they would have no unapt idea of the general\r\nstyle and effect of his physique. He was accompanied by a travelling\r\ncompanion, in many respects an exact contrast to himself. He was short\r\nand slender, lithe and catlike in his motions, and had a peering,\r\nmousing expression about his keen black eyes, with which every feature\r\nof his face seemed sharpened into sympathy; his thin, long nose, ran\r\nout as if it was eager to bore into the nature of things in general;\r\nhis sleek, thin, black hair was stuck eagerly forward, and all his\r\nmotions and evolutions expressed a dry, cautious acuteness. The great\r\nman poured out a big tumbler half full of raw spirits, and gulped it\r\ndown without a word. The little man stood tiptoe, and putting his head\r\nfirst to one side and then the other, and snuffing considerately in the\r\ndirections of the various bottles, ordered at last a mint julep, in a\r\nthin and quivering voice, and with an air of great circumspection. When\r\npoured out, he took it and looked at it with a sharp, complacent air,\r\nlike a man who thinks he has done about the right thing, and hit the\r\nnail on the head, and proceeded to dispose of it in short and\r\nwell-advised sips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, now, who\xe2\x80\x99d a thought this yer luck \xe2\x80\x99ad come to me? Why, Loker,\r\nhow are ye?\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, coming forward, and extending his hand to the\r\nbig man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d was the civil reply. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat brought you here, Haley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mousing man, who bore the name of Marks, instantly stopped his\r\nsipping, and, poking his head forward, looked shrewdly on the new\r\nacquaintance, as a cat sometimes looks at a moving dry leaf, or some\r\nother possible object of pursuit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Tom, this yer\xe2\x80\x99s the luckiest thing in the world. I\xe2\x80\x99m in a devil\r\nof a hobble, and you must help me out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh? aw! like enough!\xe2\x80\x9d grunted his complacent acquaintance. \xe2\x80\x9cA body\r\nmay be pretty sure of that, when _you\xe2\x80\x99re_ glad to see \xe2\x80\x99em; something to\r\nbe made off of \xe2\x80\x99em. What\xe2\x80\x99s the blow now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a friend here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, looking doubtfully at Marks;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpartner, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have. Here, Marks! here\xe2\x80\x99s that ar feller that I was in with in\r\nNatchez.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall be pleased with his acquaintance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks, thrusting out a\r\nlong, thin hand, like a raven\xe2\x80\x99s claw. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Haley, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, gentlemen, seein\xe2\x80\x99 as we\xe2\x80\x99ve met\r\nso happily, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand up to a small matter of a treat in this\r\nhere parlor. So, now, old coon,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the man at the bar, \xe2\x80\x9cget us\r\nhot water, and sugar, and cigars, and plenty of the _real stuff_ and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll have a blow-out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBehold, then, the candles lighted, the fire stimulated to the burning\r\npoint in the grate, and our three worthies seated round a table, well\r\nspread with all the accessories to good fellowship enumerated before.\r\n\r\nHaley began a pathetic recital of his peculiar troubles. Loker shut up\r\nhis mouth, and listened to him with gruff and surly attention. Marks,\r\nwho was anxiously and with much fidgeting compounding a tumbler of\r\npunch to his own peculiar taste, occasionally looked up from his\r\nemployment, and, poking his sharp nose and chin almost into Haley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface, gave the most earnest heed to the whole narrative. The conclusion\r\nof it appeared to amuse him extremely, for he shook his shoulders and\r\nsides in silence, and perked up his thin lips with an air of great\r\ninternal enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, then, ye\xe2\x80\x99r fairly sewed up, an\xe2\x80\x99t ye?\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9che! he! he! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneatly done, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis yer young-un business makes lots of trouble in the trade,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHaley, dolefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we could get a breed of gals that didn\xe2\x80\x99t care, now, for their young\r\nuns,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks; \xe2\x80\x9ctell ye, I think \xe2\x80\x99t would be \xe2\x80\x99bout the greatest\r\nmod\xe2\x80\x99rn improvement I knows on,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Marks patronized his joke by a\r\nquiet introductory sniggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJes so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley; \xe2\x80\x9cI never couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see into it; young uns is heaps\r\nof trouble to \xe2\x80\x99em; one would think, now, they\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to get clar on\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em; but they arn\xe2\x80\x99t. And the more trouble a young un is, and the more\r\ngood for nothing, as a gen\xe2\x80\x99l thing, the tighter they sticks to \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, Mr. Haley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98est pass the hot water. Yes, sir, you\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x99est what I feel and all\xe2\x80\x99us have. Now, I bought a gal once, when I\r\nwas in the trade,\xe2\x80\x94a tight, likely wench she was, too, and quite\r\nconsiderable smart,\xe2\x80\x94and she had a young un that was mis\xe2\x80\x99able sickly; it\r\nhad a crooked back, or something or other; and I jest gin \xe2\x80\x99t away to a\r\nman that thought he\xe2\x80\x99d take his chance raising on \xe2\x80\x99t, being it didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncost nothin\xe2\x80\x99;\xe2\x80\x94never thought, yer know, of the gal\xe2\x80\x99s takin\xe2\x80\x99 on about\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x94but, Lord, yer oughter seen how she went on. Why, re\xe2\x80\x99lly, she did\r\nseem to me to valley the child more \xe2\x80\x99cause _\xe2\x80\x9dt was_ sickly and cross,\r\nand plagued her; and she warn\xe2\x80\x99t making b\xe2\x80\x99lieve, neither,\xe2\x80\x94cried about\r\nit, she did, and lopped round, as if she\xe2\x80\x99d lost every friend she had.\r\nIt re\xe2\x80\x99lly was droll to think on \xe2\x80\x99t. Lord, there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no end to women\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, jest so with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley. \xe2\x80\x9cLast summer, down on Red River, I\r\ngot a gal traded off on me, with a likely lookin\xe2\x80\x99 child enough, and his\r\neyes looked as bright as yourn; but, come to look, I found him stone\r\nblind. Fact\xe2\x80\x94he was stone blind. Wal, ye see, I thought there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nharm in my jest passing him along, and not sayin\xe2\x80\x99 nothin\xe2\x80\x99; and I\xe2\x80\x99d got\r\nhim nicely swapped off for a keg o\xe2\x80\x99 whiskey; but come to get him away\r\nfrom the gal, she was jest like a tiger. So \xe2\x80\x99t was before we started,\r\nand I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got my gang chained up; so what should she do but ups on a\r\ncotton-bale, like a cat, ketches a knife from one of the deck hands,\r\nand, I tell ye, she made all fly for a minit, till she saw \xe2\x80\x99t wan\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nuse; and she jest turns round, and pitches head first, young un and\r\nall, into the river,\xe2\x80\x94went down plump, and never ris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Loker, who had listened to these stories with\r\nill-repressed disgust,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshif\xe2\x80\x99less, both on ye! _my_ gals don\xe2\x80\x99t cut up\r\nno such shines, I tell ye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! how do you help it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks, briskly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp it? why, I buys a gal, and if she\xe2\x80\x99s got a young un to be sold, I\r\njest walks up and puts my fist to her face, and says, \xe2\x80\x98Look here, now,\r\nif you give me one word out of your head, I\xe2\x80\x99ll smash yer face in. I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t hear one word\xe2\x80\x94not the beginning of a word.\xe2\x80\x99 I says to \xe2\x80\x99em, \xe2\x80\x98This\r\nyer young un\xe2\x80\x99s mine, and not yourn, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve no kind o\xe2\x80\x99 business with\r\nit.

I say, Tom, I s\xe2\x80\x99pect you make \xe2\x80\x99em _understand_, for all niggers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nheads is woolly.

I b\xe2\x80\x99lieve in\r\nreligion, and one of these days, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve got matters tight and snug,\r\nI calculates to tend to my soul and them ar matters; and so what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nuse of doin\xe2\x80\x99 any more wickedness than \xe2\x80\x99s re\xe2\x80\x99lly necessary?\xe2\x80\x94it don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem to me it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99t all prudent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTend to yer soul!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Tom, contemptuously; \xe2\x80\x9ctake a bright\r\nlookout to find a soul in you,\xe2\x80\x94save yourself any care on that score. If\r\nthe devil sifts you through a hair sieve, he won\xe2\x80\x99t find one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom, you\xe2\x80\x99re cross,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy can\xe2\x80\x99t ye take it pleasant,\r\nnow, when a feller\xe2\x80\x99s talking for your good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop that ar jaw o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn, there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, gruffly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can stand\r\nmost any talk o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn but your pious talk,\xe2\x80\x94that kills me right up.\r\nAfter all, what\xe2\x80\x99s the odds between me and you? \xe2\x80\x99Tan\xe2\x80\x99t that you care one\r\nbit more, or have a bit more feelin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s clean, sheer, dog meanness,\r\nwanting to cheat the devil and save your own skin; don\xe2\x80\x99t I see through\r\nit? And your \xe2\x80\x98gettin\xe2\x80\x99 religion,\xe2\x80\x99 as you call it, arter all, is too\r\np\xe2\x80\x99isin mean for any crittur;\xe2\x80\x94run up a bill with the devil all your\r\nlife, and then sneak out when pay time comes! Bob!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, gentlemen, I say; this isn\xe2\x80\x99t business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s different ways, you know, of looking at all subjects. Mr.\r\nHaley is a very nice man, no doubt, and has his own conscience; and,\r\nTom, you have your ways, and very good ones, too, Tom; but quarrelling,\r\nyou know, won\xe2\x80\x99t answer no kind of purpose. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to business.

We\xe2\x80\x99ll do a business here on our own account;\xe2\x80\x94we does\r\nthe catchin\xe2\x80\x99; the boy, of course, goes to Mr. Haley,\xe2\x80\x94we takes the gal\r\nto Orleans to speculate on. An\xe2\x80\x99t it beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom, whose great heavy mouth had stood ajar during this communication,\r\nnow suddenly snapped it together, as a big dog closes on a piece of\r\nmeat, and seemed to be digesting the idea at his leisure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks to Haley, stirring his punch as he did so, \xe2\x80\x9cye\r\nsee, we has justices convenient at all p\xe2\x80\x99ints along shore, that does up\r\nany little jobs in our line quite reasonable. Tom, he does the knockin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndown and that ar; and I come in all dressed up\xe2\x80\x94shining boots\xe2\x80\x94everything\r\nfirst chop, when the swearin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99s to be done. You oughter see, now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Marks, in a glow of professional pride, \xe2\x80\x9chow I can tone it off.\r\nOne day, I\xe2\x80\x99m Mr. Twickem, from New Orleans; \xe2\x80\x99nother day, I\xe2\x80\x99m just come\r\nfrom my plantation on Pearl River, where I works seven hundred niggers;\r\nthen, again, I come out a distant relation of Henry Clay, or some old\r\ncock in Kentuck. Talents is different, you know. Now, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s roarer when\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s any thumping or fighting to be done; but at lying he an\xe2\x80\x99t good,\r\nTom an\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x94ye see it don\xe2\x80\x99t come natural to him; but, Lord, if thar\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfeller in the country that can swear to anything and everything, and\r\nput in all the circumstances and flourishes with a long face, and carry\r\n\xe2\x80\x99t through better \xe2\x80\x99n I can, why, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see him, that\xe2\x80\x99s all! I\r\nb\xe2\x80\x99lieve my heart, I could get along and snake through, even if justices\r\nwere more particular than they is. Sometimes I rather wish they was\r\nmore particular; \xe2\x80\x99t would be a heap more relishin\xe2\x80\x99 if they was,\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nfun, yer know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom Loker, who, as we have made it appear, was a man of slow thoughts\r\nand movements, here interrupted Marks by bringing his heavy fist down\r\non the table, so as to make all ring again, _\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll do!\xe2\x80\x9d_ he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless ye, Tom, ye needn\xe2\x80\x99t break all the glasses!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csave your fist for time o\xe2\x80\x99 need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, gentlemen, an\xe2\x80\x99t I to come in for a share of the profits?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHaley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99t it enough we catch the boy for ye?\xe2\x80\x9d said Loker. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do ye\r\nwant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, \xe2\x80\x9cif I gives you the job, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth something,\xe2\x80\x94say\r\nten per cent. on the profits, expenses paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Loker, with a tremendous oath, and striking the table with\r\nhis heavy fist, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t I know _you_, Dan Haley?

Suppose you want to lie by a day or two, till\r\nthe gal \xe2\x80\x99s been carried on the underground line up to Sandusky or so,\r\nbefore you start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, no; I an\xe2\x80\x99t a grain afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks, \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, about the boat. Yer see there an\xe2\x80\x99t any boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard the woman say there was one coming along this evening, and\r\nthat a man was going to cross over in it. Neck or nothing, we must go\r\nwith him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI s\xe2\x80\x99pose you\xe2\x80\x99ve got good dogs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s the use? you han\xe2\x80\x99t got nothin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhers to smell on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s her shawl she left on\r\nthe bed in her hurry; she left her bonnet, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ar\xe2\x80\x99s lucky,\xe2\x80\x9d said Loker; \xe2\x80\x9cfork over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough the dogs might damage the gal, if they come on her unawars,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Haley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ar\xe2\x80\x99s a consideration,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks. \xe2\x80\x9cOur dogs tore a feller half\r\nto pieces, once, down in Mobile, \xe2\x80\x99fore we could get \xe2\x80\x99em off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ye see, for this sort that\xe2\x80\x99s to be sold for their looks, that ar\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t answer, ye see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, if she\xe2\x80\x99s got took in, \xe2\x80\x99tan\xe2\x80\x99t no go,\r\nneither. Dogs is no \xe2\x80\x99count in these yer up states where these critters\r\ngets carried; of course, ye can\xe2\x80\x99t get on their track. They only does\r\ndown in plantations, where niggers, when they runs, has to do their own\r\nrunning, and don\xe2\x80\x99t get no help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Loker, who had just stepped out to the bar to make some\r\ninquiries, \xe2\x80\x9cthey say the man\xe2\x80\x99s come with the boat; so, Marks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat worthy cast a rueful look at the comfortable quarters he was\r\nleaving, but slowly rose to obey. After exchanging a few words of\r\nfurther arrangement, Haley, with visible reluctance, handed over the\r\nfifty dollars to Tom, and the worthy trio separated for the night.\r\n\r\nIf any of our refined and Christian readers object to the society into\r\nwhich this scene introduces them, let us beg them to begin and conquer\r\ntheir prejudices in time. The catching business, we beg to remind them,\r\nis rising to the dignity of a lawful and patriotic profession. If all\r\nthe broad land between the Mississippi and the Pacific becomes one\r\ngreat market for bodies and souls, and human property retains the\r\nlocomotive tendencies of this nineteenth century, the trader and\r\ncatcher may yet be among our aristocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this scene was going on at the tavern, Sam and Andy, in a state\r\nof high felicitation, pursued their way home.\r\n\r\nSam was in the highest possible feather, and expressed his exultation\r\nby all sorts of supernatural howls and ejaculations, by divers odd\r\nmotions and contortions of his whole system. Sometimes he would sit\r\nbackward, with his face to the horse\xe2\x80\x99s tail and sides, and then, with a\r\nwhoop and a somerset, come right side up in his place again, and,\r\ndrawing on a grave face, begin to lecture Andy in high-sounding tones\r\nfor laughing and playing the fool. Anon, slapping his sides with his\r\narms, he would burst forth in peals of laughter, that made the old\r\nwoods ring as they passed. With all these evolutions, he contrived to\r\nkeep the horses up to the top of their speed, until, between ten and\r\neleven, their heels resounded on the gravel at the end of the balcony.\r\nMrs. Shelby flew to the railings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Sam? Where are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r Haley \xe2\x80\x99s a-restin\xe2\x80\x99 at the tavern; he\xe2\x80\x99s drefful fatigued,\r\nMissis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Eliza, Sam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, she\xe2\x80\x99s clar \xe2\x80\x99cross Jordan. As a body may say, in the land o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCanaan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Sam, what _do_ you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, breathless, and\r\nalmost faint, as the possible meaning of these words came over her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, Missis, de Lord he persarves his own. Lizy\xe2\x80\x99s done gone over the\r\nriver into \xe2\x80\x99Hio, as \xe2\x80\x99markably as if de Lord took her over in a charrit\r\nof fire and two hosses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s vein of piety was always uncommonly fervent in his mistress\xe2\x80\x99\r\npresence; and he made great capital of scriptural figures and images.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome up here, Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, who had followed on to the\r\nverandah, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell your mistress what she wants. Come, come, Emily,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, passing his arm round her, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are cold and all in a shiver;\r\nyou allow yourself to feel too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeel too much! Am not I a woman,\xe2\x80\x94a mother? Are we not both responsible\r\nto God for this poor girl? My God! lay not this sin to our charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sin, Emily? You see yourself that we have only done what we were\r\nobliged to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s an awful feeling of guilt about it, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t reason it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Andy, you nigger, be alive!\xe2\x80\x9d called Sam, under the verandah;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctake these yer hosses to der barn; don\xe2\x80\x99t ye hear Mas\xe2\x80\x99r a callin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nSam soon appeared, palm-leaf in hand, at the parlor door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Sam, tell us distinctly how the matter was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Eliza, if you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, I saw her, with my own eyes, a crossin\xe2\x80\x99 on the floatin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nice. She crossed most \xe2\x80\x99markably; it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t no less nor a miracle; and I\r\nsaw a man help her up the \xe2\x80\x99Hio side, and then she was lost in the\r\ndusk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSam, I think this rather apocryphal,\xe2\x80\x94this miracle. Crossing on\r\nfloating ice isn\xe2\x80\x99t so easily done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasy! couldn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody a done it, without de Lord. Why, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98t was jist dis yer way. Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Haley, and me, and Andy, we comes up to\r\nde little tavern by the river, and I rides a leetle ahead,\xe2\x80\x94(I\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nzealous to be a cotchin\xe2\x80\x99 Lizy, that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold in, no way),\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhen I comes by the tavern winder, sure enough there she was, right in\r\nplain sight, and dey diggin\xe2\x80\x99 on behind. Wal, I loses off my hat, and\r\nsings out nuff to raise the dead. Course Lizy she hars, and she dodges\r\nback, when Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Haley he goes past the door; and then, I tell ye, she\r\nclared out de side door; she went down de river bank;\xe2\x80\x94Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Haley he\r\nseed her, and yelled out, and him, and me, and Andy, we took arter.\r\nDown she come to the river, and thar was the current running ten feet\r\nwide by the shore, and over t\xe2\x80\x99 other side ice a sawin\xe2\x80\x99 and a jiggling\r\nup and down, kinder as \xe2\x80\x99t were a great island. We come right behind\r\nher, and I thought my soul he\xe2\x80\x99d got her sure enough,\xe2\x80\x94when she gin sich\r\na screech as I never hearn, and thar she was, clar over t\xe2\x80\x99 other side\r\nof the current, on the ice, and then on she went, a screeching and a\r\njumpin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x94the ice went crack! c\xe2\x80\x99wallop! cracking! chunk! and she a\r\nboundin\xe2\x80\x99 like a buck! Lord, the spring that ar gal\xe2\x80\x99s got in her an\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncommon, I\xe2\x80\x99m o\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99pinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby sat perfectly silent, pale with excitement, while Sam told\r\nhis story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be praised, she isn\xe2\x80\x99t dead!\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut where is the poor\r\nchild now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe Lord will pervide,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, rolling up his eyes piously. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen a sayin\xe2\x80\x99, dis yer \xe2\x80\x99s a providence and no mistake, as Missis has\r\nallers been a instructin\xe2\x80\x99 on us. Thar\xe2\x80\x99s allers instruments ris up to do\r\nde Lord\xe2\x80\x99s will. Now, if \xe2\x80\x99t hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for me today, she\xe2\x80\x99d a been took\r\na dozen times. Warn\xe2\x80\x99t it I started off de hosses, dis yer mornin\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nkept \xe2\x80\x99em chasin\xe2\x80\x99 till nigh dinner time? And didn\xe2\x80\x99t I car Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Haley\r\nnight five miles out of de road, dis evening, or else he\xe2\x80\x99d a come up\r\nwith Lizy as easy as a dog arter a coon. These yer \xe2\x80\x99s all providences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are a kind of providences that you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be pretty sparing\r\nof, Master Sam. I allow no such practices with gentlemen on my place,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Shelby, with as much sternness as he could command, under the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nNow, there is no more use in making believe be angry with a negro than\r\nwith a child; both instinctively see the true state of the case,\r\nthrough all attempts to affect the contrary; and Sam was in no wise\r\ndisheartened by this rebuke, though he assumed an air of doleful\r\ngravity, and stood with the corners of his mouth lowered in most\r\npenitential style.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r quite right,\xe2\x80\x94quite; it was ugly on me,\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no disputin\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\nar; and of course Mas\xe2\x80\x99r and Missis wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t encourage no such works.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sensible of dat ar; but a poor nigger like me \xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99mazin\xe2\x80\x99 tempted to\r\nact ugly sometimes, when fellers will cut up such shines as dat ar\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r Haley; he an\xe2\x80\x99t no gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99man no way; anybody\xe2\x80\x99s been raised as I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen can\xe2\x80\x99t help a seein\xe2\x80\x99 dat ar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, \xe2\x80\x9cas you appear to have a proper sense of\r\nyour errors, you may go now and tell Aunt Chloe she may get you some of\r\nthat cold ham that was left of dinner today. You and Andy must be\r\nhungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissis is a heap too good for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, making his bow with\r\nalacrity, and departing.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived, as has been before intimated, that Master Sam had\r\na native talent that might, undoubtedly, have raised him to eminence in\r\npolitical life,\xe2\x80\x94a talent of making capital out of everything that\r\nturned up, to be invested for his own especial praise and glory; and\r\nhaving done up his piety and humility, as he trusted, to the\r\nsatisfaction of the parlor, he clapped his palm-leaf on his head, with\r\na sort of rakish, free-and-easy air, and proceeded to the dominions of\r\nAunt Chloe, with the intention of flourishing largely in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll speechify these yer niggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\na chance. Lord, I\xe2\x80\x99ll reel it off to make \xe2\x80\x99em stare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that one of Sam\xe2\x80\x99s especial delights had been to\r\nride in attendance on his master to all kinds of political gatherings,\r\nwhere, roosted on some rail fence, or perched aloft in some tree, he\r\nwould sit watching the orators, with the greatest apparent gusto, and\r\nthen, descending among the various brethren of his own color, assembled\r\non the same errand, he would edify and delight them with the most\r\nludicrous burlesques and imitations, all delivered with the most\r\nimperturbable earnestness and solemnity; and though the auditors\r\nimmediately about him were generally of his own color, it not\r\ninfrequently happened that they were fringed pretty deeply with those\r\nof a fairer complexion, who listened, laughing and winking, to Sam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat self-congratulation. In fact, Sam considered oratory as his\r\nvocation, and never let slip an opportunity of magnifying his office.\r\n\r\nNow, between Sam and Aunt Chloe there had existed, from ancient times,\r\na sort of chronic feud, or rather a decided coolness; but, as Sam was\r\nmeditating something in the provision department, as the necessary and\r\nobvious foundation of his operations, he determined, on the present\r\noccasion, to be eminently conciliatory; for he well knew that although\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissis\xe2\x80\x99 orders\xe2\x80\x9d would undoubtedly be followed to the letter, yet he\r\nshould gain a considerable deal by enlisting the spirit also. He\r\ntherefore appeared before Aunt Chloe with a touchingly subdued,\r\nresigned expression, like one who has suffered immeasurable hardships\r\nin behalf of a persecuted fellow-creature,\xe2\x80\x94enlarged upon the fact that\r\nMissis had directed him to come to Aunt Chloe for whatever might be\r\nwanting to make up the balance in his solids and fluids,\xe2\x80\x94and thus\r\nunequivocally acknowledged her right and supremacy in the cooking\r\ndepartment, and all thereto pertaining.\r\n\r\nThe thing took accordingly. No poor, simple, virtuous body was ever\r\ncajoled by the attentions of an electioneering politician with more\r\nease than Aunt Chloe was won over by Master Sam\xe2\x80\x99s suavities; and if he\r\nhad been the prodigal son himself, he could not have been overwhelmed\r\nwith more maternal bountifulness; and he soon found himself seated,\r\nhappy and glorious, over a large tin pan, containing a sort of _olla\r\npodrida_ of all that had appeared on the table for two or three days\r\npast. Savory morsels of ham, golden blocks of corn-cake, fragments of\r\npie of every conceivable mathematical figure, chicken wings, gizzards,\r\nand drumsticks, all appeared in picturesque confusion; and Sam, as\r\nmonarch of all he surveyed, sat with his palm-leaf cocked rejoicingly\r\nto one side, and patronizing Andy at his right hand.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was full of all his compeers, who had hurried and crowded\r\nin, from the various cabins, to hear the termination of the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexploits. Now was Sam\xe2\x80\x99s hour of glory. The story of the day was\r\nrehearsed, with all kinds of ornament and varnishing which might be\r\nnecessary to heighten its effect; for Sam, like some of our fashionable\r\ndilettanti, never allowed a story to lose any of its gilding by passing\r\nthrough his hands. Roars of laughter attended the narration, and were\r\ntaken up and prolonged by all the smaller fry, who were lying, in any\r\nquantity, about on the floor, or perched in every corner. In the height\r\nof the uproar and laughter, Sam, however, preserved an immovable\r\ngravity, only from time to time rolling his eyes up, and giving his\r\nauditors divers inexpressibly droll glances, without departing from the\r\nsententious elevation of his oratory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYer see, fellow-countrymen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, elevating a turkey\xe2\x80\x99s leg, with\r\nenergy, \xe2\x80\x9cyer see, now what dis yer chile \xe2\x80\x99s up ter, for fendin\xe2\x80\x99 yer\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x94yes, all on yer. For him as tries to get one o\xe2\x80\x99 our people is as\r\ngood as tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to get all; yer see the principle \xe2\x80\x99s de same,\xe2\x80\x94dat ar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclar. And any one o\xe2\x80\x99 these yer drivers that comes smelling round arter\r\nany our people, why, he\xe2\x80\x99s got _me_ in his way; _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ the feller he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot to set in with,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m the feller for yer all to come to,\r\nbredren,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand up for yer rights,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll fend \xe2\x80\x99em to the last\r\nbreath!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, but Sam, yer telled me, only this mornin\xe2\x80\x99, that you\xe2\x80\x99d help this\r\nyer Mas\xe2\x80\x99r to cotch Lizy; seems to me yer talk don\xe2\x80\x99t hang together,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Andy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you now, Andy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, with awful superiority, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t yer be\r\na talkin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99bout what yer don\xe2\x80\x99t know nothin\xe2\x80\x99 on; boys like you, Andy,\r\nmeans well, but they can\xe2\x80\x99t be spected to collusitate the great\r\nprinciples of action.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndy looked rebuked, particularly by the hard word collusitate, which\r\nmost of the youngerly members of the company seemed to consider as a\r\nsettler in the case, while Sam proceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat ar was _conscience_, Andy; when I thought of gwine arter Lizy, I\r\nrailly spected Mas\xe2\x80\x99r was sot dat way. When I found Missis was sot the\r\ncontrar, dat ar was conscience _more yet_,\xe2\x80\x94cause fellers allers gets\r\nmore by stickin\xe2\x80\x99 to Missis\xe2\x80\x99 side,\xe2\x80\x94so yer see I \xe2\x80\x99s persistent either\r\nway, and sticks up to conscience, and holds on to principles. Yes,\r\n_principles_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, giving an enthusiastic toss to a chicken\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneck,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s principles good for, if we isn\xe2\x80\x99t persistent, I wanter\r\nknow? Thar, Andy, you may have dat ar bone,\xe2\x80\x94tan\xe2\x80\x99t picked quite clean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s audience hanging on his words with open mouth, he could not but\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDis yer matter \xe2\x80\x99bout persistence, feller-niggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, with the\r\nair of one entering into an abstruse subject, \xe2\x80\x9cdis yer \xe2\x80\x99sistency \xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nthing what an\xe2\x80\x99t seed into very clar, by most anybody. Now, yer see,\r\nwhen a feller stands up for a thing one day and night, de contrar de\r\nnext, folks ses (and nat\xe2\x80\x99rally enough dey ses), why he an\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npersistent,\xe2\x80\x94hand me dat ar bit o\xe2\x80\x99 corn-cake, Andy. But let\xe2\x80\x99s look inter\r\nit. I hope the gen\xe2\x80\x99lmen and der fair sex will scuse my usin\xe2\x80\x99 an or\xe2\x80\x99nary\r\nsort o\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99parison. Here!

Mrs. Bird,\r\nlooking the very picture of delight, was superintending the\r\narrangements of the table, ever and anon mingling admonitory remarks to\r\na number of frolicsome juveniles, who were effervescing in all those\r\nmodes of untold gambol and mischief that have astonished mothers ever\r\nsince the flood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, let the door-knob alone,\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a man! Mary! Mary! don\xe2\x80\x99t pull\r\nthe cat\xe2\x80\x99s tail,\xe2\x80\x94poor pussy! Jim, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t climb on that table,\xe2\x80\x94no,\r\nno!\xe2\x80\x94You don\xe2\x80\x99t know, my dear, what a surprise it is to us all, to see\r\nyou here tonight!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, at last, when she found a space to say\r\nsomething to her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d just make a run down, spend the night, and\r\nhave a little comfort at home. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired to death, and my head aches!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bird cast a glance at a camphor-bottle, which stood in the\r\nhalf-open closet, and appeared to meditate an approach to it, but her\r\nhusband interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Mary, no doctoring! a cup of your good hot tea, and some of\r\nour good home living, is what I want. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tiresome business, this\r\nlegislating!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the senator smiled, as if he rather liked the idea of considering\r\nhimself a sacrifice to his country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, after the business of the tea-table was getting\r\nrather slack, \xe2\x80\x9cand what have they been doing in the Senate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, it was a very unusual thing for gentle little Mrs. Bird ever to\r\ntrouble her head with what was going on in the house of the state, very\r\nwisely considering that she had enough to do to mind her own. Mr. Bird,\r\ntherefore, opened his eyes in surprise, and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very much of importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; but is it true that they have been passing a law forbidding\r\npeople to give meat and drink to those poor colored folks that come\r\nalong? I heard they were talking of some such law, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nany Christian legislature would pass it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mary, you are getting to be a politician, all at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nonsense! I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give a fig for all your politics, generally,\r\nbut I think this is something downright cruel and unchristian. I hope,\r\nmy dear, no such law has been passed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has been a law passed forbidding people to help off the slaves\r\nthat come over from Kentucky, my dear; so much of that thing has been\r\ndone by these reckless Abolitionists, that our brethren in Kentucky are\r\nvery strongly excited, and it seems necessary, and no more than\r\nChristian and kind, that something should be done by our state to quiet\r\nthe excitement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is the law? It don\xe2\x80\x99t forbid us to shelter those poor\r\ncreatures a night, does it, and to give \xe2\x80\x99em something comfortable to\r\neat, and a few old clothes, and send them quietly about their\r\nbusiness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, my dear; that would be aiding and abetting, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bird was a timid, blushing little woman, of about four feet in\r\nheight, and with mild blue eyes, and a peach-blow complexion, and the\r\ngentlest, sweetest voice in the world;\xe2\x80\x94as for courage, a moderate-sized\r\ncock-turkey had been known to put her to rout at the very first gobble,\r\nand a stout house-dog, of moderate capacity, would bring her into\r\nsubjection merely by a show of his teeth. Her husband and children were\r\nher entire world, and in these she ruled more by entreaty and\r\npersuasion than by command or argument. There was only one thing that\r\nwas capable of arousing her, and that provocation came in on the side\r\nof her unusually gentle and sympathetic nature;\xe2\x80\x94anything in the shape\r\nof cruelty would throw her into a passion, which was the more alarming\r\nand inexplicable in proportion to the general softness of her nature.\r\nGenerally the most indulgent and easy to be entreated of all mothers,\r\nstill her boys had a very reverent remembrance of a most vehement\r\nchastisement she once bestowed on them, because she found them leagued\r\nwith several graceless boys of the neighborhood, stoning a defenceless\r\nkitten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what,\xe2\x80\x9d Master Bill used to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI was scared that time.\r\nMother came at me so that I thought she was crazy, and I was whipped\r\nand tumbled off to bed, without any supper, before I could get over\r\nwondering what had come about; and, after that, I heard mother crying\r\noutside the door, which made me feel worse than all the rest. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou what,\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x9cwe boys never stoned another kitten!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, Mrs. Bird rose quickly, with very red cheeks,\r\nwhich quite improved her general appearance, and walked up to her\r\nhusband, with quite a resolute air, and said, in a determined tone,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, John, I want to know if you think such a law as that is right and\r\nChristian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t shoot me, now, Mary, if I say I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never could have thought it of you, John; you didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so, my fair politician.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be ashamed, John! Poor, homeless, houseless creatures!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a shameful, wicked, abominable law, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll break it, for one,\r\nthe first time I get a chance; and I hope I _shall_ have a chance, I\r\ndo! Things have got to a pretty pass, if a woman can\xe2\x80\x99t give a warm\r\nsupper and a bed to poor, starving creatures, just because they are\r\nslaves, and have been abused and oppressed all their lives, poor\r\nthings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mary, just listen to me. Your feelings are all quite right, dear,\r\nand interesting, and I love you for them; but, then, dear, we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuffer our feelings to run away with our judgment; you must consider\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of private feeling,\xe2\x80\x94there are great public interests\r\ninvolved,\xe2\x80\x94there is such a state of public agitation rising, that we\r\nmust put aside our private feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, John, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about politics, but I can read my\r\nBible; and there I see that I must feed the hungry, clothe the naked,\r\nand comfort the desolate; and that Bible I mean to follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in cases where your doing so would involve a great public evil\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObeying God never brings on public evils. I know it can\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nsafest, all round, to _do as He_ bids us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, listen to me, Mary, and I can state to you a very clear argument,\r\nto show\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, nonsense, John! you can talk all night, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it. I\r\nput it to you, John,\xe2\x80\x94would _you_ now turn away a poor, shivering,\r\nhungry creature from your door, because he was a runaway? _Would_ you,\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, if the truth must be told, our senator had the misfortune to be a\r\nman who had a particularly humane and accessible nature, and turning\r\naway anybody that was in trouble never had been his forte; and what was\r\nworse for him in this particular pinch of the argument was, that his\r\nwife knew it, and, of course was making an assault on rather an\r\nindefensible point. So he had recourse to the usual means of gaining\r\ntime for such cases made and provided; he said \xe2\x80\x9cahem,\xe2\x80\x9d and coughed\r\nseveral times, took out his pocket-handkerchief, and began to wipe his\r\nglasses. Mrs. Bird, seeing the defenceless condition of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nterritory, had no more conscience than to push her advantage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see you doing that, John\xe2\x80\x94I really should! Turning a\r\nwoman out of doors in a snowstorm, for instance; or may be you\xe2\x80\x99d take\r\nher up and put her in jail, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you? You would make a great hand\r\nat that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, it would be a very painful duty,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mr. Bird, in a\r\nmoderate tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuty, John! don\xe2\x80\x99t use that word! You know it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a duty\xe2\x80\x94it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\na duty! If folks want to keep their slaves from running away, let \xe2\x80\x99em\r\ntreat \xe2\x80\x99em well,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s my doctrine. If I had slaves (as I hope I never\r\nshall have), I\xe2\x80\x99d risk their wanting to run away from me, or you either,\r\nJohn. I tell you folks don\xe2\x80\x99t run away when they are happy; and when\r\nthey do run, poor creatures! they suffer enough with cold and hunger\r\nand fear, without everybody\xe2\x80\x99s turning against them; and, law or no law,\r\nI never will, so help me God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary! Mary! My dear, let me reason with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate reasoning, John,\xe2\x80\x94especially reasoning on such subjects. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na way you political folks have of coming round and round a plain right\r\nthing; and you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in it yourselves, when it comes to\r\npractice. I know _you_ well enough, John. You don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s right\r\nany more than I do; and you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it any sooner than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this critical juncture, old Cudjoe, the black man-of-all-work, put\r\nhis head in at the door, and wished \xe2\x80\x9cMissis would come into the\r\nkitchen;\xe2\x80\x9d and our senator, tolerably relieved, looked after his little\r\nwife with a whimsical mixture of amusement and vexation, and, seating\r\nhimself in the arm-chair, began to read the papers.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, his wife\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard at the door, in a quick,\r\nearnest tone,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cJohn! John! I do wish you\xe2\x80\x99d come here, a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laid down his paper, and went into the kitchen, and started, quite\r\namazed at the sight that presented itself:\xe2\x80\x94A young and slender woman,\r\nwith garments torn and frozen, with one shoe gone, and the stocking\r\ntorn away from the cut and bleeding foot, was laid back in a deadly\r\nswoon upon two chairs. There was the impress of the despised race on\r\nher face, yet none could help feeling its mournful and pathetic beauty,\r\nwhile its stony sharpness, its cold, fixed, deathly aspect, struck a\r\nsolemn chill over him. He drew his breath short, and stood in silence.\r\nHis wife, and their only colored domestic, old Aunt Dinah, were busily\r\nengaged in restorative measures; while old Cudjoe had got the boy on\r\nhis knee, and was busy pulling off his shoes and stockings, and chafing\r\nhis little cold feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, now, if she an\xe2\x80\x99t a sight to behold!\xe2\x80\x9d said old Dinah,\r\ncompassionately; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98pears like \xe2\x80\x99t was the heat that made her faint. She\r\nwas tol\xe2\x80\x99able peart when she cum in, and asked if she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t warm\r\nherself here a spell; and I was just a-askin\xe2\x80\x99 her where she cum from,\r\nand she fainted right down. Never done much hard work, guess, by the\r\nlooks of her hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor creature!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bird, compassionately, as the woman slowly\r\nunclosed her large, dark eyes, and looked vacantly at her. Suddenly an\r\nexpression of agony crossed her face, and she sprang up, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cO, my\r\nHarry! Have they got him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy, at this, jumped from Cudjoe\xe2\x80\x99s knee, and running to her side\r\nput up his arms. \xe2\x80\x9cO, he\xe2\x80\x99s here! he\xe2\x80\x99s here!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, wildly, to Mrs. Bird, \xe2\x80\x9cdo protect us! don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nthem get him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody shall hurt you here, poor woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bird,\r\nencouragingly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are safe; don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, covering her face and sobbing; while\r\nthe little boy, seeing her crying, tried to get into her lap.\r\n\r\nWith many gentle and womanly offices, which none knew better how to\r\nrender than Mrs. Bird, the poor woman was, in time, rendered more calm.\r\nA temporary bed was provided for her on the settle, near the fire; and,\r\nafter a short time, she fell into a heavy slumber, with the child, who\r\nseemed no less weary, soundly sleeping on her arm; for the mother\r\nresisted, with nervous anxiety, the kindest attempts to take him from\r\nher; and, even in sleep, her arm encircled him with an unrelaxing\r\nclasp, as if she could not even then be beguiled of her vigilant hold.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bird had gone back to the parlor, where, strange as it may\r\nappear, no reference was made, on either side, to the preceding\r\nconversation; but Mrs. Bird busied herself with her knitting-work, and\r\nMr. Bird pretended to be reading the paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder who and what she is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bird, at last, as he laid it\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she wakes up and feels a little rested, we will see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nBird.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, wife!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bird after musing in silence over his\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wear one of your gowns, could she, by any letting down,\r\nor such matter? She seems to be rather larger than you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA quite perceptible smile glimmered on Mrs. Bird\xe2\x80\x99s face, as she\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother pause, and Mr. Bird again broke out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! What now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s that old bombazin cloak, that you keep on purpose to put\r\nover me when I take my afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s nap; you might as well give her\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x94she needs clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this instant, Dinah looked in to say that the woman was awake, and\r\nwanted to see Missis.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bird went into the kitchen, followed by the two eldest\r\nboys, the smaller fry having, by this time, been safely disposed of in\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nThe woman was now sitting up on the settle, by the fire. She was\r\nlooking steadily into the blaze, with a calm, heart-broken expression,\r\nvery different from her former agitated wildness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you want me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bird, in gentle tones. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you feel\r\nbetter now, poor woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA long-drawn, shivering sigh was the only answer; but she lifted her\r\ndark eyes, and fixed them on her with such a forlorn and imploring\r\nexpression, that the tears came into the little woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of anything; we are friends here, poor woman!\r\nTell me where you came from, and what you want,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came from Kentucky,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bird, taking up the interogatory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI crossed on the ice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrossed on the ice!\xe2\x80\x9d said every one present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI did. God helping me, I crossed on the\r\nice; for they were behind me\xe2\x80\x94right behind\xe2\x80\x94and there was no other way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw, Missis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cudjoe, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ice is all in broken-up blocks, a\r\nswinging and a tetering up and down in the water!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it was\xe2\x80\x94I know it!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, wildly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I did it! I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave thought I could,\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I should get over, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare! I could but die, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. The Lord helped me; nobody knows\r\nhow much the Lord can help \xe2\x80\x99em, till they try,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, with a\r\nflashing eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you a slave?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bird.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; I belonged to a man in Kentucky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he unkind to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; he was a good master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was your mistress unkind to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir\xe2\x80\x94no! my mistress was always good to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could induce you to leave a good home, then, and run away, and go\r\nthrough such dangers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman looked up at Mrs. Bird, with a keen, scrutinizing glance, and\r\nit did not escape her that she was dressed in deep mourning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9chave you ever lost a child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question was unexpected, and it was thrust on a new wound; for it\r\nwas only a month since a darling child of the family had been laid in\r\nthe grave.\r\n\r\nMr. Bird turned around and walked to the window, and Mrs. Bird burst\r\ninto tears; but, recovering her voice, she said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you ask that? I have lost a little one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you will feel for me. I have lost two, one after another,\xe2\x80\x94left\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em buried there when I came away; and I had only this one left. I\r\nnever slept a night without him; he was all I had. He was my comfort\r\nand pride, day and night; and, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, they were going to take him away\r\nfrom me,\xe2\x80\x94to _sell_ him,\xe2\x80\x94sell him down south, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, to go all alone,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nbaby that had never been away from his mother in his life! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. I knew I never should be good for anything, if they\r\ndid; and when I knew the papers the papers were signed, and he was\r\nsold, I took him and came off in the night; and they chased me,\xe2\x80\x94the man\r\nthat bought him, and some of Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s folks,\xe2\x80\x94and they were coming down\r\nright behind me, and I heard \xe2\x80\x99em. I jumped right on to the ice; and how\r\nI got across, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x94but, first I knew, a man was helping me up\r\nthe bank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman did not sob nor weep. She had gone to a place where tears are\r\ndry; but every one around her was, in some way characteristic of\r\nthemselves, showing signs of hearty sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe two little boys, after a desperate rummaging in their pockets, in\r\nsearch of those pocket-handkerchiefs which mothers know are never to be\r\nfound there, had thrown themselves disconsolately into the skirts of\r\ntheir mother\xe2\x80\x99s gown, where they were sobbing, and wiping their eyes and\r\nnoses, to their hearts\xe2\x80\x99 content;\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Bird had her face fairly hidden\r\nin her pocket-handkerchief; and old Dinah, with tears streaming down\r\nher black, honest face, was ejaculating, \xe2\x80\x9cLord have mercy on us!\xe2\x80\x9d with\r\nall the fervor of a camp-meeting;\xe2\x80\x94while old Cudjoe, rubbing his eyes\r\nvery hard with his cuffs, and making a most uncommon variety of wry\r\nfaces, occasionally responded in the same key, with great fervor. Our\r\nsenator was a statesman, and of course could not be expected to cry,\r\nlike other mortals; and so he turned his back to the company, and\r\nlooked out of the window, and seemed particularly busy in clearing his\r\nthroat and wiping his spectacle-glasses, occasionally blowing his nose\r\nin a manner that was calculated to excite suspicion, had any one been\r\nin a state to observe critically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came you to tell me you had a kind master?\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly exclaimed,\r\ngulping down very resolutely some kind of rising in his throat, and\r\nturning suddenly round upon the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he _was_ a kind master; I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that of him, any way;\xe2\x80\x94and my\r\nmistress was kind; but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help themselves. They were owing\r\nmoney; and there was some way, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell how, that a man had a hold\r\non them, and they were obliged to give him his will. I listened, and\r\nheard him telling mistress that, and she begging and pleading for\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x94and he told her he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help himself, and that the papers were\r\nall drawn;\xe2\x80\x94and then it was I took him and left my home, and came away.\r\nI knew \xe2\x80\x99t was no use of my trying to live, if they did it; for \xe2\x80\x99t\r\n\xe2\x80\x99pears like this child is all I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but he belongs to another man. His master is real hard to him,\r\nand won\xe2\x80\x99t let him come to see me, hardly ever; and he\xe2\x80\x99s grown harder\r\nand harder upon us, and he threatens to sell him down south;\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s like\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll never see _him_ again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe quiet tone in which the woman pronounced these words might have led\r\na superficial observer to think that she was entirely apathetic; but\r\nthere was a calm, settled depth of anguish in her large, dark eye, that\r\nspoke of something far otherwise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where do you mean to go, my poor woman?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bird.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Canada, if I only knew where that was. Is it very far off, is\r\nCanada?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, looking up, with a simple, confiding air, to Mrs.\r\nBird\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bird, involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs \xe2\x80\x99t a very great way off, think?\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch further than you think, poor child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bird; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we will\r\ntry to think what can be done for you. Here, Dinah, make her up a bed\r\nin your own room, close by the kitchen, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll think what to do for\r\nher in the morning. Meanwhile, never fear, poor woman; put your trust\r\nin God; he will protect you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bird and her husband reentered the parlor. She sat down in her\r\nlittle rocking-chair before the fire, swaying thoughtfully to and fro.\r\nMr. Bird strode up and down the room, grumbling to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cPish!\r\npshaw! confounded awkward business!\xe2\x80\x9d At length, striding up to his\r\nwife, he said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, wife, she\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get away from here, this very night. That\r\nfellow will be down on the scent bright and early tomorrow morning: if\r\n\xe2\x80\x99t was only the woman, she could lie quiet till it was over; but that\r\nlittle chap can\xe2\x80\x99t be kept still by a troop of horse and foot, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwarrant me; he\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it all out, popping his head out of some window\r\nor door. A pretty kettle of fish it would be for me, too, to be caught\r\nwith them both here, just now! No; they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be got off tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTonight! How is it possible?\xe2\x80\x94where to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I know pretty well where to,\xe2\x80\x9d said the senator, beginning to put\r\non his boots, with a reflective air; and, stopping when his leg was\r\nhalf in, he embraced his knee with both hands, and seemed to go off in\r\ndeep meditation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a confounded awkward, ugly business,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, at last, beginning\r\nto tug at his boot-straps again, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact!\xe2\x80\x9d After one boot\r\nwas fairly on, the senator sat with the other in his hand, profoundly\r\nstudying the figure of the carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will have to be done, though,\r\nfor aught I see,\xe2\x80\x94hang it all!\xe2\x80\x9d and he drew the other boot anxiously on,\r\nand looked out of the window.\r\n\r\nNow, little Mrs. Bird was a discreet woman,\xe2\x80\x94a woman who never in her\r\nlife said, \xe2\x80\x9cI told you so!\xe2\x80\x9d and, on the present occasion, though pretty\r\nwell aware of the shape her husband\xe2\x80\x99s meditations were taking, she very\r\nprudently forbore to meddle with them, only sat very quietly in her\r\nchair, and looked quite ready to hear her liege lord\xe2\x80\x99s intentions, when\r\nhe should think proper to utter them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s my old client, Van Trompe, has come over\r\nfrom Kentucky, and set all his slaves free; and he has bought a place\r\nseven miles up the creek, here, back in the woods, where nobody goes,\r\nunless they go on purpose; and it\xe2\x80\x99s a place that isn\xe2\x80\x99t found in a\r\nhurry. There she\xe2\x80\x99d be safe enough; but the plague of the thing is,\r\nnobody could drive a carriage there tonight, but _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? Cudjoe is an excellent driver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, but here it is. The creek has to be crossed twice; and the\r\nsecond crossing is quite dangerous, unless one knows it as I do. I have\r\ncrossed it a hundred times on horseback, and know exactly the turns to\r\ntake. And so, you see, there\xe2\x80\x99s no help for it. Cudjoe must put in the\r\nhorses, as quietly as may be, about twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take her\r\nover; and then, to give color to the matter, he must carry me on to the\r\nnext tavern to take the stage for Columbus, that comes by about three\r\nor four, and so it will look as if I had had the carriage only for\r\nthat. I shall get into business bright and early in the morning. But\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking I shall feel rather cheap there, after all that\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nsaid and done; but, hang it, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour heart is better than your head, in this case, John,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nwife, laying her little white hand on his. \xe2\x80\x9cCould I ever have loved\r\nyou, had I not known you better than you know yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d And the little\r\nwoman looked so handsome, with the tears sparkling in her eyes, that\r\nthe senator thought he must be a decidedly clever fellow, to get such a\r\npretty creature into such a passionate admiration of him; and so, what\r\ncould he do but walk off soberly, to see about the carriage. At the\r\ndoor, however, he stopped a moment, and then coming back, he said, with\r\nsome hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you\xe2\x80\x99d feel about it, but there\xe2\x80\x99s that drawer\r\nfull of things\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94poor little Henry\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he turned quickly\r\non his heel, and shut the door after him.\r\n\r\nHis wife opened the little bed-room door adjoining her room and, taking\r\nthe candle, set it down on the top of a bureau there; then from a small\r\nrecess she took a key, and put it thoughtfully in the lock of a drawer,\r\nand made a sudden pause, while two boys, who, boy like, had followed\r\nclose on her heels, stood looking, with silent, significant glances, at\r\ntheir mother. And oh! mother that reads this, has there never been in\r\nyour house a drawer, or a closet, the opening of which has been to you\r\nlike the opening again of a little grave? Ah! happy mother that you\r\nare, if it has not been so.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bird slowly opened the drawer. There were little coats of many a\r\nform and pattern, piles of aprons, and rows of small stockings; and\r\neven a pair of little shoes, worn and rubbed at the toes, were peeping\r\nfrom the folds of a paper. There was a toy horse and wagon, a top, a\r\nball,\xe2\x80\x94memorials gathered with many a tear and many a heart-break! She\r\nsat down by the drawer, and, leaning her head on her hands over it,\r\nwept till the tears fell through her fingers into the drawer; then\r\nsuddenly raising her head, she began, with nervous haste, selecting the\r\nplainest and most substantial articles, and gathering them into a\r\nbundle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the boys, gently touching her arm, \xe2\x80\x9cyou going to\r\ngive away _those_ things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boys,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, softly and earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cif our dear, loving\r\nlittle Henry looks down from heaven, he would be glad to have us do\r\nthis. I could not find it in my heart to give them away to any common\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x94to anybody that was happy; but I give them to a mother more\r\nheart-broken and sorrowful than I am; and I hope God will send his\r\nblessings with them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere are in this world blessed souls, whose sorrows all spring up into\r\njoys for others; whose earthly hopes, laid in the grave with many\r\ntears, are the seed from which spring healing flowers and balm for the\r\ndesolate and the distressed. Among such was the delicate woman who sits\r\nthere by the lamp, dropping slow tears, while she prepares the\r\nmemorials of her own lost one for the outcast wanderer.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, Mrs. Bird opened a wardrobe, and, taking from thence a\r\nplain, serviceable dress or two, she sat down busily to her work-table,\r\nand, with needle, scissors, and thimble, at hand, quietly commenced the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cletting down\xe2\x80\x9d process which her husband had recommended, and continued\r\nbusily at it till the old clock in the corner struck twelve, and she\r\nheard the low rattling of wheels at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband, coming in, with his overcoat in his hand,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou must wake her up now; we must be off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bird hastily deposited the various articles she had collected in a\r\nsmall plain trunk, and locking it, desired her husband to see it in the\r\ncarriage, and then proceeded to call the woman. Soon, arrayed in a\r\ncloak, bonnet, and shawl, that had belonged to her benefactress, she\r\nappeared at the door with her child in her arms. Mr. Bird hurried her\r\ninto the carriage, and Mrs. Bird pressed on after her to the carriage\r\nsteps. Eliza leaned out of the carriage, and put out her hand,\xe2\x80\x94a hand\r\nas soft and beautiful as was given in return. She fixed her large, dark\r\neyes, full of earnest meaning, on Mrs. Bird\xe2\x80\x99s face, and seemed going to\r\nspeak. Her lips moved,\xe2\x80\x94she tried once or twice, but there was no\r\nsound,\xe2\x80\x94and pointing upward, with a look never to be forgotten, she fell\r\nback in the seat, and covered her face. The door was shut, and the\r\ncarriage drove on.\r\n\r\nWhat a situation, now, for a patriotic senator, that had been all the\r\nweek before spurring up the legislature of his native state to pass\r\nmore stringent resolutions against escaping fugitives, their harborers\r\nand abettors!\r\n\r\nOur good senator in his native state had not been exceeded by any of\r\nhis brethren at Washington, in the sort of eloquence which has won for\r\nthem immortal renown! How sublimely he had sat with his hands in his\r\npockets, and scouted all sentimental weakness of those who would put\r\nthe welfare of a few miserable fugitives before great state interests!\r\n\r\nHe was as bold as a lion about it, and \xe2\x80\x9cmightily convinced\xe2\x80\x9d not only\r\nhimself, but everybody that heard him;\xe2\x80\x94but then his idea of a fugitive\r\nwas only an idea of the letters that spell the word,\xe2\x80\x94or at the most,\r\nthe image of a little newspaper picture of a man with a stick and\r\nbundle with \xe2\x80\x9cRan away from the subscriber\xe2\x80\x9d under it. The magic of the\r\nreal presence of distress,\xe2\x80\x94the imploring human eye, the frail,\r\ntrembling human hand, the despairing appeal of helpless agony,\xe2\x80\x94these he\r\nhad never tried. He had never thought that a fugitive might be a\r\nhapless mother, a defenceless child,\xe2\x80\x94like that one which was now\r\nwearing his lost boy\xe2\x80\x99s little well-known cap; and so, as our poor\r\nsenator was not stone or steel,\xe2\x80\x94as he was a man, and a downright\r\nnoble-hearted one, too,\xe2\x80\x94he was, as everybody must see, in a sad case\r\nfor his patriotism. And you need not exult over him, good brother of\r\nthe Southern States; for we have some inklings that many of you, under\r\nsimilar circumstances, would not do much better. We have reason to\r\nknow, in Kentucky, as in Mississippi, are noble and generous hearts, to\r\nwhom never was tale of suffering told in vain. Ah, good brother! is it\r\nfair for you to expect of us services which your own brave, honorable\r\nheart would not allow you to render, were you in our place?\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, if our good senator was a political sinner, he was\r\nin a fair way to expiate it by his night\xe2\x80\x99s penance. There had been a\r\nlong continuous period of rainy weather, and the soft, rich earth of\r\nOhio, as every one knows, is admirably suited to the manufacture of\r\nmud\xe2\x80\x94and the road was an Ohio railroad of the good old times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray, what sort of a road may that be?\xe2\x80\x9d says some eastern\r\ntraveller, who has been accustomed to connect no ideas with a railroad,\r\nbut those of smoothness or speed.\r\n\r\nKnow, then, innocent eastern friend, that in benighted regions of the\r\nwest, where the mud is of unfathomable and sublime depth, roads are\r\nmade of round rough logs, arranged transversely side by side, and\r\ncoated over in their pristine freshness with earth, turf, and\r\nwhatsoever may come to hand, and then the rejoicing native calleth it a\r\nroad, and straightway essayeth to ride thereupon. In process of time,\r\nthe rains wash off all the turf and grass aforesaid, move the logs\r\nhither and thither, in picturesque positions, up, down and crosswise,\r\nwith divers chasms and ruts of black mud intervening.\r\n\r\nOver such a road as this our senator went stumbling along, making moral\r\nreflections as continuously as under the circumstances could be\r\nexpected,\xe2\x80\x94the carriage proceeding along much as follows,\xe2\x80\x94bump! bump!\r\nbump! slush! down in the mud!\xe2\x80\x94the senator, woman and child, reversing\r\ntheir positions so suddenly as to come, without any very accurate\r\nadjustment, against the windows of the down-hill side. Carriage sticks\r\nfast, while Cudjoe on the outside is heard making a great muster among\r\nthe horses. After various ineffectual pullings and twitchings, just as\r\nthe senator is losing all patience, the carriage suddenly rights itself\r\nwith a bounce,\xe2\x80\x94two front wheels go down into another abyss, and\r\nsenator, woman, and child, all tumble promiscuously on to the front\r\nseat,\xe2\x80\x94senator\xe2\x80\x99s hat is jammed over his eyes and nose quite\r\nunceremoniously, and he considers himself fairly extinguished;\xe2\x80\x94child\r\ncries, and Cudjoe on the outside delivers animated addresses to the\r\nhorses, who are kicking, and floundering, and straining under repeated\r\ncracks of the whip. Carriage springs up, with another bounce,\xe2\x80\x94down go\r\nthe hind wheels,\xe2\x80\x94senator, woman, and child, fly over on to the back\r\nseat, his elbows encountering her bonnet, and both her feet being\r\njammed into his hat, which flies off in the concussion. After a few\r\nmoments the \xe2\x80\x9cslough\xe2\x80\x9d is passed, and the horses stop, panting;\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsenator finds his hat, the woman straightens her bonnet and hushes her\r\nchild, and they brace themselves for what is yet to come.\r\n\r\nFor a while only the continuous bump! bump! intermingled, just by way\r\nof variety, with divers side plunges and compound shakes; and they\r\nbegin to flatter themselves that they are not so badly off, after all.\r\nAt last, with a square plunge, which puts all on to their feet and then\r\ndown into their seats with incredible quickness, the carriage\r\nstops,\xe2\x80\x94and, after much outside commotion, Cudjoe appears at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s powerful bad spot, this\xe2\x80\x99 yer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how we\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto get clar out. I\xe2\x80\x99m a thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be a gettin\xe2\x80\x99 rails.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe senator despairingly steps out, picking gingerly for some firm\r\nfoothold; down goes one foot an immeasurable depth,\xe2\x80\x94he tries to pull it\r\nup, loses his balance, and tumbles over into the mud, and is fished\r\nout, in a very despairing condition, by Cudjoe.\r\n\r\nBut we forbear, out of sympathy to our readers\xe2\x80\x99 bones. Western\r\ntravellers, who have beguiled the midnight hour in the interesting\r\nprocess of pulling down rail fences, to pry their carriages out of mud\r\nholes, will have a respectful and mournful sympathy with our\r\nunfortunate hero. We beg them to drop a silent tear, and pass on.\r\n\r\nIt was full late in the night when the carriage emerged, dripping and\r\nbespattered, out of the creek, and stood at the door of a large\r\nfarmhouse.\r\n\r\nIt took no inconsiderable perseverance to arouse the inmates; but at\r\nlast the respectable proprietor appeared, and undid the door. He was a\r\ngreat, tall, bristling Orson of a fellow, full six feet and some inches\r\nin his stockings, and arrayed in a red flannel hunting-shirt. A very\r\nheavy mat of sandy hair, in a decidedly tousled condition, and a beard\r\nof some days\xe2\x80\x99 growth, gave the worthy man an appearance, to say the\r\nleast, not particularly prepossessing. He stood for a few minutes\r\nholding the candle aloft, and blinking on our travellers with a dismal\r\nand mystified expression that was truly ludicrous. It cost some effort\r\nof our senator to induce him to comprehend the case fully; and while he\r\nis doing his best at that, we shall give him a little introduction to\r\nour readers.\r\n\r\nHonest old John Van Trompe was once quite a considerable land-owner and\r\nslave-owner in the State of Kentucky. Having \xe2\x80\x9cnothing of the bear about\r\nhim but the skin,\xe2\x80\x9d and being gifted by nature with a great, honest,\r\njust heart, quite equal to his gigantic frame, he had been for some\r\nyears witnessing with repressed uneasiness the workings of a system\r\nequally bad for oppressor and oppressed. At last, one day, John\xe2\x80\x99s great\r\nheart had swelled altogether too big to wear his bonds any longer; so\r\nhe just took his pocket-book out of his desk, and went over into Ohio,\r\nand bought a quarter of a township of good, rich land, made out free\r\npapers for all his people,\xe2\x80\x94men, women, and children,\xe2\x80\x94packed them up in\r\nwagons, and sent them off to settle down; and then honest John turned\r\nhis face up the creek, and sat quietly down on a snug, retired farm, to\r\nenjoy his conscience and his reflections.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you the man that will shelter a poor woman and child from\r\nslave-catchers?\xe2\x80\x9d said the senator, explicitly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rather think I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said honest John, with some considerable\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the senator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody comes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good man, stretching his tall,\r\nmuscular form upward, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy here I\xe2\x80\x99m ready for him: and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got seven\r\nsons, each six foot high, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready for \xe2\x80\x99em. Give our\r\nrespects to \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said John; \xe2\x80\x9ctell \xe2\x80\x99em it\xe2\x80\x99s no matter how soon they\r\ncall,\xe2\x80\x94make no kinder difference to us,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, running his fingers\r\nthrough the shock of hair that thatched his head, and bursting out into\r\na great laugh.\r\n\r\nWeary, jaded, and spiritless, Eliza dragged herself up to the door,\r\nwith her child lying in a heavy sleep on her arm. The rough man held\r\nthe candle to her face, and uttering a kind of compassionate grunt,\r\nopened the door of a small bed-room adjoining to the large kitchen\r\nwhere they were standing, and motioned her to go in. He took down a\r\ncandle, and lighting it, set it upon the table, and then addressed\r\nhimself to Eliza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I say, gal, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be a bit afeard, let who will come here.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m up to all that sort o\xe2\x80\x99 thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, pointing to two or three\r\ngoodly rifles over the mantel-piece; \xe2\x80\x9cand most people that know me know\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x99t wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be healthy to try to get anybody out o\xe2\x80\x99 my house when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m agin it. So _now_ you jist go to sleep now, as quiet as if yer\r\nmother was a rockin\xe2\x80\x99 ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as he shut the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this is an uncommon handsome un,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the senator. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\r\nwell; handsome uns has the greatest cause to run, sometimes, if they\r\nhas any kind o\xe2\x80\x99 feelin, such as decent women should. I know all about\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe senator, in a few words, briefly explained Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s history.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! ou! aw! now, I want to know?\xe2\x80\x9d said the good man, pitifully; \xe2\x80\x9csho!\r\nnow sho! That\xe2\x80\x99s natur now, poor crittur! hunted down now like a\r\ndeer,\xe2\x80\x94hunted down, jest for havin\xe2\x80\x99 natural feelin\xe2\x80\x99s, and doin\xe2\x80\x99 what no\r\nkind o\xe2\x80\x99 mother could help a doin\xe2\x80\x99! I tell ye what, these yer things\r\nmake me come the nighest to swearin\xe2\x80\x99, now, o\xe2\x80\x99 most anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhonest John, as he wiped his eyes with the back of a great, freckled,\r\nyellow hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell yer what, stranger, it was years and years before\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d jine the church, \xe2\x80\x99cause the ministers round in our parts used to\r\npreach that the Bible went in for these ere cuttings up,\xe2\x80\x94and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe up to \xe2\x80\x99em with their Greek and Hebrew, and so I took up agin \xe2\x80\x99em,\r\nBible and all. I never jined the church till I found a minister that\r\nwas up to \xe2\x80\x99em all in Greek and all that, and he said right the\r\ncontrary; and then I took right hold, and jined the church,\xe2\x80\x94I did now,\r\nfact,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, who had been all this time uncorking some very frisky\r\nbottled cider, which at this juncture he presented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99d better jest put up here, now, till daylight,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, heartily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll call up the old woman, and have a bed got ready for you in no\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my good friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the senator, \xe2\x80\x9cI must be along, to\r\ntake the night stage for Columbus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! well, then, if you must, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go a piece with you, and show you a\r\ncross road that will take you there better than the road you came on.\r\nThat road\xe2\x80\x99s mighty bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn equipped himself, and, with a lantern in hand, was soon seen\r\nguiding the senator\xe2\x80\x99s carriage towards a road that ran down in a\r\nhollow, back of his dwelling. When they parted, the senator put into\r\nhis hand a ten-dollar bill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, briefly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, with equal conciseness.\r\n\r\nThey shook hands, and parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nThe Property Is Carried Off\r\n\r\n\r\nThe February morning looked gray and drizzling through the window of\r\nUncle Tom\xe2\x80\x99s cabin. It looked on downcast faces, the images of mournful\r\nhearts. The little table stood out before the fire, covered with an\r\nironing-cloth; a coarse but clean shirt or two, fresh from the iron,\r\nhung on the back of a chair by the fire, and Aunt Chloe had another\r\nspread out before her on the table. Carefully she rubbed and ironed\r\nevery fold and every hem, with the most scrupulous exactness, every now\r\nand then raising her hand to her face to wipe off the tears that were\r\ncoursing down her cheeks.\r\n\r\nTom sat by, with his Testament open on his knee, and his head leaning\r\nupon his hand;\xe2\x80\x94but neither spoke. It was yet early, and the children\r\nlay all asleep together in their little rude trundle-bed.\r\n\r\nTom, who had, to the full, the gentle, domestic heart, which woe for\r\nthem! has been a peculiar characteristic of his unhappy race, got up\r\nand walked silently to look at his children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the last time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nAunt Chloe did not answer, only rubbed away over and over on the coarse\r\nshirt, already as smooth as hands could make it; and finally setting\r\nher iron suddenly down with a despairing plunge, she sat down to the\r\ntable, and \xe2\x80\x9clifted up her voice and wept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99pose we must be resigned; but oh Lord! how ken I? If I know\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nanything whar you \xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99, or how they\xe2\x80\x99d sarve you! Missis says she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntry and \xe2\x80\x99deem ye, in a year or two; but Lor! nobody never comes up that\r\ngoes down thar! They kills \xe2\x80\x99em! I\xe2\x80\x99ve hearn \xe2\x80\x99em tell how dey works \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nup on dem ar plantations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99ll be the same God there, Chloe, that there is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, \xe2\x80\x9cs\xe2\x80\x99pose dere will; but de Lord lets drefful\r\nthings happen, sometimes. I don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get no comfort dat way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s hands,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cnothin\xe2\x80\x99 can go no furder than he\r\nlets it;\xe2\x80\x94and thar\xe2\x80\x99s _one_ thing I can thank him for. It\xe2\x80\x99s _me_ that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsold and going down, and not you nur the chil\xe2\x80\x99en. Here you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsafe;\xe2\x80\x94what comes will come only on me; and the Lord, he\xe2\x80\x99ll help me,\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nknow he will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh, brave, manly heart,\xe2\x80\x94smothering thine own sorrow, to comfort thy\r\nbeloved ones! Tom spoke with a thick utterance, and with a bitter\r\nchoking in his throat,\xe2\x80\x94but he spoke brave and strong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s think on our marcies!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, tremulously, as if he was quite\r\nsure he needed to think on them very hard indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarcies!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t see no marcy in \xe2\x80\x99t! \xe2\x80\x99tan\xe2\x80\x99t right!\r\ntan\xe2\x80\x99t right it should be so! Mas\xe2\x80\x99r never ought ter left it so that ye\r\n_could_ be took for his debts. Ye\xe2\x80\x99ve arnt him all he gets for ye, twice\r\nover. He owed ye yer freedom, and ought ter gin \xe2\x80\x99t to yer years ago.\r\nMebbe he can\xe2\x80\x99t help himself now, but I feel it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. Nothing can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeat that ar out o\xe2\x80\x99 me. Sich a faithful crittur as ye\xe2\x80\x99ve been,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nallers sot his business \xe2\x80\x99fore yer own every way,\xe2\x80\x94and reckoned on him\r\nmore than yer own wife and chil\xe2\x80\x99en! Them as sells heart\xe2\x80\x99s love and\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s blood, to get out thar scrapes, de Lord\xe2\x80\x99ll be up to \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChloe! now, if ye love me, ye won\xe2\x80\x99t talk so, when perhaps jest the\r\nlast time we\xe2\x80\x99ll ever have together! And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell ye, Chloe, it goes\r\nagin me to hear one word agin Mas\xe2\x80\x99r. Wan\xe2\x80\x99t he put in my arms a\r\nbaby?\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s natur I should think a heap of him. And he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nspected to think so much of poor Tom. Mas\xe2\x80\x99rs is used to havin\xe2\x80\x99 all\r\nthese yer things done for \xe2\x80\x99em, and nat\xe2\x80\x99lly they don\xe2\x80\x99t think so much on\r\n\xe2\x80\x99t. They can\xe2\x80\x99t be spected to, no way. Set him \xe2\x80\x99longside of other\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99rs\xe2\x80\x94who\xe2\x80\x99s had the treatment and livin\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve had? And he never would\r\nhave let this yer come on me, if he could have seed it aforehand. I\r\nknow he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, any way, thar\xe2\x80\x99s wrong about it _somewhar_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, in\r\nwhom a stubborn sense of justice was a predominant trait; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t jest\r\nmake out whar \xe2\x80\x99t is, but thar\xe2\x80\x99s wrong somewhar, I\xe2\x80\x99m _clar_ o\xe2\x80\x99 that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYer ought ter look up to the Lord above\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s above all\xe2\x80\x94thar don\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nsparrow fall without him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to comfort me, but I spect it orter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut dar\xe2\x80\x99s no use talkin\xe2\x80\x99; I\xe2\x80\x99ll jes wet up de corn-cake, and get ye one\r\ngood breakfast, \xe2\x80\x99cause nobody knows when you\xe2\x80\x99ll get another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate the sufferings of the negroes sold south, it\r\nmust be remembered that all the instinctive affections of that race are\r\npeculiarly strong. Their local attachments are very abiding. They are\r\nnot naturally daring and enterprising, but home-loving and\r\naffectionate. Add to this all the terrors with which ignorance invests\r\nthe unknown, and add to this, again, that selling to the south is set\r\nbefore the negro from childhood as the last severity of punishment. The\r\nthreat that terrifies more than whipping or torture of any kind is the\r\nthreat of being sent down river. We have ourselves heard this feeling\r\nexpressed by them, and seen the unaffected horror with which they will\r\nsit in their gossipping hours, and tell frightful stories of that \xe2\x80\x9cdown\r\nriver,\xe2\x80\x9d which to them is\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat undiscovered country, from whose bourn\r\nNo traveller returns.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] A slightly inaccurate quotation from _Hamlet_, Act III, scene I,\r\n lines 369-370.\r\n\r\n\r\nA missionary figure among the fugitives in Canada told us that many of\r\nthe fugitives confessed themselves to have escaped from comparatively\r\nkind masters, and that they were induced to brave the perils of escape,\r\nin almost every case, by the desperate horror with which they regarded\r\nbeing sold south,\xe2\x80\x94a doom which was hanging either over themselves or\r\ntheir husbands, their wives or children. This nerves the African,\r\nnaturally patient, timid and unenterprising, with heroic courage, and\r\nleads him to suffer hunger, cold, pain, the perils of the wilderness,\r\nand the more dread penalties of recapture.\r\n\r\nThe simple morning meal now smoked on the table, for Mrs. Shelby had\r\nexcused Aunt Chloe\xe2\x80\x99s attendance at the great house that morning. The\r\npoor soul had expended all her little energies on this farewell\r\nfeast,\xe2\x80\x94had killed and dressed her choicest chicken, and prepared her\r\ncorn-cake with scrupulous exactness, just to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s taste, and\r\nbrought out certain mysterious jars on the mantel-piece, some preserves\r\nthat were never produced except on extreme occasions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, Pete,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mose, triumphantly, \xe2\x80\x9chan\xe2\x80\x99t we got a buster of a\r\nbreakfast!\xe2\x80\x9d at the same time catching at a fragment of the chicken.\r\n\r\nAunt Chloe gave him a sudden box on the ear. \xe2\x80\x9cThar now! crowing over\r\nthe last breakfast yer poor daddy\xe2\x80\x99s gwine to have to home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Chloe!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, hiding her face in her apron;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI \xe2\x80\x99s so tossed about it, it makes me act ugly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys stood quite still, looking first at their father and then at\r\ntheir mother, while the baby, climbing up her clothes, began an\r\nimperious, commanding cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThar!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, wiping her eyes and taking up the baby; \xe2\x80\x9cnow\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99s done, I hope,\xe2\x80\x94now do eat something. This yer\xe2\x80\x99s my nicest chicken.\r\nThar, boys, ye shall have some, poor critturs! Yer mammy\xe2\x80\x99s been cross\r\nto yer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys needed no second invitation, and went in with great zeal for\r\nthe eatables; and it was well they did so, as otherwise there would\r\nhave been very little performed to any purpose by the party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, bustling about after breakfast, \xe2\x80\x9cI must put up\r\nyer clothes. Jest like as not, he\xe2\x80\x99ll take \xe2\x80\x99em all away. I know thar\r\nways\xe2\x80\x94mean as dirt, they is! Wal, now, yer flannels for rhumatis is in\r\nthis corner; so be careful, \xe2\x80\x99cause there won\xe2\x80\x99t nobody make ye no more.\r\nThen here\xe2\x80\x99s yer old shirts, and these yer is new ones. I toed off these\r\nyer stockings last night, and put de ball in \xe2\x80\x99em to mend with. But Lor!\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99ll ever mend for ye?\xe2\x80\x9d and Aunt Chloe, again overcome, laid her head\r\non the box side, and sobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cTo think on \xe2\x80\x99t! no crittur to do for ye,\r\nsick or well! I don\xe2\x80\x99t railly think I ought ter be good now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys, having eaten everything there was on the breakfast-table,\r\nbegan now to take some thought of the case; and, seeing their mother\r\ncrying, and their father looking very sad, began to whimper and put\r\ntheir hands to their eyes. Uncle Tom had the baby on his knee, and was\r\nletting her enjoy herself to the utmost extent, scratching his face and\r\npulling his hair, and occasionally breaking out into clamorous\r\nexplosions of delight, evidently arising out of her own internal\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, crow away, poor crittur!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe; \xe2\x80\x9cye\xe2\x80\x99ll have to come to\r\nit, too! ye\xe2\x80\x99ll live to see yer husband sold, or mebbe be sold yerself;\r\nand these yer boys, they\xe2\x80\x99s to be sold, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose, too, jest like as not,\r\nwhen dey gets good for somethin\xe2\x80\x99; an\xe2\x80\x99t no use in niggers havin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere one of the boys called out, \xe2\x80\x9cThar\xe2\x80\x99s Missis a-comin\xe2\x80\x99 in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t do no good; what\xe2\x80\x99s she coming for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby entered. Aunt Chloe set a chair for her in a manner\r\ndecidedly gruff and crusty. She did not seem to notice either the\r\naction or the manner. She looked pale and anxious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI come to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and stopping suddenly, and regarding the\r\nsilent group, she sat down in the chair, and, covering her face with\r\nher handkerchief, began to sob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, now, Missis, don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, bursting out in her\r\nturn; and for a few moments they all wept in company. And in those\r\ntears they all shed together, the high and the lowly, melted away all\r\nthe heart-burnings and anger of the oppressed. O, ye who visit the\r\ndistressed, do ye know that everything your money can buy, given with a\r\ncold, averted face, is not worth one honest tear shed in real sympathy?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t give you anything to do\r\nyou any good. If I give you money, it will only be taken from you. But\r\nI tell you solemnly, and before God, that I will keep trace of you, and\r\nbring you back as soon as I can command the money;\xe2\x80\x94and, till then,\r\ntrust in God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the boys called out that Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Haley was coming, and then an\r\nunceremonious kick pushed open the door. Haley stood there in very ill\r\nhumor, having ridden hard the night before, and being not at all\r\npacified by his ill success in recapturing his prey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cye nigger, ye\xe2\x80\x99r ready? Servant, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\ntaking off his hat, as he saw Mrs. Shelby.\r\n\r\nAunt Chloe shut and corded the box, and, getting up, looked gruffly on\r\nthe trader, her tears seeming suddenly turned to sparks of fire.\r\n\r\nTom rose up meekly, to follow his new master, and raised up his heavy\r\nbox on his shoulder. His wife took the baby in her arms to go with him\r\nto the wagon, and the children, still crying, trailed on behind.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby, walking up to the trader, detained him for a few moments,\r\ntalking with him in an earnest manner; and while she was thus talking,\r\nthe whole family party proceeded to a wagon, that stood ready harnessed\r\nat the door. A crowd of all the old and young hands on the place stood\r\ngathered around it, to bid farewell to their old associate. Tom had\r\nbeen looked up to, both as a head servant and a Christian teacher, by\r\nall the place, and there was much honest sympathy and grief about him,\r\nparticularly among the women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Chloe, you bar it better \xe2\x80\x99n we do!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the women, who\r\nhad been weeping freely, noticing the gloomy calmness with which Aunt\r\nChloe stood by the wagon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99s done _my_ tears!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking grimly at the trader, who was\r\ncoming up. \xe2\x80\x9cI does not feel to cry \xe2\x80\x99fore dat ar old limb, no how!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet in!\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley to Tom, as he strode through the crowd of\r\nservants, who looked at him with lowering brows.\r\n\r\nTom got in, and Haley, drawing out from under the wagon seat a heavy\r\npair of shackles, made them fast around each ankle.\r\n\r\nA smothered groan of indignation ran through the whole circle, and Mrs.\r\nShelby spoke from the verandah,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Haley, I assure you that\r\nprecaution is entirely unnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99 know, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost one five hundred dollars from this yer\r\nplace, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to run no more risks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else could she spect on him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, indignantly, while\r\nthe two boys, who now seemed to comprehend at once their father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndestiny, clung to her gown, sobbing and groaning vehemently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George happened to be away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge had gone to spend two or three days with a companion on a\r\nneighboring estate, and having departed early in the morning, before\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s misfortune had been made public, had left without hearing of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive my love to Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, earnestly.\r\n\r\nHaley whipped up the horse, and, with a steady, mournful look, fixed to\r\nthe last on the old place, Tom was whirled away.\r\n\r\nMr. Shelby at this time was not at home. He had sold Tom under the spur\r\nof a driving necessity, to get out of the power of a man whom he\r\ndreaded,\xe2\x80\x94and his first feeling, after the consummation of the bargain,\r\nhad been that of relief. But his wife\xe2\x80\x99s expostulations awoke his\r\nhalf-slumbering regrets; and Tom\xe2\x80\x99s manly disinterestedness increased\r\nthe unpleasantness of his feelings. It was in vain that he said to\r\nhimself that he had a _right_ to do it,\xe2\x80\x94that everybody did it,\xe2\x80\x94and that\r\nsome did it without even the excuse of necessity;\xe2\x80\x94he could not satisfy\r\nhis own feelings; and that he might not witness the unpleasant scenes\r\nof the consummation, he had gone on a short business tour up the\r\ncountry, hoping that all would be over before he returned.\r\n\r\nTom and Haley rattled on along the dusty road, whirling past every old\r\nfamiliar spot, until the bounds of the estate were fairly passed, and\r\nthey found themselves out on the open pike. After they had ridden about\r\na mile, Haley suddenly drew up at the door of a blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s shop,\r\nwhen, taking out with him a pair of handcuffs, he stepped into the\r\nshop, to have a little alteration in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese yer \xe2\x80\x99s a little too small for his build,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, showing\r\nthe fetters, and pointing out to Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor! now, if thar an\xe2\x80\x99t Shelby\xe2\x80\x99s Tom. He han\xe2\x80\x99t sold him, now?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nsmith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he has,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, ye don\xe2\x80\x99t! well, reely,\xe2\x80\x9d said the smith, \xe2\x80\x9cwho\xe2\x80\x99d a thought it! Why,\r\nye needn\xe2\x80\x99t go to fetterin\xe2\x80\x99 him up this yer way. He\xe2\x80\x99s the faithfullest,\r\nbest crittur\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley; \xe2\x80\x9cbut your good fellers are just the critturs to\r\nwant ter run off. Them stupid ones, as doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care whar they go, and\r\nshifless, drunken ones, as don\xe2\x80\x99t care for nothin\xe2\x80\x99, they\xe2\x80\x99ll stick by,\r\nand like as not be rather pleased to be toted round; but these yer\r\nprime fellers, they hates it like sin. No way but to fetter \xe2\x80\x99em; got\r\nlegs,\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ll use \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x94no mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the smith, feeling among his tools, \xe2\x80\x9cthem plantations down\r\nthar, stranger, an\xe2\x80\x99t jest the place a Kentuck nigger wants to go to;\r\nthey dies thar tol\xe2\x80\x99able fast, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, yes, tol\xe2\x80\x99able fast, ther dying is; what with the \xe2\x80\x99climating and\r\none thing and another, they dies so as to keep the market up pretty\r\nbrisk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, now, a feller can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s a mighty pity to have a\r\nnice, quiet, likely feller, as good un as Tom is, go down to be fairly\r\nground up on one of them ar sugar plantations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a fa\xe2\x80\x99r chance. I promised to do well by him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nhim in house-servant in some good old family, and then, if he stands\r\nthe fever and \xe2\x80\x99climating, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a berth good as any nigger ought\r\nter ask for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe leaves his wife and chil\xe2\x80\x99en up here, s\xe2\x80\x99pose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but he\xe2\x80\x99ll get another thar. Lord, thar\xe2\x80\x99s women enough everywhar,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Haley.\r\n\r\nTom was sitting very mournfully on the outside of the shop while this\r\nconversation was going on. Suddenly he heard the quick, short click of\r\na horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoof behind him; and, before he could fairly awake from his\r\nsurprise, young Master George sprang into the wagon, threw his arms\r\ntumultuously round his neck, and was sobbing and scolding with energy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare, it\xe2\x80\x99s real mean! I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what they say, any of \xe2\x80\x99em!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a nasty, mean shame! If I was a man, they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nshould not, _so_!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, with a kind of subdued howl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George! this does me good!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bar to go\r\noff without seein\xe2\x80\x99 ye! It does me real good, ye can\xe2\x80\x99t tell!\xe2\x80\x9d Here Tom\r\nmade some movement of his feet, and George\xe2\x80\x99s eye fell on the fetters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a shame!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, lifting his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll knock that old\r\nfellow down\xe2\x80\x94I will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo you won\xe2\x80\x99t, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George; and you must not talk so loud. It won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp me any, to anger him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I won\xe2\x80\x99t, then, for your sake; but only to think of it\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a\r\nshame? They never sent for me, nor sent me any word, and, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen for Tom Lincon, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have heard it. I tell you, I blew \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nup well, all of \xe2\x80\x99em, at home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ar wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right, I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99feard, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t help it! I say it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame! Look here, Uncle Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nturning his back to the shop, and speaking in a mysterious tone, _\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbrought you my dollar!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO!

I tell ye, Tom, I\r\nwant to blow him up! it would do me good!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George, for it won\xe2\x80\x99t do _me_ any good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I won\xe2\x80\x99t, for your sake,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, busily tying his dollar\r\nround Tom\xe2\x80\x99s neck; \xe2\x80\x9cbut there, now, button your coat tight over it, and\r\nkeep it, and remember, every time you see it, that I\xe2\x80\x99ll come down after\r\nyou, and bring you back. Aunt Chloe and I have been talking about it. I\r\ntold her not to fear; I\xe2\x80\x99ll see to it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tease father\xe2\x80\x99s life out,\r\nif he don\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO!

Be a good Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, like yer\r\nfather; and be a Christian, like yer mother. \xe2\x80\x99Member yer Creator in the\r\ndays o\xe2\x80\x99 yer youth, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be _real_ good, Uncle Tom, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto be a _first-rater_; and don\xe2\x80\x99t you be discouraged. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you back\r\nto the place, yet. As I told Aunt Chloe this morning, I\xe2\x80\x99ll build our\r\nhouse all over, and you shall have a room for a parlor with a carpet on\r\nit, when I\xe2\x80\x99m a man. O, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have good times yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaley now came to the door, with the handcuffs in his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, now, Mister,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, with an air of great\r\nsuperiority, as he got out, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall let father and mother know how you\r\ntreat Uncle Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think you\xe2\x80\x99d be ashamed to spend all your life buying men and\r\nwomen, and chaining them, like cattle! I should think you\xe2\x80\x99d feel mean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as your grand folks wants to buy men and women, I\xe2\x80\x99m as good as\r\nthey is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98tan\xe2\x80\x99t any meaner sellin\xe2\x80\x99 on \xe2\x80\x99em, that \xe2\x80\x99t is\r\nbuyin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never do either, when I\xe2\x80\x99m a man,\xe2\x80\x9d said George; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed, this\r\nday, that I\xe2\x80\x99m a Kentuckian. I always was proud of it before;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nGeorge sat very straight on his horse, and looked round with an air, as\r\nif he expected the state would be impressed with his opinion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-by, Uncle Tom; keep a stiff upper lip,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, looking fondly and admiringly at\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cGod Almighty bless you! Ah! Kentucky han\xe2\x80\x99t got many like you!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, in the fulness of his heart, as the frank, boyish face was lost\r\nto his view. Away he went, and Tom looked, till the clatter of his\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s heels died away, the last sound or sight of his home. But over\r\nhis heart there seemed to be a warm spot, where those young hands had\r\nplaced that precious dollar. Tom put up his hand, and held it close to\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I tell ye what, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, as he came up to the wagon, and\r\nthrew in the handcuffs, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to start fa\xe2\x80\x99r with ye, as I gen\xe2\x80\x99ally do\r\nwith my niggers; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell ye now, to begin with, you treat me\r\nfa\xe2\x80\x99r, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll treat you fa\xe2\x80\x99r; I an\xe2\x80\x99t never hard on my niggers.\r\nCalculates to do the best for \xe2\x80\x99em I can. Now, ye see, you\xe2\x80\x99d better jest\r\nsettle down comfortable, and not be tryin\xe2\x80\x99 no tricks; because nigger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntricks of all sorts I\xe2\x80\x99m up to, and it\xe2\x80\x99s no use. If niggers is quiet,\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t try to get off, they has good times with me; and if they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, why, it\xe2\x80\x99s thar fault, and not mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom assured Haley that he had no present intentions of running off. In\r\nfact, the exhortation seemed rather a superfluous one to a man with a\r\ngreat pair of iron fetters on his feet. But Mr. Haley had got in the\r\nhabit of commencing his relations with his stock with little\r\nexhortations of this nature, calculated, as he deemed, to inspire\r\ncheerfulness and confidence, and prevent the necessity of any\r\nunpleasant scenes.\r\n\r\nAnd here, for the present, we take our leave of Tom, to pursue the\r\nfortunes of other characters in our story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nIn Which Property Gets into an Improper State of Mind\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late in a drizzly afternoon that a traveler alighted at the door\r\nof a small country hotel, in the village of N\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, in Kentucky. In the\r\nbarroom he found assembled quite a miscellaneous company, whom stress\r\nof weather had driven to harbor, and the place presented the usual\r\nscenery of such reunions. Great, tall, raw-boned Kentuckians, attired\r\nin hunting-shirts, and trailing their loose joints over a vast extent\r\nof territory, with the easy lounge peculiar to the race,\xe2\x80\x94rifles stacked\r\naway in the corner, shot-pouches, game-bags, hunting-dogs, and little\r\nnegroes, all rolled together in the corners,\xe2\x80\x94were the characteristic\r\nfeatures in the picture. At each end of the fireplace sat a long-legged\r\ngentleman, with his chair tipped back, his hat on his head, and the\r\nheels of his muddy boots reposing sublimely on the mantel-piece,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nposition, we will inform our readers, decidedly favorable to the turn\r\nof reflection incident to western taverns, where travellers exhibit a\r\ndecided preference for this particular mode of elevating their\r\nunderstandings.\r\n\r\nMine host, who stood behind the bar, like most of his country men, was\r\ngreat of stature, good-natured and loose-jointed, with an enormous\r\nshock of hair on his head, and a great tall hat on the top of that.\r\n\r\nIn fact, everybody in the room bore on his head this characteristic\r\nemblem of man\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty; whether it were felt hat, palm-leaf,\r\ngreasy beaver, or fine new chapeau, there it reposed with true\r\nrepublican independence. In truth, it appeared to be the characteristic\r\nmark of every individual. Some wore them tipped rakishly to one\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94these were your men of humor, jolly, free-and-easy dogs; some had\r\nthem jammed independently down over their noses\xe2\x80\x94these were your hard\r\ncharacters, thorough men, who, when they wore their hats, _wanted_ to\r\nwear them, and to wear them just as they had a mind to; there were\r\nthose who had them set far over back\xe2\x80\x94wide-awake men, who wanted a clear\r\nprospect; while careless men, who did not know, or care, how their hats\r\nsat, had them shaking about in all directions. The various hats, in\r\nfact, were quite a Shakespearean study.\r\n\r\nDivers negroes, in very free-and-easy pantaloons, and with no\r\nredundancy in the shirt line, were scuttling about, hither and thither,\r\nwithout bringing to pass any very particular results, except expressing\r\na generic willingness to turn over everything in creation generally for\r\nthe benefit of Mas\xe2\x80\x99r and his guests. Add to this picture a jolly,\r\ncrackling, rollicking fire, going rejoicingly up a great wide\r\nchimney,\xe2\x80\x94the outer door and every window being set wide open, and the\r\ncalico window-curtain flopping and snapping in a good stiff breeze of\r\ndamp raw air,\xe2\x80\x94and you have an idea of the jollities of a Kentucky\r\ntavern.\r\n\r\nYour Kentuckian of the present day is a good illustration of the\r\ndoctrine of transmitted instincts and peculiarities. His fathers were\r\nmighty hunters,\xe2\x80\x94men who lived in the woods, and slept under the free,\r\nopen heavens, with the stars to hold their candles; and their\r\ndescendant to this day always acts as if the house were his camp,\xe2\x80\x94wears\r\nhis hat at all hours, tumbles himself about, and puts his heels on the\r\ntops of chairs or mantelpieces, just as his father rolled on the green\r\nsward, and put his upon trees and logs,\xe2\x80\x94keeps all the windows and doors\r\nopen, winter and summer, that he may get air enough for his great\r\nlungs,\xe2\x80\x94calls everybody \xe2\x80\x9cstranger,\xe2\x80\x9d with nonchalant _bonhommie_, and is\r\naltogether the frankest, easiest, most jovial creature living.\r\n\r\nInto such an assembly of the free and easy our traveller entered. He\r\nwas a short, thick-set man, carefully dressed, with a round,\r\ngood-natured countenance, and something rather fussy and particular in\r\nhis appearance. He was very careful of his valise and umbrella,\r\nbringing them in with his own hands, and resisting, pertinaciously, all\r\noffers from the various servants to relieve him of them. He looked\r\nround the barroom with rather an anxious air, and, retreating with his\r\nvaluables to the warmest corner, disposed them under his chair, sat\r\ndown, and looked rather apprehensively up at the worthy whose heels\r\nillustrated the end of the mantel-piece, who was spitting from right to\r\nleft, with a courage and energy rather alarming to gentlemen of weak\r\nnerves and particular habits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, stranger, how are ye?\xe2\x80\x9d said the aforesaid gentleman, firing an\r\nhonorary salute of tobacco-juice in the direction of the new arrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I reckon,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply of the other, as he dodged, with some\r\nalarm, the threatening honor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny news?\xe2\x80\x9d said the respondent, taking out a strip of tobacco and a\r\nlarge hunting-knife from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that I know of,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChaw?\xe2\x80\x9d said the first speaker, handing the old gentleman a bit of his\r\ntobacco, with a decidedly brotherly air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank ye\xe2\x80\x94it don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little man, edging off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, easily, and stowing away the morsel in his\r\nown mouth, in order to keep up the supply of tobacco-juice, for the\r\ngeneral benefit of society.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman uniformly gave a little start whenever his long-sided\r\nbrother fired in his direction; and this being observed by his\r\ncompanion, he very good-naturedly turned his artillery to another\r\nquarter, and proceeded to storm one of the fire-irons with a degree of\r\nmilitary talent fully sufficient to take a city.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, observing some of the company\r\nformed in a group around a large handbill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNigger advertised!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the company, briefly.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson, for that was the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s name, rose up, and, after\r\ncarefully adjusting his valise and umbrella, proceeded deliberately to\r\ntake out his spectacles and fix them on his nose; and, this operation\r\nbeing performed, read as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRan away from the subscriber, my mulatto boy, George. Said George six\r\nfeet in height, a very light mulatto, brown curly hair; is very\r\nintelligent, speaks handsomely, can read and write, will probably try\r\nto pass for a white man, is deeply scarred on his back and shoulders,\r\nhas been branded in his right hand with the letter H.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI will give four hundred dollars for him alive, and the same sum\r\n    for satisfactory proof that he has been _killed.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman read this advertisement from end to end in a low\r\nvoice, as if he were studying it.\r\n\r\nThe long-legged veteran, who had been besieging the fire-iron, as\r\nbefore related, now took down his cumbrous length, and rearing aloft\r\nhis tall form, walked up to the advertisement and very deliberately\r\nspit a full discharge of tobacco-juice on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s my mind upon that!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, briefly, and sat down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, now, stranger, what\xe2\x80\x99s that for?\xe2\x80\x9d said mine host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d do it all the same to the writer of that ar paper, if he was\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the long man, coolly resuming his old employment of cutting\r\ntobacco. \xe2\x80\x9cAny man that owns a boy like that, and can\xe2\x80\x99t find any better\r\nway o\xe2\x80\x99 treating on him, _deserves_ to lose him. Such papers as these is\r\na shame to Kentucky; that\xe2\x80\x99s my mind right out, if anybody wants to\r\nknow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said mine host, as he made an entry in his\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a gang of boys, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the long man, resuming his attack\r\non the fire-irons, \xe2\x80\x9cand I jest tells \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Boys,\xe2\x80\x99 says I,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98_run_ now!\r\ndig! put! jest when ye want to! I never shall come to look after you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way I keep mine. Let \xe2\x80\x99em know they are free to run any time,\r\nand it jest breaks up their wanting to. More \xe2\x80\x99n all, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got free\r\npapers for \xe2\x80\x99em all recorded, in case I gets keeled up any o\xe2\x80\x99 these\r\ntimes, and they know it; and I tell ye, stranger, there an\xe2\x80\x99t a fellow\r\nin our parts gets more out of his niggers than I do. Why, my boys have\r\nbeen to Cincinnati, with five hundred dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of colts, and\r\nbrought me back the money, all straight, time and agin. It stands to\r\nreason they should. Treat \xe2\x80\x99em like dogs, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have dogs\xe2\x80\x99 works\r\nand dogs\xe2\x80\x99 actions. Treat \xe2\x80\x99em like men, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have men\xe2\x80\x99s works.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd the honest drover, in his warmth, endorsed this moral sentiment by\r\nfiring a perfect _feu de joi_ at the fireplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re altogether right, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wilson; \xe2\x80\x9cand this\r\nboy described here _is_ a fine fellow\xe2\x80\x94no mistake about that. He worked\r\nfor me some half-dozen years in my bagging factory, and he was my best\r\nhand, sir. He is an ingenious fellow, too: he invented a machine for\r\nthe cleaning of hemp\xe2\x80\x94a really valuable affair; it\xe2\x80\x99s gone into use in\r\nseveral factories. His master holds the patent of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the drover, \xe2\x80\x9cholds it and makes money out of\r\nit, and then turns round and brands the boy in his right hand. If I had\r\na fair chance, I\xe2\x80\x99d mark him, I reckon so that he\xe2\x80\x99d carry it _one_\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese yer knowin\xe2\x80\x99 boys is allers aggravatin\xe2\x80\x99 and sarcy,\xe2\x80\x9d said a\r\ncoarse-looking fellow, from the other side of the room; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s why\r\nthey gets cut up and marked so. If they behaved themselves, they\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, the Lord made \xe2\x80\x99em men, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a hard squeeze gettin\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em down into beasts,\xe2\x80\x9d said the drover, dryly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBright niggers isn\xe2\x80\x99t no kind of \xe2\x80\x99vantage to their masters,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nthe other, well entrenched, in a coarse, unconscious obtuseness, from\r\nthe contempt of his opponent; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 talents and them\r\nthings, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t get the use on \xe2\x80\x99em yourself? Why, all the use they\r\nmake on \xe2\x80\x99t is to get round you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had one or two of these fellers,\r\nand I jest sold \xe2\x80\x99em down river. I knew I\xe2\x80\x99d got to lose \xe2\x80\x99em, first or\r\nlast, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter send orders up to the Lord, to make you a set, and leave out\r\ntheir souls entirely,\xe2\x80\x9d said the drover.\r\n\r\nHere the conversation was interrupted by the approach of a small\r\none-horse buggy to the inn. It had a genteel appearance, and a\r\nwell-dressed, gentlemanly man sat on the seat, with a colored servant\r\ndriving.\r\n\r\nThe whole party examined the new comer with the interest with which a\r\nset of loafers in a rainy day usually examine every newcomer. He was\r\nvery tall, with a dark, Spanish complexion, fine, expressive black\r\neyes, and close-curling hair, also of a glossy blackness. His\r\nwell-formed aquiline nose, straight thin lips, and the admirable\r\ncontour of his finely-formed limbs, impressed the whole company\r\ninstantly with the idea of something uncommon. He walked easily in\r\namong the company, and with a nod indicated to his waiter where to\r\nplace his trunk, bowed to the company, and, with his hat in his hand,\r\nwalked up leisurely to the bar, and gave in his name as Henry Butter,\r\nOaklands, Shelby County. Turning, with an indifferent air, he sauntered\r\nup to the advertisement, and read it over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his man, \xe2\x80\x9cseems to me we met a boy something like\r\nthis, up at Beman\xe2\x80\x99s, didn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jim, \xe2\x80\x9conly I an\xe2\x80\x99t sure about the hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger with a careless\r\nyawn. Then walking up to the landlord, he desired him to furnish him\r\nwith a private apartment, as he had some writing to do immediately.\r\n\r\nThe landlord was all obsequious, and a relay of about seven negroes,\r\nold and young, male and female, little and big, were soon whizzing\r\nabout, like a covey of partridges, bustling, hurrying, treading on each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s toes, and tumbling over each other, in their zeal to get\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s room ready, while he seated himself easily on a chair in the\r\nmiddle of the room, and entered into conversation with the man who sat\r\nnext to him.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer, Mr. Wilson, from the time of the entrance of the\r\nstranger, had regarded him with an air of disturbed and uneasy\r\ncuriosity. He seemed to himself to have met and been acquainted with\r\nhim somewhere, but he could not recollect. Every few moments, when the\r\nman spoke, or moved, or smiled, he would start and fix his eyes on him,\r\nand then suddenly withdraw them, as the bright, dark eyes met his with\r\nsuch unconcerned coolness. At last, a sudden recollection seemed to\r\nflash upon him, for he stared at the stranger with such an air of blank\r\namazement and alarm, that he walked up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wilson, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in a tone of recognition, and extending\r\nhis hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t recollect you before. I see you\r\nremember me,\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Butler, of Oaklands, Shelby County.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wilson, like one speaking in a dream.\r\n\r\nJust then a negro boy entered, and announced that Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s room was\r\nready.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim, see to the trunks,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, negligently; then\r\naddressing himself to Mr. Wilson, he added\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to have a few\r\nmoments\xe2\x80\x99 conversation with you on business, in my room, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson followed him, as one who walks in his sleep; and they\r\nproceeded to a large upper chamber, where a new-made fire was\r\ncrackling, and various servants flying about, putting finishing touches\r\nto the arrangements.\r\n\r\nWhen all was done, and the servants departed, the young man\r\ndeliberately locked the door, and putting the key in his pocket, faced\r\nabout, and folding his arms on his bosom, looked Mr. Wilson full in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wilson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, George,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am pretty well disguised, I fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, with a\r\nsmile. \xe2\x80\x9cA little walnut bark has made my yellow skin a genteel brown,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ve dyed my hair black; so you see I don\xe2\x80\x99t answer to the\r\nadvertisement at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, George! but this is a dangerous game you are playing. I could not\r\nhave advised you to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can do it on my own responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, with the same\r\nproud smile.\r\n\r\nWe remark, _en passant_, that George was, by his father\xe2\x80\x99s side, of\r\nwhite descent. His mother was one of those unfortunates of her race,\r\nmarked out by personal beauty to be the slave of the passions of her\r\npossessor, and the mother of children who may never know a father. From\r\none of the proudest families in Kentucky he had inherited a set of fine\r\nEuropean features, and a high, indomitable spirit. From his mother he\r\nhad received only a slight mulatto tinge, amply compensated by its\r\naccompanying rich, dark eye. A slight change in the tint of the skin\r\nand the color of his hair had metamorphosed him into the\r\nSpanish-looking fellow he then appeared; and as gracefulness of\r\nmovement and gentlemanly manners had always been perfectly natural to\r\nhim, he found no difficulty in playing the bold part he had\r\nadopted\xe2\x80\x94that of a gentleman travelling with his domestic.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson, a good-natured but extremely fidgety and cautious old\r\ngentleman, ambled up and down the room, appearing, as John Bunyan hath\r\nit, \xe2\x80\x9cmuch tumbled up and down in his mind,\xe2\x80\x9d and divided between his\r\nwish to help George, and a certain confused notion of maintaining law\r\nand order: so, as he shambled about, he delivered himself as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, George, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose you\xe2\x80\x99re running away\xe2\x80\x94leaving your lawful master,\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x94(I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at it)\xe2\x80\x94at the same time, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, George,\xe2\x80\x94yes,\r\ndecidedly\xe2\x80\x94I think I must say that, George\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s my duty to tell you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you sorry, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said George, calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to see you, as it were, setting yourself in opposition to the\r\nlaws of your country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_My_ country!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, with a strong and bitter emphasis; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\ncountry have I, but the grave,\xe2\x80\x94and I wish to God that I was laid\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, George, no\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94it won\xe2\x80\x99t do; this way of talking is\r\nwicked\xe2\x80\x94unscriptural. George, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a hard master\xe2\x80\x94in fact, he\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94well he conducts himself reprehensibly\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to defend\r\nhim. But you know how the angel commanded Hagar to return to her\r\nmistress, and submit herself under the hand;[1] and the apostle sent\r\nback Onesimus to his master.\xe2\x80\x9d[2]\r\n\r\n [1] Gen. 16. The angel bade the pregnant Hagar return to her mistress\r\n Sarai, even though Sarai had dealt harshly with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] Phil. 1:10. Onesimus went back to his master to become no longer a\r\n servant but a \xe2\x80\x9cbrother beloved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t quote Bible at me that way, Mr. Wilson,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, with a\r\nflashing eye, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t! for my wife is a Christian, and I mean to be, if\r\never I get to where I can; but to quote Bible to a fellow in my\r\ncircumstances, is enough to make him give it up altogether. I appeal to\r\nGod Almighty;\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to go with the case to Him, and ask Him if I\r\ndo wrong to seek my freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese feelings are quite natural, George,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good-natured man,\r\nblowing his nose. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, they\xe2\x80\x99re natural, but it is my duty not to\r\nencourage \xe2\x80\x99em in you. Yes, my boy, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you, now; it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad\r\ncase\xe2\x80\x94very bad; but the apostle says, \xe2\x80\x98Let everyone abide in the\r\ncondition in which he is called.\xe2\x80\x99 We must all submit to the indications\r\nof Providence, George,\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge stood with his head drawn back, his arms folded tightly over his\r\nbroad breast, and a bitter smile curling his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder, Mr. Wilson, if the Indians should come and take you a\r\nprisoner away from your wife and children, and want to keep you all\r\nyour life hoeing corn for them, if you\xe2\x80\x99d think it your duty to abide in\r\nthe condition in which you were called. I rather think that you\xe2\x80\x99d think\r\nthe first stray horse you could find an indication of\r\nProvidence\xe2\x80\x94shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little old gentleman stared with both eyes at this illustration of\r\nthe case; but, though not much of a reasoner, he had the sense in which\r\nsome logicians on this particular subject do not excel,\xe2\x80\x94that of saying\r\nnothing, where nothing could be said. So, as he stood carefully\r\nstroking his umbrella, and folding and patting down all the creases in\r\nit, he proceeded on with his exhortations in a general way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, George, you know, now, I always have stood your friend; and\r\nwhatever I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, I\xe2\x80\x99ve said for your good. Now, here, it seems to me,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re running an awful risk. You can\xe2\x80\x99t hope to carry it out. If you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ntaken, it will be worse with you than ever; they\xe2\x80\x99ll only abuse you, and\r\nhalf kill you, and sell you down the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wilson, I know all this,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cI _do_ run a risk, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe threw open his overcoat, and showed two pistols and a bowie-knife.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ready for \xe2\x80\x99em! Down south I never _will_ go. No!\r\nif it comes to that, I can earn myself at least six feet of free\r\nsoil,\xe2\x80\x94the first and last I shall ever own in Kentucky!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, George, this state of mind is awful; it\xe2\x80\x99s getting really\r\ndesperate George. I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned. Going to break the laws of your\r\ncountry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy country again! Mr. Wilson, _you_ have a country; but what country\r\nhave _I_, or any one like me, born of slave mothers? What laws are\r\nthere for us? We don\xe2\x80\x99t make them,\xe2\x80\x94we don\xe2\x80\x99t consent to them,\xe2\x80\x94we have\r\nnothing to do with them; all they do for us is to crush us, and keep us\r\ndown. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I heard your Fourth-of-July speeches? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell us\r\nall, once a year, that governments derive their just power from the\r\nconsent of the governed? Can\xe2\x80\x99t a fellow _think_, that hears such\r\nthings? Can\xe2\x80\x99t he put this and that together, and see what it comes to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s mind was one of those that may not unaptly be represented\r\nby a bale of cotton,\xe2\x80\x94downy, soft, benevolently fuzzy and confused. He\r\nreally pitied George with all his heart, and had a sort of dim and\r\ncloudy perception of the style of feeling that agitated him; but he\r\ndeemed it his duty to go on talking _good_ to him, with infinite\r\npertinacity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, this is bad. I must tell you, you know, as a friend, you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter not be meddling with such notions; they are bad, George, very\r\nbad, for boys in your condition,\xe2\x80\x94very;\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Wilson sat down to a\r\ntable, and began nervously chewing the handle of his umbrella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, now, Mr. Wilson,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, coming up and sitting himself\r\ndeterminately down in front of him; \xe2\x80\x9clook at me, now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t I sit\r\nbefore you, every way, just as much a man as you are? Look at my\r\nface,\xe2\x80\x94look at my hands,\xe2\x80\x94look at my body,\xe2\x80\x9d and the young man drew\r\nhimself up proudly; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy am I _not_ a man, as much as anybody? Well,\r\nMr. Wilson, hear what I can tell you. I had a father\xe2\x80\x94one of your\r\nKentucky gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94who didn\xe2\x80\x99t think enough of me to keep me from being\r\nsold with his dogs and horses, to satisfy the estate, when he died. I\r\nsaw my mother put up at sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s sale, with her seven children. They\r\nwere sold before her eyes, one by one, all to different masters; and I\r\nwas the youngest. She came and kneeled down before old Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, and\r\nbegged him to buy her with me, that she might have at least one child\r\nwith her; and he kicked her away with his heavy boot. I saw him do it;\r\nand the last that I heard was her moans and screams, when I was tied to\r\nhis horse\xe2\x80\x99s neck, to be carried off to his place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy master traded with one of the men, and bought my oldest sister. She\r\nwas a pious, good girl,\xe2\x80\x94a member of the Baptist church,\xe2\x80\x94and as handsome\r\nas my poor mother had been. She was well brought up, and had good\r\nmanners. At first, I was glad she was bought, for I had one friend near\r\nme. I was soon sorry for it. Sir, I have stood at the door and heard\r\nher whipped, when it seemed as if every blow cut into my naked heart,\r\nand I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to help her; and she was whipped, sir, for\r\nwanting to live a decent Christian life, such as your laws give no\r\nslave girl a right to live; and at last I saw her chained with a\r\ntrader\xe2\x80\x99s gang, to be sent to market in Orleans,\xe2\x80\x94sent there for nothing\r\nelse but that,\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s the last I know of her. Well, I grew up,\xe2\x80\x94long\r\nyears and years,\xe2\x80\x94no father, no mother, no sister, not a living soul\r\nthat cared for me more than a dog; nothing but whipping, scolding,\r\nstarving. Why, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so hungry that I have been glad to take\r\nthe bones they threw to their dogs; and yet, when I was a little\r\nfellow, and laid awake whole nights and cried, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the hunger, it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t the whipping, I cried for. No, sir, it was for _my mother_ and\r\n_my sisters_,\xe2\x80\x94it was because I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a friend to love me on earth. I\r\nnever knew what peace or comfort was. I never had a kind word spoken to\r\nme till I came to work in your factory. Mr. Wilson, you treated me\r\nwell; you encouraged me to do well, and to learn to read and write, and\r\nto try to make something of myself; and God knows how grateful I am for\r\nit. Then, sir, I found my wife; you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her,\xe2\x80\x94you know how beautiful\r\nshe is. When I found she loved me, when I married her, I scarcely could\r\nbelieve I was alive, I was so happy; and, sir, she is as good as she is\r\nbeautiful. But now what? Why, now comes my master, takes me right away\r\nfrom my work, and my friends, and all I like, and grinds me down into\r\nthe very dirt! And why? Because, he says, I forgot who I was; he says,\r\nto teach me that I am only a nigger! After all, and last of all, he\r\ncomes between me and my wife, and says I shall give her up, and live\r\nwith another woman. And all this your laws give him power to do, in\r\nspite of God or man. Mr. Wilson, look at it! There isn\xe2\x80\x99t _one_ of all\r\nthese things, that have broken the hearts of my mother and my sister,\r\nand my wife and myself, but your laws allow, and give every man power\r\nto do, in Kentucky, and none can say to him nay! Do you call these the\r\nlaws of _my_ country? Sir, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any country, anymore than I have\r\nany father. But I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have one. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything of _your_\r\ncountry, except to be let alone,\xe2\x80\x94to go peaceably out of it; and when I\r\nget to Canada, where the laws will own me and protect me, _that_ shall\r\nbe my country, and its laws I will obey. But if any man tries to stop\r\nme, let him take care, for I am desperate. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fight for my liberty to\r\nthe last breath I breathe. You say your fathers did it; if it was right\r\nfor them, it is right for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech, delivered partly while sitting at the table, and partly\r\nwalking up and down the room,\xe2\x80\x94delivered with tears, and flashing eyes,\r\nand despairing gestures,\xe2\x80\x94was altogether too much for the good-natured\r\nold body to whom it was addressed, who had pulled out a great yellow\r\nsilk pocket-handkerchief, and was mopping up his face with great\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlast \xe2\x80\x99em all!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly broke out. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I always said so\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ninfernal old cusses! I hope I an\xe2\x80\x99t swearing, now. Well! go ahead,\r\nGeorge, go ahead; but be careful, my boy; don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot anybody, George,\r\nunless\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d _better_ not shoot, I reckon; at least, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n_hit_ anybody, you know. Where is your wife, George?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as he\r\nnervously rose, and began walking the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone, sir gone, with her child in her arms, the Lord only knows\r\nwhere;\xe2\x80\x94gone after the north star; and when we ever meet, or whether we\r\nmeet at all in this world, no creature can tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible! astonishing! from such a kind family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKind families get in debt, and the laws of _our_ country allow them to\r\nsell the child out of its mother\xe2\x80\x99s bosom to pay its master\xe2\x80\x99s debts,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid George, bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the honest old man, fumbling in his pocket: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ns\xe2\x80\x99pose, perhaps, I an\xe2\x80\x99t following my judgment,\xe2\x80\x94hang it, I _won\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nfollow my judgment!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, suddenly; \xe2\x80\x9cso here, George,\xe2\x80\x9d and, taking\r\nout a roll of bills from his pocket-book, he offered them to George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my kind, good sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve done a great deal for me,\r\nand this might get you into trouble. I have money enough, I hope, to\r\ntake me as far as I need it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but you must, George. Money is a great help everywhere;\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ntoo much, if you get it honestly. Take it,\xe2\x80\x94_do_ take it, _now_,\xe2\x80\x94do, my\r\nboy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn condition, sir, that I may repay it at some future time, I will,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid George, taking up the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, George, how long are you going to travel in this way?\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nlong or far, I hope. It\xe2\x80\x99s well carried on, but too bold. And this black\r\nfellow,\xe2\x80\x94who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA true fellow, who went to Canada more than a year ago. He heard,\r\nafter he got there, that his master was so angry at him for going off\r\nthat he had whipped his poor old mother; and he has come all the way\r\nback to comfort her, and get a chance to get her away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he got her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet; he has been hanging about the place, and found no chance yet.\r\nMeanwhile, he is going with me as far as Ohio, to put me among friends\r\nthat helped him, and then he will come back after her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDangerous, very dangerous!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\nGeorge drew himself up, and smiled disdainfully.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman eyed him from head to foot, with a sort of innocent\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, something has brought you out wonderfully. You hold up your\r\nhead, and speak and move like another man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wilson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99m a _freeman_!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, proudly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; I\xe2\x80\x99ve said\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r for the last time to any man. _I\xe2\x80\x99m free!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care! You are not sure,\xe2\x80\x94you may be taken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll men are free and equal _in the grave_, if it comes to that, Mr.\r\nWilson,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly dumb-founded with your boldness!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wilson,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto\r\ncome right here to the nearest tavern!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wilson, it is _so_ bold, and this tavern is so near, that they\r\nwill never think of it; they will look for me on ahead, and you\r\nyourself wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know me. Jim\xe2\x80\x99s master don\xe2\x80\x99t live in this county; he\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t known in these parts. Besides, he is given up; nobody is looking\r\nafter him, and nobody will take me up from the advertisement, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the mark in your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge drew off his glove, and showed a newly-healed scar in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a parting proof of Mr. Harris\xe2\x80\x99 regard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, scornfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fortnight ago, he took it into his head to give it to me, because he\r\nsaid he believed I should try to get away one of these days. Looks\r\ninteresting, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, drawing his glove on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare, my very blood runs cold when I think of it,\xe2\x80\x94your condition\r\nand your risks!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wilson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine has run cold a good many years, Mr. Wilson; at present, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabout up to the boiling point,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my good sir,\xe2\x80\x9d continued George, after a few moments\xe2\x80\x99 silence, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsaw you knew me; I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d just have this talk with you, lest your\r\nsurprised looks should bring me out. I leave early tomorrow morning,\r\nbefore daylight; by tomorrow night I hope to sleep safe in Ohio. I\r\nshall travel by daylight, stop at the best hotels, go to the\r\ndinner-tables with the lords of the land. So, good-by, sir; if you hear\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99m taken, you may know that I\xe2\x80\x99m dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge stood up like a rock, and put out his hand with the air of a\r\nprince. The friendly little old man shook it heartily, and after a\r\nlittle shower of caution, he took his umbrella, and fumbled his way out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nGeorge stood thoughtfully looking at the door, as the old man closed\r\nit. A thought seemed to flash across his mind. He hastily stepped to\r\nit, and opening it, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wilson, one word more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman entered again, and George, as before, locked the\r\ndoor, and then stood for a few moments looking on the floor,\r\nirresolutely. At last, raising his head with a sudden effort\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nWilson, you have shown yourself a Christian in your treatment of me,\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwant to ask one last deed of Christian kindness of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x94what you said was true. I _am_ running a dreadful risk.\r\nThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t, on earth, a living soul to care if I die,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\ndrawing his breath hard, and speaking with a great effort,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be\r\nkicked out and buried like a dog, and nobody\xe2\x80\x99ll think of it a day\r\nafter,\xe2\x80\x94_only my poor wife!_ Poor soul! she\xe2\x80\x99ll mourn and grieve; and if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d only contrive, Mr. Wilson, to send this little pin to her. She\r\ngave it to me for a Christmas present, poor child! Give it to her, and\r\ntell her I loved her to the last. Will you? _Will_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, certainly\xe2\x80\x94poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, taking the pin,\r\nwith watery eyes, and a melancholy quiver in his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said George; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s my last wish, if she _can_ get\r\nto Canada, to go there. No matter how kind her mistress is,\xe2\x80\x94no matter\r\nhow much she loves her home; beg her not to go back,\xe2\x80\x94for slavery always\r\nends in misery. Tell her to bring up our boy a free man, and then he\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t suffer as I have. Tell her this, Mr. Wilson, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, George. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her; but I trust you won\xe2\x80\x99t die; take\r\nheart,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re a brave fellow. Trust in the Lord, George. I wish in my\r\nheart you were safe through, though,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Is_ there a God to trust in?\xe2\x80\x9d said George, in such a tone of bitter\r\ndespair as arrested the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s words. \xe2\x80\x9cO, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen things all\r\nmy life that have made me feel that there can\xe2\x80\x99t be a God. You\r\nChristians don\xe2\x80\x99t know how these things look to us. There\xe2\x80\x99s a God for\r\nyou, but is there any for us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, now, don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, almost sobbing as he\r\nspoke; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t feel so! There is\xe2\x80\x94there is; clouds and darkness are\r\naround about him, but righteousness and judgment are the habitation of\r\nhis throne. There\xe2\x80\x99s a _God_, George,\xe2\x80\x94believe it; trust in Him, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure He\xe2\x80\x99ll help you. Everything will be set right,\xe2\x80\x94if not in this life,\r\nin another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe real piety and benevolence of the simple old man invested him with\r\na temporary dignity and authority, as he spoke. George stopped his\r\ndistracted walk up and down the room, stood thoughtfully a moment, and\r\nthen said, quietly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for saying that, my good friend; I\xe2\x80\x99ll _think of that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nSelect Incident of Lawful Trade\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Ramah there was a voice heard,\xe2\x80\x94weeping, and lamentation, and great\r\nmourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nJer. 31:15.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Haley and Tom jogged onward in their wagon, each, for a time,\r\nabsorbed in his own reflections. Now, the reflections of two men\r\nsitting side by side are a curious thing,\xe2\x80\x94seated on the same seat,\r\nhaving the same eyes, ears, hands and organs of all sorts, and having\r\npass before their eyes the same objects,\xe2\x80\x94it is wonderful what a variety\r\nwe shall find in these same reflections!\r\n\r\nAs, for example, Mr. Haley: he thought first of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s length, and\r\nbreadth, and height, and what he would sell for, if he was kept fat and\r\nin good case till he got him into market. He thought of how he should\r\nmake out his gang; he thought of the respective market value of certain\r\nsupposititious men and women and children who were to compose it, and\r\nother kindred topics of the business; then he thought of himself, and\r\nhow humane he was, that whereas other men chained their \xe2\x80\x9cniggers\xe2\x80\x9d hand\r\nand foot both, he only put fetters on the feet, and left Tom the use of\r\nhis hands, as long as he behaved well; and he sighed to think how\r\nungrateful human nature was, so that there was even room to doubt\r\nwhether Tom appreciated his mercies. He had been taken in so by\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cniggers\xe2\x80\x9d whom he had favored; but still he was astonished to consider\r\nhow good-natured he yet remained!\r\n\r\nAs to Tom, he was thinking over some words of an unfashionable old\r\nbook, which kept running through his head, again and again, as follows:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have here no continuing city, but we seek one to come; wherefore\r\nGod himself is not ashamed to be called our God; for he hath prepared\r\nfor us a city.\xe2\x80\x9d These words of an ancient volume, got up principally by\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cignorant and unlearned men,\xe2\x80\x9d have, through all time, kept up, somehow,\r\na strange sort of power over the minds of poor, simple fellows, like\r\nTom. They stir up the soul from its depths, and rouse, as with trumpet\r\ncall, courage, energy, and enthusiasm, where before was only the\r\nblackness of despair.\r\n\r\nMr. Haley pulled out of his pocket sundry newspapers, and began looking\r\nover their advertisements, with absorbed interest. He was not a\r\nremarkably fluent reader, and was in the habit of reading in a sort of\r\nrecitative half-aloud, by way of calling in his ears to verify the\r\ndeductions of his eyes. In this tone he slowly recited the following\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEXECUTOR\xe2\x80\x99S SALE,\xe2\x80\x94NEGROES!\xe2\x80\x94Agreeably to order of court, will be sold,\r\non Tuesday, February 20, before the Court-house door, in the town of\r\nWashington, Kentucky, the following negroes: Hagar, aged 60; John, aged\r\n30; Ben, aged 21; Saul, aged 25; Albert, aged 14. Sold for the benefit\r\nof the creditors and heirs of the estate of Jesse Blutchford,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSAMUEL MORRIS,\r\nTHOMAS FLINT,\r\n_Executors_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis yer I must look at,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Tom, for want of somebody else to\r\ntalk to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe see, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get up a prime gang to take down with ye, Tom;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99ll make it sociable and pleasant like,\xe2\x80\x94good company will, ye know.\r\nWe must drive right to Washington first and foremost, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nclap you into jail, while I does the business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom received this agreeable intelligence quite meekly; simply\r\nwondering, in his own heart, how many of these doomed men had wives and\r\nchildren, and whether they would feel as he did about leaving them. It\r\nis to be confessed, too, that the naive, off-hand information that he\r\nwas to be thrown into jail by no means produced an agreeable impression\r\non a poor fellow who had always prided himself on a strictly honest and\r\nupright course of life. Yes, Tom, we must confess it, was rather proud\r\nof his honesty, poor fellow,\xe2\x80\x94not having very much else to be proud\r\nof;\xe2\x80\x94if he had belonged to some of the higher walks of society, he,\r\nperhaps, would never have been reduced to such straits. However, the\r\nday wore on, and the evening saw Haley and Tom comfortably accommodated\r\nin Washington,\xe2\x80\x94the one in a tavern, and the other in a jail.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next day, a mixed throng was gathered around\r\nthe court-house steps,\xe2\x80\x94smoking, chewing, spitting, swearing, and\r\nconversing, according to their respective tastes and turns,\xe2\x80\x94waiting for\r\nthe auction to commence. The men and women to be sold sat in a group\r\napart, talking in a low tone to each other. The woman who had been\r\nadvertised by the name of Hagar was a regular African in feature and\r\nfigure. She might have been sixty, but was older than that by hard work\r\nand disease, was partially blind, and somewhat crippled with\r\nrheumatism. By her side stood her only remaining son, Albert, a\r\nbright-looking little fellow of fourteen years. The boy was the only\r\nsurvivor of a large family, who had been successively sold away from\r\nher to a southern market. The mother held on to him with both her\r\nshaking hands, and eyed with intense trepidation every one who walked\r\nup to examine him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AUCTION SALE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be feard, Aunt Hagar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the oldest of the men, \xe2\x80\x9cI spoke to\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r Thomas \xe2\x80\x99bout it, and he thought he might manage to sell you in a\r\nlot both together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDey needn\xe2\x80\x99t call me worn out yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, lifting her shaking\r\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cI can cook yet, and scrub, and scour,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m wuth a buying, if I\r\ndo come cheap;\xe2\x80\x94tell em dat ar,\xe2\x80\x94you _tell_ em,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, earnestly.\r\n\r\nHaley here forced his way into the group, walked up to the old man,\r\npulled his mouth open and looked in, felt of his teeth, made him stand\r\nand straighten himself, bend his back, and perform various evolutions\r\nto show his muscles; and then passed on to the next, and put him\r\nthrough the same trial. Walking up last to the boy, he felt of his\r\narms, straightened his hands, and looked at his fingers, and made him\r\njump, to show his agility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe an\xe2\x80\x99t gwine to be sold widout me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, with\r\npassionate eagerness; \xe2\x80\x9che and I goes in a lot together; I \xe2\x80\x99s rail\r\nstrong yet, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r and can do heaps o\xe2\x80\x99 work,\xe2\x80\x94heaps on it, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn plantation?\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, with a contemptuous glance. \xe2\x80\x9cLikely\r\nstory!\xe2\x80\x9d and, as if satisfied with his examination, he walked out and\r\nlooked, and stood with his hands in his pocket, his cigar in his mouth,\r\nand his hat cocked on one side, ready for action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat think of \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d said a man who had been following Haley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexamination, as if to make up his own mind from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, spitting, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall put in, I think, for the\r\nyoungerly ones and the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey want to sell the boy and the old woman together,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind it a tight pull;\xe2\x80\x94why, she\xe2\x80\x99s an old rack o\xe2\x80\x99 bones,\xe2\x80\x94not worth her\r\nsalt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t then?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnybody \xe2\x80\x99d be a fool \xe2\x80\x99t would. She\xe2\x80\x99s half blind, crooked with\r\nrheumatis, and foolish to boot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome buys up these yer old critturs, and ses there\xe2\x80\x99s a sight more wear\r\nin \xe2\x80\x99em than a body \xe2\x80\x99d think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, reflectively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo go, \xe2\x80\x99t all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley; \xe2\x80\x9cwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take her for a\r\npresent,\xe2\x80\x94fact,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve _seen_, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, \xe2\x80\x99t is kinder pity, now, not to buy her with her son,\xe2\x80\x94her heart\r\nseems so sot on him,\xe2\x80\x94s\xe2\x80\x99pose they fling her in cheap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem that\xe2\x80\x99s got money to spend that ar way, it\xe2\x80\x99s all well enough. I\r\nshall bid off on that ar boy for a plantation-hand;\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nbothered with her, no way, not if they\xe2\x80\x99d give her to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll take on desp\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xe2\x80\x99lly, she will,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader, coolly.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was here interrupted by a busy hum in the audience;\r\nand the auctioneer, a short, bustling, important fellow, elbowed his\r\nway into the crowd. The old woman drew in her breath, and caught\r\ninstinctively at her son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep close to yer mammy, Albert,\xe2\x80\x94close,\xe2\x80\x94dey\xe2\x80\x99ll put us up togedder,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, mammy, I\xe2\x80\x99m feard they won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDey must, child; I can\xe2\x80\x99t live, no ways, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\r\ncreature, vehemently.\r\n\r\nThe stentorian tones of the auctioneer, calling out to clear the way,\r\nnow announced that the sale was about to commence. A place was cleared,\r\nand the bidding began. The different men on the list were soon knocked\r\noff at prices which showed a pretty brisk demand in the market; two of\r\nthem fell to Haley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, young un,\xe2\x80\x9d said the auctioneer, giving the boy a touch with\r\nhis hammer, \xe2\x80\x9cbe up and show your springs, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut us two up togedder, togedder,\xe2\x80\x94do please, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\r\nwoman, holding fast to her boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe off,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, gruffly, pushing her hands away; \xe2\x80\x9cyou come\r\nlast. Now, darkey, spring;\xe2\x80\x9d and, with the word, he pushed the boy\r\ntoward the block, while a deep, heavy groan rose behind him. The boy\r\npaused, and looked back; but there was no time to stay, and, dashing\r\nthe tears from his large, bright eyes, he was up in a moment.\r\n\r\nHis fine figure, alert limbs, and bright face, raised an instant\r\ncompetition, and half a dozen bids simultaneously met the ear of the\r\nauctioneer. Anxious, half-frightened, he looked from side to side, as\r\nhe heard the clatter of contending bids,\xe2\x80\x94now here, now there,\xe2\x80\x94till the\r\nhammer fell. Haley had got him. He was pushed from the block toward his\r\nnew master, but stopped one moment, and looked back, when his poor old\r\nmother, trembling in every limb, held out her shaking hands toward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuy me too, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, for de dear Lord\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x94buy me,\xe2\x80\x94I shall die if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll die if I do, that\xe2\x80\x99s the kink of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cno!\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nturned on his heel.\r\n\r\nThe bidding for the poor old creature was summary. The man who had\r\naddressed Haley, and who seemed not destitute of compassion, bought her\r\nfor a trifle, and the spectators began to disperse.\r\n\r\nThe poor victims of the sale, who had been brought up in one place\r\ntogether for years, gathered round the despairing old mother, whose\r\nagony was pitiful to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dey leave me one? Mas\xe2\x80\x99r allers said I should have one,\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ndid,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated over and over, in heart-broken tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust in the Lord, Aunt Hagar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the oldest of the men,\r\nsorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat good will it do?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, sobbing passionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, mother,\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t! don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say you \xe2\x80\x99s got a\r\ngood master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. O, Albert! oh, my boy! you \xe2\x80\x99s my last\r\nbaby. Lord, how ken I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, take her off, can\xe2\x80\x99t some of ye?\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, dryly; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t do no\r\ngood for her to go on that ar way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old men of the company, partly by persuasion and partly by force,\r\nloosed the poor creature\xe2\x80\x99s last despairing hold, and, as they led her\r\noff to her new master\xe2\x80\x99s wagon, strove to comfort her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, pushing his three purchases together, and producing\r\na bundle of handcuffs, which he proceeded to put on their wrists; and\r\nfastening each handcuff to a long chain, he drove them before him to\r\nthe jail.\r\n\r\nA few days saw Haley, with his possessions, safely deposited on one of\r\nthe Ohio boats. It was the commencement of his gang, to be augmented,\r\nas the boat moved on, by various other merchandise of the same kind,\r\nwhich he, or his agent, had stored for him in various points along\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nThe La Belle Riviere, as brave and beautiful a boat as ever walked the\r\nwaters of her namesake river, was floating gayly down the stream, under\r\na brilliant sky, the stripes and stars of free America waving and\r\nfluttering over head; the guards crowded with well-dressed ladies and\r\ngentlemen walking and enjoying the delightful day. All was full of\r\nlife, buoyant and rejoicing;\xe2\x80\x94all but Haley\xe2\x80\x99s gang, who were stored,\r\nwith other freight, on the lower deck, and who, somehow, did not seem\r\nto appreciate their various privileges, as they sat in a knot, talking\r\nto each other in low tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoys,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, coming up, briskly, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you keep up good heart,\r\nand are cheerful. Now, no sulks, ye see; keep stiff upper lip, boys; do\r\nwell by me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do well by you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys addressed responded the invariable \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d for ages the\r\nwatchword of poor Africa; but it\xe2\x80\x99s to be owned they did not look\r\nparticularly cheerful; they had their various little prejudices in\r\nfavor of wives, mothers, sisters, and children, seen for the last\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x94and though \xe2\x80\x9cthey that wasted them required of them mirth,\xe2\x80\x9d it was\r\nnot instantly forthcoming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a wife,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke out the article enumerated as \xe2\x80\x9cJohn, aged\r\nthirty,\xe2\x80\x9d and he laid his chained hand on Tom\xe2\x80\x99s knee,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand she don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow a word about this, poor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere does she live?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a tavern a piece down here,\xe2\x80\x9d said John; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish, now, I _could_ see\r\nher once more in this world,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\nPoor John! It _was_ rather natural; and the tears that fell, as he\r\nspoke, came as naturally as if he had been a white man. Tom drew a long\r\nbreath from a sore heart, and tried, in his poor way, to comfort him.\r\n\r\nAnd over head, in the cabin, sat fathers and mothers, husbands and\r\nwives; and merry, dancing children moved round among them, like so many\r\nlittle butterflies, and everything was going on quite easy and\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said a boy, who had just come up from below, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nnegro trader on board, and he\xe2\x80\x99s brought four or five slaves down\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor creatures!\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, in a tone between grief and\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said another lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome poor slaves below,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they\xe2\x80\x99ve got chains on,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a shame to our country that such sights are to be seen!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nanother lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, there\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal to be said on both sides of the subject,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\na genteel woman, who sat at her state-room door sewing, while her\r\nlittle girl and boy were playing round her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been south, and I\r\nmust say I think the negroes are better off than they would be to be\r\nfree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn some respects, some of them are well off, I grant,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady\r\nto whose remark she had answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most dreadful part of slavery,\r\nto my mind, is its outrages on the feelings and affections,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nseparating of families, for example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat _is_ a bad thing, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other lady, holding up a\r\nbaby\xe2\x80\x99s dress she had just completed, and looking intently on its\r\ntrimmings; \xe2\x80\x9cbut then, I fancy, it don\xe2\x80\x99t occur often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, it does,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first lady, eagerly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lived many years in\r\nKentucky and Virginia both, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen enough to make any one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart sick. Suppose, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, your two children, there, should be taken\r\nfrom you, and sold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t reason from our feelings to those of this class of persons,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the other lady, sorting out some worsteds on her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you can know nothing of them, if you say so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nthe first lady, warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was born and brought up among them. I know\r\nthey _do_ feel, just as keenly,\xe2\x80\x94even more so, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x94as we do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady said \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d yawned, and looked out the cabin window, and\r\nfinally repeated, for a finale, the remark with which she had\r\nbegun,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, I think they are better off than they would be to be\r\nfree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s undoubtedly the intention of Providence that the African race\r\nshould be servants,\xe2\x80\x94kept in a low condition,\xe2\x80\x9d said a grave-looking\r\ngentleman in black, a clergyman, seated by the cabin door. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Cursed be\r\nCanaan; a servant of servants shall he be,\xe2\x80\x99 the scripture says.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n [1] Gen. 9:25. his is what Noah says when he wakes out of drunkenness\r\n and realizes that his youngest son, Ham, father of Canaan, has seen\r\n him naked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, stranger, is that ar what that text means?\xe2\x80\x9d said a tall man,\r\nstanding by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly. It pleased Providence, for some inscrutable reason, to\r\ndoom the race to bondage, ages ago; and we must not set up our opinion\r\nagainst that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, we\xe2\x80\x99ll all go ahead and buy up niggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the way of Providence,\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t we, Squire?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning to\r\nHaley, who had been standing, with his hands in his pockets, by the\r\nstove and intently listening to the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the tall man, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must all be resigned to the decrees\r\nof Providence. Niggers must be sold, and trucked round, and kept under;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99s made for. \xe2\x80\x99Pears like this yer view \xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\nrefreshing, an\xe2\x80\x99t it, stranger?\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Haley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought on \xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said as much,\r\nmyself; I ha\xe2\x80\x99nt no larning. I took up the trade just to make a living;\r\nif \xe2\x80\x99tan\xe2\x80\x99t right, I calculated to \xe2\x80\x99pent on \xe2\x80\x99t in time, ye know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you\xe2\x80\x99ll save yerself the trouble, won\xe2\x80\x99t ye?\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall man.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what \xe2\x80\x99t is, now, to know scripture. If ye\xe2\x80\x99d only studied yer\r\nBible, like this yer good man, ye might have know\xe2\x80\x99d it before, and\r\nsaved ye a heap o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble. Ye could jist have said, \xe2\x80\x99Cussed be\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhis name?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98and \xe2\x80\x99t would all have come right.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d And the stranger, who\r\nwas no other than the honest drover whom we introduced to our readers\r\nin the Kentucky tavern, sat down, and began smoking, with a curious\r\nsmile on his long, dry face.\r\n\r\nA tall, slender young man, with a face expressive of great feeling and\r\nintelligence, here broke in, and repeated the words, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98All things\r\nwhatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x99 I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9c_that_ is scripture, as much as \xe2\x80\x99Cursed\r\nbe Canaan.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, it seems quite _as_ plain a text, stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d said John the\r\ndrover, \xe2\x80\x9cto poor fellows like us, now;\xe2\x80\x9d and John smoked on like a\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\nThe young man paused, looked as if he was going to say more, when\r\nsuddenly the boat stopped, and the company made the usual steamboat\r\nrush, to see where they were landing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth them ar chaps parsons?\xe2\x80\x9d said John to one of the men, as they were\r\ngoing out.\r\n\r\nThe man nodded.\r\n\r\nAs the boat stopped, a black woman came running wildly up the plank,\r\ndarted into the crowd, flew up to where the slave gang sat, and threw\r\nher arms round that unfortunate piece of merchandise before\r\nenumerate\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cJohn, aged thirty,\xe2\x80\x9d and with sobs and tears bemoaned him as\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nBut what needs tell the story, told too oft,\xe2\x80\x94every day told,\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nheart-strings rent and broken,\xe2\x80\x94the weak broken and torn for the profit\r\nand convenience of the strong! It needs not to be told;\xe2\x80\x94every day is\r\ntelling it,\xe2\x80\x94telling it, too, in the ear of One who is not deaf, though\r\nhe be long silent.\r\n\r\nThe young man who had spoken for the cause of humanity and God before\r\nstood with folded arms, looking on this scene. He turned, and Haley was\r\nstanding at his side. \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, speaking with thick\r\nutterance, \xe2\x80\x9chow can you, how dare you, carry on a trade like this? Look\r\nat those poor creatures! Here I am, rejoicing in my heart that I am\r\ngoing home to my wife and child; and the same bell which is a signal to\r\ncarry me onward towards them will part this poor man and his wife\r\nforever. Depend upon it, God will bring you into judgment for this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trader turned away in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the drover, touching his elbow, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s differences\r\nin parsons, an\xe2\x80\x99t there? \xe2\x80\x99Cussed be Canaan\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to go down with\r\nthis \xe2\x80\x99un, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaley gave an uneasy growl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that ar an\xe2\x80\x99t the worst on \xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said John; \xe2\x80\x9cmabbee it won\xe2\x80\x99t go down\r\nwith the Lord, neither, when ye come to settle with Him, one o\xe2\x80\x99 these\r\ndays, as all on us must, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaley walked reflectively to the other end of the boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I make pretty handsomely on one or two next gangs,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nreckon I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop off this yer; it\xe2\x80\x99s really getting dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\ntook out his pocket-book, and began adding over his accounts,\xe2\x80\x94a process\r\nwhich many gentlemen besides Mr. Haley have found a specific for an\r\nuneasy conscience.\r\n\r\nThe boat swept proudly away from the shore, and all went on merrily, as\r\nbefore. Men talked, and loafed, and read, and smoked. Women sewed, and\r\nchildren played, and the boat passed on her way.\r\n\r\nOne day, when she lay to for a while at a small town in Kentucky, Haley\r\nwent up into the place on a little matter of business.\r\n\r\nTom, whose fetters did not prevent his taking a moderate circuit, had\r\ndrawn near the side of the boat, and stood listlessly gazing over the\r\nrailing. After a time, he saw the trader returning, with an alert step,\r\nin company with a colored woman, bearing in her arms a young child. She\r\nwas dressed quite respectably, and a colored man followed her, bringing\r\nalong a small trunk. The woman came cheerfully onward, talking, as she\r\ncame, with the man who bore her trunk, and so passed up the plank into\r\nthe boat. The bell rung, the steamer whizzed, the engine groaned and\r\ncoughed, and away swept the boat down the river.\r\n\r\nThe woman walked forward among the boxes and bales of the lower deck,\r\nand, sitting down, busied herself with chirruping to her baby.\r\n\r\nHaley made a turn or two about the boat, and then, coming up, seated\r\nhimself near her, and began saying something to her in an indifferent\r\nundertone.\r\n\r\nTom soon noticed a heavy cloud passing over the woman\xe2\x80\x99s brow; and that\r\nshe answered rapidly, and with great vehemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it,\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d he heard her say. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\njist a foolin\xe2\x80\x99 with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, look here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, drawing out a\r\npaper; \xe2\x80\x9cthis yer\xe2\x80\x99s the bill of sale, and there\xe2\x80\x99s your master\xe2\x80\x99s name to\r\nit; and I paid down good solid cash for it, too, I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x94so,\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe Mas\xe2\x80\x99r would cheat me so; it can\xe2\x80\x99t be true!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nwoman, with increasing agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can ask any of these men here, that can read writing. Here!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, to a man that was passing by, \xe2\x80\x9cjist read this yer, won\xe2\x80\x99t you!\r\nThis yer gal won\xe2\x80\x99t believe me, when I tell her what \xe2\x80\x99t is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bill of sale, signed by John Fosdick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmaking over to you the girl Lucy and her child. It\xe2\x80\x99s all straight\r\nenough, for aught I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman\xe2\x80\x99s passionate exclamations collected a crowd around her, and\r\nthe trader briefly explained to them the cause of the agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me that I was going down to Louisville, to hire out as cook to\r\nthe same tavern where my husband works,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what Mas\xe2\x80\x99r told me, his\r\nown self; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe he\xe2\x80\x99d lie to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he has sold you, my poor woman, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said a\r\ngood-natured looking man, who had been examining the papers; \xe2\x80\x9che has\r\ndone it, and no mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s no account talking,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, suddenly growing quite\r\ncalm; and, clasping her child tighter in her arms, she sat down on her\r\nbox, turned her back round, and gazed listlessly into the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to take it easy, after all!\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader. \xe2\x80\x9cGal\xe2\x80\x99s got grit, I\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman looked calm, as the boat went on; and a beautiful soft summer\r\nbreeze passed like a compassionate spirit over her head,\xe2\x80\x94the gentle\r\nbreeze, that never inquires whether the brow is dusky or fair that it\r\nfans. And she saw sunshine sparkling on the water, in golden ripples,\r\nand heard gay voices, full of ease and pleasure, talking around her\r\neverywhere; but her heart lay as if a great stone had fallen on it. Her\r\nbaby raised himself up against her, and stroked her cheeks with his\r\nlittle hands; and, springing up and down, crowing and chatting, seemed\r\ndetermined to arouse her. She strained him suddenly and tightly in her\r\narms, and slowly one tear after another fell on his wondering,\r\nunconscious face; and gradually she seemed, and little by little, to\r\ngrow calmer, and busied herself with tending and nursing him.\r\n\r\nThe child, a boy of ten months, was uncommonly large and strong of his\r\nage, and very vigorous in his limbs. Never, for a moment, still, he\r\nkept his mother constantly busy in holding him, and guarding his\r\nspringing activity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fine chap!\xe2\x80\x9d said a man, suddenly stopping opposite to him,\r\nwith his hands in his pockets. \xe2\x80\x9cHow old is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen months and a half,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother.\r\n\r\nThe man whistled to the boy, and offered him part of a stick of candy,\r\nwhich he eagerly grabbed at, and very soon had it in a baby\xe2\x80\x99s general\r\ndepository, to wit, his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRum fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man \xe2\x80\x9cKnows what\xe2\x80\x99s what!\xe2\x80\x9d and he whistled, and\r\nwalked on. When he had got to the other side of the boat, he came\r\nacross Haley, who was smoking on top of a pile of boxes.\r\n\r\nThe stranger produced a match, and lighted a cigar, saying, as he did\r\nso,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecentish kind o\xe2\x80\x99 wench you\xe2\x80\x99ve got round there, stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I reckon she _is_ tol\xe2\x80\x99able fair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, blowing the smoke\r\nout of his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaking her down south?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\nHaley nodded, and smoked on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlantation hand?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fillin\xe2\x80\x99 out an order for a plantation, and I\r\nthink I shall put her in. They telled me she was a good cook; and they\r\ncan use her for that, or set her at the cotton-picking. She\xe2\x80\x99s got the\r\nright fingers for that; I looked at \xe2\x80\x99em. Sell well, either way;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nHaley resumed his cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t want the young \xe2\x80\x99un on the plantation,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall sell him, first chance I find,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, lighting another\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99pose you\xe2\x80\x99d be selling him tol\xe2\x80\x99able cheap,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger,\r\nmounting the pile of boxes, and sitting down comfortably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x99bout that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty smart young \xe2\x80\x99un,\r\nstraight, fat, strong; flesh as hard as a brick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, but then there\xe2\x80\x99s the bother and expense of raisin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley; \xe2\x80\x9cthey is raised as easy as any kind of critter\r\nthere is going; they an\xe2\x80\x99t a bit more trouble than pups. This yer chap\r\nwill be running all around, in a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good place for raisin\xe2\x80\x99, and I thought of takin\xe2\x80\x99 in a little\r\nmore stock,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cOne cook lost a young \xe2\x80\x99un last week,\xe2\x80\x94got\r\ndrownded in a washtub, while she was a hangin\xe2\x80\x99 out the clothes,\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nreckon it would be well enough to set her to raisin\xe2\x80\x99 this yer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaley and the stranger smoked a while in silence, neither seeming\r\nwilling to broach the test question of the interview. At last the man\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of wantin\xe2\x80\x99 more than ten dollars for that ar chap,\r\nseeing you _must_ get him off yer hand, any how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaley shook his head, and spit impressively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t do, no ways,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and began his smoking again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, stranger, what will you take?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, \xe2\x80\x9cI _could_ raise that ar chap myself, or get\r\nhim raised; he\xe2\x80\x99s oncommon likely and healthy, and he\xe2\x80\x99d fetch a hundred\r\ndollars, six months hence; and, in a year or two, he\xe2\x80\x99d bring two\r\nhundred, if I had him in the right spot; I shan\xe2\x80\x99t take a cent less nor\r\nfifty for him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, stranger! that\xe2\x80\x99s rediculous, altogether,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFact!\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, with a decisive nod of his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give thirty for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not a cent more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell ye what I will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, spitting again, with\r\nrenewed decision. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll split the difference, and say forty-five; and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the most I will do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, agreed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, after an interval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you land?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Louisville,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouisville,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley. \xe2\x80\x9cVery fair, we get there about dusk. Chap\r\nwill be asleep,\xe2\x80\x94all fair,\xe2\x80\x94get him off quietly, and no\r\nscreaming,\xe2\x80\x94happens beautiful,\xe2\x80\x94I like to do everything quietly,\xe2\x80\x94I hates\r\nall kind of agitation and fluster.\xe2\x80\x9d And so, after a transfer of certain\r\nbills had passed from the man\xe2\x80\x99s pocket-book to the trader\xe2\x80\x99s, he resumed\r\nhis cigar.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright, tranquil evening when the boat stopped at the wharf at\r\nLouisville. The woman had been sitting with her baby in her arms, now\r\nwrapped in a heavy sleep. When she heard the name of the place called\r\nout, she hastily laid the child down in a little cradle formed by the\r\nhollow among the boxes, first carefully spreading under it her cloak;\r\nand then she sprung to the side of the boat, in hopes that, among the\r\nvarious hotel-waiters who thronged the wharf, she might see her\r\nhusband. In this hope, she pressed forward to the front rails, and,\r\nstretching far over them, strained her eyes intently on the moving\r\nheads on the shore, and the crowd pressed in between her and the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow\xe2\x80\x99s your time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, taking the sleeping child up, and\r\nhanding him to the stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t wake him up, and set him to crying,\r\nnow; it would make a devil of a fuss with the gal.\xe2\x80\x9d The man took the\r\nbundle carefully, and was soon lost in the crowd that went up the\r\nwharf.\r\n\r\nWhen the boat, creaking, and groaning, and puffing, had loosed from the\r\nwharf, and was beginning slowly to strain herself along, the woman\r\nreturned to her old seat. The trader was sitting there,\xe2\x80\x94the child was\r\ngone!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, why,\xe2\x80\x94where?\xe2\x80\x9d she began, in bewildered surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader, \xe2\x80\x9cyour child\xe2\x80\x99s gone; you may as well know it\r\nfirst as last. You see, I know\xe2\x80\x99d you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take him down south; and\r\nI got a chance to sell him to a first-rate family, that\xe2\x80\x99ll raise him\r\nbetter than you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trader had arrived at that stage of Christian and political\r\nperfection which has been recommended by some preachers and politicians\r\nof the north, lately, in which he had completely overcome every humane\r\nweakness and prejudice. His heart was exactly where yours, sir, and\r\nmine could be brought, with proper effort and cultivation. The wild\r\nlook of anguish and utter despair that the woman cast on him might have\r\ndisturbed one less practised; but he was used to it. He had seen that\r\nsame look hundreds of times. You can get used to such things, too, my\r\nfriend; and it is the great object of recent efforts to make our whole\r\nnorthern community used to them, for the glory of the Union. So the\r\ntrader only regarded the mortal anguish which he saw working in those\r\ndark features, those clenched hands, and suffocating breathings, as\r\nnecessary incidents of the trade, and merely calculated whether she was\r\ngoing to scream, and get up a commotion on the boat; for, like other\r\nsupporters of our peculiar institution, he decidedly disliked\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\nBut the woman did not scream. The shot had passed too straight and\r\ndirect through the heart, for cry or tear.\r\n\r\nDizzily she sat down. Her slack hands fell lifeless by her side. Her\r\neyes looked straight forward, but she saw nothing. All the noise and\r\nhum of the boat, the groaning of the machinery, mingled dreamily to her\r\nbewildered ear; and the poor, dumb-stricken heart had neither cry not\r\ntear to show for its utter misery. She was quite calm.\r\n\r\nThe trader, who, considering his advantages, was almost as humane as\r\nsome of our politicians, seemed to feel called on to administer such\r\nconsolation as the case admitted of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know this yer comes kinder hard, at first, Lucy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut such\r\na smart, sensible gal as you are, won\xe2\x80\x99t give way to it. You see it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_necessary_, and can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! don\xe2\x80\x99t, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, with a voice like one that is\r\nsmothering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a smart wench, Lucy,\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted; \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to do well by ye,\r\nand get ye a nice place down river; and you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon get another\r\nhusband,\xe2\x80\x94such a likely gal as you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, if you _only_ won\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, in a\r\nvoice of such quick and living anguish that the trader felt that there\r\nwas something at present in the case beyond his style of operation. He\r\ngot up, and the woman turned away, and buried her head in her cloak.\r\n\r\nThe trader walked up and down for a time, and occasionally stopped and\r\nlooked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTakes it hard, rather,\xe2\x80\x9d he soliloquized, \xe2\x80\x9cbut quiet, tho\xe2\x80\x99;\xe2\x80\x94let her\r\nsweat a while; she\xe2\x80\x99ll come right, by and by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom had watched the whole transaction from first to last, and had a\r\nperfect understanding of its results. To him, it looked like something\r\nunutterably horrible and cruel, because, poor, ignorant black soul! he\r\nhad not learned to generalize, and to take enlarged views. If he had\r\nonly been instructed by certain ministers of Christianity, he might\r\nhave thought better of it, and seen in it an every-day incident of a\r\nlawful trade; a trade which is the vital support of an institution\r\nwhich an American divine[2] tells us has _\xe2\x80\x9cno evils but such as are\r\ninseparable from any other relations in social and domestic life_.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nTom, as we see, being a poor, ignorant fellow, whose reading had been\r\nconfined entirely to the New Testament, could not comfort and solace\r\nhimself with views like these. His very soul bled within him for what\r\nseemed to him the _wrongs_ of the poor suffering thing that lay like a\r\ncrushed reed on the boxes; the feeling, living, bleeding, yet immortal\r\n_thing_, which American state law coolly classes with the bundles, and\r\nbales, and boxes, among which she is lying.\r\n\r\n [2] Dr. Joel Parker of Philadelphia. [Mrs. Stowe\xe2\x80\x99s note.] Presbyterian\r\n clergyman (1798-1873), a friend of the Beecher family. Mrs. Stowe\r\n attempted unsuccessfully to have this identifying note removed from\r\n the stereotype-plate of the first edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTom drew near, and tried to say something; but she only groaned.\r\nHonestly, and with tears running down his own cheeks, he spoke of a\r\nheart of love in the skies, of a pitying Jesus, and an eternal home;\r\nbut the ear was deaf with anguish, and the palsied heart could not\r\nfeel.\r\n\r\nNight came on,\xe2\x80\x94night calm, unmoved, and glorious, shining down with her\r\ninnumerable and solemn angel eyes, twinkling, beautiful, but silent.\r\nThere was no speech nor language, no pitying voice or helping hand,\r\nfrom that distant sky. One after another, the voices of business or\r\npleasure died away; all on the boat were sleeping, and the ripples at\r\nthe prow were plainly heard. Tom stretched himself out on a box, and\r\nthere, as he lay, he heard, ever and anon, a smothered sob or cry from\r\nthe prostrate creature,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cO! what shall I do? O Lord! O good Lord, do\r\nhelp me!\xe2\x80\x9d and so, ever and anon, until the murmur died away in silence.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, Tom waked, with a sudden start. Something black passed\r\nquickly by him to the side of the boat, and he heard a splash in the\r\nwater. No one else saw or heard anything. He raised his head,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s place was vacant! He got up, and sought about him in vain. The\r\npoor bleeding heart was still, at last, and the river rippled and\r\ndimpled just as brightly as if it had not closed above it.\r\n\r\nPatience! patience! ye whose hearts swell indignant at wrongs like\r\nthese. Not one throb of anguish, not one tear of the oppressed, is\r\nforgotten by the Man of Sorrows, the Lord of Glory. In his patient,\r\ngenerous bosom he bears the anguish of a world. Bear thou, like him, in\r\npatience, and labor in love; for sure as he is God, \xe2\x80\x9cthe year of his\r\nredeemed _shall_ come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trader waked up bright and early, and came out to see to his live\r\nstock. It was now his turn to look about in perplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere alive is that gal?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Tom.\r\n\r\nTom, who had learned the wisdom of keeping counsel, did not feel called\r\nupon to state his observations and suspicions, but said he did not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe surely couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have got off in the night at any of the landings,\r\nfor I was awake, and on the lookout, whenever the boat stopped. I never\r\ntrust these yer things to other folks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech was addressed to Tom quite confidentially, as if it was\r\nsomething that would be specially interesting to him. Tom made no\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nThe trader searched the boat from stem to stern, among boxes, bales and\r\nbarrels, around the machinery, by the chimneys, in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I say, Tom, be fair about this yer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when, after a\r\nfruitless search, he came where Tom was standing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know something\r\nabout it, now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me,\xe2\x80\x94I know you do. I saw the gal stretched\r\nout here about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and ag\xe2\x80\x99in at twelve, and ag\xe2\x80\x99in between one\r\nand two; and then at four she was gone, and you was a sleeping right\r\nthere all the time. Now, you know something,\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9ctowards morning something brushed by me, and\r\nI kinder half woke; and then I hearn a great splash, and then I clare\r\nwoke up, and the gal was gone. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I know on \xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trader was not shocked nor amazed; because, as we said before, he\r\nwas used to a great many things that you are not used to. Even the\r\nawful presence of Death struck no solemn chill upon him. He had seen\r\nDeath many times,\xe2\x80\x94met him in the way of trade, and got acquainted with\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x94and he only thought of him as a hard customer, that embarrassed\r\nhis property operations very unfairly; and so he only swore that the\r\ngal was a baggage, and that he was devilish unlucky, and that, if\r\nthings went on in this way, he should not make a cent on the trip. In\r\nshort, he seemed to consider himself an ill-used man, decidedly; but\r\nthere was no help for it, as the woman had escaped into a state which\r\n_never will_ give up a fugitive,\xe2\x80\x94not even at the demand of the whole\r\nglorious Union. The trader, therefore, sat discontentedly down, with\r\nhis little account-book, and put down the missing body and soul under\r\nthe head of _losses!_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a shocking creature, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he,\xe2\x80\x94this trader? so unfeeling! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndreadful, really!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, but nobody thinks anything of these traders! They are universally\r\ndespised,\xe2\x80\x94never received into any decent society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut who, sir, makes the trader? Who is most to blame? The enlightened,\r\ncultivated, intelligent man, who supports the system of which the\r\ntrader is the inevitable result, or the poor trader himself? You make\r\nthe public statement that calls for his trade, that debauches and\r\ndepraves him, till he feels no shame in it; and in what are you better\r\nthan he?\r\n\r\nAre you educated and he ignorant, you high and he low, you refined and\r\nhe coarse, you talented and he simple?\r\n\r\nIn the day of a future judgment, these very considerations may make it\r\nmore tolerable for him than for you.\r\n\r\nIn concluding these little incidents of lawful trade, we must beg the\r\nworld not to think that American legislators are entirely destitute of\r\nhumanity, as might, perhaps, be unfairly inferred from the great\r\nefforts made in our national body to protect and perpetuate this\r\nspecies of traffic.\r\n\r\nWho does not know how our great men are outdoing themselves, in\r\ndeclaiming against the _foreign_ slave-trade. There are a perfect host\r\nof Clarksons and Wilberforces[3] risen up among us on that subject,\r\nmost edifying to hear and behold. Trading negroes from Africa, dear\r\nreader, is so horrid! It is not to be thought of! But trading them from\r\nKentucky,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s quite another thing!\r\n\r\n [3] Thomas Clarkson (1760-1846) and William Wilberforce (1759- 1833),\r\n English philanthropists and anti-slavery agitators who helped to\r\n secure passage of the Emancipation Bill by Parliament in 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nThe Quaker Settlement\r\n\r\n\r\nA quiet scene now rises before us. A large, roomy, neatly-painted\r\nkitchen, its yellow floor glossy and smooth, and without a particle of\r\ndust; a neat, well-blacked cooking-stove; rows of shining tin,\r\nsuggestive of unmentionable good things to the appetite; glossy green\r\nwood chairs, old and firm; a small flag-bottomed rocking-chair, with a\r\npatch-work cushion in it, neatly contrived out of small pieces of\r\ndifferent colored woollen goods, and a larger sized one, motherly and\r\nold, whose wide arms breathed hospitable invitation, seconded by the\r\nsolicitation of its feather cushions,\xe2\x80\x94a real comfortable, persuasive\r\nold chair, and worth, in the way of honest, homely enjoyment, a dozen\r\nof your plush or _brochetelle_ drawing-room gentry; and in the chair,\r\ngently swaying back and forward, her eyes bent on some fine sewing, sat\r\nour fine old friend Eliza. Yes, there she is, paler and thinner than in\r\nher Kentucky home, with a world of quiet sorrow lying under the shadow\r\nof her long eyelashes, and marking the outline of her gentle mouth! It\r\nwas plain to see how old and firm the girlish heart was grown under the\r\ndiscipline of heavy sorrow; and when, anon, her large dark eye was\r\nraised to follow the gambols of her little Harry, who was sporting,\r\nlike some tropical butterfly, hither and thither over the floor, she\r\nshowed a depth of firmness and steady resolve that was never there in\r\nher earlier and happier days.\r\n\r\nBy her side sat a woman with a bright tin pan in her lap, into which\r\nshe was carefully sorting some dried peaches. She might be fifty-five\r\nor sixty; but hers was one of those faces that time seems to touch only\r\nto brighten and adorn. The snowy lisse crape cap, made after the strait\r\nQuaker pattern,\xe2\x80\x94the plain white muslin handkerchief, lying in placid\r\nfolds across her bosom,\xe2\x80\x94the drab shawl and dress,\xe2\x80\x94showed at once the\r\ncommunity to which she belonged. Her face was round and rosy, with a\r\nhealthful downy softness, suggestive of a ripe peach. Her hair,\r\npartially silvered by age, was parted smoothly back from a high placid\r\nforehead, on which time had written no inscription, except peace on\r\nearth, good will to men, and beneath shone a large pair of clear,\r\nhonest, loving brown eyes; you only needed to look straight into them,\r\nto feel that you saw to the bottom of a heart as good and true as ever\r\nthrobbed in woman\xe2\x80\x99s bosom. So much has been said and sung of beautiful\r\nyoung girls, why don\xe2\x80\x99t somebody wake up to the beauty of old women? If\r\nany want to get up an inspiration under this head, we refer them to our\r\ngood friend Rachel Halliday, just as she sits there in her little\r\nrocking-chair. It had a turn for quacking and squeaking,\xe2\x80\x94that chair\r\nhad,\xe2\x80\x94either from having taken cold in early life, or from some\r\nasthmatic affection, or perhaps from nervous derangement; but, as she\r\ngently swung backward and forward, the chair kept up a kind of subdued\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccreechy crawchy,\xe2\x80\x9d that would have been intolerable in any other chair.\r\nBut old Simeon Halliday often declared it was as good as any music to\r\nhim, and the children all avowed that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t miss of hearing\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s chair for anything in the world. For why? for twenty years or\r\nmore, nothing but loving words, and gentle moralities, and motherly\r\nloving kindness, had come from that chair;\xe2\x80\x94head-aches and heart-aches\r\ninnumerable had been cured there,\xe2\x80\x94difficulties spiritual and temporal\r\nsolved there,\xe2\x80\x94all by one good, loving woman, God bless her!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so thee still thinks of going to Canada, Eliza?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she\r\nwas quietly looking over her peaches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go onward. I dare not stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99ll thee do, when thee gets there? Thee must think about that,\r\nmy daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter\xe2\x80\x9d came naturally from the lips of Rachel Halliday; for hers\r\nwas just the face and form that made \xe2\x80\x9cmother\xe2\x80\x9d seem the most natural\r\nword in the world.\r\n\r\nEliza\xe2\x80\x99s hands trembled, and some tears fell on her fine work; but she\r\nanswered, firmly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall do\xe2\x80\x94anything I can find. I hope I can find something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee knows thee can stay here, as long as thee pleases,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she pointed to Harry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep\r\nnights; I can\xe2\x80\x99t rest. Last night I dreamed I saw that man coming into\r\nthe yard,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shuddering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, wiping her eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cbut thee mustn\xe2\x80\x99t feel so.\r\nThe Lord hath ordered it so that never hath a fugitive been stolen from\r\nour village. I trust thine will not be the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door here opened, and a little short, round, pin-cushiony woman\r\nstood at the door, with a cheery, blooming face, like a ripe apple. She\r\nwas dressed, like Rachel, in sober gray, with the muslin folded neatly\r\nacross her round, plump little chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuth Stedman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, coming joyfully forward; \xe2\x80\x9chow is thee,\r\nRuth? she said, heartily taking both her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth, taking off her little drab bonnet, and dusting it\r\nwith her handkerchief, displaying, as she did so, a round little head,\r\non which the Quaker cap sat with a sort of jaunty air, despite all the\r\nstroking and patting of the small fat hands, which were busily applied\r\nto arranging it. Certain stray locks of decidedly curly hair, too, had\r\nescaped here and there, and had to be coaxed and cajoled into their\r\nplace again; and then the new comer, who might have been\r\nfive-and-twenty, turned from the small looking-glass, before which she\r\nhad been making these arrangements, and looked well pleased,\xe2\x80\x94as most\r\npeople who looked at her might have been,\xe2\x80\x94for she was decidedly a\r\nwholesome, whole-hearted, chirruping little woman, as ever gladdened\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s heart withal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuth, this friend is Eliza Harris; and this is the little boy I told\r\nthee of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to see thee, Eliza,\xe2\x80\x94very,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth, shaking hands, as if\r\nEliza were an old friend she had long been expecting; \xe2\x80\x9cand this is thy\r\ndear boy,\xe2\x80\x94I brought a cake for him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, holding out a little\r\nheart to the boy, who came up, gazing through his curls, and accepted\r\nit shyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s thy baby, Ruth?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, he\xe2\x80\x99s coming; but thy Mary caught him as I came in, and ran off with\r\nhim to the barn, to show him to the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the door opened, and Mary, an honest, rosy-looking\r\ngirl, with large brown eyes, like her mother\xe2\x80\x99s, came in with the baby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, coming up, and taking the great, white, fat\r\nfellow in her arms, \xe2\x80\x9chow good he looks, and how he does grow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, he does,\xe2\x80\x9d said little bustling Ruth, as she took the\r\nchild, and began taking off a little blue silk hood, and various layers\r\nand wrappers of outer garments; and having given a twitch here, and a\r\npull there, and variously adjusted and arranged him, and kissed him\r\nheartily, she set him on the floor to collect his thoughts. Baby seemed\r\nquite used to this mode of proceeding, for he put his thumb in his\r\nmouth (as if it were quite a thing of course), and seemed soon absorbed\r\nin his own reflections, while the mother seated herself, and taking out\r\na long stocking of mixed blue and white yarn, began to knit with\r\nbriskness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary, thee\xe2\x80\x99d better fill the kettle, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thee?\xe2\x80\x9d gently suggested\r\nthe mother.\r\n\r\nMary took the kettle to the well, and soon reappearing, placed it over\r\nthe stove, where it was soon purring and steaming, a sort of censer of\r\nhospitality and good cheer. The peaches, moreover, in obedience to a\r\nfew gentle whispers from Rachel, were soon deposited, by the same hand,\r\nin a stew-pan over the fire.\r\n\r\nRachel now took down a snowy moulding-board, and, tying on an apron,\r\nproceeded quietly to making up some biscuits, first saying to\r\nMary,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMary, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thee better tell John to get a chicken ready?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nMary disappeared accordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is Abigail Peters?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, as she went on with her\r\nbiscuits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, she\xe2\x80\x99s better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth; \xe2\x80\x9cI was in, this morning; made the bed,\r\ntidied up the house. Leah Hills went in, this afternoon, and baked\r\nbread and pies enough to last some days; and I engaged to go back to\r\nget her up, this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go in tomorrow, and do any cleaning there may be, and look over\r\nthe mending,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that is well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Hannah\r\nStanwood is sick. John was up there, last night,\xe2\x80\x94I must go there\r\ntomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn can come in here to his meals, if thee needs to stay all day,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsuggested Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank thee, Rachel; will see, tomorrow; but, here comes Simeon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimeon Halliday, a tall, straight, muscular man, in drab coat and\r\npantaloons, and broad-brimmed hat, now entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is thee, Ruth?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, warmly, as he spread his broad open hand\r\nfor her little fat palm; \xe2\x80\x9cand how is John?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! John is well, and all the rest of our folks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth, cheerily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny news, father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, as she was putting her biscuits into\r\nthe oven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Stebbins told me that they should be along tonight, with\r\n_friends_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon, significantly, as he was washing his hands at\r\na neat sink, in a little back porch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, looking thoughtfully, and glancing at Eliza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid thee say thy name was Harris?\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon to Eliza, as he\r\nreentered.\r\n\r\nRachel glanced quickly at her husband, as Eliza tremulously answered\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyes;\xe2\x80\x9d her fears, ever uppermost, suggesting that possibly there might\r\nbe advertisements out for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother!\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon, standing in the porch, and calling Rachel out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does thee want, father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, rubbing her floury hands,\r\nas she went into the porch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis child\xe2\x80\x99s husband is in the settlement, and will be here tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Simeon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, thee doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say that, father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, all her face radiant\r\nwith joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really true. Peter was down yesterday, with the wagon, to the\r\nother stand, and there he found an old woman and two men; and one said\r\nhis name was George Harris; and from what he told of his history, I am\r\ncertain who he is. He is a bright, likely fellow, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we tell her now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s tell Ruth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Ruth,\xe2\x80\x94come here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth laid down her knitting-work, and was in the back porch in a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuth, what does thee think?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cFather says Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s husband\r\nis in the last company, and will be here tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA burst of joy from the little Quakeress interrupted the speech. She\r\ngave such a bound from the floor, as she clapped her little hands, that\r\ntwo stray curls fell from under her Quaker cap, and lay brightly on her\r\nwhite neckerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush thee, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, gently; \xe2\x80\x9chush, Ruth! Tell us, shall we\r\ntell her now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow! to be sure,\xe2\x80\x94this very minute. Why, now, suppose \xe2\x80\x99t was my John,\r\nhow should I feel? Do tell her, right off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee uses thyself only to learn how to love thy neighbor, Ruth,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSimeon, looking, with a beaming face, on Ruth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it what we are made for? If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t love John and\r\nthe baby, I should not know how to feel for her. Come, now do tell\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x94do!\xe2\x80\x9d and she laid her hands persuasively on Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cTake\r\nher into thy bed-room, there, and let me fry the chicken while thee\r\ndoes it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel came out into the kitchen, where Eliza was sewing, and opening\r\nthe door of a small bed-room, said, gently, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in here with me, my\r\ndaughter; I have news to tell thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blood flushed in Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s pale face; she rose, trembling with\r\nnervous anxiety, and looked towards her boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Ruth, darting up, and seizing her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cNever\r\nthee fear; it\xe2\x80\x99s good news, Eliza,\xe2\x80\x94go in, go in!\xe2\x80\x9d And she gently pushed\r\nher to the door which closed after her; and then, turning round, she\r\ncaught little Harry in her arms, and began kissing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee\xe2\x80\x99ll see thy father, little one. Does thee know it? Thy father is\r\ncoming,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, over and over again, as the boy looked wonderingly\r\nat her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, within the door, another scene was going on. Rachel Halliday\r\ndrew Eliza toward her, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord hath had mercy on thee,\r\ndaughter; thy husband hath escaped from the house of bondage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blood flushed to Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s cheek in a sudden glow, and went back to\r\nher heart with as sudden a rush. She sat down, pale and faint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave courage, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, laying her hand on her head. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is\r\namong friends, who will bring him here tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTonight!\xe2\x80\x9d Eliza repeated, \xe2\x80\x9ctonight!\xe2\x80\x9d The words lost all meaning to\r\nher; her head was dreamy and confused; all was mist for a moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke, she found herself snugly tucked up on the bed, with a\r\nblanket over her, and little Ruth rubbing her hands with camphor. She\r\nopened her eyes in a state of dreamy, delicious languor, such as one\r\nwho has long been bearing a heavy load, and now feels it gone, and\r\nwould rest. The tension of the nerves, which had never ceased a moment\r\nsince the first hour of her flight, had given way, and a strange\r\nfeeling of security and rest came over her; and as she lay, with her\r\nlarge, dark eyes open, she followed, as in a quiet dream, the motions\r\nof those about her. She saw the door open into the other room; saw the\r\nsupper-table, with its snowy cloth; heard the dreamy murmur of the\r\nsinging tea-kettle; saw Ruth tripping backward and forward, with plates\r\nof cake and saucers of preserves, and ever and anon stopping to put a\r\ncake into Harry\xe2\x80\x99s hand, or pat his head, or twine his long curls round\r\nher snowy fingers. She saw the ample, motherly form of Rachel, as she\r\never and anon came to the bedside, and smoothed and arranged something\r\nabout the bedclothes, and gave a tuck here and there, by way of\r\nexpressing her good-will; and was conscious of a kind of sunshine\r\nbeaming down upon her from her large, clear, brown eyes. She saw Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhusband come in,\xe2\x80\x94saw her fly up to him, and commence whispering very\r\nearnestly, ever and anon, with impressive gesture, pointing her little\r\nfinger toward the room. She saw her, with the baby in her arms, sitting\r\ndown to tea; she saw them all at table, and little Harry in a high\r\nchair, under the shadow of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s ample wing; there were low murmurs\r\nof talk, gentle tinkling of tea-spoons, and musical clatter of cups and\r\nsaucers, and all mingled in a delightful dream of rest; and Eliza\r\nslept, as she had not slept before, since the fearful midnight hour\r\nwhen she had taken her child and fled through the frosty starlight.\r\n\r\nShe dreamed of a beautiful country,\xe2\x80\x94a land, it seemed to her, of\r\nrest,\xe2\x80\x94green shores, pleasant islands, and beautifully glittering water;\r\nand there, in a house which kind voices told her was a home, she saw\r\nher boy playing, free and happy child. She heard her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfootsteps; she felt him coming nearer; his arms were around her, his\r\ntears falling on her face, and she awoke! It was no dream. The daylight\r\nhad long faded; her child lay calmly sleeping by her side; a candle was\r\nburning dimly on the stand, and her husband was sobbing by her pillow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning was a cheerful one at the Quaker house. \xe2\x80\x9cMother\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nup betimes, and surrounded by busy girls and boys, whom we had scarce\r\ntime to introduce to our readers yesterday, and who all moved\r\nobediently to Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s gentle \xe2\x80\x9cThee had better,\xe2\x80\x9d or more gentle \xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthee better?\xe2\x80\x9d in the work of getting breakfast; for a breakfast in the\r\nluxurious valleys of Indiana is a thing complicated and multiform, and,\r\nlike picking up the rose-leaves and trimming the bushes in Paradise,\r\nasking other hands than those of the original mother. While, therefore,\r\nJohn ran to the spring for fresh water, and Simeon the second sifted\r\nmeal for corn-cakes, and Mary ground coffee, Rachel moved gently, and\r\nquietly about, making biscuits, cutting up chicken, and diffusing a\r\nsort of sunny radiance over the whole proceeding generally. If there\r\nwas any danger of friction or collision from the ill-regulated zeal of\r\nso many young operators, her gentle \xe2\x80\x9cCome! come!\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas quite sufficient to allay the difficulty. Bards have written of the\r\ncestus of Venus, that turned the heads of all the world in successive\r\ngenerations. We had rather, for our part, have the cestus of Rachel\r\nHalliday, that kept heads from being turned, and made everything go on\r\nharmoniously. We think it is more suited to our modern days, decidedly.\r\n\r\nWhile all other preparations were going on, Simeon the elder stood in\r\nhis shirt-sleeves before a little looking-glass in the corner, engaged\r\nin the anti-patriarchal operation of shaving. Everything went on so\r\nsociably, so quietly, so harmoniously, in the great kitchen,\xe2\x80\x94it seemed\r\nso pleasant to every one to do just what they were doing, there was\r\nsuch an atmosphere of mutual confidence and good fellowship\r\neverywhere,\xe2\x80\x94even the knives and forks had a social clatter as they went\r\non to the table; and the chicken and ham had a cheerful and joyous\r\nfizzle in the pan, as if they rather enjoyed being cooked than\r\notherwise;\xe2\x80\x94and when George and Eliza and little Harry came out, they\r\nmet such a hearty, rejoicing welcome, no wonder it seemed to them like\r\na dream.\r\n\r\nAt last, they were all seated at breakfast, while Mary stood at the\r\nstove, baking griddle-cakes, which, as they gained the true exact\r\ngolden-brown tint of perfection, were transferred quite handily to the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nRachel never looked so truly and benignly happy as at the head of her\r\ntable. There was so much motherliness and full-heartedness even in the\r\nway she passed a plate of cakes or poured a cup of coffee, that it\r\nseemed to put a spirit into the food and drink she offered.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that ever George had sat down on equal terms at\r\nany white man\xe2\x80\x99s table; and he sat down, at first, with some constraint\r\nand awkwardness; but they all exhaled and went off like fog, in the\r\ngenial morning rays of this simple, overflowing kindness.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, was a home,\xe2\x80\x94_home_,\xe2\x80\x94a word that George had never yet\r\nknown a meaning for; and a belief in God, and trust in his providence,\r\nbegan to encircle his heart, as, with a golden cloud of protection and\r\nconfidence, dark, misanthropic, pining atheistic doubts, and fierce\r\ndespair, melted away before the light of a living Gospel, breathed in\r\nliving faces, preached by a thousand unconscious acts of love and good\r\nwill, which, like the cup of cold water given in the name of a\r\ndisciple, shall never lose their reward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, what if thee should get found out again?\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon second,\r\nas he buttered his cake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should pay my fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what if they put thee in prison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t thee and mother manage the farm?\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother can do almost everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a shame\r\nto make such laws?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee mustn\xe2\x80\x99t speak evil of thy rulers, Simeon,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father,\r\ngravely. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord only gives us our worldly goods that we may do\r\njustice and mercy; if our rulers require a price of us for it, we must\r\ndeliver it up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hate those old slaveholders!\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, who felt as\r\nunchristian as became any modern reformer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am surprised at thee, son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon; \xe2\x80\x9cthy mother never taught\r\nthee so. I would do even the same for the slaveholder as for the slave,\r\nif the Lord brought him to my door in affliction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimeon second blushed scarlet; but his mother only smiled, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimeon is my good boy; he will grow older, by and by, and then he will\r\nbe like his father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope, my good sir, that you are not exposed to any difficulty on our\r\naccount,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFear nothing, George, for therefore are we sent into the world. If we\r\nwould not meet trouble for a good cause, we were not worthy of our\r\nname.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, for _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cI could not bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFear not, then, friend George; it is not for thee, but for God and\r\nman, we do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now thou must lie by quietly this\r\nday, and tonight, at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Phineas Fletcher will carry thee\r\nonward to the next stand,\xe2\x80\x94thee and the rest of thy company. The\r\npursuers are hard after thee; we must not delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that is the case, why wait till evening?\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art safe here by daylight, for every one in the settlement is a\r\nFriend, and all are watching. It has been found safer to travel by\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nEvangeline\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young star! which shone\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er life\xe2\x80\x94too sweet an image, for such glass!\r\nA lovely being, scarcely formed or moulded;\r\nA rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi! How, as by an enchanted wand, have its scenes been\r\nchanged, since Chateaubriand wrote his prose-poetic description of\r\nit,[1] as a river of mighty, unbroken solitudes, rolling amid undreamed\r\nwonders of vegetable and animal existence.\r\n\r\n [1] _In Atala; or the Love and Constantcy of Two Savages in the\r\n Desert_ (1801) by Francois Auguste Rene, Vicomte de Chateaubriand\r\n (1768-1848).\r\n\r\n\r\nBut as in an hour, this river of dreams and wild romance has emerged to\r\na reality scarcely less visionary and splendid. What other river of the\r\nworld bears on its bosom to the ocean the wealth and enterprise of such\r\nanother country?\xe2\x80\x94a country whose products embrace all between the\r\ntropics and the poles! Those turbid waters, hurrying, foaming, tearing\r\nalong, an apt resemblance of that headlong tide of business which is\r\npoured along its wave by a race more vehement and energetic than any\r\nthe old world ever saw. Ah! would that they did not also bear along a\r\nmore fearful freight,\xe2\x80\x94the tears of the oppressed, the sighs of the\r\nhelpless, the bitter prayers of poor, ignorant hearts to an unknown\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x94unknown, unseen and silent, but who will yet \xe2\x80\x9ccome out of his place\r\nto save all the poor of the earth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe slanting light of the setting sun quivers on the sea-like expanse\r\nof the river; the shivery canes, and the tall, dark cypress, hung with\r\nwreaths of dark, funereal moss, glow in the golden ray, as the\r\nheavily-laden steamboat marches onward.\r\n\r\nPiled with cotton-bales, from many a plantation, up over deck and\r\nsides, till she seems in the distance a square, massive block of gray,\r\nshe moves heavily onward to the nearing mart. We must look some time\r\namong its crowded decks before we shall find again our humble friend\r\nTom. High on the upper deck, in a little nook among the everywhere\r\npredominant cotton-bales, at last we may find him.\r\n\r\nPartly from confidence inspired by Mr. Shelby\xe2\x80\x99s representations, and\r\npartly from the remarkably inoffensive and quiet character of the man,\r\nTom had insensibly won his way far into the confidence even of such a\r\nman as Haley.\r\n\r\nAt first he had watched him narrowly through the day, and never allowed\r\nhim to sleep at night unfettered; but the uncomplaining patience and\r\napparent contentment of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s manner led him gradually to discontinue\r\nthese restraints, and for some time Tom had enjoyed a sort of parole of\r\nhonor, being permitted to come and go freely where he pleased on the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nEver quiet and obliging, and more than ready to lend a hand in every\r\nemergency which occurred among the workmen below, he had won the good\r\nopinion of all the hands, and spent many hours in helping them with as\r\nhearty a good will as ever he worked on a Kentucky farm.\r\n\r\nWhen there seemed to be nothing for him to do, he would climb to a nook\r\namong the cotton-bales of the upper deck, and busy himself in studying\r\nover his Bible,\xe2\x80\x94and it is there we see him now.\r\n\r\nFor a hundred or more miles above New Orleans, the river is higher than\r\nthe surrounding country, and rolls its tremendous volume between\r\nmassive levees twenty feet in height. The traveller from the deck of\r\nthe steamer, as from some floating castle top, overlooks the whole\r\ncountry for miles and miles around. Tom, therefore, had spread out full\r\nbefore him, in plantation after plantation, a map of the life to which\r\nhe was approaching.\r\n\r\nHe saw the distant slaves at their toil; he saw afar their villages of\r\nhuts gleaming out in long rows on many a plantation, distant from the\r\nstately mansions and pleasure-grounds of the master;\xe2\x80\x94and as the moving\r\npicture passed on, his poor, foolish heart would be turning backward to\r\nthe Kentucky farm, with its old shadowy beeches,\xe2\x80\x94to the master\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nwith its wide, cool halls, and, near by, the little cabin overgrown\r\nwith the multiflora and bignonia. There he seemed to see familiar faces\r\nof comrades who had grown up with him from infancy; he saw his busy\r\nwife, bustling in her preparations for his evening meals; he heard the\r\nmerry laugh of his boys at their play, and the chirrup of the baby at\r\nhis knee; and then, with a start, all faded, and he saw again the\r\ncanebrakes and cypresses and gliding plantations, and heard again the\r\ncreaking and groaning of the machinery, all telling him too plainly\r\nthat all that phase of life had gone by forever.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, you write to your wife, and send messages to your\r\nchildren; but Tom could not write,\xe2\x80\x94the mail for him had no existence,\r\nand the gulf of separation was unbridged by even a friendly word or\r\nsignal.\r\n\r\nIs it strange, then, that some tears fall on the pages of his Bible, as\r\nhe lays it on the cotton-bale, and, with patient finger, threading his\r\nslow way from word to word, traces out its promises? Having learned\r\nlate in life, Tom was but a slow reader, and passed on laboriously from\r\nverse to verse. Fortunate for him was it that the book he was intent on\r\nwas one which slow reading cannot injure,\xe2\x80\x94nay, one whose words, like\r\ningots of gold, seem often to need to be weighed separately, that the\r\nmind may take in their priceless value. Let us follow him a moment, as,\r\npointing to each word, and pronouncing each half aloud, he reads,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x94not\xe2\x80\x94your\xe2\x80\x94heart\xe2\x80\x94be\xe2\x80\x94troubled.\r\nIn\xe2\x80\x94my\xe2\x80\x94Father\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94house\xe2\x80\x94are\xe2\x80\x94many\xe2\x80\x94mansions.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94go\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94prepare\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94place\xe2\x80\x94for\xe2\x80\x94you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCicero, when he buried his darling and only daughter, had a heart as\r\nfull of honest grief as poor Tom\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x94perhaps no fuller, for both were\r\nonly men;\xe2\x80\x94but Cicero could pause over no such sublime words of hope,\r\nand look to no such future reunion; and if he _had_ seen them, ten to\r\none he would not have believed,\xe2\x80\x94he must fill his head first with a\r\nthousand questions of authenticity of manuscript, and correctness of\r\ntranslation. But, to poor Tom, there it lay, just what he needed, so\r\nevidently true and divine that the possibility of a question never\r\nentered his simple head. It must be true; for, if not true, how could\r\nhe live?\r\n\r\nAs for Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Bible, though it had no annotations and helps in margin\r\nfrom learned commentators, still it had been embellished with certain\r\nway-marks and guide-boards of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s own invention, and which helped him\r\nmore than the most learned expositions could have done. It had been his\r\ncustom to get the Bible read to him by his master\xe2\x80\x99s children, in\r\nparticular by young Master George; and, as they read, he would\r\ndesignate, by bold, strong marks and dashes, with pen and ink, the\r\npassages which more particularly gratified his ear or affected his\r\nheart. His Bible was thus marked through, from one end to the other,\r\nwith a variety of styles and designations; so he could in a moment\r\nseize upon his favorite passages, without the labor of spelling out\r\nwhat lay between them;\xe2\x80\x94and while it lay there before him, every passage\r\nbreathing of some old home scene, and recalling some past enjoyment,\r\nhis Bible seemed to him all of this life that remained, as well as the\r\npromise of a future one.\r\n\r\nAmong the passengers on the boat was a young gentleman of fortune and\r\nfamily, resident in New Orleans, who bore the name of St. Clare. He had\r\nwith him a daughter between five and six years of age, together with a\r\nlady who seemed to claim relationship to both, and to have the little\r\none especially under her charge.\r\n\r\nTom had often caught glimpses of this little girl,\xe2\x80\x94for she was one of\r\nthose busy, tripping creatures, that can be no more contained in one\r\nplace than a sunbeam or a summer breeze,\xe2\x80\x94nor was she one that, once\r\nseen, could be easily forgotten.\r\n\r\nHer form was the perfection of childish beauty, without its usual\r\nchubbiness and squareness of outline. There was about it an undulating\r\nand aerial grace, such as one might dream of for some mythic and\r\nallegorical being. Her face was remarkable less for its perfect beauty\r\nof feature than for a singular and dreamy earnestness of expression,\r\nwhich made the ideal start when they looked at her, and by which the\r\ndullest and most literal were impressed, without exactly knowing why.\r\nThe shape of her head and the turn of her neck and bust was peculiarly\r\nnoble, and the long golden-brown hair that floated like a cloud around\r\nit, the deep spiritual gravity of her violet blue eyes, shaded by heavy\r\nfringes of golden brown,\xe2\x80\x94all marked her out from other children, and\r\nmade every one turn and look after her, as she glided hither and\r\nthither on the boat. Nevertheless, the little one was not what you\r\nwould have called either a grave child or a sad one. On the contrary,\r\nan airy and innocent playfulness seemed to flicker like the shadow of\r\nsummer leaves over her childish face, and around her buoyant figure.\r\nShe was always in motion, always with a half smile on her rosy mouth,\r\nflying hither and thither, with an undulating and cloud-like tread,\r\nsinging to herself as she moved as in a happy dream. Her father and\r\nfemale guardian were incessantly busy in pursuit of her,\xe2\x80\x94but, when\r\ncaught, she melted from them again like a summer cloud; and as no word\r\nof chiding or reproof ever fell on her ear for whatever she chose to\r\ndo, she pursued her own way all over the boat. Always dressed in white,\r\nshe seemed to move like a shadow through all sorts of places, without\r\ncontracting spot or stain; and there was not a corner or nook, above or\r\nbelow, where those fairy footsteps had not glided, and that visionary\r\ngolden head, with its deep blue eyes, fleeted along.\r\n\r\nThe fireman, as he looked up from his sweaty toil, sometimes found\r\nthose eyes looking wonderingly into the raging depths of the furnace,\r\nand fearfully and pityingly at him, as if she thought him in some\r\ndreadful danger. Anon the steersman at the wheel paused and smiled, as\r\nthe picture-like head gleamed through the window of the round house,\r\nand in a moment was gone again. A thousand times a day rough voices\r\nblessed her, and smiles of unwonted softness stole over hard faces, as\r\nshe passed; and when she tripped fearlessly over dangerous places,\r\nrough, sooty hands were stretched involuntarily out to save her, and\r\nsmooth her path.\r\n\r\nTom, who had the soft, impressible nature of his kindly race, ever\r\nyearning toward the simple and childlike, watched the little creature\r\nwith daily increasing interest. To him she seemed something almost\r\ndivine; and whenever her golden head and deep blue eyes peered out upon\r\nhim from behind some dusky cotton-bale, or looked down upon him over\r\nsome ridge of packages, he half believed that he saw one of the angels\r\nstepped out of his New Testament.\r\n\r\nOften and often she walked mournfully round the place where Haley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngang of men and women sat in their chains. She would glide in among\r\nthem, and look at them with an air of perplexed and sorrowful\r\nearnestness; and sometimes she would lift their chains with her slender\r\nhands, and then sigh wofully, as she glided away. Several times she\r\nappeared suddenly among them, with her hands full of candy, nuts, and\r\noranges, which she would distribute joyfully to them, and then be gone\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTom watched the little lady a great deal, before he ventured on any\r\novertures towards acquaintanceship. He knew an abundance of simple acts\r\nto propitiate and invite the approaches of the little people, and he\r\nresolved to play his part right skilfully. He could cut cunning little\r\nbaskets out of cherry-stones, could make grotesque faces on\r\nhickory-nuts, or odd-jumping figures out of elder-pith, and he was a\r\nvery Pan in the manufacture of whistles of all sizes and sorts. His\r\npockets were full of miscellaneous articles of attraction, which he had\r\nhoarded in days of old for his master\xe2\x80\x99s children, and which he now\r\nproduced, with commendable prudence and economy, one by one, as\r\novertures for acquaintance and friendship.\r\n\r\nThe little one was shy, for all her busy interest in everything going\r\non, and it was not easy to tame her. For a while, she would perch like\r\na canary-bird on some box or package near Tom, while busy in the little\r\narts afore-named, and take from him, with a kind of grave bashfulness,\r\nthe little articles he offered. But at last they got on quite\r\nconfidential terms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s little missy\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, at last, when he thought\r\nmatters were ripe to push such an inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvangeline St. Clare,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little one, \xe2\x80\x9cthough papa and everybody\r\nelse call me Eva. Now, what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name\xe2\x80\x99s Tom; the little chil\xe2\x80\x99en used to call me Uncle Tom, way back\r\nthar in Kentuck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because, you see, I like you,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEva. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, Uncle Tom, where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Miss Eva.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am going to be sold to somebody. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy papa can buy you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, quickly; \xe2\x80\x9cand if he buys you, you will\r\nhave good times. I mean to ask him, this very day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my little lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\nThe boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and Eva,\r\nhearing her father\xe2\x80\x99s voice, bounded nimbly away. Tom rose up, and went\r\nforward to offer his service in wooding, and soon was busy among the\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nEva and her father were standing together by the railings to see the\r\nboat start from the landing-place, the wheel had made two or three\r\nrevolutions in the water, when, by some sudden movement, the little one\r\nsuddenly lost her balance and fell sheer over the side of the boat into\r\nthe water. Her father, scarce knowing what he did, was plunging in\r\nafter her, but was held back by some behind him, who saw that more\r\nefficient aid had followed his child.\r\n\r\nTom was standing just under her on the lower deck, as she fell. He saw\r\nher strike the water, and sink, and was after her in a moment. A\r\nbroad-chested, strong-armed fellow, it was nothing for him to keep\r\nafloat in the water, till, in a moment or two the child rose to the\r\nsurface, and he caught her in his arms, and, swimming with her to the\r\nboat-side, handed her up, all dripping, to the grasp of hundreds of\r\nhands, which, as if they had all belonged to one man, were stretched\r\neagerly out to receive her. A few moments more, and her father bore\r\nher, dripping and senseless, to the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 cabin, where, as is usual\r\nin cases of the kind, there ensued a very well-meaning and kind-hearted\r\nstrife among the female occupants generally, as to who should do the\r\nmost things to make a disturbance, and to hinder her recovery in every\r\nway possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a sultry, close day, the next day, as the steamer drew near to\r\nNew Orleans. A general bustle of expectation and preparation was spread\r\nthrough the boat; in the cabin, one and another were gathering their\r\nthings together, and arranging them, preparatory to going ashore. The\r\nsteward and chambermaid, and all, were busily engaged in cleaning,\r\nfurbishing, and arranging the splendid boat, preparatory to a grand\r\nentree.\r\n\r\nOn the lower deck sat our friend Tom, with his arms folded, and\r\nanxiously, from time to time, turning his eyes towards a group on the\r\nother side of the boat.\r\n\r\nThere stood the fair Evangeline, a little paler than the day before,\r\nbut otherwise exhibiting no traces of the accident which had befallen\r\nher. A graceful, elegantly-formed young man stood by her, carelessly\r\nleaning one elbow on a bale of cotton while a large pocket-book lay\r\nopen before him. It was quite evident, at a glance, that the gentleman\r\nwas Eva\xe2\x80\x99s father. There was the same noble cast of head, the same large\r\nblue eyes, the same golden-brown hair; yet the expression was wholly\r\ndifferent. In the large, clear blue eyes, though in form and color\r\nexactly similar, there was wanting that misty, dreamy depth of\r\nexpression; all was clear, bold, and bright, but with a light wholly of\r\nthis world: the beautifully cut mouth had a proud and somewhat\r\nsarcastic expression, while an air of free-and-easy superiority sat not\r\nungracefully in every turn and movement of his fine form. He was\r\nlistening, with a good-humored, negligent air, half comic, half\r\ncontemptuous, to Haley, who was very volubly expatiating on the quality\r\nof the article for which they were bargaining.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the moral and Christian virtues bound in black Morocco, complete!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, when Haley had finished. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, my good fellow, what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe damage, as they say in Kentucky; in short, what\xe2\x80\x99s to be paid out\r\nfor this business? How much are you going to cheat me, now? Out with\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, \xe2\x80\x9cif I should say thirteen hundred dollars for that\r\nar fellow, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t but just save myself; I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, now, re\xe2\x80\x99ly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, fixing his keen, mocking blue eye on\r\nhim; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99d let me have him for that, out of a particular\r\nregard for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the young lady here seems to be sot on him, and nat\xe2\x80\x99lly enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! certainly, there\xe2\x80\x99s a call on your benevolence, my friend. Now, as a\r\nmatter of Christian charity, how cheap could you afford to let him go,\r\nto oblige a young lady that\xe2\x80\x99s particular sot on him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, now, just think on \xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader; \xe2\x80\x9cjust look at them\r\nlimbs,\xe2\x80\x94broad-chested, strong as a horse. Look at his head; them high\r\nforrads allays shows calculatin niggers, that\xe2\x80\x99ll do any kind o\xe2\x80\x99 thing.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve, marked that ar. Now, a nigger of that ar heft and build is worth\r\nconsiderable, just as you may say, for his body, supposin he\xe2\x80\x99s stupid;\r\nbut come to put in his calculatin faculties, and them which I can show\r\nhe has oncommon, why, of course, it makes him come higher. Why, that ar\r\nfellow managed his master\xe2\x80\x99s whole farm. He has a strornary talent for\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad, bad, very bad; knows altogether too much!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man,\r\nwith the same mocking smile playing about his mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cNever will do, in\r\nthe world. Your smart fellows are always running off, stealing horses,\r\nand raising the devil generally. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take off a\r\ncouple of hundred for his smartness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, there might be something in that ar, if it warnt for his\r\ncharacter; but I can show recommends from his master and others, to\r\nprove he is one of your real pious,\xe2\x80\x94the most humble, prayin, pious\r\ncrittur ye ever did see. Why, he\xe2\x80\x99s been called a preacher in them parts\r\nhe came from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I might use him for a family chaplain, possibly,\xe2\x80\x9d added the young\r\nman, dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s quite an idea. Religion is a remarkably scarce\r\narticle at our house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re joking, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know I am? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you just warrant him for a preacher? Has\r\nhe been examined by any synod or council? Come, hand over your papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the trader had not been sure, by a certain good-humored twinkle in\r\nthe large eye, that all this banter was sure, in the long run, to turn\r\nout a cash concern, he might have been somewhat out of patience; as it\r\nwas, he laid down a greasy pocket-book on the cotton-bales, and began\r\nanxiously studying over certain papers in it, the young man standing\r\nby, the while, looking down on him with an air of careless, easy\r\ndrollery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, do buy him! it\xe2\x80\x99s no matter what you pay,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Eva, softly,\r\ngetting up on a package, and putting her arm around her father\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have money enough, I know. I want him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for, pussy? Are you going to use him for a rattle-box, or a\r\nrocking-horse, or what?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to make him happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn original reason, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the trader handed up a certificate, signed by Mr. Shelby, which\r\nthe young man took with the tips of his long fingers, and glanced over\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gentlemanly hand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand well spelt, too. Well, now, but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot sure, after all, about this religion,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, the old wicked\r\nexpression returning to his eye; \xe2\x80\x9cthe country is almost ruined with\r\npious white people; such pious politicians as we have just before\r\nelections,\xe2\x80\x94such pious goings on in all departments of church and state,\r\nthat a fellow does not know who\xe2\x80\x99ll cheat him next. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\r\neither, about religion\xe2\x80\x99s being up in the market, just now. I have not\r\nlooked in the papers lately, to see how it sells. How many hundred\r\ndollars, now, do you put on for this religion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou like to be jokin, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, then, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_sense_ under all that ar. I know there\xe2\x80\x99s differences in religion. Some\r\nkinds is mis\xe2\x80\x99rable: there\xe2\x80\x99s your meetin pious; there\xe2\x80\x99s your singin,\r\nroarin pious; them ar an\xe2\x80\x99t no account, in black or white;\xe2\x80\x94but these\r\nrayly is; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in niggers as often as any, your rail\r\nsoftly, quiet, stiddy, honest, pious, that the hull world couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntempt \xe2\x80\x99em to do nothing that they thinks is wrong; and ye see in this\r\nletter what Tom\xe2\x80\x99s old master says about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, stooping gravely over his book of bills, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyou can assure me that I really can buy _this_ kind of pious, and that\r\nit will be set down to my account in the book up above, as something\r\nbelonging to me, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care if I did go a little extra for it. How\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99ye say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, raily, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a thinkin that\r\nevery man\xe2\x80\x99ll have to hang on his own hook, in them ar quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather hard on a fellow that pays extra on religion, and can\xe2\x80\x99t trade\r\nwith it in the state where he wants it most, an\xe2\x80\x99t it, now?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nyoung man, who had been making out a roll of bills while he was\r\nspeaking. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, count your money, old boy!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as he handed\r\nthe roll to the trader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, his face beaming with delight; and pulling out\r\nan old inkhorn, he proceeded to fill out a bill of sale, which, in a\r\nfew moments, he handed to the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder, now, if I was divided up and inventoried,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter\r\nas he ran over the paper, \xe2\x80\x9chow much I might bring. Say so much for the\r\nshape of my head, so much for a high forehead, so much for arms, and\r\nhands, and legs, and then so much for education, learning, talent,\r\nhonesty, religion! Bless me! there would be small charge on that last,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking. But come, Eva,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and taking the hand of his\r\ndaughter, he stepped across the boat, and carelessly putting the tip of\r\nhis finger under Tom\xe2\x80\x99s chin, said, good-humoredly, \xe2\x80\x9cLook-up, Tom, and\r\nsee how you like your new master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom looked up. It was not in nature to look into that gay, young,\r\nhandsome face, without a feeling of pleasure; and Tom felt the tears\r\nstart in his eyes as he said, heartily, \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope he will. What\xe2\x80\x99s your name? Tom? Quite as likely to do it\r\nfor your asking as mine, from all accounts. Can you drive horses, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been allays used to horses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r Shelby raised heaps\r\nof \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think I shall put you in coachy, on condition that you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe drunk more than once a week, unless in cases of emergency, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom looked surprised, and rather hurt, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI never drink,\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that story before, Tom; but then we\xe2\x80\x99ll see. It will be a\r\nspecial accommodation to all concerned, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t. Never mind, my\r\nboy,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, good-humoredly, seeing Tom still looked grave; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndoubt you mean to do well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sartin do, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you shall have good times,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva. \xe2\x80\x9cPapa is very good to\r\neverybody, only he always will laugh at them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa is much obliged to you for his recommendation,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare,\r\nlaughing, as he turned on his heel and walked away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nOf Tom\xe2\x80\x99s New Master, and Various Other Matters\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the thread of our humble hero\xe2\x80\x99s life has now become interwoven\r\nwith that of higher ones, it is necessary to give some brief\r\nintroduction to them.\r\n\r\nAugustine St. Clare was the son of a wealthy planter of Louisiana. The\r\nfamily had its origin in Canada. Of two brothers, very similar in\r\ntemperament and character, one had settled on a flourishing farm in\r\nVermont, and the other became an opulent planter in Louisiana. The\r\nmother of Augustine was a Huguenot French lady, whose family had\r\nemigrated to Louisiana during the days of its early settlement.\r\nAugustine and another brother were the only children of their parents.\r\nHaving inherited from his mother an exceeding delicacy of constitution,\r\nhe was, at the instance of physicians, during many years of his\r\nboyhood, sent to the care of his uncle in Vermont, in order that his\r\nconstitution might be strengthened by the cold of a more bracing\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nIn childhood, he was remarkable for an extreme and marked sensitiveness\r\nof character, more akin to the softness of woman than the ordinary\r\nhardness of his own sex. Time, however, overgrew this softness with the\r\nrough bark of manhood, and but few knew how living and fresh it still\r\nlay at the core. His talents were of the very first order, although his\r\nmind showed a preference always for the ideal and the \xc3\xa6sthetic, and\r\nthere was about him that repugnance to the actual business of life\r\nwhich is the common result of this balance of the faculties. Soon after\r\nthe completion of his college course, his whole nature was kindled into\r\none intense and passionate effervescence of romantic passion. His hour\r\ncame,\xe2\x80\x94the hour that comes only once; his star rose in the horizon,\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nstar that rises so often in vain, to be remembered only as a thing of\r\ndreams; and it rose for him in vain. To drop the figure,\xe2\x80\x94he saw and won\r\nthe love of a high-minded and beautiful woman, in one of the northern\r\nstates, and they were affianced. He returned south to make arrangements\r\nfor their marriage, when, most unexpectedly, his letters were returned\r\nto him by mail, with a short note from her guardian, stating to him\r\nthat ere this reached him the lady would be the wife of another. Stung\r\nto madness, he vainly hoped, as many another has done, to fling the\r\nwhole thing from his heart by one desperate effort. Too proud to\r\nsupplicate or seek explanation, he threw himself at once into a whirl\r\nof fashionable society, and in a fortnight from the time of the fatal\r\nletter was the accepted lover of the reigning belle of the season; and\r\nas soon as arrangements could be made, he became the husband of a fine\r\nfigure, a pair of bright dark eyes, and a hundred thousand dollars;\r\nand, of course, everybody thought him a happy fellow.\r\n\r\nThe married couple were enjoying their honeymoon, and entertaining a\r\nbrilliant circle of friends in their splendid villa, near Lake\r\nPontchartrain, when, one day, a letter was brought to him in _that_\r\nwell-remembered writing. It was handed to him while he was in full tide\r\nof gay and successful conversation, in a whole room-full of company. He\r\nturned deadly pale when he saw the writing, but still preserved his\r\ncomposure, and finished the playful warfare of badinage which he was at\r\nthe moment carrying on with a lady opposite; and, a short time after,\r\nwas missed from the circle. In his room, alone, he opened and read the\r\nletter, now worse than idle and useless to be read. It was from her,\r\ngiving a long account of a persecution to which she had been exposed by\r\nher guardian\xe2\x80\x99s family, to lead her to unite herself with their son: and\r\nshe related how, for a long time, his letters had ceased to arrive; how\r\nshe had written time and again, till she became weary and doubtful; how\r\nher health had failed under her anxieties, and how, at last, she had\r\ndiscovered the whole fraud which had been practised on them both. The\r\nletter ended with expressions of hope and thankfulness, and professions\r\nof undying affection, which were more bitter than death to the unhappy\r\nyoung man. He wrote to her immediately:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have received yours,\xe2\x80\x94but too late. I believed all I heard. I was\r\ndesperate. _I am married_, and all is over. Only forget,\xe2\x80\x94it is all that\r\nremains for either of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd thus ended the whole romance and ideal of life for Augustine St.\r\nClare. But the _real_ remained,\xe2\x80\x94the _real_, like the flat, bare, oozy\r\ntide-mud, when the blue sparkling wave, with all its company of gliding\r\nboats and white-winged ships, its music of oars and chiming waters, has\r\ngone down, and there it lies, flat, slimy, bare,\xe2\x80\x94exceedingly real.\r\n\r\nOf course, in a novel, people\xe2\x80\x99s hearts break, and they die, and that is\r\nthe end of it; and in a story this is very convenient. But in real life\r\nwe do not die when all that makes life bright dies to us. There is a\r\nmost busy and important round of eating, drinking, dressing, walking,\r\nvisiting, buying, selling, talking, reading, and all that makes up what\r\nis commonly called _living_, yet to be gone through; and this yet\r\nremained to Augustine. Had his wife been a whole woman, she might yet\r\nhave done something\xe2\x80\x94as woman can\xe2\x80\x94to mend the broken threads of life,\r\nand weave again into a tissue of brightness. But Marie St. Clare could\r\nnot even see that they had been broken. As before stated, she consisted\r\nof a fine figure, a pair of splendid eyes, and a hundred thousand\r\ndollars; and none of these items were precisely the ones to minister to\r\na mind diseased.\r\n\r\nWhen Augustine, pale as death, was found lying on the sofa, and pleaded\r\nsudden sick-headache as the cause of his distress, she recommended to\r\nhim to smell of hartshorn; and when the paleness and headache came on\r\nweek after week, she only said that she never thought Mr. St. Clare was\r\nsickly; but it seems he was very liable to sick-headaches, and that it\r\nwas a very unfortunate thing for her, because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy going\r\ninto company with her, and it seemed odd to go so much alone, when they\r\nwere just married. Augustine was glad in his heart that he had married\r\nso undiscerning a woman; but as the glosses and civilities of the\r\nhoneymoon wore away, he discovered that a beautiful young woman, who\r\nhas lived all her life to be caressed and waited on, might prove quite\r\na hard mistress in domestic life. Marie never had possessed much\r\ncapability of affection, or much sensibility, and the little that she\r\nhad, had been merged into a most intense and unconscious selfishness; a\r\nselfishness the more hopeless, from its quiet obtuseness, its utter\r\nignorance of any claims but her own. From her infancy, she had been\r\nsurrounded with servants, who lived only to study her caprices; the\r\nidea that they had either feelings or rights had never dawned upon her,\r\neven in distant perspective. Her father, whose only child she had been,\r\nhad never denied her anything that lay within the compass of human\r\npossibility; and when she entered life, beautiful, accomplished, and an\r\nheiress, she had, of course, all the eligibles and non-eligibles of the\r\nother sex sighing at her feet, and she had no doubt that Augustine was\r\na most fortunate man in having obtained her. It is a great mistake to\r\nsuppose that a woman with no heart will be an easy creditor in the\r\nexchange of affection. There is not on earth a more merciless exactor\r\nof love from others than a thoroughly selfish woman; and the more\r\nunlovely she grows, the more jealously and scrupulously she exacts\r\nlove, to the uttermost farthing. When, therefore, St. Clare began to\r\ndrop off those gallantries and small attentions which flowed at first\r\nthrough the habitude of courtship, he found his sultana no way ready to\r\nresign her slave; there were abundance of tears, poutings, and small\r\ntempests, there were discontents, pinings, upbraidings. St. Clare was\r\ngood-natured and self-indulgent, and sought to buy off with presents\r\nand flatteries; and when Marie became mother to a beautiful daughter,\r\nhe really felt awakened, for a time, to something like tenderness.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s mother had been a woman of uncommon elevation and purity of\r\ncharacter, and he gave to his child his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name, fondly fancying\r\nthat she would prove a reproduction of her image. The thing had been\r\nremarked with petulant jealousy by his wife, and she regarded her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s absorbing devotion to the child with suspicion and dislike;\r\nall that was given to her seemed so much taken from herself. From the\r\ntime of the birth of this child, her health gradually sunk. A life of\r\nconstant inaction, bodily and mental,\xe2\x80\x94the friction of ceaseless ennui\r\nand discontent, united to the ordinary weakness which attended the\r\nperiod of maternity,\xe2\x80\x94in course of a few years changed the blooming\r\nyoung belle into a yellow faded, sickly woman, whose time was divided\r\namong a variety of fanciful diseases, and who considered herself, in\r\nevery sense, the most ill-used and suffering person in existence.\r\n\r\nThere was no end of her various complaints; but her principal forte\r\nappeared to lie in sick-headache, which sometimes would confine her to\r\nher room three days out of six. As, of course, all family arrangements\r\nfell into the hands of servants, St. Clare found his menage anything\r\nbut comfortable. His only daughter was exceedingly delicate, and he\r\nfeared that, with no one to look after her and attend to her, her\r\nhealth and life might yet fall a sacrifice to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninefficiency. He had taken her with him on a tour to Vermont, and had\r\npersuaded his cousin, Miss Ophelia St. Clare, to return with him to his\r\nsouthern residence; and they are now returning on this boat, where we\r\nhave introduced them to our readers.\r\n\r\nAnd now, while the distant domes and spires of New Orleans rise to our\r\nview, there is yet time for an introduction to Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\nWhoever has travelled in the New England States will remember, in some\r\ncool village, the large farmhouse, with its clean-swept grassy yard,\r\nshaded by the dense and massive foliage of the sugar maple; and\r\nremember the air of order and stillness, of perpetuity and unchanging\r\nrepose, that seemed to breathe over the whole place. Nothing lost, or\r\nout of order; not a picket loose in the fence, not a particle of litter\r\nin the turfy yard, with its clumps of lilac bushes growing up under the\r\nwindows. Within, he will remember wide, clean rooms, where nothing ever\r\nseems to be doing or going to be done, where everything is once and\r\nforever rigidly in place, and where all household arrangements move\r\nwith the punctual exactness of the old clock in the corner. In the\r\nfamily \xe2\x80\x9ckeeping-room,\xe2\x80\x9d as it is termed, he will remember the staid,\r\nrespectable old book-case, with its glass doors, where Rollin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHistory,[1] Milton\xe2\x80\x99s Paradise Lost, Bunyan\xe2\x80\x99s Pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s Progress, and\r\nScott\xe2\x80\x99s Family Bible,[2] stand side by side in decorous order, with\r\nmultitudes of other books, equally solemn and respectable. There are no\r\nservants in the house, but the lady in the snowy cap, with the\r\nspectacles, who sits sewing every afternoon among her daughters, as if\r\nnothing ever had been done, or were to be done,\xe2\x80\x94she and her girls, in\r\nsome long-forgotten fore part of the day, \xe2\x80\x9c_did up the work_,\xe2\x80\x9d and for\r\nthe rest of the time, probably, at all hours when you would see them,\r\nit is \xe2\x80\x9c_done up_.\xe2\x80\x9d The old kitchen floor never seems stained or\r\nspotted; the tables, the chairs, and the various cooking utensils,\r\nnever seem deranged or disordered; though three and sometimes four\r\nmeals a day are got there, though the family washing and ironing is\r\nthere performed, and though pounds of butter and cheese are in some\r\nsilent and mysterious manner there brought into existence.\r\n\r\n [1] _The Ancient History_, ten volumes (1730-1738), by the French\r\n historian Charles Rollin (1661-1741).\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] _Scott\xe2\x80\x99s Family Bible_ (1788-1792), edited with notes by the\r\n English Biblical commentator, Thomas Scott (1747-1821).\r\n\r\n\r\nOn such a farm, in such a house and family, Miss Ophelia had spent a\r\nquiet existence of some forty-five years, when her cousin invited her\r\nto visit his southern mansion. The eldest of a large family, she was\r\nstill considered by her father and mother as one of \xe2\x80\x9cthe children,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe proposal that she should go to _Orleans_ was a most momentous one\r\nto the family circle. The old gray-headed father took down Morse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nAtlas[3] out of the book-case, and looked out the exact latitude and\r\nlongitude; and read Flint\xe2\x80\x99s Travels in the South and West,[4] to make\r\nup his own mind as to the nature of the country.\r\n\r\n [3] _The Cerographic Atlas of the United States_ (1842-1845), by\r\n Sidney Edwards Morse (1794-1871), son of the geographer, Jedidiah\r\n Morse, and brother of the painter-inventor, Samuel F. B. Morse.\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] _Recollections of the Last Ten Years_ (1826) by Timothy Flint\r\n (1780-1840), missionary of Presbyterianism to the trans-Allegheny\r\n West.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good mother inquired, anxiously, \xe2\x80\x9cif Orleans wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an awful wicked\r\nplace,\xe2\x80\x9d saying, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it seemed to her most equal to going to the\r\nSandwich Islands, or anywhere among the heathen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was known at the minister\xe2\x80\x99s and at the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s, and at Miss\r\nPeabody\xe2\x80\x99s milliner shop, that Ophelia St. Clare was \xe2\x80\x9ctalking about\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ngoing away down to Orleans with her cousin; and of course the whole\r\nvillage could do no less than help this very important process of\r\n_talking about_ the matter. The minister, who inclined strongly to\r\nabolitionist views, was quite doubtful whether such a step might not\r\ntend somewhat to encourage the southerners in holding on to their\r\nslaves; while the doctor, who was a stanch colonizationist, inclined to\r\nthe opinion that Miss Ophelia ought to go, to show the Orleans people\r\nthat we don\xe2\x80\x99t think hardly of them, after all. He was of opinion, in\r\nfact, that southern people needed encouraging. When however, the fact\r\nthat she had resolved to go was fully before the public mind, she was\r\nsolemnly invited out to tea by all her friends and neighbors for the\r\nspace of a fortnight, and her prospects and plans duly canvassed and\r\ninquired into. Miss Moseley, who came into the house to help to do the\r\ndress-making, acquired daily accessions of importance from the\r\ndevelopments with regard to Miss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe which she had been\r\nenabled to make. It was credibly ascertained that Squire Sinclare, as\r\nhis name was commonly contracted in the neighborhood, had counted out\r\nfifty dollars, and given them to Miss Ophelia, and told her to buy any\r\nclothes she thought best; and that two new silk dresses, and a bonnet,\r\nhad been sent for from Boston. As to the propriety of this\r\nextraordinary outlay, the public mind was divided,\xe2\x80\x94some affirming that\r\nit was well enough, all things considered, for once in one\xe2\x80\x99s life, and\r\nothers stoutly affirming that the money had better have been sent to\r\nthe missionaries; but all parties agreed that there had been no such\r\nparasol seen in those parts as had been sent on from New York, and that\r\nshe had one silk dress that might fairly be trusted to stand alone,\r\nwhatever might be said of its mistress. There were credible rumors,\r\nalso, of a hemstitched pocket-handkerchief; and report even went so far\r\nas to state that Miss Ophelia had one pocket-handkerchief with lace all\r\naround it,\xe2\x80\x94it was even added that it was worked in the corners; but\r\nthis latter point was never satisfactorily ascertained, and remains, in\r\nfact, unsettled to this day.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia, as you now behold her, stands before you, in a very\r\nshining brown linen travelling-dress, tall, square-formed, and angular.\r\nHer face was thin, and rather sharp in its outlines; the lips\r\ncompressed, like those of a person who is in the habit of making up her\r\nmind definitely on all subjects; while the keen, dark eyes had a\r\npeculiarly searching, advised movement, and travelled over everything,\r\nas if they were looking for something to take care of.\r\n\r\nAll her movements were sharp, decided, and energetic; and, though she\r\nwas never much of a talker, her words were remarkably direct, and to\r\nthe purpose, when she did speak.\r\n\r\nIn her habits, she was a living impersonation of order, method, and\r\nexactness. In punctuality, she was as inevitable as a clock, and as\r\ninexorable as a railroad engine; and she held in most decided contempt\r\nand abomination anything of a contrary character.\r\n\r\nThe great sin of sins, in her eyes,\xe2\x80\x94the sum of all evils,\xe2\x80\x94was expressed\r\nby one very common and important word in her\r\nvocabulary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshiftlessness.\xe2\x80\x9d Her finale and ultimatum of contempt\r\nconsisted in a very emphatic pronunciation of the word \xe2\x80\x9cshiftless;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nby this she characterized all modes of procedure which had not a direct\r\nand inevitable relation to accomplishment of some purpose then\r\ndefinitely had in mind. People who did nothing, or who did not know\r\nexactly what they were going to do, or who did not take the most direct\r\nway to accomplish what they set their hands to, were objects of her\r\nentire contempt,\xe2\x80\x94a contempt shown less frequently by anything she said,\r\nthan by a kind of stony grimness, as if she scorned to say anything\r\nabout the matter.\r\n\r\nAs to mental cultivation,\xe2\x80\x94she had a clear, strong, active mind, was\r\nwell and thoroughly read in history and the older English classics, and\r\nthought with great strength within certain narrow limits. Her\r\ntheological tenets were all made up, labelled in most positive and\r\ndistinct forms, and put by, like the bundles in her patch trunk; there\r\nwere just so many of them, and there were never to be any more. So,\r\nalso, were her ideas with regard to most matters of practical\r\nlife,\xe2\x80\x94such as housekeeping in all its branches, and the various\r\npolitical relations of her native village. And, underlying all, deeper\r\nthan anything else, higher and broader, lay the strongest principle of\r\nher being\xe2\x80\x94conscientiousness. Nowhere is conscience so dominant and\r\nall-absorbing as with New England women. It is the granite formation,\r\nwhich lies deepest, and rises out, even to the tops of the highest\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia was the absolute bond-slave of the \xe2\x80\x9c_ought_.\xe2\x80\x9d Once make\r\nher certain that the \xe2\x80\x9cpath of duty,\xe2\x80\x9d as she commonly phrased it, lay in\r\nany given direction, and fire and water could not keep her from it. She\r\nwould walk straight down into a well, or up to a loaded cannon\xe2\x80\x99s mouth,\r\nif she were only quite sure that there the path lay. Her standard of\r\nright was so high, so all-embracing, so minute, and making so few\r\nconcessions to human frailty, that, though she strove with heroic ardor\r\nto reach it, she never actually did so, and of course was burdened with\r\na constant and often harassing sense of deficiency;\xe2\x80\x94this gave a severe\r\nand somewhat gloomy cast to her religious character.\r\n\r\nBut, how in the world can Miss Ophelia get along with Augustine St.\r\nClare,\xe2\x80\x94gay, easy, unpunctual, unpractical, sceptical,\xe2\x80\x94in short,\xe2\x80\x94walking\r\nwith impudent and nonchalant freedom over every one of her most\r\ncherished habits and opinions?\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, then, Miss Ophelia loved him. When a boy, it had\r\nbeen hers to teach him his catechism, mend his clothes, comb his hair,\r\nand bring him up generally in the way he should go; and her heart\r\nhaving a warm side to it, Augustine had, as he usually did with most\r\npeople, monopolized a large share of it for himself, and therefore it\r\nwas that he succeeded very easily in persuading her that the \xe2\x80\x9cpath of\r\nduty\xe2\x80\x9d lay in the direction of New Orleans, and that she must go with\r\nhim to take care of Eva, and keep everything from going to wreck and\r\nruin during the frequent illnesses of his wife. The idea of a house\r\nwithout anybody to take care of it went to her heart; then she loved\r\nthe lovely little girl, as few could help doing; and though she\r\nregarded Augustine as very much of a heathen, yet she loved him,\r\nlaughed at his jokes, and forbore with his failings, to an extent which\r\nthose who knew him thought perfectly incredible. But what more or other\r\nis to be known of Miss Ophelia our reader must discover by a personal\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nThere she is, sitting now in her state-room, surrounded by a mixed\r\nmultitude of little and big carpet-bags, boxes, baskets, each\r\ncontaining some separate responsibility which she is tying, binding up,\r\npacking, or fastening, with a face of great earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Eva, have you kept count of your things? Of course you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x94children never do: there\xe2\x80\x99s the spotted carpet-bag and the\r\nlittle blue band-box with your best bonnet,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s two; then the India\r\nrubber satchel is three; and my tape and needle box is four; and my\r\nband-box, five; and my collar-box; and that little hair trunk, seven.\r\nWhat have you done with your sunshade? Give it to me, and let me put a\r\npaper round it, and tie it to my umbrella with my shade;\xe2\x80\x94there, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, aunty, we are only going up home;\xe2\x80\x94what is the use?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo keep it nice, child; people must take care of their things, if they\r\never mean to have anything; and now, Eva, is your thimble put up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, aunty, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind; I\xe2\x80\x99ll look your box over,\xe2\x80\x94thimble, wax, two spools,\r\nscissors, knife, tape-needle; all right,\xe2\x80\x94put it in here. What did you\r\never do, child, when you were coming on with only your papa. I should\r\nhave thought you\xe2\x80\x99d a lost everything you had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, aunty, I did lose a great many; and then, when we stopped\r\nanywhere, papa would buy some more of whatever it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy on us, child,\xe2\x80\x94what a way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very easy way, aunty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a dreadful shiftless one,\xe2\x80\x9d said aunty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, aunty, what\xe2\x80\x99ll you do now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva; \xe2\x80\x9cthat trunk is too full to\r\nbe shut down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _must_ shut down,\xe2\x80\x9d said aunty, with the air of a general, as she\r\nsqueezed the things in, and sprung upon the lid;\xe2\x80\x94still a little gap\r\nremained about the mouth of the trunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up here, Eva!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, courageously; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has been\r\ndone can be done again. This trunk has _got to be_ shut and\r\nlocked\xe2\x80\x94there are no two ways about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the trunk, intimidated, doubtless, by this resolute statement, gave\r\nin. The hasp snapped sharply in its hole, and Miss Ophelia turned the\r\nkey, and pocketed it in triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99re ready. Where\xe2\x80\x99s your papa? I think it time this baggage was\r\nset out. Do look out, Eva, and see if you see your papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s down the other end of the gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s cabin, eating an\r\norange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t know how near we are coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said aunty; \xe2\x80\x9chadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better\r\nrun and speak to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa never is in a hurry about anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cand we haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome to the landing. Do step on the guards, aunty. Look! there\xe2\x80\x99s our\r\nhouse, up that street!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boat now began, with heavy groans, like some vast, tired monster,\r\nto prepare to push up among the multiplied steamers at the levee. Eva\r\njoyously pointed out the various spires, domes, and way-marks, by which\r\nshe recognized her native city.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, dear; very fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cBut mercy on us! the\r\nboat has stopped! where is your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now ensued the usual turmoil of landing\xe2\x80\x94waiters running twenty ways\r\nat once\xe2\x80\x94men tugging trunks, carpet-bags, boxes\xe2\x80\x94women anxiously calling\r\nto their children, and everybody crowding in a dense mass to the plank\r\ntowards the landing.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia seated herself resolutely on the lately vanquished trunk,\r\nand marshalling all her goods and chattels in fine military order,\r\nseemed resolved to defend them to the last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I take your trunk, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShall I take your baggage?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLet me\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tend to your baggage, Missis?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShan\xe2\x80\x99t I carry out these yer, Missis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nrained down upon her unheeded. She sat with grim determination, upright\r\nas a darning-needle stuck in a board, holding on her bundle of umbrella\r\nand parasols, and replying with a determination that was enough to\r\nstrike dismay even into a hackman, wondering to Eva, in each interval,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat upon earth her papa could be thinking of; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have fallen\r\nover, now,\xe2\x80\x94but something must have happened;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and just as she had begun\r\nto work herself into a real distress, he came up, with his usually\r\ncareless motion, and giving Eva a quarter of the orange he was eating,\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Cousin Vermont, I suppose you are all ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been ready, waiting, nearly an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia; \xe2\x80\x9cI began\r\nto be really concerned about you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a clever fellow, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, the carriage is waiting,\r\nand the crowd are now off, so that one can walk out in a decent and\r\nChristian manner, and not be pushed and shoved. Here,\xe2\x80\x9d he added to a\r\ndriver who stood behind him, \xe2\x80\x9ctake these things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see to his putting them in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, pshaw, cousin, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at any rate, I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry this, and this, and this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nOphelia, singling out three boxes and a small carpet-bag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Miss Vermont, positively you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t come the Green Mountains\r\nover us that way. You must adopt at least a piece of a southern\r\nprinciple, and not walk out under all that load. They\xe2\x80\x99ll take you for a\r\nwaiting-maid; give them to this fellow; he\xe2\x80\x99ll put them down as if they\r\nwere eggs, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia looked despairingly as her cousin took all her treasures\r\nfrom her, and rejoiced to find herself once more in the carriage with\r\nthem, in a state of preservation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, he\xe2\x80\x99s on the outside, Pussy. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take Tom up to mother for\r\na peace-offering, to make up for that drunken fellow that upset the\r\ncarriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Tom will make a splendid driver, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nget drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped in front of an ancient mansion, built in that odd\r\nmixture of Spanish and French style, of which there are specimens in\r\nsome parts of New Orleans. It was built in the Moorish fashion,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsquare building enclosing a court-yard, into which the carriage drove\r\nthrough an arched gateway. The court, in the inside, had evidently been\r\narranged to gratify a picturesque and voluptuous ideality. Wide\r\ngalleries ran all around the four sides, whose Moorish arches, slender\r\npillars, and arabesque ornaments, carried the mind back, as in a dream,\r\nto the reign of oriental romance in Spain. In the middle of the court,\r\na fountain threw high its silvery water, falling in a never-ceasing\r\nspray into a marble basin, fringed with a deep border of fragrant\r\nviolets. The water in the fountain, pellucid as crystal, was alive with\r\nmyriads of gold and silver fishes, twinkling and darting through it\r\nlike so many living jewels. Around the fountain ran a walk, paved with\r\na mosaic of pebbles, laid in various fanciful patterns; and this,\r\nagain, was surrounded by turf, smooth as green velvet, while a\r\ncarriage-drive enclosed the whole. Two large orange-trees, now fragrant\r\nwith blossoms, threw a delicious shade; and, ranged in a circle round\r\nupon the turf, were marble vases of arabesque sculpture, containing the\r\nchoicest flowering plants of the tropics. Huge pomegranate trees, with\r\ntheir glossy leaves and flame-colored flowers, dark-leaved Arabian\r\njessamines, with their silvery stars, geraniums, luxuriant roses\r\nbending beneath their heavy abundance of flowers, golden jessamines,\r\nlemon-scented verbenum, all united their bloom and fragrance, while\r\nhere and there a mystic old aloe, with its strange, massive leaves, sat\r\nlooking like some old enchanter, sitting in weird grandeur among the\r\nmore perishable bloom and fragrance around it.\r\n\r\nThe galleries that surrounded the court were festooned with a curtain\r\nof some kind of Moorish stuff, and could be drawn down at pleasure, to\r\nexclude the beams of the sun. On the whole, the appearance of the place\r\nwas luxurious and romantic.\r\n\r\nAs the carriage drove in, Eva seemed like a bird ready to burst from a\r\ncage, with the wild eagerness of her delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it beautiful, lovely! my own dear, darling home!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to\r\nMiss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99T is a pretty place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, as she alighted; \xe2\x80\x9cthough it\r\nlooks rather old and heathenish to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom got down from the carriage, and looked about with an air of calm,\r\nstill enjoyment. The negro, it must be remembered, is an exotic of the\r\nmost gorgeous and superb countries of the world, and he has, deep in\r\nhis heart, a passion for all that is splendid, rich, and fanciful; a\r\npassion which, rudely indulged by an untrained taste, draws on them the\r\nridicule of the colder and more correct white race.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare, who was in heart a poetical voluptuary, smiled as Miss\r\nOphelia made her remark on his premises, and, turning to Tom, who was\r\nstanding looking round, his beaming black face perfectly radiant with\r\nadmiration, he said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, my boy, this seems to suit you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, it looks about the right thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\nAll this passed in a moment, while trunks were being hustled off,\r\nhackman paid, and while a crowd, of all ages and sizes,\xe2\x80\x94men, women, and\r\nchildren,\xe2\x80\x94came running through the galleries, both above and below to\r\nsee Mas\xe2\x80\x99r come in. Foremost among them was a highly-dressed young\r\nmulatto man, evidently a very _distingue_ personage, attired in the\r\nultra extreme of the mode, and gracefully waving a scented cambric\r\nhandkerchief in his hand.\r\n\r\nThis personage had been exerting himself, with great alacrity, in\r\ndriving all the flock of domestics to the other end of the verandah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack! all of you. I am ashamed of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a tone of\r\nauthority. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you intrude on Master\xe2\x80\x99s domestic relations, in the\r\nfirst hour of his return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll looked abashed at this elegant speech, delivered with quite an air,\r\nand stood huddled together at a respectful distance, except two stout\r\nporters, who came up and began conveying away the baggage.\r\n\r\nOwing to Mr. Adolph\xe2\x80\x99s systematic arrangements, when St. Clare turned\r\nround from paying the hackman, there was nobody in view but Mr. Adolph\r\nhimself, conspicuous in satin vest, gold guard-chain, and white pants,\r\nand bowing with inexpressible grace and suavity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Adolph, is it you?\xe2\x80\x9d said his master, offering his hand to him;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow are you, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d while Adolph poured forth, with great fluency, an\r\nextemporary speech, which he had been preparing, with great care, for a\r\nfortnight before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, passing on, with his usual air of\r\nnegligent drollery, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s very well got up, Adolph. See that the\r\nbaggage is well bestowed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come to the people in a minute;\xe2\x80\x9d and, so\r\nsaying, he led Miss Ophelia to a large parlor that opened on the\r\nverandah.\r\n\r\nWhile this had been passing, Eva had flown like a bird, through the\r\nporch and parlor, to a little boudoir opening likewise on the verandah.\r\n\r\nA tall, dark-eyed, sallow woman, half rose from a couch on which she\r\nwas reclining.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, in a sort of a rapture, throwing herself on her\r\nneck, and embracing her over and over again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x94take care, child,\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t, you make my head ache,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nmother, after she had languidly kissed her.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare came in, embraced his wife in true, orthodox, husbandly\r\nfashion, and then presented to her his cousin. Marie lifted her large\r\neyes on her cousin with an air of some curiosity, and received her with\r\nlanguid politeness. A crowd of servants now pressed to the entry door,\r\nand among them a middle-aged mulatto woman, of very respectable\r\nappearance, stood foremost, in a tremor of expectation and joy, at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, there\xe2\x80\x99s Mammy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, as she flew across the room; and,\r\nthrowing herself into her arms, she kissed her repeatedly.\r\n\r\nThis woman did not tell her that she made her head ache, but, on the\r\ncontrary, she hugged her, and laughed, and cried, till her sanity was a\r\nthing to be doubted of; and when released from her, Eva flew from one\r\nto another, shaking hands and kissing, in a way that Miss Ophelia\r\nafterwards declared fairly turned her stomach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cyou southern children can do something that\r\n_I_ couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, now, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I want to be kind to everybody, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything\r\nhurt; but as to kissing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNiggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99re not up to,\xe2\x80\x94hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. How can she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare laughed, as he went into the passage. \xe2\x80\x9cHalloa, here, what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto pay out here? Here, you all\xe2\x80\x94Mammy, Jimmy, Polly, Sukey\xe2\x80\x94glad to see\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he went shaking hands from one to another. \xe2\x80\x9cLook\r\nout for the babies!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as he stumbled over a sooty little\r\nurchin, who was crawling upon all fours. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I step upon anybody, let\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em mention it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an abundance of laughing and blessing Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, as St. Clare\r\ndistributed small pieces of change among them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, take yourselves off, like good boys and girls,\xe2\x80\x9d he said;\r\nand the whole assemblage, dark and light, disappeared through a door\r\ninto a large verandah, followed by Eva, who carried a large satchel,\r\nwhich she had been filling with apples, nuts, candy, ribbons, laces,\r\nand toys of every description, during her whole homeward journey.\r\n\r\nAs St. Clare turned to go back his eye fell upon Tom, who was standing\r\nuneasily, shifting from one foot to the other, while Adolph stood\r\nnegligently leaning against the banisters, examining Tom through an\r\nopera-glass, with an air that would have done credit to any dandy\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPuh! you puppy,\xe2\x80\x9d said his master, striking down the opera glass; \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nthat the way you treat your company? Seems to me, Dolph,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nlaying his finger on the elegant figured satin vest that Adolph was\r\nsporting, \xe2\x80\x9cseems to me that\xe2\x80\x99s _my_ vest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! Master, this vest all stained with wine; of course, a gentleman in\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s standing never wears a vest like this. I understood I was to\r\ntake it. It does for a poor nigger-fellow, like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Adolph tossed his head, and passed his fingers through his scented\r\nhair, with a grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, here, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to show this Tom to his mistress, and then you take him to the\r\nkitchen; and mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t put on any of your airs to him. He\xe2\x80\x99s worth\r\ntwo such puppies as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster always will have his joke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adolph, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ndelighted to see Master in such spirits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, beckoning.\r\n\r\nTom entered the room. He looked wistfully on the velvet carpets, and\r\nthe before unimagined splendors of mirrors, pictures, statues, and\r\ncurtains, and, like the Queen of Sheba before Solomon, there was no\r\nmore spirit in him. He looked afraid even to set his feet down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, Marie,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve bought you a\r\ncoachman, at last, to order. I tell you, he\xe2\x80\x99s a regular hearse for\r\nblackness and sobriety, and will drive you like a funeral, if you want.\r\nOpen your eyes, now, and look at him. Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t say I never think\r\nabout you when I\xe2\x80\x99m gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarie opened her eyes, and fixed them on Tom, without rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know he\xe2\x80\x99ll get drunk,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\xe2\x80\x99s warranted a pious and sober article.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope he may turn out well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s more than I\r\nexpect, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDolph,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cshow Tom down stairs; and, mind yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded; \xe2\x80\x9cremember what I told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdolph tripped gracefully forward, and Tom, with lumbering tread, went\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect behemoth!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, Marie,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, seating himself on a stool beside\r\nher sofa, \xe2\x80\x9cbe gracious, and say something pretty to a fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been gone a fortnight beyond the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, pouting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know I wrote you the reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a short, cold letter!\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! the mail was just going, and it had to be that or nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the way, always,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady; \xe2\x80\x9calways something to make\r\nyour journeys long, and letters short.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, now,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, drawing an elegant velvet case out of his\r\npocket, and opening it, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a present I got for you in New York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a daguerreotype, clear and soft as an engraving, representing\r\nEva and her father sitting hand in hand.\r\n\r\nMarie looked at it with a dissatisfied air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you sit in such an awkward position?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the position may be a matter of opinion; but what do you think\r\nof the likeness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything of my opinion in one case, I suppose you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t in another,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, shutting the daguerreotype.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang the woman!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, mentally; but aloud he added, \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nnow, Marie, what do you think of the likeness? Don\xe2\x80\x99t be nonsensical,\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very inconsiderate of you, St. Clare,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cto insist\r\non my talking and looking at things. You know I\xe2\x80\x99ve been lying all day\r\nwith the sick-headache; and there\xe2\x80\x99s been such a tumult made ever since\r\nyou came, I\xe2\x80\x99m half dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re subject to the sick-headache, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia,\r\nsuddenly rising from the depths of the large arm-chair, where she had\r\nsat quietly, taking an inventory of the furniture, and calculating its\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m a perfect martyr to it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuniper-berry tea is good for sick-headache,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia; \xe2\x80\x9cat\r\nleast, Auguste, Deacon Abraham Perry\xe2\x80\x99s wife, used to say so; and she\r\nwas a great nurse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have the first juniper-berries that get ripe in our garden by the\r\nlake brought in for that special purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, gravely\r\npulling the bell as he did so; \xe2\x80\x9cmeanwhile, cousin, you must be wanting\r\nto retire to your apartment, and refresh yourself a little, after your\r\njourney. Dolph,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9ctell Mammy to come here.\xe2\x80\x9d The decent\r\nmulatto woman whom Eva had caressed so rapturously soon entered; she\r\nwas dressed neatly, with a high red and yellow turban on her head, the\r\nrecent gift of Eva, and which the child had been arranging on her head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMammy,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cI put this lady under your care; she is\r\ntired, and wants rest; take her to her chamber, and be sure she is made\r\ncomfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d and Miss Ophelia disappeared in the rear of Mammy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s Mistress and Her Opinions\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Marie,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cyour golden days are dawning. Here\r\nis our practical, business-like New England cousin, who will take the\r\nwhole budget of cares off your shoulders, and give you time to refresh\r\nyourself, and grow young and handsome. The ceremony of delivering the\r\nkeys had better come off forthwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis remark was made at the breakfast-table, a few mornings after Miss\r\nOphelia had arrived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99s welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, leaning her head languidly on her\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99ll find one thing, if she does, and that is, that\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s we mistresses that are the slaves, down here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, certainly, she will discover that, and a world of wholesome truths\r\nbesides, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk about our keeping slaves, as if we did it for our _convenience_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Marie. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure, if we consulted _that_, we might let them all go\r\nat once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvangeline fixed her large, serious eyes on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s face, with an\r\nearnest and perplexed expression, and said, simply, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you keep\r\nthem for, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, except for a plague; they are the plague of my\r\nlife. I believe that more of my ill health is caused by them than by\r\nany one thing; and ours, I know, are the very worst that ever anybody\r\nwas plagued with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, come, Marie, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the blues, this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know \xe2\x80\x99t isn\xe2\x80\x99t so. There\xe2\x80\x99s Mammy, the best creature living,\xe2\x80\x94what\r\ncould you do without her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMammy is the best I ever knew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet Mammy, now, is\r\nselfish\xe2\x80\x94dreadfully selfish; it\xe2\x80\x99s the fault of the whole race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSelfishness _is_ a dreadful fault,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, there\xe2\x80\x99s Mammy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s selfish of her to\r\nsleep so sound nights; she knows I need little attentions almost every\r\nhour, when my worst turns are on, and yet she\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to wake. I\r\nabsolutely am worse, this very morning, for the efforts I had to make\r\nto wake her last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t she sat up with you a good many nights, lately, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, sharply; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\ncomplaining, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t complain; she only told me what bad nights you\xe2\x80\x99d had,\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nmany in succession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you let Jane or Rosa take her place, a night or two,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSt. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cand let her rest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you propose it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie. \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Clare, you really are\r\ninconsiderate. So nervous as I am, the least breath disturbs me; and a\r\nstrange hand about me would drive me absolutely frantic. If Mammy felt\r\nthe interest in me she ought to, she\xe2\x80\x99d wake easier,\xe2\x80\x94of course, she\r\nwould. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of people who had such devoted servants, but it never\r\nwas _my_ luck;\xe2\x80\x9d and Marie sighed.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia had listened to this conversation with an air of shrewd,\r\nobservant gravity; and she still kept her lips tightly compressed, as\r\nif determined fully to ascertain her longitude and position, before she\r\ncommitted herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mammy has a _sort_ of goodness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s smooth and\r\nrespectful, but she\xe2\x80\x99s selfish at heart. Now, she never will be done\r\nfidgeting and worrying about that husband of hers. You see, when I was\r\nmarried and came to live here, of course, I had to bring her with me,\r\nand her husband my father couldn\xe2\x80\x99t spare. He was a blacksmith, and, of\r\ncourse, very necessary; and I thought and said, at the time, that Mammy\r\nand he had better give each other up, as it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to be\r\nconvenient for them ever to live together again. I wish, now, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ninsisted on it, and married Mammy to somebody else; but I was foolish\r\nand indulgent, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to insist. I told Mammy, at the time,\r\nthat she mustn\xe2\x80\x99t ever expect to see him more than once or twice in her\r\nlife again, for the air of father\xe2\x80\x99s place doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with my health,\r\nand I can\xe2\x80\x99t go there; and I advised her to take up with somebody else;\r\nbut no\xe2\x80\x94she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Mammy has a kind of obstinacy about her, in spots,\r\nthat everybody don\xe2\x80\x99t see as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she children?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; she has two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose she feels the separation from them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring them. They were little dirty\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have them about; and, besides, they took up too much\r\nof her time; but I believe that Mammy has always kept up a sort of\r\nsulkiness about this. She won\xe2\x80\x99t marry anybody else; and I do believe,\r\nnow, though she knows how necessary she is to me, and how feeble my\r\nhealth is, she would go back to her husband tomorrow, if she only\r\ncould. I _do_, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are just so selfish, now, the\r\nbest of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s distressing to reflect upon,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, dryly.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia looked keenly at him, and saw the flush of mortification\r\nand repressed vexation, and the sarcastic curl of the lip, as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mammy has always been a pet with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish some of\r\nyour northern servants could look at her closets of dresses,\xe2\x80\x94silks and\r\nmuslins, and one real linen cambric, she has hanging there. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked\r\nsometimes whole afternoons, trimming her caps, and getting her ready to\r\ngo to a party. As to abuse, she don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is. She never was\r\nwhipped more than once or twice in her whole life. She has her strong\r\ncoffee or her tea every day, with white sugar in it. It\xe2\x80\x99s abominable,\r\nto be sure; but St. Clare will have high life below-stairs, and they\r\nevery one of them live just as they please. The fact is, our servants\r\nare over-indulged. I suppose it is partly our fault that they are\r\nselfish, and act like spoiled children; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to St. Clare\r\ntill I am tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, taking up the morning paper.\r\n\r\nEva, the beautiful Eva, had stood listening to her mother, with that\r\nexpression of deep and mystic earnestness which was peculiar to her.\r\nShe walked softly round to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and put her arms round\r\nher neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Eva, what now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I take care of you one night\xe2\x80\x94just one? I know I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make you nervous, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep. I often lie awake\r\nnights, thinking\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, nonsense, child\xe2\x80\x94nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are such a strange\r\nchild!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut may I, mamma? I think,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, timidly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mammy isn\xe2\x80\x99t well.\r\nShe told me her head ached all the time, lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, that\xe2\x80\x99s just one of Mammy\xe2\x80\x99s fidgets! Mammy is just like all the rest\r\nof them\xe2\x80\x94makes such a fuss about every little headache or finger-ache;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99ll never do to encourage it\xe2\x80\x94never! I\xe2\x80\x99m principled about this\r\nmatter,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, turning to Miss Ophelia; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll find the necessity\r\nof it. If you encourage servants in giving way to every little\r\ndisagreeable feeling, and complaining of every little ailment, you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave your hands full. I never complain myself\xe2\x80\x94nobody knows what I\r\nendure. I feel it a duty to bear it quietly, and I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s round eyes expressed an undisguised amazement at this\r\nperoration, which struck St. Clare as so supremely ludicrous, that he\r\nburst into a loud laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Clare always laughs when I make the least allusion to my ill\r\nhealth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, with the voice of a suffering martyr. \xe2\x80\x9cI only hope\r\nthe day won\xe2\x80\x99t come when he\xe2\x80\x99ll remember it!\xe2\x80\x9d and Marie put her\r\nhandkerchief to her eyes.\r\n\r\nOf course, there was rather a foolish silence. Finally, St. Clare got\r\nup, looked at his watch, and said he had an engagement down street. Eva\r\ntripped away after him, and Miss Ophelia and Marie remained at the\r\ntable alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, that\xe2\x80\x99s just like St. Clare!\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, withdrawing her\r\nhandkerchief with somewhat of a spirited flourish when the criminal to\r\nbe affected by it was no longer in sight. \xe2\x80\x9cHe never realizes, never\r\ncan, never will, what I suffer, and have, for years. If I was one of\r\nthe complaining sort, or ever made any fuss about my ailments, there\r\nwould be some reason for it. Men do get tired, naturally, of a\r\ncomplaining wife. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve kept things to myself, and borne, and borne,\r\ntill St. Clare has got in the way of thinking I can bear anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia did not exactly know what she was expected to answer to\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nWhile she was thinking what to say, Marie gradually wiped away her\r\ntears, and smoothed her plumage in a general sort of way, as a dove\r\nmight be supposed to make toilet after a shower, and began a\r\nhousewifely chat with Miss Ophelia, concerning cupboards, closets,\r\nlinen-presses, store-rooms, and other matters, of which the latter was,\r\nby common understanding, to assume the direction,\xe2\x80\x94giving her so many\r\ncautious directions and charges, that a head less systematic and\r\nbusiness-like than Miss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s would have been utterly dizzied and\r\nconfounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you everything; so that,\r\nwhen my next sick turn comes on, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to go forward entirely,\r\nwithout consulting me;\xe2\x80\x94only about Eva,\xe2\x80\x94she requires watching.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe seems to be a good child, very,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia; \xe2\x80\x9cI never saw a\r\nbetter child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cvery. There are things about her so\r\nsingular; she isn\xe2\x80\x99t like me, now, a particle;\xe2\x80\x9d and Marie sighed, as if\r\nthis was a truly melancholy consideration.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia in her own heart said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope she isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d but had\r\nprudence enough to keep it down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva always was disposed to be with servants; and I think that well\r\nenough with some children. Now, I always played with father\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\nnegroes\xe2\x80\x94it never did me any harm. But Eva somehow always seems to put\r\nherself on an equality with every creature that comes near her. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nstrange thing about the child. I never have been able to break her of\r\nit. St. Clare, I believe, encourages her in it. The fact is, St. Clare\r\nindulges every creature under this roof but his own wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Miss Ophelia sat in blank silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way with servants,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, \xe2\x80\x9cbut to _put them\r\ndown_, and keep them down. It was always natural to me, from a child.\r\nEva is enough to spoil a whole house-full. What she will do when she\r\ncomes to keep house herself, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I hold to being\r\n_kind_ to servants\xe2\x80\x94I always am; but you must make \xe2\x80\x99em _know their\r\nplace_. Eva never does; there\xe2\x80\x99s no getting into the child\xe2\x80\x99s head the\r\nfirst beginning of an idea what a servant\xe2\x80\x99s place is! You heard her\r\noffering to take care of me nights, to let Mammy sleep! That\xe2\x80\x99s just a\r\nspecimen of the way the child would be doing all the time, if she was\r\nleft to herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, bluntly, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you think your servants\r\nare human creatures, and ought to have some rest when they are tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, of course. I\xe2\x80\x99m very particular in letting them have\r\neverything that comes convenient,\xe2\x80\x94anything that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t put one at all\r\nout of the way, you know. Mammy can make up her sleep, some time or\r\nother; there\xe2\x80\x99s no difficulty about that. She\xe2\x80\x99s the sleepiest concern\r\nthat ever I saw; sewing, standing, or sitting, that creature will go to\r\nsleep, and sleep anywhere and everywhere. No danger but Mammy gets\r\nsleep enough. But this treating servants as if they were exotic\r\nflowers, or china vases, is really ridiculous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, as she\r\nplunged languidly into the depths of a voluminous and pillowy lounge,\r\nand drew towards her an elegant cut-glass vinaigrette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, in a faint and lady-like voice, like the last\r\ndying breath of an Arabian jessamine, or something equally ethereal,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou see, Cousin Ophelia, I don\xe2\x80\x99t often speak of myself. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t my\r\n_habit_; \xe2\x80\x99t isn\xe2\x80\x99t agreeable to me. In fact, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t strength to do\r\nit. But there are points where St. Clare and I differ. St. Clare never\r\nunderstood me, never appreciated me. I think it lies at the root of all\r\nmy ill health. St. Clare means well, I am bound to believe; but men are\r\nconstitutionally selfish and inconsiderate to woman. That, at least, is\r\nmy impression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia, who had not a small share of the genuine New England\r\ncaution, and a very particular horror of being drawn into family\r\ndifficulties, now began to foresee something of this kind impending;\r\nso, composing her face into a grim neutrality, and drawing out of her\r\npocket about a yard and a quarter of stocking, which she kept as a\r\nspecific against what Dr. Watts asserts to be a personal habit of Satan\r\nwhen people have idle hands, she proceeded to knit most energetically,\r\nshutting her lips together in a way that said, as plain as words could,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t try to make me speak. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything to do with\r\nyour affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in fact, she looked about as sympathizing as a stone\r\nlion. But Marie didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for that. She had got somebody to talk to,\r\nand she felt it her duty to talk, and that was enough; and reinforcing\r\nherself by smelling again at her vinaigrette, she went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I brought my own property and servants into the connection,\r\nwhen I married St. Clare, and I am legally entitled to manage them my\r\nown way. St. Clare had his fortune and his servants, and I\xe2\x80\x99m well\r\nenough content he should manage them his way; but St. Clare will be\r\ninterfering. He has wild, extravagant notions about things,\r\nparticularly about the treatment of servants. He really does act as if\r\nhe set his servants before me, and before himself, too; for he lets\r\nthem make him all sorts of trouble, and never lifts a finger. Now,\r\nabout some things, St. Clare is really frightful\xe2\x80\x94he frightens\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94good-natured as he looks, in general. Now, he has set down his foot\r\nthat, come what will, there shall not be a blow struck in this house,\r\nexcept what he or I strike; and he does it in a way that I really dare\r\nnot cross him. Well, you may see what that leads to; for St. Clare\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t raise his hand, if every one of them walked over him, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94you see how cruel it would be to require me to make the exertion.\r\nNow, you know these servants are nothing but grown-up children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it, and I thank the Lord that I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss Ophelia, shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but you will have to know something, and know it to your cost,\r\nif you stay here. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a provoking, stupid, careless,\r\nunreasonable, childish, ungrateful set of wretches they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarie seemed wonderfully supported, always, when she got upon this\r\ntopic; and she now opened her eyes, and seemed quite to forget her\r\nlanguor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t, the daily, hourly trials that beset a\r\nhousekeeper from them, everywhere and every way. But it\xe2\x80\x99s no use to\r\ncomplain to St. Clare. He talks the strangest stuff. He says we have\r\nmade them what they are, and ought to bear with them. He says their\r\nfaults are all owing to us, and that it would be cruel to make the\r\nfault and punish it too. He says we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do any better, in their\r\nplace; just as if one could reason from them to us, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you believe that the Lord made them of one blood with us?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Ophelia, shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed not I! A pretty story, truly! They are a degraded race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think they\xe2\x80\x99ve got immortal souls?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, with\r\nincreasing indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, yawning, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, of course\xe2\x80\x94nobody doubts that.\r\nBut as to putting them on any sort of equality with us, you know, as if\r\nwe could be compared, why, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible! Now, St. Clare really has\r\ntalked to me as if keeping Mammy from her husband was like keeping me\r\nfrom mine. There\xe2\x80\x99s no comparing in this way. Mammy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the\r\nfeelings that I should. It\xe2\x80\x99s a different thing altogether,\xe2\x80\x94of course,\r\nit is,\xe2\x80\x94and yet St. Clare pretends not to see it. And just as if Mammy\r\ncould love her little dirty babies as I love Eva! Yet St. Clare once\r\nreally and soberly tried to persuade me that it was my duty, with my\r\nweak health, and all I suffer, to let Mammy go back, and take somebody\r\nelse in her place. That was a little too much even for _me_ to bear. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t often show my feelings, I make it a principle to endure\r\neverything in silence; it\xe2\x80\x99s a wife\xe2\x80\x99s hard lot, and I bear it. But I did\r\nbreak out, that time; so that he has never alluded to the subject\r\nsince. But I know by his looks, and little things that he says, that he\r\nthinks so as much as ever; and it\xe2\x80\x99s so trying, so provoking!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia looked very much as if she was afraid she should say\r\nsomething; but she rattled away with her needles in a way that had\r\nvolumes of meaning in it, if Marie could only have understood it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you just see,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to manage. A\r\nhousehold without any rule; where servants have it all their own way,\r\ndo what they please, and have what they please, except so far as I,\r\nwith my feeble health, have kept up government. I keep my cowhide\r\nabout, and sometimes I do lay it on; but the exertion is always too\r\nmuch for me. If St. Clare would only have this thing done as others\r\ndo\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, send them to the calaboose, or some of the other places to be\r\nflogged. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way. If I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a poor, feeble piece, I\r\nbelieve I should manage with twice the energy that St. Clare does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how does St. Clare contrive to manage?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsay he never strikes a blow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, men have a more commanding way, you know; it is easier for them;\r\nbesides, if you ever looked full in his eye, it\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar,\xe2\x80\x94that\r\neye,\xe2\x80\x94and if he speaks decidedly, there\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of flash. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of\r\nit, myself; and the servants know they must mind. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do as much\r\nby a regular storm and scolding as St. Clare can by one turn of his\r\neye, if once he is in earnest. O, there\xe2\x80\x99s no trouble about St. Clare;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the reason he\xe2\x80\x99s no more feeling for me. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll find, when\r\nyou come to manage, that there\xe2\x80\x99s no getting along without\r\nseverity,\xe2\x80\x94they are so bad, so deceitful, so lazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old tune,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, sauntering in. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an awful account\r\nthese wicked creatures will have to settle, at last, especially for\r\nbeing lazy! You see, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as he stretched himself at full\r\nlength on a lounge opposite to Marie, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s wholly inexcusable in them,\r\nin the light of the example that Marie and I set them,\xe2\x80\x94this laziness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, St. Clare, you are too bad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I, now? Why, I thought I was talking good, quite remarkably for me.\r\nI try to enforce your remarks, Marie, always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know you meant no such thing, St. Clare,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I must have been mistaken, then. Thank you, my dear, for setting me\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do really try to be provoking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, come, Marie, the day is growing warm, and I have just had a long\r\nquarrel with Dolph, which has fatigued me excessively; so, pray be\r\nagreeable, now, and let a fellow repose in the light of your smile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter about Dolph?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie. \xe2\x80\x9cThat fellow\xe2\x80\x99s impudence\r\nhas been growing to a point that is perfectly intolerable to me. I only\r\nwish I had the undisputed management of him a while. I\xe2\x80\x99d bring him\r\ndown!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say, my dear, is marked with your usual acuteness and good\r\nsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cAs to Dolph, the case is this: that he has so\r\nlong been engaged in imitating my graces and perfections, that he has,\r\nat last, really mistaken himself for his master; and I have been\r\nobliged to give him a little insight into his mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I was obliged to let him understand explicitly that I preferred\r\nto keep _some_ of my clothes for my own personal wearing; also, I put\r\nhis magnificence upon an allowance of cologne-water, and actually was\r\nso cruel as to restrict him to one dozen of my cambric handkerchiefs.\r\nDolph was particularly huffy about it, and I had to talk to him like a\r\nfather, to bring him round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! St. Clare, when will you learn how to treat your servants? It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabominable, the way you indulge them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, after all, what\xe2\x80\x99s the harm of the poor dog\xe2\x80\x99s wanting to be like\r\nhis master; and if I haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought him up any better than to find his\r\nchief good in cologne and cambric handkerchiefs, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I give\r\nthem to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why haven\xe2\x80\x99t you brought him up better?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, with\r\nblunt determination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo much trouble,\xe2\x80\x94laziness, cousin, laziness,\xe2\x80\x94which ruins more souls\r\nthan you can shake a stick at. If it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for laziness, I should\r\nhave been a perfect angel, myself. I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to think that laziness\r\nis what your old Dr. Botherem, up in Vermont, used to call the \xe2\x80\x98essence\r\nof moral evil.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s an awful consideration, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you slaveholders have an awful responsibility upon you,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it, for a thousand worlds. You ought to\r\neducate your slaves, and treat them like reasonable creatures,\xe2\x80\x94like\r\nimmortal creatures, that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stand before the bar of God\r\nwith. That\xe2\x80\x99s my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good lady, breaking suddenly out with a\r\ntide of zeal that had been gaining strength in her mind all the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! come, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, getting up quickly; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you know\r\nabout us?\xe2\x80\x9d And he sat down to the piano, and rattled a lively piece of\r\nmusic. St. Clare had a decided genius for music. His touch was\r\nbrilliant and firm, and his fingers flew over the keys with a rapid and\r\nbird-like motion, airy, and yet decided. He played piece after piece,\r\nlike a man who is trying to play himself into a good humor. After\r\npushing the music aside, he rose up, and said, gayly, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now,\r\ncousin, you\xe2\x80\x99ve given us a good talk and done your duty; on the whole, I\r\nthink the better of you for it. I make no manner of doubt that you\r\nthrew a very diamond of truth at me, though you see it hit me so\r\ndirectly in the face that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly appreciated, at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any use in such sort of talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure, if anybody does more for servants than we do, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to\r\nknow who; and it don\xe2\x80\x99t do \xe2\x80\x99em a bit good,\xe2\x80\x94not a particle,\xe2\x80\x94they get\r\nworse and worse. As to talking to them, or anything like that, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nI have talked till I was tired and hoarse, telling them their duty, and\r\nall that; and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they can go to church when they like, though\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t understand a word of the sermon, more than so many pigs,\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nit isn\xe2\x80\x99t of any great use for them to go, as I see; but they do go, and\r\nso they have every chance; but, as I said before, they are a degraded\r\nrace, and always will be, and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any help for them; you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake anything of them, if you try. You see, Cousin Ophelia, I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried,\r\nand you haven\xe2\x80\x99t; I was born and bred among them, and I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia thought she had said enough, and therefore sat silent. St.\r\nClare whistled a tune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Clare, I wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t whistle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cit makes my head\r\nworse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything else you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish me\r\nto do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you _would_ have some kind of sympathy for my trials; you never\r\nhave any feeling for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear accusing angel!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s provoking to be talked to in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, how will you be talked to? I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to order,\xe2\x80\x94any way you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmention,\xe2\x80\x94only to give satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA gay laugh from the court rang through the silken curtains of the\r\nverandah. St. Clare stepped out, and lifting up the curtain, laughed\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, coming to the railing.\r\n\r\nThere sat Tom, on a little mossy seat in the court, every one of his\r\nbutton-holes stuck full of cape jessamines, and Eva, gayly laughing,\r\nwas hanging a wreath of roses round his neck; and then she sat down on\r\nhis knee, like a chip-sparrow, still laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Tom, you look so funny!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom had a sober, benevolent smile, and seemed, in his quiet way, to be\r\nenjoying the fun quite as much as his little mistress. He lifted his\r\neyes, when he saw his master, with a half-deprecating, apologetic air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you let her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it seems so dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would think no harm in a child\xe2\x80\x99s caressing a large dog, even if he\r\nwas black; but a creature that can think, and reason, and feel, and is\r\nimmortal, you shudder at; confess it, cousin. I know the feeling among\r\nsome of you northerners well enough. Not that there is a particle of\r\nvirtue in our not having it; but custom with us does what Christianity\r\nought to do,\xe2\x80\x94obliterates the feeling of personal prejudice. I have\r\noften noticed, in my travels north, how much stronger this was with you\r\nthan with us. You loathe them as you would a snake or a toad, yet you\r\nare indignant at their wrongs. You would not have them abused; but you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to have anything to do with them yourselves. You would send\r\nthem to Africa, out of your sight and smell, and then send a missionary\r\nor two to do up all the self-denial of elevating them compendiously.\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cthere may be some\r\ntruth in this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would the poor and lowly do, without children?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare,\r\nleaning on the railing, and watching Eva, as she tripped off, leading\r\nTom with her. \xe2\x80\x9cYour little child is your only true democrat. Tom, now\r\nis a hero to Eva; his stories are wonders in her eyes, his songs and\r\nMethodist hymns are better than an opera, and the traps and little bits\r\nof trash in his pocket a mine of jewels, and he the most wonderful Tom\r\nthat ever wore a black skin. This is one of the roses of Eden that the\r\nLord has dropped down expressly for the poor and lowly, who get few\r\nenough of any other kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s strange, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cone might almost think you\r\nwere a _professor_, to hear you talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA professor?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; a professor of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all; not a professor, as your town-folks have it; and, what is\r\nworse, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, not a _practiser_, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you talk so, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is easier than talking,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe\r\nShakespeare makes somebody say, \xe2\x80\x99I could sooner show twenty what were\r\ngood to be done, than be one of the twenty to follow my own\r\nshowing.\xe2\x80\x98[1] Nothing like division of labor. My forte lies in talking,\r\nand yours, cousin, lies in doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1] _The Merchant of Venice_, Act 1, scene 2, lines 17-18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Tom\xe2\x80\x99s external situation, at this time, there was, as the world\r\nsays, nothing to complain of Little Eva\xe2\x80\x99s fancy for him\xe2\x80\x94the instinctive\r\ngratitude and loveliness of a noble nature\xe2\x80\x94had led her to petition her\r\nfather that he might be her especial attendant, whenever she needed the\r\nescort of a servant, in her walks or rides; and Tom had general orders\r\nto let everything else go, and attend to Miss Eva whenever she wanted\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x94orders which our readers may fancy were far from disagreeable to\r\nhim. He was kept well dressed, for St. Clare was fastidiously\r\nparticular on this point. His stable services were merely a sinecure,\r\nand consisted simply in a daily care and inspection, and directing an\r\nunder-servant in his duties; for Marie St. Clare declared that she\r\ncould not have any smell of the horses about him when he came near her,\r\nand that he must positively not be put to any service that would make\r\nhim unpleasant to her, as her nervous system was entirely inadequate to\r\nany trial of that nature; one snuff of anything disagreeable being,\r\naccording to her account, quite sufficient to close the scene, and put\r\nan end to all her earthly trials at once. Tom, therefore, in his\r\nwell-brushed broadcloth suit, smooth beaver, glossy boots, faultless\r\nwristbands and collar, with his grave, good-natured black face, looked\r\nrespectable enough to be a Bishop of Carthage, as men of his color\r\nwere, in other ages.\r\n\r\nThen, too, he was in a beautiful place, a consideration to which his\r\nsensitive race was never indifferent; and he did enjoy with a quiet joy\r\nthe birds, the flowers, the fountains, the perfume, and light and\r\nbeauty of the court, the silken hangings, and pictures, and lustres,\r\nand statuettes, and gilding, that made the parlors within a kind of\r\nAladdin\xe2\x80\x99s palace to him.\r\n\r\nIf ever Africa shall show an elevated and cultivated race,\xe2\x80\x94and come it\r\nmust, some time, her turn to figure in the great drama of human\r\nimprovement.\xe2\x80\x94life will awake there with a gorgeousness and splendor of\r\nwhich our cold western tribes faintly have conceived. In that far-off\r\nmystic land of gold, and gems, and spices, and waving palms, and\r\nwondrous flowers, and miraculous fertility, will awake new forms of\r\nart, new styles of splendor; and the negro race, no longer despised and\r\ntrodden down, will, perhaps, show forth some of the latest and most\r\nmagnificent revelations of human life. Certainly they will, in their\r\ngentleness, their lowly docility of heart, their aptitude to repose on\r\na superior mind and rest on a higher power, their childlike simplicity\r\nof affection, and facility of forgiveness. In all these they will\r\nexhibit the highest form of the peculiarly _Christian life_, and,\r\nperhaps, as God chasteneth whom he loveth, he hath chosen poor Africa\r\nin the furnace of affliction, to make her the highest and noblest in\r\nthat kingdom which he will set up, when every other kingdom has been\r\ntried, and failed; for the first shall be last, and the last first.\r\n\r\nWas this what Marie St. Clare was thinking of, as she stood, gorgeously\r\ndressed, on the verandah, on Sunday morning, clasping a diamond\r\nbracelet on her slender wrist? Most likely it was. Or, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthat, it was something else; for Marie patronized good things, and she\r\nwas going now, in full force,\xe2\x80\x94diamonds, silk, and lace, and jewels, and\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x94to a fashionable church, to be very religious. Marie always made a\r\npoint to be very pious on Sundays. There she stood, so slender, so\r\nelegant, so airy and undulating in all her motions, her lace scarf\r\nenveloping her like a mist. She looked a graceful creature, and she\r\nfelt very good and very elegant indeed. Miss Ophelia stood at her side,\r\na perfect contrast. It was not that she had not as handsome a silk\r\ndress and shawl, and as fine a pocket-handkerchief; but stiffness and\r\nsquareness, and bolt-uprightness, enveloped her with as indefinite yet\r\nappreciable a presence as did grace her elegant neighbor; not the grace\r\nof God, however,\xe2\x80\x94that is quite another thing!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Eva?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child stopped on the stairs, to say something to Mammy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd what was Eva saying to Mammy on the stairs? Listen, reader, and you\r\nwill hear, though Marie does not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mammy, I know your head is aching dreadfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless you, Miss Eva! my head allers aches lately. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need\r\nto worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99re going out; and here,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the little girl threw\r\nher arms around her,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMammy, you shall take my vinaigrette.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! your beautiful gold thing, thar, with them diamonds! Lor, Miss,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99t wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be proper, no ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? You need it, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t. Mamma always uses it for headache,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99ll make you feel better. No, you shall take it, to please me,\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo hear the darlin talk!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mammy, as Eva thrust it into her bosom,\r\nand kissing her, ran down stairs to her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you stopping for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just stopping to give Mammy my vinaigrette, to take to church\r\nwith her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, stamping impatiently,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyour gold vinaigrette to\r\n_Mammy!_ When will you learn what\xe2\x80\x99s _proper_? Go right and take it back\r\nthis moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEva looked downcast and aggrieved, and turned slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Marie, let the child alone; she shall do as she pleases,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSt. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Clare, how will she ever get along in the world?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord knows,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cbut she\xe2\x80\x99ll get along in heaven\r\nbetter than you or I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, papa, don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, softly touching his elbow; \xe2\x80\x9cit troubles\r\nmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, cousin, are you ready to go to meeting?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia,\r\nturning square about on St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do wish St. Clare ever would go to church,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t a particle of religion about him. It really isn\xe2\x80\x99t respectable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ladies go to church to learn how to\r\nget along in the world, I suppose, and your piety sheds respectability\r\non us. If I did go at all, I would go where Mammy goes; there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething to keep a fellow awake there, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! those shouting Methodists? Horrible!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything but the dead sea of your respectable churches, Marie.\r\nPositively, it\xe2\x80\x99s too much to ask of a man. Eva, do you like to go?\r\nCome, stay at home and play with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, papa; but I\xe2\x80\x99d rather go to church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it dreadful tiresome?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is tiresome, some,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am sleepy, too, but I\r\ntry to keep awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you go for, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you know, papa,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9ccousin told me that God\r\nwants to have us; and he gives us everything, you know; and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmuch to do it, if he wants us to. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t so very tiresome after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou sweet, little obliging soul!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, kissing her; \xe2\x80\x9cgo\r\nalong, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good girl, and pray for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, I always do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, as she sprang after her\r\nmother into the carriage.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare stood on the steps and kissed his hand to her, as the\r\ncarriage drove away; large tears were in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Evangeline! rightly named,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9chath not God made thee an\r\nevangel to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he felt a moment; and then he smoked a cigar, and read the Picayune,\r\nand forgot his little gospel. Was he much unlike other folks?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Evangeline,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s always right and proper\r\nto be kind to servants, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t proper to treat them _just_ as we\r\nwould our relations, or people in our own class of life. Now, if Mammy\r\nwas sick, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to put her in your own bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should feel just like it, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause then it would\r\nbe handier to take care of her, and because, you know, my bed is better\r\nthan hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarie was in utter despair at the entire want of moral perception\r\nevinced in this reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do to make this child understand me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, significantly.\r\n\r\nEva looked sorry and disconcerted for a moment; but children, luckily,\r\ndo not keep to one impression long, and in a few moments she was\r\nmerrily laughing at various things which she saw from the\r\ncoach-windows, as it rattled along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, as they were comfortably seated at the\r\ndinner-table, \xe2\x80\x9cand what was the bill of fare at church today?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Dr. G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 preached a splendid sermon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was just such\r\na sermon as you ought to hear; it expressed all my views exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been very improving,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cThe subject must\r\nhave been an extensive one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I mean all my views about society, and such things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe text was, \xe2\x80\x98He hath made everything beautiful in its season;\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nhe showed how all the orders and distinctions in society came from God;\r\nand that it was so appropriate, you know, and beautiful, that some\r\nshould be high and some low, and that some were born to rule and some\r\nto serve, and all that, you know; and he applied it so well to all this\r\nridiculous fuss that is made about slavery, and he proved distinctly\r\nthat the Bible was on our side, and supported all our institutions so\r\nconvincingly. I only wish you\xe2\x80\x99d heard him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need it,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cI can learn what does me as\r\nmuch good as that from the Picayune, any time, and smoke a cigar\r\nbesides; which I can\xe2\x80\x99t do, you know, in a church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you believe in these views?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho,\xe2\x80\x94I? You know I\xe2\x80\x99m such a graceless dog that these religious aspects\r\nof such subjects don\xe2\x80\x99t edify me much. If I was to say anything on this\r\nslavery matter, I would say out, fair and square, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re in for it;\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got \xe2\x80\x99em, and mean to keep \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s for our convenience and our\r\ninterest;\xe2\x80\x99 for that\xe2\x80\x99s the long and short of it,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s just the whole\r\nof what all this sanctified stuff amounts to, after all; and I think\r\nthat it will be intelligible to everybody, everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do think, Augustine, you are so irreverent!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie. \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s shocking to hear you talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShocking! it\xe2\x80\x99s the truth. This religious talk on such matters,\xe2\x80\x94why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t they carry it a little further, and show the beauty, in its\r\nseason, of a fellow\xe2\x80\x99s taking a glass too much, and sitting a little too\r\nlate over his cards, and various providential arrangements of that\r\nsort, which are pretty frequent among us young men;\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear\r\nthat those are right and godly, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think slavery right or wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to have any of your horrid New England directness,\r\ncousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, gayly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I answer that question, I know\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be at me with half a dozen others, each one harder than the\r\nlast; and I\xe2\x80\x99m not a going to define my position. I am one of the sort\r\nthat lives by throwing stones at other people\xe2\x80\x99s glass houses, but I\r\nnever mean to put up one for them to stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the way he\xe2\x80\x99s always talking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nany satisfaction out of him. I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s just because he don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nreligion, that he\xe2\x80\x99s always running out in this way he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReligion!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, in a tone that made both ladies look at\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cReligion! Is what you hear at church, religion? Is that which can\r\nbend and turn, and descend and ascend, to fit every crooked phase of\r\nselfish, worldly society, religion? Is that religion which is less\r\nscrupulous, less generous, less just, less considerate for man, than\r\neven my own ungodly, worldly, blinded nature? No! When I look for a\r\nreligion, I must look for something above me, and not something\r\nbeneath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that the Bible justifies slavery,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nOphelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Bible was my _mother\xe2\x80\x99s_ book,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cBy it she lived\r\nand died, and I would be very sorry to think it did. I\xe2\x80\x99d as soon desire\r\nto have it proved that my mother could drink brandy, chew tobacco, and\r\nswear, by way of satisfying me that I did right in doing the same. It\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make me at all more satisfied with these things in myself, and\r\nit would take from me the comfort of respecting her; and it really is a\r\ncomfort, in this world, to have anything one can respect. In short, you\r\nsee,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, suddenly resuming his gay tone, \xe2\x80\x9call I want is that\r\ndifferent things be kept in different boxes. The whole frame-work of\r\nsociety, both in Europe and America, is made up of various things which\r\nwill not stand the scrutiny of any very ideal standard of morality.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s pretty generally understood that men don\xe2\x80\x99t aspire after the\r\nabsolute right, but only to do about as well as the rest of the world.\r\nNow, when any one speaks up, like a man, and says slavery is necessary\r\nto us, we can\xe2\x80\x99t get along without it, we should be beggared if we give\r\nit up, and, of course, we mean to hold on to it,\xe2\x80\x94this is strong, clear,\r\nwell-defined language; it has the respectability of truth to it; and,\r\nif we may judge by their practice, the majority of the world will bear\r\nus out in it. But when he begins to put on a long face, and snuffle,\r\nand quote Scripture, I incline to think he isn\xe2\x80\x99t much better than he\r\nshould be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very uncharitable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose that something should bring down the\r\nprice of cotton once and forever, and make the whole slave property a\r\ndrug in the market, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think we should soon have another version\r\nof the Scripture doctrine? What a flood of light would pour into the\r\nchurch, all at once, and how immediately it would be discovered that\r\neverything in the Bible and reason went the other way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, as she reclined herself on a lounge,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thankful I\xe2\x80\x99m born where slavery exists; and I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright,\xe2\x80\x94indeed, I feel it must be; and, at any rate, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget along without it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, what do you think, Pussy?\xe2\x80\x9d said her father to Eva, who came in\r\nat this moment, with a flower in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, which do you like the best,\xe2\x80\x94to live as they do at your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nup in Vermont, or to have a house-full of servants, as we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, of course, our way is the pleasantest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, stroking her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it makes so many more round you to love, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva,\r\nlooking up earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, that\xe2\x80\x99s just like Eva,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cjust one of her odd\r\nspeeches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it an odd speech, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, whisperingly, as she got upon\r\nhis knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather, as this world goes, Pussy,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cBut where has my\r\nlittle Eva been, all dinner-time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been up in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s room, hearing him sing, and Aunt Dinah gave\r\nme my dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHearing Tom sing, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, yes! he sings such beautiful things about the New Jerusalem, and\r\nbright angels, and the land of Canaan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say; it\xe2\x80\x99s better than the opera, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to teach them to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSinging lessons, hey?\xe2\x80\x94you _are_ coming on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he sings for me, and I read to him in my Bible; and he explains\r\nwhat it means, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the latest joke of the\r\nseason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad hand, now, at explaining Scripture, I\xe2\x80\x99ll dare swear,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cTom has a natural genius for religion. I wanted the\r\nhorses out early, this morning, and I stole up to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s cubiculum\r\nthere, over the stables, and there I heard him holding a meeting by\r\nhimself; and, in fact, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard anything quite so savory as\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s prayer, this some time. He put in for me, with a zeal that was\r\nquite apostolic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he guessed you were listening. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of that trick\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he did, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very polite; for he gave the Lord his opinion of\r\nme, pretty freely. Tom seemed to think there was decidedly room for\r\nimprovement in me, and seemed very earnest that I should be converted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll lay it to heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you are much of the same opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\r\nshall see,\xe2\x80\x94shan\xe2\x80\x99t we, Eva?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\nThe Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Defence\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a gentle bustle at the Quaker house, as the afternoon drew to\r\na close. Rachel Halliday moved quietly to and fro, collecting from her\r\nhousehold stores such needments as could be arranged in the smallest\r\ncompass, for the wanderers who were to go forth that night. The\r\nafternoon shadows stretched eastward, and the round red sun stood\r\nthoughtfully on the horizon, and his beams shone yellow and calm into\r\nthe little bed-room where George and his wife were sitting. He was\r\nsitting with his child on his knee, and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s hand in his. Both\r\nlooked thoughtful and serious and traces of tears were on their cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Eliza,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cI know all you say is true. You are a good\r\nchild,\xe2\x80\x94a great deal better than I am; and I will try to do as you say.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll try to act worthy of a free man. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to feel like a\r\nChristian. God Almighty knows that I\xe2\x80\x99ve meant to do well,\xe2\x80\x94tried hard to\r\ndo well,\xe2\x80\x94when everything has been against me; and now I\xe2\x80\x99ll forget all\r\nthe past, and put away every hard and bitter feeling, and read my\r\nBible, and learn to be a good man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when we get to Canada,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, \xe2\x80\x9cI can help you. I can do\r\ndress-making very well; and I understand fine washing and ironing; and\r\nbetween us we can find something to live on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Eliza, so long as we have each other and our boy. O! Eliza, if\r\nthese people only knew what a blessing it is for a man to feel that his\r\nwife and child belong to _him_! I\xe2\x80\x99ve often wondered to see men that\r\ncould call their wives and children _their own_ fretting and worrying\r\nabout anything else. Why, I feel rich and strong, though we have\r\nnothing but our bare hands. I feel as if I could scarcely ask God for\r\nany more. Yes, though I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked hard every day, till I am twenty-five\r\nyears old, and have not a cent of money, nor a roof to cover me, nor a\r\nspot of land to call my own, yet, if they will only let me alone now, I\r\nwill be satisfied,\xe2\x80\x94thankful; I will work, and send back the money for\r\nyou and my boy. As to my old master, he has been paid five times over\r\nfor all he ever spent for me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t owe him anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut yet we are not quite out of danger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not yet\r\nin Canada.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it seems as if I smelt the free air, and it\r\nmakes me strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, voices were heard in the outer apartment, in earnest\r\nconversation, and very soon a rap was heard on the door. Eliza started\r\nand opened it.\r\n\r\nSimeon Halliday was there, and with him a Quaker brother, whom he\r\nintroduced as Phineas Fletcher. Phineas was tall and lathy, red-haired,\r\nwith an expression of great acuteness and shrewdness in his face. He\r\nhad not the placid, quiet, unworldly air of Simeon Halliday; on the\r\ncontrary, a particularly wide-awake and _au fait_ appearance, like a\r\nman who rather prides himself on knowing what he is about, and keeping\r\na bright lookout ahead; peculiarities which sorted rather oddly with\r\nhis broad brim and formal phraseology.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur friend Phineas hath discovered something of importance to the\r\ninterests of thee and thy party, George,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon; \xe2\x80\x9cit were well\r\nfor thee to hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas, \xe2\x80\x9cand it shows the use of a man\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nsleeping with one ear open, in certain places, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve always said.\r\nLast night I stopped at a little lone tavern, back on the road. Thee\r\nremembers the place, Simeon, where we sold some apples, last year, to\r\nthat fat woman, with the great ear-rings. Well, I was tired with hard\r\ndriving; and, after my supper I stretched myself down on a pile of bags\r\nin the corner, and pulled a buffalo over me, to wait till my bed was\r\nready; and what does I do, but get fast asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith one ear open, Phineas?\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I slept, ears and all, for an hour or two, for I was pretty well\r\ntired; but when I came to myself a little, I found that there were some\r\nmen in the room, sitting round a table, drinking and talking; and I\r\nthought, before I made much muster, I\xe2\x80\x99d just see what they were up to,\r\nespecially as I heard them say something about the Quakers. \xe2\x80\x98So,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\none, \xe2\x80\x98they are up in the Quaker settlement, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x99 says he. Then I\r\nlistened with both ears, and I found that they were talking about this\r\nvery party. So I lay and heard them lay off all their plans. This young\r\nman, they said, was to be sent back to Kentucky, to his master, who was\r\ngoing to make an example of him, to keep all niggers from running away;\r\nand his wife two of them were going to run down to New Orleans to sell,\r\non their own account, and they calculated to get sixteen or eighteen\r\nhundred dollars for her; and the child, they said, was going to a\r\ntrader, who had bought him; and then there was the boy, Jim, and his\r\nmother, they were to go back to their masters in Kentucky. They said\r\nthat there were two constables, in a town a little piece ahead, who\r\nwould go in with \xe2\x80\x99em to get \xe2\x80\x99em taken up, and the young woman was to be\r\ntaken before a judge; and one of the fellows, who is small and\r\nsmooth-spoken, was to swear to her for his property, and get her\r\ndelivered over to him to take south. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got a right notion of the\r\ntrack we are going tonight; and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be down after us, six or eight\r\nstrong. So now, what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe group that stood in various attitudes, after this communication,\r\nwere worthy of a painter. Rachel Halliday, who had taken her hands out\r\nof a batch of biscuit, to hear the news, stood with them upraised and\r\nfloury, and with a face of the deepest concern. Simeon looked\r\nprofoundly thoughtful; Eliza had thrown her arms around her husband,\r\nand was looking up to him. George stood with clenched hands and glowing\r\neyes, and looking as any other man might look, whose wife was to be\r\nsold at auction, and son sent to a trader, all under the shelter of a\r\nChristian nation\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _shall_ we do, George?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what _I_ shall do,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, as he stepped into the little\r\nroom, and began examining pistols.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas, nodding his head to Simeon; \xe2\x80\x9cthou seest,\r\nSimeon, how it will work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon, sighing; \xe2\x80\x9cI pray it come not to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to involve any one with or for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nwill lend me your vehicle and direct me, I will drive alone to the next\r\nstand. Jim is a giant in strength, and brave as death and despair, and\r\nso am I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas, \xe2\x80\x9cbut thee\xe2\x80\x99ll need a driver, for all\r\nthat. Thee\xe2\x80\x99s quite welcome to do all the fighting, thee knows; but I\r\nknow a thing or two about the road, that thee doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to involve you,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInvolve,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas, with a curious and keen expression of face,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen thee does involve me, please to let me know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhineas is a wise and skilful man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon. \xe2\x80\x9cThee does well,\r\nGeorge, to abide by his judgment; and,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, laying his hand\r\nkindly on George\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and pointing to the pistols, \xe2\x80\x9cbe not over\r\nhasty with these,\xe2\x80\x94young blood is hot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will attack no man,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I ask of this country is to\r\nbe let alone, and I will go out peaceably; but,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he paused, and his\r\nbrow darkened and his face worked,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a sister sold in that New\r\nOrleans market. I know what they are sold for; and am I going to stand\r\nby and see them take my wife and sell her, when God has given me a pair\r\nof strong arms to defend her? No; God help me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll fight to the last\r\nbreath, before they shall take my wife and son. Can you blame me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMortal man cannot blame thee, George. Flesh and blood could not do\r\notherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon. \xe2\x80\x9cWoe unto the world because of offences, but\r\nwoe unto them through whom the offence cometh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould not even you, sir, do the same, in my place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray that I be not tried,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon; \xe2\x80\x9cthe flesh is weak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think my flesh would be pretty tolerable strong, in such a case,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Phineas, stretching out a pair of arms like the sails of a\r\nwindmill. \xe2\x80\x9cI an\xe2\x80\x99t sure, friend George, that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold a fellow\r\nfor thee, if thee had any accounts to settle with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf man should _ever_ resist evil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon, \xe2\x80\x9cthen George should\r\nfeel free to do it now: but the leaders of our people taught a more\r\nexcellent way; for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of\r\nGod; but it goes sorely against the corrupt will of man, and none can\r\nreceive it save they to whom it is given. Let us pray the Lord that we\r\nbe not tempted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so _I_ do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if we are tempted too much\xe2\x80\x94why, let\r\nthem look out, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite plain thee wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born a Friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon, smiling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old nature hath its way in thee pretty strong as yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, Phineas had been a hearty, two-fisted backwoodsman,\r\na vigorous hunter, and a dead shot at a buck; but, having wooed a\r\npretty Quakeress, had been moved by the power of her charms to join the\r\nsociety in his neighborhood; and though he was an honest, sober, and\r\nefficient member, and nothing particular could be alleged against him,\r\nyet the more spiritual among them could not but discern an exceeding\r\nlack of savor in his developments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend Phineas will ever have ways of his own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel Halliday,\r\nsmiling; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we all think that his heart is in the right place, after\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t it best that we hasten our flight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got up at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and came on with all speed, full two or\r\nthree hours ahead of them, if they start at the time they planned. It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t safe to start till dark, at any rate; for there are some evil\r\npersons in the villages ahead, that might be disposed to meddle with\r\nus, if they saw our wagon, and that would delay us more than the\r\nwaiting; but in two hours I think we may venture. I will go over to\r\nMichael Cross, and engage him to come behind on his swift nag, and keep\r\na bright lookout on the road, and warn us if any company of men come\r\non. Michael keeps a horse that can soon get ahead of most other horses;\r\nand he could shoot ahead and let us know, if there were any danger. I\r\nam going out now to warn Jim and the old woman to be in readiness, and\r\nto see about the horse. We have a pretty fair start, and stand a good\r\nchance to get to the stand before they can come up with us. So, have\r\ngood courage, friend George; this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first ugly scrape that I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen in with thy people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas, as he closed the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhineas is pretty shrewd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will do the best that can\r\nbe done for thee, George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I am sorry for,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cis the risk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee\xe2\x80\x99ll much oblige us, friend George, to say no more about that. What\r\nwe do we are conscience bound to do; we can do no other way. And now,\r\nmother,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning to Rachel, \xe2\x80\x9churry thy preparations for these\r\nfriends, for we must not send them away fasting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd while Rachel and her children were busy making corn-cake, and\r\ncooking ham and chicken, and hurrying on the _et ceteras_ of the\r\nevening meal, George and his wife sat in their little room, with their\r\narms folded about each other, in such talk as husband and wife have\r\nwhen they know that a few hours may part them forever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEliza,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cpeople that have friends, and houses, and lands,\r\nand money, and all those things _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ love as we do, who have nothing\r\nbut each other. Till I knew you, Eliza, no creature had loved me, but\r\nmy poor, heart-broken mother and sister. I saw poor Emily that morning\r\nthe trader carried her off. She came to the corner where I was lying\r\nasleep, and said, \xe2\x80\x99Poor George, your last friend is going. What will\r\nbecome of you, poor boy?\xe2\x80\x99 And I got up and threw my arms round her, and\r\ncried and sobbed, and she cried too; and those were the last kind words\r\nI got for ten long years; and my heart all withered up, and felt as dry\r\nas ashes, till I met you. And your loving me,\xe2\x80\x94why, it was almost like\r\nraising one from the dead! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a new man ever since! And now,\r\nEliza, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give my last drop of blood, but they _shall not_ take you\r\nfrom me. Whoever gets you must walk over my dead body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Lord, have mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, sobbing. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he will only let us get\r\nout of this country together, that is all we ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs God on their side?\xe2\x80\x9d said George, speaking less to his wife than\r\npouring out his own bitter thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he see all they do? Why does\r\nhe let such things happen? And they tell us that the Bible is on their\r\nside; certainly all the power is. They are rich, and healthy, and\r\nhappy; they are members of churches, expecting to go to heaven; and\r\nthey get along so easy in the world, and have it all their own way; and\r\npoor, honest, faithful Christians,\xe2\x80\x94Christians as good or better than\r\nthey,\xe2\x80\x94are lying in the very dust under their feet. They buy \xe2\x80\x99em and\r\nsell \xe2\x80\x99em, and make trade of their heart\xe2\x80\x99s blood, and groans and\r\ntears,\xe2\x80\x94and God _lets_ them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend George,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon, from the kitchen, \xe2\x80\x9clisten to this Psalm;\r\nit may do thee good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge drew his seat near the door, and Eliza, wiping her tears, came\r\nforward also to listen, while Simeon read as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well-nigh\r\nslipped. For I was envious of the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of\r\nthe wicked. They are not in trouble like other men, neither are they\r\nplagued like other men. Therefore, pride compasseth them as a chain;\r\nviolence covereth them as a garment. Their eyes stand out with fatness;\r\nthey have more than heart could wish. They are corrupt, and speak\r\nwickedly concerning oppression; they speak loftily. Therefore his\r\npeople return, and the waters of a full cup are wrung out to them, and\r\nthey say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs not that the way thee feels, George?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said George,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cas well as I could have written it\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I thought to know this, it was too\r\npainful for me until I went unto the sanctuary of God. Then understood\r\nI their end. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places, thou\r\ncastedst them down to destruction. As a dream when one awaketh, so, oh\r\nLord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. Nevertheless I\r\nam continually with thee; thou hast holden me by my right hand. Thou\r\nshalt guide me by thy counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory. It\r\nis good for me to draw near unto God. I have put my trust in the Lord\r\nGod.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n [1] Ps. 73, \xe2\x80\x9cThe End of the Wicked contrasted with that of the\r\n Righteous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words of holy trust, breathed by the friendly old man, stole like\r\nsacred music over the harassed and chafed spirit of George; and after\r\nhe ceased, he sat with a gentle and subdued expression on his fine\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this world were all, George,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon, \xe2\x80\x9cthee might, indeed, ask\r\nwhere is the Lord? But it is often those who have least of all in this\r\nlife whom he chooseth for the kingdom. Put thy trust in him and, no\r\nmatter what befalls thee here, he will make all right hereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf these words had been spoken by some easy, self-indulgent exhorter,\r\nfrom whose mouth they might have come merely as pious and rhetorical\r\nflourish, proper to be used to people in distress, perhaps they might\r\nnot have had much effect; but coming from one who daily and calmly\r\nrisked fine and imprisonment for the cause of God and man, they had a\r\nweight that could not but be felt, and both the poor, desolate\r\nfugitives found calmness and strength breathing into them from it.\r\n\r\nAnd now Rachel took Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s hand kindly, and led the way to the\r\nsupper-table. As they were sitting down, a light tap sounded at the\r\ndoor, and Ruth entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just ran in,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith these little stockings for the\r\nboy,\xe2\x80\x94three pair, nice, warm woollen ones. It will be so cold, thee\r\nknows, in Canada. Does thee keep up good courage, Eliza?\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\ntripping round to Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s side of the table, and shaking her warmly by\r\nthe hand, and slipping a seed-cake into Harry\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI brought a\r\nlittle parcel of these for him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, tugging at her pocket to get\r\nout the package. \xe2\x80\x9cChildren, thee knows, will always be eating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, thank you; you are too kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Ruth, sit down to supper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, any way. I left John with the baby, and some biscuits in\r\nthe oven; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t stay a moment, else John will burn up all the\r\nbiscuits, and give the baby all the sugar in the bowl. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way\r\nhe does,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little Quakeress, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, good-by, Eliza;\r\ngood-by, George; the Lord grant thee a safe journey;\xe2\x80\x9d and, with a few\r\ntripping steps, Ruth was out of the apartment.\r\n\r\nA little while after supper, a large covered-wagon drew up before the\r\ndoor; the night was clear starlight; and Phineas jumped briskly down\r\nfrom his seat to arrange his passengers. George walked out of the door,\r\nwith his child on one arm and his wife on the other. His step was firm,\r\nhis face settled and resolute. Rachel and Simeon came out after them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou get out, a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas to those inside, \xe2\x80\x9cand let me fix\r\nthe back of the wagon, there, for the women-folks and the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are the two buffaloes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cMake the seats as\r\ncomfortable as may be; it\xe2\x80\x99s hard riding all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim came out first, and carefully assisted out his old mother, who\r\nclung to his arm, and looked anxiously about, as if she expected the\r\npursuer every moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim, are your pistols all in order?\xe2\x80\x9d said George, in a low, firm\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt what you shall do, if they come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rather think I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jim, throwing open his broad chest,\r\nand taking a deep breath. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them get mother\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this brief colloquy, Eliza had been taking her leave of her kind\r\nfriend, Rachel, and was handed into the carriage by Simeon, and,\r\ncreeping into the back part with her boy, sat down among the\r\nbuffalo-skins. The old woman was next handed in and seated and George\r\nand Jim placed on a rough board seat front of them, and Phineas mounted\r\nin front.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon, from without.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d answered all from within.\r\n\r\nAnd the wagon drove off, rattling and jolting over the frozen road.\r\n\r\nThere was no opportunity for conversation, on account of the roughness\r\nof the way and the noise of the wheels. The vehicle, therefore, rumbled\r\non, through long, dark stretches of woodland,\xe2\x80\x94over wide dreary\r\nplains,\xe2\x80\x94up hills, and down valleys,\xe2\x80\x94and on, on, on they jogged, hour\r\nafter hour. The child soon fell asleep, and lay heavily in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlap. The poor, frightened old woman at last forgot her fears; and, even\r\nEliza, as the night waned, found all her anxieties insufficient to keep\r\nher eyes from closing. Phineas seemed, on the whole, the briskest of\r\nthe company, and beguiled his long drive with whistling certain very\r\nunquaker-like songs, as he went on.\r\n\r\nBut about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock George\xe2\x80\x99s ear caught the hasty and decided click\r\nof a horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoof coming behind them at some distance and jogged\r\nPhineas by the elbow. Phineas pulled up his horses, and listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must be Michael,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI think I know the sound of his\r\ngallop;\xe2\x80\x9d and he rose up and stretched his head anxiously back over the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nA man riding in hot haste was now dimly descried at the top of a\r\ndistant hill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is, I do believe!\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas. George and Jim both sprang\r\nout of the wagon before they knew what they were doing. All stood\r\nintensely silent, with their faces turned towards the expected\r\nmessenger. On he came. Now he went down into a valley, where they could\r\nnot see him; but they heard the sharp, hasty tramp, rising nearer and\r\nnearer; at last they saw him emerge on the top of an eminence, within\r\nhail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s Michael!\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas; and, raising his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cHalloa,\r\nthere, Michael!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhineas! is that thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; what news\xe2\x80\x94they coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight on behind, eight or ten of them, hot with brandy, swearing and\r\nfoaming like so many wolves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, just as he spoke, a breeze brought the faint sound of galloping\r\nhorsemen towards them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn with you,\xe2\x80\x94quick, boys, _in!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you must fight,\r\nwait till I get you a piece ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d And, with the word, both jumped in,\r\nand Phineas lashed the horses to a run, the horseman keeping close\r\nbeside them. The wagon rattled, jumped, almost flew, over the frozen\r\nground; but plainer, and still plainer, came the noise of pursuing\r\nhorsemen behind. The women heard it, and, looking anxiously out, saw,\r\nfar in the rear, on the brow of a distant hill, a party of men looming\r\nup against the red-streaked sky of early dawn. Another hill, and their\r\npursuers had evidently caught sight of their wagon, whose white\r\ncloth-covered top made it conspicuous at some distance, and a loud yell\r\nof brutal triumph came forward on the wind. Eliza sickened, and\r\nstrained her child closer to her bosom; the old woman prayed and\r\ngroaned, and George and Jim clenched their pistols with the grasp of\r\ndespair. The pursuers gained on them fast; the carriage made a sudden\r\nturn, and brought them near a ledge of a steep overhanging rock, that\r\nrose in an isolated ridge or clump in a large lot, which was, all\r\naround it, quite clear and smooth. This isolated pile, or range of\r\nrocks, rose up black and heavy against the brightening sky, and seemed\r\nto promise shelter and concealment. It was a place well known to\r\nPhineas, who had been familiar with the spot in his hunting days; and\r\nit was to gain this point he had been racing his horses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow for it!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, suddenly checking his horses, and springing from\r\nhis seat to the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cOut with you, in a twinkling, every one, and\r\nup into these rocks with me. Michael, thee tie thy horse to the wagon,\r\nand drive ahead to Amariah\xe2\x80\x99s and get him and his boys to come back and\r\ntalk to these fellows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a twinkling they were all out of the carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas, catching up Harry, \xe2\x80\x9cyou, each of you, see to the\r\nwomen; and run, _now_ if you ever _did_ run!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey needed no exhortation. Quicker than we can say it, the whole party\r\nwere over the fence, making with all speed for the rocks, while\r\nMichael, throwing himself from his horse, and fastening the bridle to\r\nthe wagon, began driving it rapidly away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas, as they reached the rocks, and saw in the\r\nmingled starlight and dawn, the traces of a rude but plainly marked\r\nfoot-path leading up among them; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is one of our old hunting-dens.\r\nCome up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhineas went before, springing up the rocks like a goat, with the boy\r\nin his arms. Jim came second, bearing his trembling old mother over his\r\nshoulder, and George and Eliza brought up the rear. The party of\r\nhorsemen came up to the fence, and, with mingled shouts and oaths, were\r\ndismounting, to prepare to follow them. A few moments\xe2\x80\x99 scrambling\r\nbrought them to the top of the ledge; the path then passed between a\r\nnarrow defile, where only one could walk at a time, till suddenly they\r\ncame to a rift or chasm more than a yard in breadth, and beyond which\r\nlay a pile of rocks, separate from the rest of the ledge, standing full\r\nthirty feet high, with its sides steep and perpendicular as those of a\r\ncastle. Phineas easily leaped the chasm, and sat down the boy on a\r\nsmooth, flat platform of crisp white moss, that covered the top of the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver with you!\xe2\x80\x9d he called; \xe2\x80\x9cspring, now, once, for your lives!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, as one after another sprang across. Several fragments of loose\r\nstone formed a kind of breast-work, which sheltered their position from\r\nthe observation of those below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here we all are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas, peeping over the stone\r\nbreast-work to watch the assailants, who were coming tumultuously up\r\nunder the rocks. \xe2\x80\x9cLet \xe2\x80\x99em get us, if they can. Whoever comes here has\r\nto walk single file between those two rocks, in fair range of your\r\npistols, boys, d\xe2\x80\x99ye see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do see,\xe2\x80\x9d said George! \xe2\x80\x9cand now, as this matter is ours, let us take\r\nall the risk, and do all the fighting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee\xe2\x80\x99s quite welcome to do the fighting, George,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas,\r\nchewing some checkerberry-leaves as he spoke; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I may have the fun\r\nof looking on, I suppose. But see, these fellows are kinder debating\r\ndown there, and looking up, like hens when they are going to fly up on\r\nto the roost. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thee better give \xe2\x80\x99em a word of advice, before they\r\ncome up, just to tell \xe2\x80\x99em handsomely they\xe2\x80\x99ll be shot if they do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe party beneath, now more apparent in the light of the dawn,\r\nconsisted of our old acquaintances, Tom Loker and Marks, with two\r\nconstables, and a posse consisting of such rowdies at the last tavern\r\nas could be engaged by a little brandy to go and help the fun of\r\ntrapping a set of niggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Tom, yer coons are farly treed,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I see \xe2\x80\x99em go up right here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cand here\xe2\x80\x99s a path. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nfor going right up. They can\xe2\x80\x99t jump down in a hurry, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nlong to ferret \xe2\x80\x99em out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Tom, they might fire at us from behind the rocks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be ugly, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with a sneer. \xe2\x80\x9cAlways for saving your skin, Marks! No\r\ndanger! niggers are too plaguy scared!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I _shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ save my skin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbest I\xe2\x80\x99ve got; and niggers _do_ fight like the devil, sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, George appeared on the top of a rock above them, and,\r\nspeaking in a calm, clear voice, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, who are you, down there, and what do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want a party of runaway niggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Loker. \xe2\x80\x9cOne George\r\nHarris, and Eliza Harris, and their son, and Jim Selden, and an old\r\nwoman. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the officers, here, and a warrant to take \xe2\x80\x99em; and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re going to have \xe2\x80\x99em, too. D\xe2\x80\x99ye hear? An\xe2\x80\x99t you George Harris, that\r\nbelongs to Mr. Harris, of Shelby county, Kentucky?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am George Harris. A Mr. Harris, of Kentucky, did call me his\r\nproperty. But now I\xe2\x80\x99m a free man, standing on God\xe2\x80\x99s free soil; and my\r\nwife and my child I claim as mine. Jim and his mother are here. We have\r\narms to defend ourselves, and we mean to do it. You can come up, if you\r\nlike; but the first one of you that comes within the range of our\r\nbullets is a dead man, and the next, and the next; and so on till the\r\nlast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, come! come!\xe2\x80\x9d said a short, puffy man, stepping forward, and blowing\r\nhis nose as he did so. \xe2\x80\x9cYoung man, this an\xe2\x80\x99t no kind of talk at all for\r\nyou. You see, we\xe2\x80\x99re officers of justice. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the law on our side,\r\nand the power, and so forth; so you\xe2\x80\x99d better give up peaceably, you\r\nsee; for you\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly have to give up, at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know very well that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the law on your side, and the power,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid George, bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to take my wife to sell in New\r\nOrleans, and put my boy like a calf in a trader\xe2\x80\x99s pen, and send Jim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nold mother to the brute that whipped and abused her before, because he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t abuse her son. You want to send Jim and me back to be whipped\r\nand tortured, and ground down under the heels of them that you call\r\nmasters; and your laws _will_ bear you out in it,\xe2\x80\x94more shame for you\r\nand them! But you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got us. We don\xe2\x80\x99t own your laws; we don\xe2\x80\x99t own\r\nyour country; we stand here as free, under God\xe2\x80\x99s sky, as you are; and,\r\nby the great God that made us, we\xe2\x80\x99ll fight for our liberty till we\r\ndie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge stood out in fair sight, on the top of the rock, as he made his\r\ndeclaration of independence; the glow of dawn gave a flush to his\r\nswarthy cheek, and bitter indignation and despair gave fire to his dark\r\neye; and, as if appealing from man to the justice of God, he raised his\r\nhand to heaven as he spoke.\r\n\r\nIf it had been only a Hungarian youth, now bravely defending in some\r\nmountain fastness the retreat of fugitives escaping from Austria into\r\nAmerica, this would have been sublime heroism; but as it was a youth of\r\nAfrican descent, defending the retreat of fugitives through America\r\ninto Canada, of course we are too well instructed and patriotic to see\r\nany heroism in it; and if any of our readers do, they must do it on\r\ntheir own private responsibility. When despairing Hungarian fugitives\r\nmake their way, against all the search-warrants and authorities of\r\ntheir lawful government, to America, press and political cabinet ring\r\nwith applause and welcome. When despairing African fugitives do the\r\nsame thing,\xe2\x80\x94it is\xe2\x80\x94what _is_ it?\r\n\r\nBe it as it may, it is certain that the attitude, eye, voice, manner,\r\nof the speaker for a moment struck the party below to silence. There is\r\nsomething in boldness and determination that for a time hushes even the\r\nrudest nature. Marks was the only one who remained wholly untouched. He\r\nwas deliberately cocking his pistol, and, in the momentary silence that\r\nfollowed George\xe2\x80\x99s speech, he fired at him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FREEMAN\xe2\x80\x99S DEFENCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe see ye get jist as much for him dead as alive in Kentucky,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\ncoolly, as he wiped his pistol on his coat-sleeve.\r\n\r\nGeorge sprang backward,\xe2\x80\x94Eliza uttered a shriek,\xe2\x80\x94the ball had passed\r\nclose to his hair, had nearly grazed the cheek of his wife, and struck\r\nin the tree above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, Eliza,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee\xe2\x80\x99d better keep out of sight, with thy speechifying,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re mean scamps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Jim,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9clook that your pistols are all right, and\r\nwatch that pass with me. The first man that shows himself I fire at;\r\nyou take the second, and so on. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do, you know, to waste two\r\nshots on one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what if you don\xe2\x80\x99t hit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _shall_ hit,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, coolly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! now, there\xe2\x80\x99s stuff in that fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Phineas, between\r\nhis teeth.\r\n\r\nThe party below, after Marks had fired, stood, for a moment, rather\r\nundecided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you must have hit some on \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the men. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard\r\na squeal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going right up for one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cI never was afraid of niggers,\r\nand I an\xe2\x80\x99t going to be now. Who goes after?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, springing up the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nGeorge heard the words distinctly. He drew up his pistol, examined it,\r\npointed it towards that point in the defile where the first man would\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nOne of the most courageous of the party followed Tom, and, the way\r\nbeing thus made, the whole party began pushing up the rock,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nhindermost pushing the front ones faster than they would have gone of\r\nthemselves. On they came, and in a moment the burly form of Tom\r\nappeared in sight, almost at the verge of the chasm.\r\n\r\nGeorge fired,\xe2\x80\x94the shot entered his side,\xe2\x80\x94but, though wounded, he would\r\nnot retreat, but, with a yell like that of a mad bull, he was leaping\r\nright across the chasm into the party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas, suddenly stepping to the front, and meeting him\r\nwith a push from his long arms, \xe2\x80\x9cthee isn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDown he fell into the chasm, crackling down among trees, bushes, logs,\r\nloose stones, till he lay bruised and groaning thirty feet below. The\r\nfall might have killed him, had it not been broken and moderated by his\r\nclothes catching in the branches of a large tree; but he came down with\r\nsome force, however,\xe2\x80\x94more than was at all agreeable or convenient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord help us, they are perfect devils!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks, heading the\r\nretreat down the rocks with much more of a will than he had joined the\r\nascent, while all the party came tumbling precipitately after him,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfat constable, in particular, blowing and puffing in a very energetic\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, fellers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks, \xe2\x80\x9cyou jist go round and pick up Tom,\r\nthere, while I run and get on to my horse to go back for help,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyou;\xe2\x80\x9d and, without minding the hootings and jeers of his company, Marks\r\nwas as good as his word, and was soon seen galloping away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas ever such a sneaking varmint?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the men; \xe2\x80\x9cto come on\r\nhis business, and he clear out and leave us this yer way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we must pick up that feller,\xe2\x80\x9d said another. \xe2\x80\x9cCuss me if I much\r\ncare whether he is dead or alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men, led by the groans of Tom, scrambled and crackled through\r\nstumps, logs and bushes, to where that hero lay groaning and swearing\r\nwith alternate vehemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe keep it agoing pretty loud, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said one. \xe2\x80\x9cYe much hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know. Get me up, can\xe2\x80\x99t ye? Blast that infernal Quaker! If it\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for him, I\xe2\x80\x99d a pitched some on \xe2\x80\x99em down here, to see how\r\nthey liked it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith much labor and groaning, the fallen hero was assisted to rise;\r\nand, with one holding him up under each shoulder, they got him as far\r\nas the horses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you could only get me a mile back to that ar tavern. Give me a\r\nhandkerchief or something, to stuff into this place, and stop this\r\ninfernal bleeding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge looked over the rocks, and saw them trying to lift the burly\r\nform of Tom into the saddle. After two or three ineffectual attempts,\r\nhe reeled, and fell heavily to the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I hope he isn\xe2\x80\x99t killed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, who, with all the party, stood\r\nwatching the proceeding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas; \xe2\x80\x9cserves him right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause after death comes the judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, who had been groaning and praying, in her\r\nMethodist fashion, during all the encounter, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s an awful case for\r\nthe poor crittur\xe2\x80\x99s soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my word, they\xe2\x80\x99re leaving him, I do believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas.\r\n\r\nIt was true; for after some appearance of irresolution and\r\nconsultation, the whole party got on their horses and rode away. When\r\nthey were quite out of sight, Phineas began to bestir himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we must go down and walk a piece,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI told Michael to\r\ngo forward and bring help, and be along back here with the wagon; but\r\nwe shall have to walk a piece along the road, I reckon, to meet them.\r\nThe Lord grant he be along soon! It\xe2\x80\x99s early in the day; there won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nmuch travel afoot yet a while; we an\xe2\x80\x99t much more than two miles from\r\nour stopping-place. If the road hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so rough last night, we\r\ncould have outrun \xe2\x80\x99em entirely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the party neared the fence, they discovered in the distance, along\r\nthe road, their own wagon coming back, accompanied by some men on\r\nhorseback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, there\xe2\x80\x99s Michael, and Stephen and Amariah,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nPhineas, joyfully. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we _are_ made\xe2\x80\x94as safe as if we\xe2\x80\x99d got there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do stop, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, \xe2\x80\x9cand do something for that poor man;\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s groaning dreadfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be no more than Christian,\xe2\x80\x9d said George; \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s take him up\r\nand carry him on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd doctor him up among the Quakers!\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas; \xe2\x80\x9cpretty well,\r\nthat! Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if we do. Here, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at him;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nPhineas, who in the course of his hunting and backwoods life had\r\nacquired some rude experience of surgery, kneeled down by the wounded\r\nman, and began a careful examination of his condition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, feebly, \xe2\x80\x9cis that you, Marks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I reckon \xe2\x80\x99tan\xe2\x80\x99t friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas. \xe2\x80\x9cMuch Marks cares for thee,\r\nif his own skin\xe2\x80\x99s safe. He\xe2\x80\x99s off, long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I\xe2\x80\x99m done for,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cussed sneaking dog, to leave\r\nme to die alone! My poor old mother always told me \xe2\x80\x99t would be so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa sakes! jist hear the poor crittur. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a mammy, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nold negress. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help kinder pityin\xe2\x80\x99 on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly, softly; don\xe2\x80\x99t thee snap and snarl, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas, as\r\nTom winced and pushed his hand away. \xe2\x80\x9cThee has no chance, unless I stop\r\nthe bleeding.\xe2\x80\x9d And Phineas busied himself with making some off-hand\r\nsurgical arrangements with his own pocket-handkerchief, and such as\r\ncould be mustered in the company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou pushed me down there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thee would have pushed us down, thee sees,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhineas, as he stooped to apply his bandage. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, there,\xe2\x80\x94let me fix\r\nthis bandage. We mean well to thee; we bear no malice. Thee shall be\r\ntaken to a house where they\xe2\x80\x99ll nurse thee first rate, well as thy own\r\nmother could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom groaned, and shut his eyes. In men of his class, vigor and\r\nresolution are entirely a physical matter, and ooze out with the\r\nflowing of the blood; and the gigantic fellow really looked piteous in\r\nhis helplessness.\r\n\r\nThe other party now came up. The seats were taken out of the wagon. The\r\nbuffalo-skins, doubled in fours, were spread all along one side, and\r\nfour men, with great difficulty, lifted the heavy form of Tom into it.\r\nBefore he was gotten in, he fainted entirely. The old negress, in the\r\nabundance of her compassion, sat down on the bottom, and took his head\r\nin her lap. Eliza, George and Jim, bestowed themselves, as well as they\r\ncould, in the remaining space and the whole party set forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of him?\xe2\x80\x9d said George, who sat by Phineas in front.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell it\xe2\x80\x99s only a pretty deep flesh-wound; but, then, tumbling and\r\nscratching down that place didn\xe2\x80\x99t help him much. It has bled pretty\r\nfreely,\xe2\x80\x94pretty much drained him out, courage and all,\xe2\x80\x94but he\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nover it, and may be learn a thing or two by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear you say so,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would always be a heavy\r\nthought to me, if I\xe2\x80\x99d caused his death, even in a just cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phineas, \xe2\x80\x9ckilling is an ugly operation, any way they\xe2\x80\x99ll fix\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x94man or beast. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a buck that was shot down and a dying, look\r\nthat way on a feller with his eye, that it reely most made a feller\r\nfeel wicked for killing on him; and human creatures is a more serious\r\nconsideration yet, bein\xe2\x80\x99, as thy wife says, that the judgment comes to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em after death. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know as our people\xe2\x80\x99s notions on these\r\nmatters is too strict; and, considerin\xe2\x80\x99 how I was raised, I fell in\r\nwith them pretty considerably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall you do with this poor fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, carry him along to Amariah\xe2\x80\x99s. There\xe2\x80\x99s old Grandmam Stephens\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x94Dorcas, they call her,\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s most an amazin\xe2\x80\x99 nurse. She takes to\r\nnursing real natural, and an\xe2\x80\x99t never better suited than when she gets a\r\nsick body to tend. We may reckon on turning him over to her for a\r\nfortnight or so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA ride of about an hour more brought the party to a neat farmhouse,\r\nwhere the weary travellers were received to an abundant breakfast. Tom\r\nLoker was soon carefully deposited in a much cleaner and softer bed\r\nthan he had ever been in the habit of occupying. His wound was\r\ncarefully dressed and bandaged, and he lay languidly opening and\r\nshutting his eyes on the white window-curtains and gently-gliding\r\nfigures of his sick room, like a weary child. And here, for the\r\npresent, we shall take our leave of one party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\nMiss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s Experiences and Opinions\r\n\r\n\r\nOur friend Tom, in his own simple musings, often compared his more\r\nfortunate lot, in the bondage into which he was cast, with that of\r\nJoseph in Egypt; and, in fact, as time went on, and he developed more\r\nand more under the eye of his master, the strength of the parallel\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare was indolent and careless of money. Hitherto the providing\r\nand marketing had been principally done by Adolph, who was, to the\r\nfull, as careless and extravagant as his master; and, between them\r\nboth, they had carried on the dispersing process with great alacrity.\r\nAccustomed, for many years, to regard his master\xe2\x80\x99s property as his own\r\ncare, Tom saw, with an uneasiness he could scarcely repress, the\r\nwasteful expenditure of the establishment; and, in the quiet, indirect\r\nway which his class often acquire, would sometimes make his own\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare at first employed him occasionally; but, struck with his\r\nsoundness of mind and good business capacity, he confided in him more\r\nand more, till gradually all the marketing and providing for the family\r\nwere intrusted to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Adolph,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, one day, as Adolph was deprecating the\r\npassing of power out of his hands; \xe2\x80\x9clet Tom alone. You only understand\r\nwhat you want; Tom understands cost and come to; and there may be some\r\nend to money, bye and bye if we don\xe2\x80\x99t let somebody do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrusted to an unlimited extent by a careless master, who handed him a\r\nbill without looking at it, and pocketed the change without counting\r\nit, Tom had every facility and temptation to dishonesty; and nothing\r\nbut an impregnable simplicity of nature, strengthened by Christian\r\nfaith, could have kept him from it. But, to that nature, the very\r\nunbounded trust reposed in him was bond and seal for the most\r\nscrupulous accuracy.\r\n\r\nWith Adolph the case had been different. Thoughtless and\r\nself-indulgent, and unrestrained by a master who found it easier to\r\nindulge than to regulate, he had fallen into an absolute confusion as\r\nto _meum tuum_ with regard to himself and his master, which sometimes\r\ntroubled even St. Clare. His own good sense taught him that such a\r\ntraining of his servants was unjust and dangerous. A sort of chronic\r\nremorse went with him everywhere, although not strong enough to make\r\nany decided change in his course; and this very remorse reacted again\r\ninto indulgence. He passed lightly over the most serious faults,\r\nbecause he told himself that, if he had done his part, his dependents\r\nhad not fallen into them.\r\n\r\nTom regarded his gay, airy, handsome young master with an odd mixture\r\nof fealty, reverence, and fatherly solicitude. That he never read the\r\nBible; never went to church; that he jested and made free with any and\r\nevery thing that came in the way of his wit; that he spent his Sunday\r\nevenings at the opera or theatre; that he went to wine parties, and\r\nclubs, and suppers, oftener than was at all expedient,\xe2\x80\x94were all things\r\nthat Tom could see as plainly as anybody, and on which he based a\r\nconviction that \xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a Christian;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a conviction, however,\r\nwhich he would have been very slow to express to any one else, but on\r\nwhich he founded many prayers, in his own simple fashion, when he was\r\nby himself in his little dormitory. Not that Tom had not his own way of\r\nspeaking his mind occasionally, with something of the tact often\r\nobservable in his class; as, for example, the very day after the\r\nSabbath we have described, St. Clare was invited out to a convivial\r\nparty of choice spirits, and was helped home, between one and two\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, in a condition when the physical had decidedly\r\nattained the upper hand of the intellectual. Tom and Adolph assisted to\r\nget him composed for the night, the latter in high spirits, evidently\r\nregarding the matter as a good joke, and laughing heartily at the\r\nrusticity of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s horror, who really was simple enough to lie awake\r\nmost of the rest of the night, praying for his young master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Tom, what are you waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, the next day, as\r\nhe sat in his library, in dressing-gown and slippers. St. Clare had\r\njust been entrusting Tom with some money, and various commissions.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t all right there, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as Tom still stood waiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99fraid not, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with a grave face.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare laid down his paper, and set down his coffee-cup, and looked\r\nat Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy Tom, what\xe2\x80\x99s the case? You look as solemn as a coffin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel very bad, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r. I allays have thought that Mas\xe2\x80\x99r would be good\r\nto everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Tom, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I been? Come, now, what do you want? There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got, I suppose, and this is the preface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r allays been good to me. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t nothing to complain of on that\r\nhead. But there is one that Mas\xe2\x80\x99r isn\xe2\x80\x99t good to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom, what\xe2\x80\x99s got into you? Speak out; what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast night, between one and two, I thought so. I studied upon the\r\nmatter then. Mas\xe2\x80\x99r isn\xe2\x80\x99t good to _himself_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom said this with his back to his master, and his hand on the\r\ndoor-knob. St. Clare felt his face flush crimson, but he laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, that\xe2\x80\x99s all, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gayly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, turning suddenly round and falling on his knees. \xe2\x80\x9cO,\r\nmy dear young Mas\xe2\x80\x99r; I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99fraid it will be _loss of all\xe2\x80\x94all_\xe2\x80\x94body and\r\nsoul. The good Book says, \xe2\x80\x99it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like\r\nan adder!\xe2\x80\x99 my dear Mas\xe2\x80\x99r!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s voice choked, and the tears ran down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou poor, silly fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, with tears in his own eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up, Tom. I\xe2\x80\x99m not worth crying over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Tom wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rise, and looked imploring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go to any more of their cursed nonsense, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said St.\r\nClare; \xe2\x80\x9con my honor, I won\xe2\x80\x99t. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I haven\xe2\x80\x99t stopped long\r\nago. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always despised _it_, and myself for it,\xe2\x80\x94so now, Tom, wipe up\r\nyour eyes, and go about your errands. Come, come,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cno\r\nblessings. I\xe2\x80\x99m not so wonderfully good, now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he gently\r\npushed Tom to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, I\xe2\x80\x99ll pledge my honor to you, Tom, you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see me so again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and Tom went off, wiping his eyes,\r\nwith great satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll keep my faith with him, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, as he closed the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nAnd St. Clare did so,\xe2\x80\x94for gross sensualism, in any form, was not the\r\npeculiar temptation of his nature.\r\n\r\nBut, all this time, who shall detail the tribulations manifold of our\r\nfriend Miss Ophelia, who had begun the labors of a Southern\r\nhousekeeper?\r\n\r\nThere is all the difference in the world in the servants of Southern\r\nestablishments, according to the character and capacity of the\r\nmistresses who have brought them up.\r\n\r\nSouth as well as north, there are women who have an extraordinary\r\ntalent for command, and tact in educating. Such are enabled, with\r\napparent ease, and without severity, to subject to their will, and\r\nbring into harmonious and systematic order, the various members of\r\ntheir small estate,\xe2\x80\x94to regulate their peculiarities, and so balance and\r\ncompensate the deficiencies of one by the excess of another, as to\r\nproduce a harmonious and orderly system.\r\n\r\nSuch a housekeeper was Mrs. Shelby, whom we have already described; and\r\nsuch our readers may remember to have met with. If they are not common\r\nat the South, it is because they are not common in the world. They are\r\nto be found there as often as anywhere; and, when existing, find in\r\nthat peculiar state of society a brilliant opportunity to exhibit their\r\ndomestic talent.\r\n\r\nSuch a housekeeper Marie St. Clare was not, nor her mother before her.\r\nIndolent and childish, unsystematic and improvident, it was not to be\r\nexpected that servants trained under her care should not be so\r\nlikewise; and she had very justly described to Miss Ophelia the state\r\nof confusion she would find in the family, though she had not ascribed\r\nit to the proper cause.\r\n\r\nThe first morning of her regency, Miss Ophelia was up at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock;\r\nand having attended to all the adjustments of her own chamber, as she\r\nhad done ever since she came there, to the great amazement of the\r\nchambermaid, she prepared for a vigorous onslaught on the cupboards and\r\nclosets of the establishment of which she had the keys.\r\n\r\nThe store-room, the linen-presses, the china-closet, the kitchen and\r\ncellar, that day, all went under an awful review. Hidden things of\r\ndarkness were brought to light to an extent that alarmed all the\r\nprincipalities and powers of kitchen and chamber, and caused many\r\nwonderings and murmurings about \xe2\x80\x9cdese yer northern ladies\xe2\x80\x9d from the\r\ndomestic cabinet.\r\n\r\nOld Dinah, the head cook, and principal of all rule and authority in\r\nthe kitchen department, was filled with wrath at what she considered an\r\ninvasion of privilege. No feudal baron in _Magna Charta_ times could\r\nhave more thoroughly resented some incursion of the crown.\r\n\r\nDinah was a character in her own way, and it would be injustice to her\r\nmemory not to give the reader a little idea of her. She was a native\r\nand essential cook, as much as Aunt Chloe,\xe2\x80\x94cooking being an indigenous\r\ntalent of the African race; but Chloe was a trained and methodical one,\r\nwho moved in an orderly domestic harness, while Dinah was a self-taught\r\ngenius, and, like geniuses in general, was positive, opinionated and\r\nerratic, to the last degree.\r\n\r\nLike a certain class of modern philosophers, Dinah perfectly scorned\r\nlogic and reason in every shape, and always took refuge in intuitive\r\ncertainty; and here she was perfectly impregnable. No possible amount\r\nof talent, or authority, or explanation, could ever make her believe\r\nthat any other way was better than her own, or that the course she had\r\npursued in the smallest matter could be in the least modified. This had\r\nbeen a conceded point with her old mistress, Marie\xe2\x80\x99s mother; and \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nMarie,\xe2\x80\x9d as Dinah always called her young mistress, even after her\r\nmarriage, found it easier to submit than contend; and so Dinah had\r\nruled supreme. This was the easier, in that she was perfect mistress of\r\nthat diplomatic art which unites the utmost subservience of manner with\r\nthe utmost inflexibility as to measure.\r\n\r\nDinah was mistress of the whole art and mystery of excuse-making, in\r\nall its branches. Indeed, it was an axiom with her that the cook can do\r\nno wrong; and a cook in a Southern kitchen finds abundance of heads and\r\nshoulders on which to lay off every sin and frailty, so as to maintain\r\nher own immaculateness entire. If any part of the dinner was a failure,\r\nthere were fifty indisputably good reasons for it; and it was the fault\r\nundeniably of fifty other people, whom Dinah berated with unsparing\r\nzeal.\r\n\r\nBut it was very seldom that there was any failure in Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\nresults. Though her mode of doing everything was peculiarly meandering\r\nand circuitous, and without any sort of calculation as to time and\r\nplace,\xe2\x80\x94though her kitchen generally looked as if it had been arranged\r\nby a hurricane blowing through it, and she had about as many places for\r\neach cooking utensil as there were days in the year,\xe2\x80\x94yet, if one would\r\nhave patience to wait her own good time, up would come her dinner in\r\nperfect order, and in a style of preparation with which an epicure\r\ncould find no fault.\r\n\r\nIt was now the season of incipient preparation for dinner. Dinah, who\r\nrequired large intervals of reflection and repose, and was studious of\r\nease in all her arrangements, was seated on the kitchen floor, smoking\r\na short, stumpy pipe, to which she was much addicted, and which she\r\nalways kindled up, as a sort of censer, whenever she felt the need of\r\nan inspiration in her arrangements. It was Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s mode of invoking the\r\ndomestic Muses.\r\n\r\nSeated around her were various members of that rising race with which a\r\nSouthern household abounds, engaged in shelling peas, peeling potatoes,\r\npicking pin-feathers out of fowls, and other preparatory\r\narrangements,\xe2\x80\x94Dinah every once in a while interrupting her meditations\r\nto give a poke, or a rap on the head, to some of the young operators,\r\nwith the pudding-stick that lay by her side. In fact, Dinah ruled over\r\nthe woolly heads of the younger members with a rod of iron, and seemed\r\nto consider them born for no earthly purpose but to \xe2\x80\x9csave her steps,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas she phrased it. It was the spirit of the system under which she had\r\ngrown up, and she carried it out to its full extent.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia, after passing on her reformatory tour through all the\r\nother parts of the establishment, now entered the kitchen. Dinah had\r\nheard, from various sources, what was going on, and resolved to stand\r\non defensive and conservative ground,\xe2\x80\x94mentally determined to oppose and\r\nignore every new measure, without any actual observable contest.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was a large brick-floored apartment, with a great\r\nold-fashioned fireplace stretching along one side of it,\xe2\x80\x94an arrangement\r\nwhich St. Clare had vainly tried to persuade Dinah to exchange for the\r\nconvenience of a modern cook-stove. Not she. No Puseyite,[1] or\r\nconservative of any school, was ever more inflexibly attached to\r\ntime-honored inconveniences than Dinah.\r\n\r\n [1] Edward Bouverie Pusey (1800-1882), champion of the orthodoxy of\r\n revealed religion, defender of the Oxford movement, and Regius\r\n professor of Hebrew and Canon of Christ Church, Oxford.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen St. Clare had first returned from the north, impressed with the\r\nsystem and order of his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen arrangements, he had largely\r\nprovided his own with an array of cupboards, drawers, and various\r\napparatus, to induce systematic regulation, under the sanguine illusion\r\nthat it would be of any possible assistance to Dinah in her\r\narrangements. He might as well have provided them for a squirrel or a\r\nmagpie. The more drawers and closets there were, the more hiding-holes\r\ncould Dinah make for the accommodation of old rags, hair-combs, old\r\nshoes, ribbons, cast-off artificial flowers, and other articles of\r\n_vertu_, wherein her soul delighted.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Ophelia entered the kitchen Dinah did not rise, but smoked on\r\nin sublime tranquillity, regarding her movements obliquely out of the\r\ncorner of her eye, but apparently intent only on the operations around\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia commenced opening a set of drawers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this drawer for, Dinah?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s handy for most anything, Missis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah. So it appeared to\r\nbe. From the variety it contained, Miss Ophelia pulled out first a fine\r\ndamask table-cloth stained with blood, having evidently been used to\r\nenvelop some raw meat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this, Dinah? You don\xe2\x80\x99t wrap up meat in your mistress\xe2\x80\x99 best\r\ntable-cloths?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lor, Missis, no; the towels was all a missin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94so I jest did it. I\r\nlaid out to wash that a,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s why I put it thar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShif\xe2\x80\x99less!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia to herself, proceeding to tumble over\r\nthe drawer, where she found a nutmeg-grater and two or three nutmegs, a\r\nMethodist hymn-book, a couple of soiled Madras handkerchiefs, some yarn\r\nand knitting-work, a paper of tobacco and a pipe, a few crackers, one\r\nor two gilded china-saucers with some pomade in them, one or two thin\r\nold shoes, a piece of flannel carefully pinned up enclosing some small\r\nwhite onions, several damask table-napkins, some coarse crash towels,\r\nsome twine and darning-needles, and several broken papers, from which\r\nsundry sweet herbs were sifting into the drawer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you keep your nutmegs, Dinah?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, with the\r\nair of one who prayed for patience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost anywhar, Missis; there\xe2\x80\x99s some in that cracked tea-cup, up there,\r\nand there\xe2\x80\x99s some over in that ar cupboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are some in the grater,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, holding them up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, yes, I put \xe2\x80\x99em there this morning,\xe2\x80\x94I likes to keep my things\r\nhandy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, Jake! what are you stopping for! You\xe2\x80\x99ll cotch\r\nit! Be still, thar!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a dive of her stick at the\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, holding up the saucer of pomade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, it\xe2\x80\x99s my har _grease_;\xe2\x80\x94I put it thar to have it handy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you use your mistress\xe2\x80\x99 best saucers for that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw! it was cause I was driv, and in sich a hurry;\xe2\x80\x94I was gwine to\r\nchange it this very day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are two damask table-napkins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem table-napkins I put thar, to get \xe2\x80\x99em washed out, some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you have some place here on purpose for things to be washed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r St. Clare got dat ar chest, he said, for dat; but I likes\r\nto mix up biscuit and hev my things on it some days, and then it an\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhandy a liftin\xe2\x80\x99 up the lid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you mix your biscuits on the pastry-table, there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw, Missis, it gets sot so full of dishes, and one thing and another,\r\nder an\xe2\x80\x99t no room, noway\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you should _wash_ your dishes, and clear them away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWash my dishes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, in a high key, as her wrath began to rise\r\nover her habitual respect of manner; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does ladies know \xe2\x80\x99bout work,\r\nI want to know? When \xe2\x80\x99d Mas\xe2\x80\x99r ever get his dinner, if I vas to spend\r\nall my time a washin\xe2\x80\x99 and a puttin\xe2\x80\x99 up dishes? Miss Marie never telled\r\nme so, nohow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here are these onions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah; \xe2\x80\x9cthar _is_ whar I put \xe2\x80\x99em, now. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n\xe2\x80\x99member. Them \xe2\x80\x99s particular onions I was a savin\xe2\x80\x99 for dis yer very\r\nstew. I\xe2\x80\x99d forgot they was in dat ar old flannel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia lifted out the sifting papers of sweet herbs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish Missis wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch dem ar. I likes to keep my things where I\r\nknows whar to go to \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, rather decidedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t want these holes in the papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem \xe2\x80\x99s handy for siftin\xe2\x80\x99 on \xe2\x80\x99t out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you see it spills all over the drawer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, yes! if Missis will go a tumblin\xe2\x80\x99 things all up so, it will.\r\nMissis has spilt lots dat ar way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, coming uneasily to the\r\ndrawers. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Missis only will go up stars till my clarin\xe2\x80\x99 up time\r\ncomes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have everything right; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t do nothin\xe2\x80\x99 when ladies\r\nis round, a henderin\xe2\x80\x99. You, Sam, don\xe2\x80\x99t you gib the baby dat ar\r\nsugar-bowl! I\xe2\x80\x99ll crack ye over, if ye don\xe2\x80\x99t mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going through the kitchen, and going to put everything in order,\r\n_once_, Dinah; and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll expect you to _keep_ it so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, now! Miss Phelia; dat ar an\xe2\x80\x99t no way for ladies to do. I never\r\ndid see ladies doin\xe2\x80\x99 no sich; my old Missis nor Miss Marie never did,\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t see no kinder need on \xe2\x80\x99t;\xe2\x80\x9d and Dinah stalked indignantly\r\nabout, while Miss Ophelia piled and sorted dishes, emptied dozens of\r\nscattering bowls of sugar into one receptacle, sorted napkins,\r\ntable-cloths, and towels, for washing; washing, wiping, and arranging\r\nwith her own hands, and with a speed and alacrity which perfectly\r\namazed Dinah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor now! if dat ar de way dem northern ladies do, dey an\xe2\x80\x99t ladies,\r\nnohow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to some of her satellites, when at a safe hearing\r\ndistance. \xe2\x80\x9cI has things as straight as anybody, when my clarin\xe2\x80\x99 up\r\ntimes comes; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want ladies round, a henderin\xe2\x80\x99, and getting my\r\nthings all where I can\xe2\x80\x99t find \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo do Dinah justice, she had, at irregular periods, paroxyms of\r\nreformation and arrangement, which she called \xe2\x80\x9cclarin\xe2\x80\x99 up times,\xe2\x80\x9d when\r\nshe would begin with great zeal, and turn every drawer and closet wrong\r\nside outward, on to the floor or tables, and make the ordinary\r\nconfusion seven-fold more confounded. Then she would light her pipe,\r\nand leisurely go over her arrangements, looking things over, and\r\ndiscoursing upon them; making all the young fry scour most vigorously\r\non the tin things, and keeping up for several hours a most energetic\r\nstate of confusion, which she would explain to the satisfaction of all\r\ninquirers, by the remark that she was a \xe2\x80\x9cclarin\xe2\x80\x99 up.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hev\r\nthings a gwine on so as they had been, and she was gwine to make these\r\nyer young ones keep better order;\xe2\x80\x9d for Dinah herself, somehow, indulged\r\nthe illusion that she, herself, was the soul of order, and it was only\r\nthe _young uns_, and the everybody else in the house, that were the\r\ncause of anything that fell short of perfection in this respect. When\r\nall the tins were scoured, and the tables scrubbed snowy white, and\r\neverything that could offend tucked out of sight in holes and corners,\r\nDinah would dress herself up in a smart dress, clean apron, and high,\r\nbrilliant Madras turban, and tell all marauding \xe2\x80\x9cyoung uns\xe2\x80\x9d to keep out\r\nof the kitchen, for she was gwine to have things kept nice. Indeed,\r\nthese periodic seasons were often an inconvenience to the whole\r\nhousehold; for Dinah would contract such an immoderate attachment to\r\nher scoured tin, as to insist upon it that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be used again\r\nfor any possible purpose,\xe2\x80\x94at least, till the ardor of the \xe2\x80\x9cclarin\xe2\x80\x99 up\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nperiod abated.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia, in a few days, thoroughly reformed every department of\r\nthe house to a systematic pattern; but her labors in all departments\r\nthat depended on the cooperation of servants were like those of\r\nSisyphus or the Danaides. In despair, she one day appealed to St.\r\nClare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no such thing as getting anything like a system in this\r\nfamily!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch shiftless management, such waste, such confusion, I never saw!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would not take it so coolly, if you were housekeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear cousin, you may as well understand, once for all, that we\r\nmasters are divided into two classes, oppressors and oppressed. We who\r\nare good-natured and hate severity make up our minds to a good deal of\r\ninconvenience. If we _will keep_ a shambling, loose, untaught set in\r\nthe community, for our convenience, why, we must take the consequence.\r\nSome rare cases I have seen, of persons, who, by a peculiar tact, can\r\nproduce order and system without severity; but I\xe2\x80\x99m not one of them,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nso I made up my mind, long ago, to let things go just as they do. I\r\nwill not have the poor devils thrashed and cut to pieces, and they know\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x94and, of course, they know the staff is in their own hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to have no time, no place, no order,\xe2\x80\x94all going on in this\r\nshiftless way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Vermont, you natives up by the North Pole set an extravagant\r\nvalue on time! What on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has\r\ntwice as much of it as he knows what to do with? As to order and\r\nsystem, where there is nothing to be done but to lounge on the sofa and\r\nread, an hour sooner or later in breakfast or dinner isn\xe2\x80\x99t of much\r\naccount. Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s Dinah gets you a capital dinner,\xe2\x80\x94soup, ragout,\r\nroast fowl, dessert, ice-creams and all,\xe2\x80\x94and she creates it all out of\r\nchaos and old night down there, in that kitchen. I think it really\r\nsublime, the way she manages. But, Heaven bless us! if we are to go\r\ndown there, and view all the smoking and squatting about, and\r\nhurryscurryation of the preparatory process, we should never eat more!\r\nMy good cousin, absolve yourself from that! It\xe2\x80\x99s more than a Catholic\r\npenance, and does no more good. You\xe2\x80\x99ll only lose your own temper, and\r\nutterly confound Dinah. Let her go her own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Augustine, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I found things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I know that the rolling-pin is under her bed, and the\r\nnutmeg-grater in her pocket with her tobacco,\xe2\x80\x94that there are sixty-five\r\ndifferent sugar-bowls, one in every hole in the house,\xe2\x80\x94that she washes\r\ndishes with a dinner-napkin one day, and with a fragment of an old\r\npetticoat the next? But the upshot is, she gets up glorious dinners,\r\nmakes superb coffee; and you must judge her as warriors and statesmen\r\nare judged, _by her success_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the waste,\xe2\x80\x94the expense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, well! Lock everything you can, and keep the key. Give out by\r\ndriblets, and never inquire for odds and ends,\xe2\x80\x94it isn\xe2\x80\x99t best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat troubles me, Augustine. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling as if these servants\r\nwere not _strictly honest_. Are you sure they can be relied on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAugustine laughed immoderately at the grave and anxious face with which\r\nMiss Ophelia propounded the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, cousin, that\xe2\x80\x99s too good,\xe2\x80\x94_honest!_\xe2\x80\x94as if that\xe2\x80\x99s a thing to be\r\nexpected! Honest!\xe2\x80\x94why, of course, they arn\xe2\x80\x99t. Why should they be? What\r\nupon earth is to make them so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you instruct?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstruct! O, fiddlestick! What instructing do you think I should do? I\r\nlook like it! As to Marie, she has spirit enough, to be sure, to kill\r\noff a whole plantation, if I\xe2\x80\x99d let her manage; but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the\r\ncheatery out of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there no honest ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now and then one, whom Nature makes so impracticably simple,\r\ntruthful and faithful, that the worst possible influence can\xe2\x80\x99t destroy\r\nit. But, you see, from the mother\xe2\x80\x99s breast the colored child feels and\r\nsees that there are none but underhand ways open to it. It can get\r\nalong no other way with its parents, its mistress, its young master and\r\nmissie play-fellows. Cunning and deception become necessary, inevitable\r\nhabits. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair to expect anything else of him. He ought not to\r\nbe punished for it. As to honesty, the slave is kept in that dependent,\r\nsemi-childish state, that there is no making him realize the rights of\r\nproperty, or feel that his master\xe2\x80\x99s goods are not his own, if he can\r\nget them. For my part, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how they _can_ be honest. Such a\r\nfellow as Tom, here, is,\xe2\x80\x94is a moral miracle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what becomes of their souls?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t my affair, as I know of,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare; \xe2\x80\x9cI am only\r\ndealing in facts of the present life. The fact is, that the whole race\r\nare pretty generally understood to be turned over to the devil, for our\r\nbenefit, in this world, however it may turn out in another!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is perfectly horrible!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia; \xe2\x80\x9cyou ought to be\r\nashamed of yourselves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know as I am. We are in pretty good company, for all that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cas people in the broad road generally are. Look at the\r\nhigh and the low, all the world over, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the same story,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nlower class used up, body, soul and spirit, for the good of the upper.\r\nIt is so in England; it is so everywhere; and yet all Christendom\r\nstands aghast, with virtuous indignation, because we do the thing in a\r\nlittle different shape from what they do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t so in Vermont.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, in New England, and in the free States, you have the better\r\nof us, I grant. But there\xe2\x80\x99s the bell; so, Cousin, let us for a while\r\nlay aside our sectional prejudices, and come out to dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Miss Ophelia was in the kitchen in the latter part of the afternoon,\r\nsome of the sable children called out, \xe2\x80\x9cLa, sakes! thar\xe2\x80\x99s Prue a\r\ncoming, grunting along like she allers does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tall, bony colored woman now entered the kitchen, bearing on her head\r\na basket of rusks and hot rolls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, Prue! you\xe2\x80\x99ve come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah.\r\n\r\nPrue had a peculiar scowling expression of countenance, and a sullen,\r\ngrumbling voice. She set down her basket, squatted herself down, and\r\nresting her elbows on her knees said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord! I wish\xe2\x80\x99t I \xe2\x80\x99s dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you wish you were dead?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be out o\xe2\x80\x99 my misery,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, gruffly, without taking her\r\neyes from the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat need you getting drunk, then, and cutting up, Prue?\xe2\x80\x9d said a\r\nspruce quadroon chambermaid, dangling, as she spoke, a pair of coral\r\near-drops.\r\n\r\nThe woman looked at her with a sour surly glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to it, one of these yer days. I\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to see\r\nyou, I would; then you\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad of a drop, like me, to forget your\r\nmisery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Prue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s look at your rusks. Here\xe2\x80\x99s Missis will\r\npay for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia took out a couple of dozen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThar\xe2\x80\x99s some tickets in that ar old cracked jug on the top shelf,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDinah. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, Jake, climb up and get it down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTickets,\xe2\x80\x94what are they for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe buy tickets of her Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, and she gives us bread for \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they counts my money and tickets, when I gets home, to see if I \xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot the change; and if I han\xe2\x80\x99t, they half kills me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd serves you right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane, the pert chambermaid, \xe2\x80\x9cif you will\r\ntake their money to get drunk on. That\xe2\x80\x99s what she does, Missis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what I _will_ do,\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t live no other ways,\xe2\x80\x94drink and\r\nforget my misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very wicked and very foolish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cto steal\r\nyour master\xe2\x80\x99s money to make yourself a brute with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s mighty likely, Missis; but I will do it,\xe2\x80\x94yes, I will. O Lord! I\r\nwish I \xe2\x80\x99s dead, I do,\xe2\x80\x94I wish I \xe2\x80\x99s dead, and out of my misery!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nslowly and stiffly the old creature rose, and got her basket on her\r\nhead again; but before she went out, she looked at the quadroon girl,\r\nwho still stood playing with her ear-drops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe think ye\xe2\x80\x99re mighty fine with them ar, a frolickin\xe2\x80\x99 and a tossin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyour head, and a lookin\xe2\x80\x99 down on everybody. Well, never mind,\xe2\x80\x94you may\r\nlive to be a poor, old, cut-up crittur, like me. Hope to the Lord ye\r\nwill, I do; then see if ye won\xe2\x80\x99t drink,\xe2\x80\x94drink,\xe2\x80\x94drink,\xe2\x80\x94yerself into\r\ntorment; and sarve ye right, too\xe2\x80\x94ugh!\xe2\x80\x9d and, with a malignant howl, the\r\nwoman left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDisgusting old beast!\xe2\x80\x9d said Adolph, who was getting his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshaving-water. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I was her master, I\xe2\x80\x99d cut her up worse than she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that ar, no ways,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah. \xe2\x80\x9cHer back\xe2\x80\x99s a far sight\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x94she can\xe2\x80\x99t never get a dress together over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think such low creatures ought not to be allowed to go round to\r\ngenteel families,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, Mr. St. Clare?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, coquettishly tossing her head at Adolph.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that, among other appropriations from his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstock, Adolph was in the habit of adopting his name and address; and\r\nthat the style under which he moved, among the colored circles of New\r\nOrleans, was that of _Mr. St. Clare_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m certainly of your opinion, Miss Benoir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adolph.\r\n\r\nBenoir was the name of Marie St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s family, and Jane was one of\r\nher servants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, Miss Benoir, may I be allowed to ask if those drops are for the\r\nball, tomorrow night? They are certainly bewitching!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder, now, Mr. St. Clare, what the impudence of you men will come\r\nto!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane, tossing her pretty head \xe2\x80\x99til the ear-drops twinkled\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t dance with you for a whole evening, if you go to\r\nasking me any more questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so cruel, now! I was just dying to know whether you\r\nwould appear in your pink tarletane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adolph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosa, a bright, piquant little quadroon who came\r\nskipping down stairs at this moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s so impudent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adolph, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to Miss Rosa now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know he\xe2\x80\x99s always a saucy creature,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosa, poising herself on\r\none of her little feet, and looking maliciously at Adolph. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\ngetting me so angry with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! ladies, ladies, you will certainly break my heart, between you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Adolph. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be found dead in my bed, some morning, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave it to answer for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo hear the horrid creature talk!\xe2\x80\x9d said both ladies, laughing\r\nimmoderately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x94clar out, you! I can\xe2\x80\x99t have you cluttering up the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDinah; \xe2\x80\x9cin my way, foolin\xe2\x80\x99 round here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s glum, because she can\xe2\x80\x99t go to the ball,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t want none o\xe2\x80\x99 your light-colored balls,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah; \xe2\x80\x9ccuttin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nround, makin\xe2\x80\x99 b\xe2\x80\x99lieve you\xe2\x80\x99s white folks. Arter all, you\xe2\x80\x99s niggers, much\r\nas I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Dinah greases her wool stiff, every day, to make it lie\r\nstraight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it will be wool, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosa, maliciously shaking down\r\nher long, silky curls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s sight, an\xe2\x80\x99t wool as good as har, any time?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDinah. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to have Missis say which is worth the most,\xe2\x80\x94a couple\r\nsuch as you, or one like me. Get out wid ye, ye trumpery,\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nye round!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the conversation was interrupted in a two-fold manner. St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice was heard at the head of the stairs, asking Adolph if he meant to\r\nstay all night with his shaving-water; and Miss Ophelia, coming out of\r\nthe dining-room, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJane and Rosa, what are you wasting your time for, here? Go in and\r\nattend to your muslins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur friend Tom, who had been in the kitchen during the conversation\r\nwith the old rusk-woman, had followed her out into the street. He saw\r\nher go on, giving every once in a while a suppressed groan. At last she\r\nset her basket down on a doorstep, and began arranging the old, faded\r\nshawl which covered her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll carry your basket a piece,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, compassionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should ye?\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want no help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be sick, or in trouble, or somethin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI an\xe2\x80\x99t sick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, looking at her earnestly,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could persuade\r\nyou to leave off drinking. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know it will be the ruin of ye,\r\nbody and soul?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knows I\xe2\x80\x99m gwine to torment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cYe don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nneed to tell me that ar. I \xe2\x80\x99s ugly, I \xe2\x80\x99s wicked,\xe2\x80\x94I \xe2\x80\x99s gwine straight to\r\ntorment. O, Lord! I wish I \xe2\x80\x99s thar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom shuddered at these frightful words, spoken with a sullen,\r\nimpassioned earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Lord have mercy on ye! poor crittur. Han\xe2\x80\x99t ye never heard of Jesus\r\nChrist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJesus Christ,\xe2\x80\x94who\xe2\x80\x99s he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he\xe2\x80\x99s _the Lord_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve hearn tell o\xe2\x80\x99 the Lord, and the judgment and torment.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard o\xe2\x80\x99 that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut didn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody ever tell you of the Lord Jesus, that loved us poor\r\nsinners, and died for us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know nothin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99bout that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman; \xe2\x80\x9cnobody han\xe2\x80\x99t never\r\nloved me, since my old man died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was you raised?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp in Kentuck. A man kept me to breed chil\xe2\x80\x99en for market, and sold \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nas fast as they got big enough; last of all, he sold me to a\r\nspeculator, and my Mas\xe2\x80\x99r got me o\xe2\x80\x99 him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat set you into this bad way of drinkin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo get shet o\xe2\x80\x99 my misery. I had one child after I come here; and I\r\nthought then I\xe2\x80\x99d have one to raise, cause Mas\xe2\x80\x99r wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a speculator. It\r\nwas de peartest little thing! and Missis she seemed to think a heap on\r\n\xe2\x80\x99t, at first; it never cried,\xe2\x80\x94it was likely and fat. But Missis tuck\r\nsick, and I tended her; and I tuck the fever, and my milk all left me,\r\nand the child it pined to skin and bone, and Missis wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy milk\r\nfor it. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear to me, when I telled her I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t milk. She\r\nsaid she knowed I could feed it on what other folks eat; and the child\r\nkinder pined, and cried, and cried, and cried, day and night, and got\r\nall gone to skin and bones, and Missis got sot agin it and she said \xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwan\xe2\x80\x99t nothin\xe2\x80\x99 but crossness. She wished it was dead, she said; and she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me have it o\xe2\x80\x99 nights, cause, she said, it kept me awake,\r\nand made me good for nothing. She made me sleep in her room; and I had\r\nto put it away off in a little kind o\xe2\x80\x99 garret, and thar it cried itself\r\nto death, one night. It did; and I tuck to drinkin\xe2\x80\x99, to keep its crying\r\nout of my ears! I did,\xe2\x80\x94and I will drink! I will, if I do go to torment\r\nfor it! Mas\xe2\x80\x99r says I shall go to torment, and I tell him I\xe2\x80\x99ve got thar\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, ye poor crittur!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9chan\xe2\x80\x99t nobody never telled ye how the\r\nLord Jesus loved ye, and died for ye? Han\xe2\x80\x99t they telled ye that he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhelp ye, and ye can go to heaven, and have rest, at last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looks like gwine to heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman; \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99t thar where white\r\nfolks is gwine? S\xe2\x80\x99pose they\xe2\x80\x99d have me thar? I\xe2\x80\x99d rather go to torment,\r\nand get away from Mas\xe2\x80\x99r and Missis. I had _so_,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as with her\r\nusual groan, she got her basket on her head, and walked sullenly away.\r\n\r\nTom turned, and walked sorrowfully back to the house. In the court he\r\nmet little Eva,\xe2\x80\x94a crown of tuberoses on her head, and her eyes radiant\r\nwith delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Tom! here you are. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I\xe2\x80\x99ve found you. Papa says you may get\r\nout the ponies, and take me in my little new carriage,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\ncatching his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter Tom?\xe2\x80\x94you look sober.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel bad, Miss Eva,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, sorrowfully. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the horses\r\nfor you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do tell me, Tom, what is the matter. I saw you talking to cross\r\nold Prue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom, in simple, earnest phrase, told Eva the woman\xe2\x80\x99s history. She did\r\nnot exclaim or wonder, or weep, as other children do. Her cheeks grew\r\npale, and a deep, earnest shadow passed over her eyes. She laid both\r\nhands on her bosom, and sighed heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME II\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\nMiss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s Experiences and Opinions Continued\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t get me the horses. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, Miss Eva?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese things sink into my heart, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthey sink into my\r\nheart,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go;\xe2\x80\x9d and she turned\r\nfrom Tom, and went into the house.\r\n\r\nA few days after, another woman came, in old Prue\xe2\x80\x99s place, to bring the\r\nrusks; Miss Ophelia was in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s got Prue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrue isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming any more,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, mysteriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, \xe2\x80\x9cshe an\xe2\x80\x99t dead, is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know. She\xe2\x80\x99s down cellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, glancing\r\nat Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\nAfter Miss Ophelia had taken the rusks, Dinah followed the woman to the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _has_ got Prue, any how?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe woman seemed desirous, yet reluctant, to speak, and answered, in\r\nlow, mysterious tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t tell nobody, Prue, she got drunk agin,\xe2\x80\x94and they had\r\nher down cellar,\xe2\x80\x94and thar they left her all day,\xe2\x80\x94and I hearn \xe2\x80\x99em saying\r\nthat the _flies had got to her_,\xe2\x80\x94and _she\xe2\x80\x99s dead_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah held up her hands, and, turning, saw close by her side the\r\nspirit-like form of Evangeline, her large, mystic eyes dilated with\r\nhorror, and every drop of blood driven from her lips and cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor bless us! Miss Eva\xe2\x80\x99s gwine to faint away! What go us all, to let\r\nher har such talk? Her pa\xe2\x80\x99ll be rail mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t faint, Dinah,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, firmly; \xe2\x80\x9cand why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nhear it? It an\xe2\x80\x99t so much for me to hear it, as for poor Prue to suffer\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Lor sakes_! it isn\xe2\x80\x99t for sweet, delicate young ladies, like\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x94these yer stories isn\xe2\x80\x99t; it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to kill \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEva sighed again, and walked up stairs with a slow and melancholy step.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia anxiously inquired the woman\xe2\x80\x99s story. Dinah gave a very\r\ngarrulous version of it, to which Tom added the particulars which he\r\nhad drawn from her that morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn abominable business,\xe2\x80\x94perfectly horrible!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, as she\r\nentered the room where St. Clare lay reading his paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, what iniquity has turned up now?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now? why, those folks have whipped Prue to death!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nOphelia, going on, with great strength of detail, into the story, and\r\nenlarging on its most shocking particulars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it would come to that, some time,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, going on\r\nwith his paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThought so!\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99t you going to _do_ anything about it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nOphelia. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you got any _selectmen_, or anybody, to interfere and\r\nlook after such matters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s commonly supposed that the _property_ interest is a sufficient\r\nguard in these cases. If people choose to ruin their own possessions, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done. It seems the poor creature was a thief\r\nand a drunkard; and so there won\xe2\x80\x99t be much hope to get up sympathy for\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is perfectly outrageous,\xe2\x80\x94it is horrid, Augustine! It will certainly\r\nbring down vengeance upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear cousin, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it; I would, if I\r\ncould. If low-minded, brutal people will act like themselves, what am I\r\nto do? they have absolute control; they are irresponsible despots.\r\nThere would be no use in interfering; there is no law that amounts to\r\nanything practically, for such a case. The best we can do is to shut\r\nour eyes and ears, and let it alone. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only resource left us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you shut your eyes and ears? How can you let such things\r\nalone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, what do you expect? Here is a whole class,\xe2\x80\x94debased,\r\nuneducated, indolent, provoking,\xe2\x80\x94put, without any sort of terms or\r\nconditions, entirely into the hands of such people as the majority in\r\nour world are; people who have neither consideration nor self-control,\r\nwho haven\xe2\x80\x99t even an enlightened regard to their own interest,\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the case with the largest half of mankind. Of course, in a\r\ncommunity so organized, what can a man of honorable and humane feelings\r\ndo, but shut his eyes all he can, and harden his heart? I can\xe2\x80\x99t buy\r\nevery poor wretch I see. I can\xe2\x80\x99t turn knight-errant, and undertake to\r\nredress every individual case of wrong in such a city as this. The most\r\nI can do is to try and keep out of the way of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s fine countenance was for a moment overcast; he said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, cousin, don\xe2\x80\x99t stand there looking like one of the Fates; you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nonly seen a peep through the curtain,\xe2\x80\x94a specimen of what is going on,\r\nthe world over, in some shape or other. If we are to be prying and\r\nspying into all the dismals of life, we should have no heart to\r\nanything. \xe2\x80\x99T is like looking too close into the details of Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkitchen;\xe2\x80\x9d and St. Clare lay back on the sofa, and busied himself with\r\nhis paper.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia sat down, and pulled out her knitting-work, and sat there\r\ngrim with indignation. She knit and knit, but while she mused the fire\r\nburned; at last she broke out\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, Augustine, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get over\r\nthings so, if you can. It\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect abomination for you to defend\r\nsuch a system,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s _my_ mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, looking up. \xe2\x80\x9cAt it again, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly abominable for you to defend such a system!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Ophelia, with increasing warmth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ defend it, my dear lady? Who ever said I did defend it?\xe2\x80\x9d said St.\r\nClare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you defend it,\xe2\x80\x94you all do,\xe2\x80\x94all you Southerners. What do you\r\nhave slaves for, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you such a sweet innocent as to suppose nobody in this world ever\r\ndoes what they don\xe2\x80\x99t think is right? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you, or didn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever, do\r\nanything that you did not think quite right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I do, I repent of it, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, rattling her\r\nneedles with energy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, peeling his orange; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m repenting of it all\r\nthe time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you keep on doing it for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever keep on doing wrong, after you\xe2\x80\x99d repented, my good\r\ncousin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, only when I\xe2\x80\x99ve been very much tempted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m very much tempted,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s just my\r\ndifficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I always resolve I won\xe2\x80\x99t and I try to break off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have been resolving I won\xe2\x80\x99t, off and on, these ten years,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid St. Clare; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, some how, got clear. Have you got clear\r\nof all your sins, cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousin Augustine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, seriously, and laying down her\r\nknitting-work, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I deserve that you should reprove my\r\nshort-comings. I know all you say is true enough; nobody else feels\r\nthem more than I do; but it does seem to me, after all, there is some\r\ndifference between me and you. It seems to me I would cut off my right\r\nhand sooner than keep on, from day to day, doing what I thought was\r\nwrong. But, then, my conduct is so inconsistent with my profession, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wonder you reprove me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, now, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Augustine, sitting down on the floor, and laying\r\nhis head back in her lap, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t take on so awfully serious! You know\r\nwhat a good-for-nothing, saucy boy I always was. I love to poke you\r\nup,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x94just to see you get earnest. I do think you are\r\ndesperately, distressingly good; it tires me to death to think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is a serious subject, my boy, Auguste,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia,\r\nlaying her hand on his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDismally so,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x94well, I never want to talk seriously in\r\nhot weather. What with mosquitos and all, a fellow can\xe2\x80\x99t get himself up\r\nto any very sublime moral flights; and I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare,\r\nsuddenly rousing himself up, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a theory, now! I understand now\r\nwhy northern nations are always more virtuous than southern ones,\xe2\x80\x94I see\r\ninto that whole subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Augustine, you are a sad rattle-brain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I? Well, so I am, I suppose; but for once I will be serious, now;\r\nbut you must hand me that basket of oranges;\xe2\x80\x94you see, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to\r\n\xe2\x80\x98stay me with flagons and comfort me with apples,\xe2\x80\x99 if I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make\r\nthis effort. Now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Augustine, drawing the basket up, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll begin:\r\nWhen, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a fellow\r\nto hold two or three dozen of his fellow-worms in captivity, a decent\r\nregard to the opinions of society requires\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see that you are growing more serious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m coming on,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear. The short of the matter is, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, his handsome face suddenly settling into an earnest and\r\nserious expression, \xe2\x80\x9con this abstract question of slavery there can, as\r\nI think, be but one opinion. Planters, who have money to make by\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x94clergymen, who have planters to please,\xe2\x80\x94politicians, who want to\r\nrule by it,\xe2\x80\x94may warp and bend language and ethics to a degree that\r\nshall astonish the world at their ingenuity; they can press nature and\r\nthe Bible, and nobody knows what else, into the service; but, after\r\nall, neither they nor the world believe in it one particle the more. It\r\ncomes from the devil, that\xe2\x80\x99s the short of it;\xe2\x80\x94and, to my mind, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npretty respectable specimen of what he can do in his own line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia stopped her knitting, and looked surprised, and St. Clare,\r\napparently enjoying her astonishment, went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to wonder; but if you will get me fairly at it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a\r\nclean breast of it. This cursed business, accursed of God and man, what\r\nis it? Strip it of all its ornament, run it down to the root and\r\nnucleus of the whole, and what is it? Why, because my brother Quashy is\r\nignorant and weak, and I am intelligent and strong,\xe2\x80\x94because I know how,\r\nand _can_ do it,\xe2\x80\x94therefore, I may steal all he has, keep it, and give\r\nhim only such and so much as suits my fancy. Whatever is too hard, too\r\ndirty, too disagreeable, for me, I may set Quashy to doing. Because I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like work, Quashy shall work. Because the sun burns me, Quashy\r\nshall stay in the sun. Quashy shall earn the money, and I will spend\r\nit. Quashy shall lie down in every puddle, that I may walk over\r\ndry-shod. Quashy shall do my will, and not his, all the days of his\r\nmortal life, and have such chance of getting to heaven, at last, as I\r\nfind convenient. This I take to be about what slavery _is_. I defy\r\nanybody on earth to read our slave-code, as it stands in our law-books,\r\nand make anything else of it. Talk of the _abuses_ of slavery! Humbug!\r\nThe _thing itself_ is the essence of all abuse! And the only reason why\r\nthe land don\xe2\x80\x99t sink under it, like Sodom and Gomorrah, is because it is\r\n_used_ in a way infinitely better than it is. For pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake, for\r\nshame\xe2\x80\x99s sake, because we are men born of women, and not savage beasts,\r\nmany of us do not, and dare not,\xe2\x80\x94we would _scorn_ to use the full power\r\nwhich our savage laws put into our hands. And he who goes the furthest,\r\nand does the worst, only uses within limits the power that the law\r\ngives him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare had started up, and, as his manner was when excited, was\r\nwalking, with hurried steps, up and down the floor. His fine face,\r\nclassic as that of a Greek statue, seemed actually to burn with the\r\nfervor of his feelings. His large blue eyes flashed, and he gestured\r\nwith an unconscious eagerness. Miss Ophelia had never seen him in this\r\nmood before, and she sat perfectly silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, suddenly stopping before his cousin \xe2\x80\x9c(It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno sort of use to talk or to feel on this subject), but I declare to\r\nyou, there have been times when I have thought, if the whole country\r\nwould sink, and hide all this injustice and misery from the light, I\r\nwould willingly sink with it. When I have been travelling up and down\r\non our boats, or about on my collecting tours, and reflected that every\r\nbrutal, disgusting, mean, low-lived fellow I met, was allowed by our\r\nlaws to become absolute despot of as many men, women and children, as\r\nhe could cheat, steal, or gamble money enough to buy,\xe2\x80\x94when I have seen\r\nsuch men in actual ownership of helpless children, of young girls and\r\nwomen,\xe2\x80\x94I have been ready to curse my country, to curse the human race!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugustine! Augustine!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve said\r\nenough. I never, in my life, heard anything like this, even at the\r\nNorth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the North!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, with a sudden change of expression, and\r\nresuming something of his habitual careless tone. \xe2\x80\x9cPooh! your northern\r\nfolks are cold-blooded; you are cool in everything! You can\xe2\x80\x99t begin to\r\ncurse up hill and down as we can, when we get fairly at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but the question is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, yes, to be sure, the _question is_,\xe2\x80\x94and a deuce of a question it\r\nis! How came _you_ in this state of sin and misery? Well, I shall\r\nanswer in the good old words you used to teach me, Sundays. I came so\r\nby ordinary generation. My servants were my father\xe2\x80\x99s, and, what is\r\nmore, my mother\xe2\x80\x99s; and now they are mine, they and their increase,\r\nwhich bids fair to be a pretty considerable item. My father, you know,\r\ncame first from New England; and he was just such another man as your\r\nfather,\xe2\x80\x94a regular old Roman,\xe2\x80\x94upright, energetic, noble-minded, with an\r\niron will. Your father settled down in New England, to rule over rocks\r\nand stones, and to force an existence out of Nature; and mine settled\r\nin Louisiana, to rule over men and women, and force existence out of\r\nthem. My mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, getting up and walking to a picture\r\nat the end of the room, and gazing upward with a face fervent with\r\nveneration, \xe2\x80\x9c_she was divine!_ Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me so!\xe2\x80\x94you know what I\r\nmean! She probably was of mortal birth; but, as far as ever I could\r\nobserve, there was no trace of any human weakness or error about her;\r\nand everybody that lives to remember her, whether bond or free,\r\nservant, acquaintance, relation, all say the same. Why, cousin, that\r\nmother has been all that has stood between me and utter unbelief for\r\nyears. She was a direct embodiment and personification of the New\r\nTestament,\xe2\x80\x94a living fact, to be accounted for, and to be accounted for\r\nin no other way than by its truth. O, mother! mother!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare,\r\nclasping his hands, in a sort of transport; and then suddenly checking\r\nhimself, he came back, and seating himself on an ottoman, he went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother and I were twins; and they say, you know, that twins ought\r\nto resemble each other; but we were in all points a contrast. He had\r\nblack, fiery eyes, coal-black hair, a strong, fine Roman profile, and a\r\nrich brown complexion. I had blue eyes, golden hair, a Greek outline,\r\nand fair complexion. He was active and observing, I dreamy and\r\ninactive. He was generous to his friends and equals, but proud,\r\ndominant, overbearing, to inferiors, and utterly unmerciful to whatever\r\nset itself up against him. Truthful we both were; he from pride and\r\ncourage, I from a sort of abstract ideality. We loved each other about\r\nas boys generally do,\xe2\x80\x94off and on, and in general;\xe2\x80\x94he was my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npet, and I my mother\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a morbid sensitiveness and acuteness of feeling in me on all\r\npossible subjects, of which he and my father had no kind of\r\nunderstanding, and with which they could have no possible sympathy. But\r\nmother did; and so, when I had quarreled with Alfred, and father looked\r\nsternly on me, I used to go off to mother\xe2\x80\x99s room, and sit by her. I\r\nremember just how she used to look, with her pale cheeks, her deep,\r\nsoft, serious eyes, her white dress,\xe2\x80\x94she always wore white; and I used\r\nto think of her whenever I read in Revelations about the saints that\r\nwere arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. She had a great deal of\r\ngenius of one sort and another, particularly in music; and she used to\r\nsit at her organ, playing fine old majestic music of the Catholic\r\nchurch, and singing with a voice more like an angel than a mortal\r\nwoman; and I would lay my head down on her lap, and cry, and dream, and\r\nfeel,\xe2\x80\x94oh, immeasurably!\xe2\x80\x94things that I had no language to say!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn those days, this matter of slavery had never been canvassed as it\r\nhas now; nobody dreamed of any harm in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father was a born aristocrat. I think, in some preexistent state,\r\nhe must have been in the higher circles of spirits, and brought all his\r\nold court pride along with him; for it was ingrain, bred in the bone,\r\nthough he was originally of poor and not in any way of noble family. My\r\nbrother was begotten in his image.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, an aristocrat, you know, the world over, has no human sympathies,\r\nbeyond a certain line in society. In England the line is in one place,\r\nin Burmah in another, and in America in another; but the aristocrat of\r\nall these countries never goes over it. What would be hardship and\r\ndistress and injustice in his own class, is a cool matter of course in\r\nanother one. My father\xe2\x80\x99s dividing line was that of color. _Among his\r\nequals_, never was a man more just and generous; but he considered the\r\nnegro, through all possible gradations of color, as an intermediate\r\nlink between man and animals, and graded all his ideas of justice or\r\ngenerosity on this hypothesis. I suppose, to be sure, if anybody had\r\nasked him, plump and fair, whether they had human immortal souls, he\r\nmight have hemmed and hawed, and said yes. But my father was not a man\r\nmuch troubled with spiritualism; religious sentiment he had none,\r\nbeyond a veneration for God, as decidedly the head of the upper\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my father worked some five hundred negroes; he was an\r\ninflexible, driving, punctilious business man; everything was to move\r\nby system,\xe2\x80\x94to be sustained with unfailing accuracy and precision. Now,\r\nif you take into account that all this was to be worked out by a set of\r\nlazy, twaddling, shiftless laborers, who had grown up, all their lives,\r\nin the absence of every possible motive to learn how to do anything but\r\n\xe2\x80\x98shirk,\xe2\x80\x99 as you Vermonters say, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that there might\r\nnaturally be, on his plantation, a great many things that looked\r\nhorrible and distressing to a sensitive child, like me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides all, he had an overseer,\xe2\x80\x94great, tall, slab-sided, two-fisted\r\nrenegade son of Vermont\xe2\x80\x94(begging your pardon),\xe2\x80\x94who had gone through a\r\nregular apprenticeship in hardness and brutality and taken his degree\r\nto be admitted to practice. My mother never could endure him, nor I;\r\nbut he obtained an entire ascendency over my father; and this man was\r\nthe absolute despot of the estate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a little fellow then, but I had the same love that I have now\r\nfor all kinds of human things,\xe2\x80\x94a kind of passion for the study of\r\nhumanity, come in what shape it would. I was found in the cabins and\r\namong the field-hands a great deal, and, of course, was a great\r\nfavorite; and all sorts of complaints and grievances were breathed in\r\nmy ear; and I told them to mother, and we, between us, formed a sort of\r\ncommittee for a redress of grievances. We hindered and repressed a\r\ngreat deal of cruelty, and congratulated ourselves on doing a vast deal\r\nof good, till, as often happens, my zeal overacted. Stubbs complained\r\nto my father that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage the hands, and must resign his\r\nposition. Father was a fond, indulgent husband, but a man that never\r\nflinched from anything that he thought necessary; and so he put down\r\nhis foot, like a rock, between us and the field-hands. He told my\r\nmother, in language perfectly respectful and deferential, but quite\r\nexplicit, that over the house-servants she should be entire mistress,\r\nbut that with the field-hands he could allow no interference. He\r\nrevered and respected her above all living beings; but he would have\r\nsaid it all the same to the virgin Mary herself, if she had come in the\r\nway of his system.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used sometimes to hear my mother reasoning cases with\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x94endeavoring to excite his sympathies. He would listen to the most\r\npathetic appeals with the most discouraging politeness and equanimity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It all resolves itself into this,\xe2\x80\x99 he would say; \xe2\x80\x98must I part with\r\nStubbs, or keep him? Stubbs is the soul of punctuality, honesty, and\r\nefficiency,\xe2\x80\x94a thorough business hand, and as humane as the general run.\r\nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t have perfection; and if I keep him, I must sustain his\r\nadministration as a _whole_, even if there are, now and then, things\r\nthat are exceptionable. All government includes some necessary\r\nhardness. General rules will bear hard on particular cases.\xe2\x80\x99 This last\r\nmaxim my father seemed to consider a settler in most alleged cases of\r\ncruelty. After he had said _that_, he commonly drew up his feet on the\r\nsofa, like a man that has disposed of a business, and betook himself to\r\na nap, or the newspaper, as the case might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is my father showed the exact sort of talent for a statesman.\r\nHe could have divided Poland as easily as an orange, or trod on Ireland\r\nas quietly and systematically as any man living. At last my mother gave\r\nup, in despair. It never will be known, till the last account, what\r\nnoble and sensitive natures like hers have felt, cast, utterly\r\nhelpless, into what seems to them an abyss of injustice and cruelty,\r\nand which seems so to nobody about them. It has been an age of long\r\nsorrow of such natures, in such a hell-begotten sort of world as ours.\r\nWhat remained for her, but to train her children in her own views and\r\nsentiments? Well, after all you say about training, children will grow\r\nup substantially what they _are_ by nature, and only that. From the\r\ncradle, Alfred was an aristocrat; and as he grew up, instinctively, all\r\nhis sympathies and all his reasonings were in that line, and all\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s exhortations went to the winds. As to me, they sunk deep into\r\nme. She never contradicted, in form, anything my father said, or seemed\r\ndirectly to differ from him; but she impressed, burnt into my very\r\nsoul, with all the force of her deep, earnest nature, an idea of the\r\ndignity and worth of the meanest human soul. I have looked in her face\r\nwith solemn awe, when she would point up to the stars in the evening,\r\nand say to me, \xe2\x80\x99See there, Auguste! the poorest, meanest soul on our\r\nplace will be living, when all these stars are gone forever,\xe2\x80\x94will live\r\nas long as God lives!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had some fine old paintings; one, in particular, of Jesus healing\r\na blind man. They were very fine, and used to impress me strongly. \xe2\x80\x98See\r\nthere, Auguste,\xe2\x80\x99 she would say; \xe2\x80\x98the blind man was a beggar, poor and\r\nloathsome; therefore, he would not heal him _afar off!_ He called him\r\nto him, and put _his hands on him!_ Remember this, my boy.\xe2\x80\x99 If I had\r\nlived to grow up under her care, she might have stimulated me to I know\r\nnot what of enthusiasm. I might have been a saint, reformer,\r\nmartyr,\xe2\x80\x94but, alas! alas! I went from her when I was only thirteen, and\r\nI never saw her again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare rested his head on his hands, and did not speak for some\r\nminutes. After a while, he looked up, and went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat poor, mean trash this whole business of human virtue is! A mere\r\nmatter, for the most part, of latitude and longitude, and geographical\r\nposition, acting with natural temperament. The greater part is nothing\r\nbut an accident! Your father, for example, settles in Vermont, in a\r\ntown where all are, in fact, free and equal; becomes a regular church\r\nmember and deacon, and in due time joins an Abolition society, and\r\nthinks us all little better than heathens. Yet he is, for all the\r\nworld, in constitution and habit, a duplicate of my father. I can see\r\nit leaking out in fifty different ways,\xe2\x80\x94just the same strong,\r\noverbearing, dominant spirit. You know very well how impossible it is\r\nto persuade some of the folks in your village that Squire Sinclair does\r\nnot feel above them. The fact is, though he has fallen on democratic\r\ntimes, and embraced a democratic theory, he is to the heart an\r\naristocrat, as much as my father, who ruled over five or six hundred\r\nslaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia felt rather disposed to cavil at this picture, and was\r\nlaying down her knitting to begin, but St. Clare stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I know every word you are going to say. I do not say they _were_\r\nalike, in fact. One fell into a condition where everything acted\r\nagainst the natural tendency, and the other where everything acted for\r\nit; and so one turned out a pretty wilful, stout, overbearing old\r\ndemocrat, and the other a wilful, stout old despot. If both had owned\r\nplantations in Louisiana, they would have been as like as two old\r\nbullets cast in the same mould.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an undutiful boy you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean them any disrespect,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know reverence\r\nis not my forte. But, to go back to my history:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen father died, he left the whole property to us twin boys, to be\r\ndivided as we should agree. There does not breathe on God\xe2\x80\x99s earth a\r\nnobler-souled, more generous fellow, than Alfred, in all that concerns\r\nhis equals; and we got on admirably with this property question,\r\nwithout a single unbrotherly word or feeling. We undertook to work the\r\nplantation together; and Alfred, whose outward life and capabilities\r\nhad double the strength of mine, became an enthusiastic planter, and a\r\nwonderfully successful one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut two years\xe2\x80\x99 trial satisfied me that I could not be a partner in\r\nthat matter. To have a great gang of seven hundred, whom I could not\r\nknow personally, or feel any individual interest in, bought and driven,\r\nhoused, fed, worked like so many horned cattle, strained up to military\r\nprecision,\xe2\x80\x94the question of how little of life\xe2\x80\x99s commonest enjoyments\r\nwould keep them in working order being a constantly recurring\r\nproblem,\xe2\x80\x94the necessity of drivers and overseers,\xe2\x80\x94the ever-necessary\r\nwhip, first, last, and only argument,\xe2\x80\x94the whole thing was insufferably\r\ndisgusting and loathsome to me; and when I thought of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nestimate of one poor human soul, it became even frightful!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense to talk to me about slaves _enjoying_ all this! To\r\nthis day, I have no patience with the unutterable trash that some of\r\nyour patronizing Northerners have made up, as in their zeal to\r\napologize for our sins. We all know better. Tell me that any man living\r\nwants to work all his days, from day-dawn till dark, under the constant\r\neye of a master, without the power of putting forth one irresponsible\r\nvolition, on the same dreary, monotonous, unchanging toil, and all for\r\ntwo pairs of pantaloons and a pair of shoes a year, with enough food\r\nand shelter to keep him in working order! Any man who thinks that human\r\nbeings can, as a general thing, be made about as comfortable that way\r\nas any other, I wish he might try it. I\xe2\x80\x99d buy the dog, and work him,\r\nwith a clear conscience!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always have supposed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you, all of you,\r\napproved of these things, and thought them _right_\xe2\x80\x94according to\r\nScripture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumbug! We are not quite reduced to that yet. Alfred who is as\r\ndetermined a despot as ever walked, does not pretend to this kind of\r\ndefence;\xe2\x80\x94no, he stands, high and haughty, on that good old respectable\r\nground, _the right of the strongest_; and he says, and I think quite\r\nsensibly, that the American planter is \xe2\x80\x98only doing, in another form,\r\nwhat the English aristocracy and capitalists are doing by the lower\r\nclasses;\xe2\x80\x99 that is, I take it, _appropriating_ them, body and bone, soul\r\nand spirit, to their use and convenience. He defends both,\xe2\x80\x94and I think,\r\nat least, _consistently_. He says that there can be no high\r\ncivilization without enslavement of the masses, either nominal or real.\r\nThere must, he says, be a lower class, given up to physical toil and\r\nconfined to an animal nature; and a higher one thereby acquires leisure\r\nand wealth for a more expanded intelligence and improvement, and\r\nbecomes the directing soul of the lower. So he reasons, because, as I\r\nsaid, he is born an aristocrat;\xe2\x80\x94so I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe, because I was born\r\na democrat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow in the world can the two things be compared?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe English laborer is not sold, traded, parted from his family,\r\nwhipped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is as much at the will of his employer as if he were sold to him.\r\nThe slave-owner can whip his refractory slave to death,\xe2\x80\x94the capitalist\r\ncan starve him to death. As to family security, it is hard to say which\r\nis the worst,\xe2\x80\x94to have one\xe2\x80\x99s children sold, or see them starve to death\r\nat home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s no kind of apology for slavery, to prove that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t worse\r\nthan some other bad thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t give it for one,\xe2\x80\x94nay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say, besides, that ours is the\r\nmore bold and palpable infringement of human rights; actually buying a\r\nman up, like a horse,\xe2\x80\x94looking at his teeth, cracking his joints, and\r\ntrying his paces and then paying down for him,\xe2\x80\x94having speculators,\r\nbreeders, traders, and brokers in human bodies and souls,\xe2\x80\x94sets the\r\nthing before the eyes of the civilized world in a more tangible form,\r\nthough the thing done be, after all, in its nature, the same; that is,\r\nappropriating one set of human beings to the use and improvement of\r\nanother without any regard to their own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought of the matter in this light,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve travelled in England some, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked over a good many\r\ndocuments as to the state of their lower classes; and I really think\r\nthere is no denying Alfred, when he says that his slaves are better off\r\nthan a large class of the population of England. You see, you must not\r\ninfer, from what I have told you, that Alfred is what is called a hard\r\nmaster; for he isn\xe2\x80\x99t. He is despotic, and unmerciful to\r\ninsubordination; he would shoot a fellow down with as little remorse as\r\nhe would shoot a buck, if he opposed him. But, in general, he takes a\r\nsort of pride in having his slaves comfortably fed and accommodated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was with him, I insisted that he should do something for their\r\ninstruction; and, to please me, he did get a chaplain, and used to have\r\nthem catechized Sunday, though, I believe, in his heart, that he\r\nthought it would do about as much good to set a chaplain over his dogs\r\nand horses. And the fact is, that a mind stupefied and animalized by\r\nevery bad influence from the hour of birth, spending the whole of every\r\nweek-day in unreflecting toil, cannot be done much with by a few hours\r\non Sunday. The teachers of Sunday-schools among the manufacturing\r\npopulation of England, and among plantation-hands in our country, could\r\nperhaps testify to the same result, _there and here_. Yet some striking\r\nexceptions there are among us, from the fact that the negro is\r\nnaturally more impressible to religious sentiment than the white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9chow came you to give up your plantation\r\nlife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we jogged on together some time, till Alfred saw plainly that I\r\nwas no planter. He thought it absurd, after he had reformed, and\r\naltered, and improved everywhere, to suit my notions, that I still\r\nremained unsatisfied. The fact was, it was, after all, the THING that I\r\nhated\xe2\x80\x94the using these men and women, the perpetuation of all this\r\nignorance, brutality and vice,\xe2\x80\x94just to make money for me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, I was always interfering in the details. Being myself one of\r\nthe laziest of mortals, I had altogether too much fellow-feeling for\r\nthe lazy; and when poor, shiftless dogs put stones at the bottom of\r\ntheir cotton-baskets to make them weigh heavier, or filled their sacks\r\nwith dirt, with cotton at the top, it seemed so exactly like what I\r\nshould do if I were they, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have them flogged for\r\nit. Well, of course, there was an end of plantation discipline; and Alf\r\nand I came to about the same point that I and my respected father did,\r\nyears before. So he told me that I was a womanish sentimentalist, and\r\nwould never do for business life; and advised me to take the bank-stock\r\nand the New Orleans family mansion, and go to writing poetry, and let\r\nhim manage the plantation. So we parted, and I came here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you free your slaves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t up to that. To hold them as tools for money-making, I\r\ncould not;\xe2\x80\x94have them to help spend money, you know, didn\xe2\x80\x99t look quite\r\nso ugly to me. Some of them were old house-servants, to whom I was much\r\nattached; and the younger ones were children to the old. All were well\r\nsatisfied to be as they were.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, and walked reflectively up\r\nand down the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9ca time in my life when I had plans and\r\nhopes of doing something in this world, more than to float and drift. I\r\nhad vague, indistinct yearnings to be a sort of emancipator,\xe2\x80\x94to free my\r\nnative land from this spot and stain. All young men have had such\r\nfever-fits, I suppose, some time,\xe2\x80\x94but then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou ought not to put your hand to\r\nthe plough, and look back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, well, things didn\xe2\x80\x99t go with me as I expected, and I got the despair\r\nof living that Solomon did. I suppose it was a necessary incident to\r\nwisdom in us both; but, some how or other, instead of being actor and\r\nregenerator in society, I became a piece of driftwood, and have been\r\nfloating and eddying about, ever since. Alfred scolds me, every time we\r\nmeet; and he has the better of me, I grant,\xe2\x80\x94for he really does\r\nsomething; his life is a logical result of his opinions and mine is a\r\ncontemptible _non sequitur_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear cousin, can you be satisfied with such a way of spending your\r\nprobation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSatisfied! Was I not just telling you I despised it? But, then, to\r\ncome back to this point,\xe2\x80\x94we were on this liberation business. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink my feelings about slavery are peculiar. I find many men who, in\r\ntheir hearts, think of it just as I do. The land groans under it; and,\r\nbad as it is for the slave, it is worse, if anything, for the master.\r\nIt takes no spectacles to see that a great class of vicious,\r\nimprovident, degraded people, among us, are an evil to us, as well as\r\nto themselves. The capitalist and aristocrat of England cannot feel\r\nthat as we do, because they do not mingle with the class they degrade\r\nas we do. They are in our homes; they are the associates of our\r\nchildren, and they form their minds faster than we can; for they are a\r\nrace that children always will cling to and assimilate with. If Eva,\r\nnow, was not more angel than ordinary, she would be ruined. We might as\r\nwell allow the small-pox to run among them, and think our children\r\nwould not take it, as to let them be uninstructed and vicious, and\r\nthink our children will not be affected by that. Yet our laws\r\npositively and utterly forbid any efficient general educational system,\r\nand they do it wisely, too; for, just begin and thoroughly educate one\r\ngeneration, and the whole thing would be blown sky high. If we did not\r\ngive them liberty, they would take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you think will be the end of this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. One thing is certain,\xe2\x80\x94that there is a mustering among\r\nthe masses, the world over; and there is a _dies ir\xc3\xa6_ coming on, sooner\r\nor later. The same thing is working in Europe, in England, and in this\r\ncountry. My mother used to tell me of a millennium that was coming,\r\nwhen Christ should reign, and all men should be free and happy. And she\r\ntaught me, when I was a boy, to pray, \xe2\x80\x99thy kingdom come.\xe2\x80\x99 Sometimes I\r\nthink all this sighing, and groaning, and stirring among the dry bones\r\nforetells what she used to tell me was coming. But who may abide the\r\nday of His appearing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugustine, sometimes I think you are not far from the kingdom,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Ophelia, laying down her knitting, and looking anxiously at her\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for your good opinion, but it\xe2\x80\x99s up and down with me,\xe2\x80\x94up to\r\nheaven\xe2\x80\x99s gate in theory, down in earth\xe2\x80\x99s dust in practice. But there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe teabell,\xe2\x80\x94do let\xe2\x80\x99s go,\xe2\x80\x94and don\xe2\x80\x99t say, now, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had one\r\ndownright serious talk, for once in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt table, Marie alluded to the incident of Prue. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nthink, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we are all barbarians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that\xe2\x80\x99s a barbarous thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink you are all barbarians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, \xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to get along with some\r\nof these creatures. They are so bad they ought not to live. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfeel a particle of sympathy for such cases. If they\xe2\x80\x99d only behave\r\nthemselves, it would not happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cthe poor creature was unhappy; that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nmade her drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, fiddlestick! as if that were any excuse! I\xe2\x80\x99m unhappy, very often. I\r\npresume,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pensively, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve had greater trials than ever\r\nshe had. It\xe2\x80\x99s just because they are so bad. There\xe2\x80\x99s some of them that\r\nyou cannot break in by any kind of severity. I remember father had a\r\nman that was so lazy he would run away just to get rid of work, and lie\r\nround in the swamps, stealing and doing all sorts of horrid things.\r\nThat man was caught and whipped, time and again, and it never did him\r\nany good; and the last time he crawled off, though he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t but just\r\ngo, and died in the swamp. There was no sort of reason for it, for\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s hands were always treated kindly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI broke a fellow in, once,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cthat all the overseers\r\nand masters had tried their hands on in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cwell, I\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to know when _you_ ever did\r\nanything of the sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he was a powerful, gigantic fellow,\xe2\x80\x94a native-born African; and\r\nhe appeared to have the rude instinct of freedom in him to an uncommon\r\ndegree. He was a regular African lion. They called him Scipio. Nobody\r\ncould do anything with him; and he was sold round from overseer to\r\noverseer, till at last Alfred bought him, because he thought he could\r\nmanage him. Well, one day he knocked down the overseer, and was fairly\r\noff into the swamps. I was on a visit to Alf\xe2\x80\x99s plantation, for it was\r\nafter we had dissolved partnership. Alfred was greatly exasperated; but\r\nI told him that it was his own fault, and laid him any wager that I\r\ncould break the man; and finally it was agreed that, if I caught him, I\r\nshould have him to experiment on. So they mustered out a party of some\r\nsix or seven, with guns and dogs, for the hunt. People, you know, can\r\nget up as much enthusiasm in hunting a man as a deer, if it is only\r\ncustomary; in fact, I got a little excited myself, though I had only\r\nput in as a sort of mediator, in case he was caught.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the dogs bayed and howled, and we rode and scampered, and\r\nfinally we started him. He ran and bounded like a buck, and kept us\r\nwell in the rear for some time; but at last he got caught in an\r\nimpenetrable thicket of cane; then he turned to bay, and I tell you he\r\nfought the dogs right gallantly. He dashed them to right and left, and\r\nactually killed three of them with only his naked fists, when a shot\r\nfrom a gun brought him down, and he fell, wounded and bleeding, almost\r\nat my feet. The poor fellow looked up at me with manhood and despair\r\nboth in his eye. I kept back the dogs and the party, as they came\r\npressing up, and claimed him as my prisoner. It was all I could do to\r\nkeep them from shooting him, in the flush of success; but I persisted\r\nin my bargain, and Alfred sold him to me. Well, I took him in hand, and\r\nin one fortnight I had him tamed down as submissive and tractable as\r\nheart could desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world did you do to him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was quite a simple process. I took him to my own room, had a\r\ngood bed made for him, dressed his wounds, and tended him myself, until\r\nhe got fairly on his feet again. And, in process of time, I had free\r\npapers made out for him, and told him he might go where he liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did he go?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. The foolish fellow tore the paper in two, and absolutely refused\r\nto leave me. I never had a braver, better fellow,\xe2\x80\x94trusty and true as\r\nsteel. He embraced Christianity afterwards, and became as gentle as a\r\nchild. He used to oversee my place on the lake, and did it capitally,\r\ntoo. I lost him the first cholera season. In fact, he laid down his\r\nlife for me. For I was sick, almost to death; and when, through the\r\npanic, everybody else fled, Scipio worked for me like a giant, and\r\nactually brought me back into life again. But, poor fellow! he was\r\ntaken, right after, and there was no saving him. I never felt anybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloss more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEva had come gradually nearer and nearer to her father, as he told the\r\nstory,\xe2\x80\x94her small lips apart, her eyes wide and earnest with absorbing\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nAs he finished, she suddenly threw her arms around his neck, burst into\r\ntears, and sobbed convulsively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva, dear child! what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, as the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsmall frame trembled and shook with the violence of her feelings. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nchild,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cought not to hear any of this kind of thing,\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnervous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, papa, I\xe2\x80\x99m not nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, controlling herself, suddenly,\r\nwith a strength of resolution singular in such a child. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nnervous, but these things _sink into my heart_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Eva?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, papa, I think a great many thoughts. Perhaps some\r\nday I shall tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, think away, dear,\xe2\x80\x94only don\xe2\x80\x99t cry and worry your papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said St.\r\nClare, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x94see what a beautiful peach I have got for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEva took it and smiled, though there was still a nervous twiching about\r\nthe corners of her mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, look at the gold-fish,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, taking her hand and\r\nstepping on to the verandah. A few moments, and merry laughs were heard\r\nthrough the silken curtains, as Eva and St. Clare were pelting each\r\nother with roses, and chasing each other among the alleys of the court.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is danger that our humble friend Tom be neglected amid the\r\nadventures of the higher born; but, if our readers will accompany us up\r\nto a little loft over the stable, they may, perhaps, learn a little of\r\nhis affairs. It was a decent room, containing a bed, a chair, and a\r\nsmall, rough stand, where lay Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Bible and hymn-book; and where he\r\nsits, at present, with his slate before him, intent on something that\r\nseems to cost him a great deal of anxious thought.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that Tom\xe2\x80\x99s home-yearnings had become so strong that he\r\nhad begged a sheet of writing-paper of Eva, and, mustering up all his\r\nsmall stock of literary attainment acquired by Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstructions, he conceived the bold idea of writing a letter; and he\r\nwas busy now, on his slate, getting out his first draft. Tom was in a\r\ngood deal of trouble, for the forms of some of the letters he had\r\nforgotten entirely; and of what he did remember, he did not know\r\nexactly which to use. And while he was working, and breathing very\r\nhard, in his earnestness, Eva alighted, like a bird, on the round of\r\nhis chair behind him, and peeped over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Uncle Tom! what funny things you _are_ making, there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to write to my poor old woman, Miss Eva, and my little\r\nchil\xe2\x80\x99en,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, drawing the back of his hand over his eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cbut,\r\nsome how, I\xe2\x80\x99m feard I shan\xe2\x80\x99t make it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could help you, Tom! I\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt to write some. Last year I\r\ncould make all the letters, but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Eva put her golden head close to his, and the two commenced a grave\r\nand anxious discussion, each one equally earnest, and about equally\r\nignorant; and, with a deal of consulting and advising over every word,\r\nthe composition began, as they both felt very sanguine, to look quite\r\nlike writing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Uncle Tom, it really begins to look beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, gazing\r\ndelightedly on it. \xe2\x80\x9cHow pleased your wife\xe2\x80\x99ll be, and the poor little\r\nchildren! O, it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame you ever had to go away from them! I mean to\r\nask papa to let you go back, some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissis said that she would send down money for me, as soon as they\r\ncould get it together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99spectin, she will. Young Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\r\nGeorge, he said he\xe2\x80\x99d come for me; and he gave me this yer dollar as a\r\nsign;\xe2\x80\x9d and Tom drew from under his clothes the precious dollar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, he\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly come, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wanted to send a letter, you know, to let \xe2\x80\x99em know whar I was,\r\nand tell poor Chloe that I was well off,\xe2\x80\x94cause she felt so drefful,\r\npoor soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s voice, coming in the door at this moment.\r\n\r\nTom and Eva both started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s here?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, coming up and looking at the slate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, it\xe2\x80\x99s Tom\xe2\x80\x99s letter. I\xe2\x80\x99m helping him to write it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva; \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit nice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t discourage either of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I rather\r\nthink, Tom, you\xe2\x80\x99d better get me to write your letter for you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nit, when I come home from my ride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very important he should write,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause his mistress\r\nis going to send down money to redeem him, you know, papa; he told me\r\nthey told him so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare thought, in his heart, that this was probably only one of\r\nthose things which good-natured owners say to their servants, to\r\nalleviate their horror of being sold, without any intention of\r\nfulfilling the expectation thus excited. But he did not make any\r\naudible comment upon it,\xe2\x80\x94only ordered Tom to get the horses out for a\r\nride.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s letter was written in due form for him that evening, and safely\r\nlodged in the post-office.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia still persevered in her labors in the housekeeping line.\r\nIt was universally agreed, among all the household, from Dinah down to\r\nthe youngest urchin, that Miss Ophelia was decidedly \xe2\x80\x9ccuris,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a term by\r\nwhich a southern servant implies that his or her betters don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly\r\nsuit them.\r\n\r\nThe higher circle in the family\xe2\x80\x94to wit, Adolph, Jane and Rosa\xe2\x80\x94agreed\r\nthat she was no lady; ladies never keep working about as she did,\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nshe had no _air_ at all; and they were surprised that she should be any\r\nrelation of the St. Clares. Even Marie declared that it was absolutely\r\nfatiguing to see Cousin Ophelia always so busy. And, in fact, Miss\r\nOphelia\xe2\x80\x99s industry was so incessant as to lay some foundation for the\r\ncomplaint. She sewed and stitched away, from daylight till dark, with\r\nthe energy of one who is pressed on by some immediate urgency; and\r\nthen, when the light faded, and the work was folded away, with one turn\r\nout came the ever-ready knitting-work, and there she was again, going\r\non as briskly as ever. It really was a labor to see her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\nTopsy\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, while Miss Ophelia was busy in some of her domestic cares,\r\nSt. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard, calling her at the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome down here, Cousin, I\xe2\x80\x99ve something to show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, coming down, with her sewing in her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made a purchase for your department,\xe2\x80\x94see here,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare;\r\nand, with the word, he pulled along a little negro girl, about eight or\r\nnine years of age.\r\n\r\nShe was one of the blackest of her race; and her round shining eyes,\r\nglittering as glass beads, moved with quick and restless glances over\r\neverything in the room. Her mouth, half open with astonishment at the\r\nwonders of the new Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s parlor, displayed a white and brilliant set\r\nof teeth. Her woolly hair was braided in sundry little tails, which\r\nstuck out in every direction. The expression of her face was an odd\r\nmixture of shrewdness and cunning, over which was oddly drawn, like a\r\nkind of veil, an expression of the most doleful gravity and solemnity.\r\nShe was dressed in a single filthy, ragged garment, made of bagging;\r\nand stood with her hands demurely folded before her. Altogether, there\r\nwas something odd and goblin-like about her appearance,\xe2\x80\x94something, as\r\nMiss Ophelia afterwards said, \xe2\x80\x9cso heathenish,\xe2\x80\x9d as to inspire that good\r\nlady with utter dismay; and turning to St. Clare, she said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugustine, what in the world have you brought that thing here for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you to educate, to be sure, and train in the way she should go. I\r\nthought she was rather a funny specimen in the Jim Crow line. Here,\r\nTopsy,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, giving a whistle, as a man would to call the\r\nattention of a dog, \xe2\x80\x9cgive us a song, now, and show us some of your\r\ndancing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe black, glassy eyes glittered with a kind of wicked drollery, and\r\nthe thing struck up, in a clear shrill voice, an odd negro melody, to\r\nwhich she kept time with her hands and feet, spinning round, clapping\r\nher hands, knocking her knees together, in a wild, fantastic sort of\r\ntime, and producing in her throat all those odd guttural sounds which\r\ndistinguish the native music of her race; and finally, turning a\r\nsummerset or two, and giving a prolonged closing note, as odd and\r\nunearthly as that of a steam-whistle, she came suddenly down on the\r\ncarpet, and stood with her hands folded, and a most sanctimonious\r\nexpression of meekness and solemnity over her face, only broken by the\r\ncunning glances which she shot askance from the corners of her eyes.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia stood silent, perfectly paralyzed with amazement. St.\r\nClare, like a mischievous fellow as he was, appeared to enjoy her\r\nastonishment; and, addressing the child again, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTopsy, this is your new mistress. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you up to her; see\r\nnow that you behave yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy, with sanctimonious gravity, her wicked eyes\r\ntwinkling as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to be good, Topsy, you understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy, with another twinkle, her hands still\r\ndevoutly folded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Augustine, what upon earth is this for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nhouse is so full of these little plagues, now, that a body can\xe2\x80\x99t set\r\ndown their foot without treading on \xe2\x80\x99em. I get up in the morning, and\r\nfind one asleep behind the door, and see one black head poking out from\r\nunder the table, one lying on the door-mat,\xe2\x80\x94and they are mopping and\r\nmowing and grinning between all the railings, and tumbling over the\r\nkitchen floor! What on earth did you want to bring this one for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you to educate\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you? You\xe2\x80\x99re always preaching about\r\neducating. I thought I would make you a present of a fresh-caught\r\nspecimen, and let you try your hand on her, and bring her up in the way\r\nshe should go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want her, I am sure;\xe2\x80\x94I have more to do with \xe2\x80\x99em now than I\r\nwant to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s you Christians, all over!\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll get up a society, and get some\r\npoor missionary to spend all his days among just such heathen. But let\r\nme see one of you that would take one into your house with you, and\r\ntake the labor of their conversion on yourselves! No; when it comes to\r\nthat, they are dirty and disagreeable, and it\xe2\x80\x99s too much care, and so\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugustine, you know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of it in that light,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nOphelia, evidently softening. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it might be a real missionary\r\nwork,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, looking rather more favorably on the child.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare had touched the right string. Miss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconscientiousness was ever on the alert. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cI really\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t see the need of buying this one;\xe2\x80\x94there are enough now, in your\r\nhouse, to take all my time and skill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, drawing her aside, \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to\r\nbeg your pardon for my good-for-nothing speeches. You are so good,\r\nafter all, that there\xe2\x80\x99s no sense in them. Why, the fact is, this\r\nconcern belonged to a couple of drunken creatures that keep a low\r\nrestaurant that I have to pass by every day, and I was tired of hearing\r\nher screaming, and them beating and swearing at her. She looked bright\r\nand funny, too, as if something might be made of her;\xe2\x80\x94so I bought her,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll give her to you. Try, now, and give her a good orthodox New\r\nEngland bringing up, and see what it\xe2\x80\x99ll make of her. You know I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nany gift that way; but I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do what I can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia; and she approached her\r\nnew subject very much as a person might be supposed to approach a black\r\nspider, supposing them to have benevolent designs toward it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s dreadfully dirty, and half naked,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, take her down stairs, and make some of them clean and clothe her\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia carried her to the kitchen regions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t see what Mas\xe2\x80\x99r St. Clare wants of \xe2\x80\x99nother nigger!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah,\r\nsurveying the new arrival with no friendly air. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t have her around\r\nunder _my_ feet, _I_ know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosa and Jane, with supreme disgust; \xe2\x80\x9clet her keep out of\r\nour way! What in the world Mas\xe2\x80\x99r wanted another of these low niggers\r\nfor, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go long! No more nigger dan you be, Miss Rosa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, who\r\nfelt this last remark a reflection on herself. \xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to tink\r\nyourself white folks. You an\xe2\x80\x99t nerry one, black _nor_ white, I\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nto be one or turrer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia saw that there was nobody in the camp that would undertake\r\nto oversee the cleansing and dressing of the new arrival; and so she\r\nwas forced to do it herself, with some very ungracious and reluctant\r\nassistance from Jane.\r\n\r\nIt is not for ears polite to hear the particulars of the first toilet\r\nof a neglected, abused child. In fact, in this world, multitudes must\r\nlive and die in a state that it would be too great a shock to the\r\nnerves of their fellow-mortals even to hear described. Miss Ophelia had\r\na good, strong, practical deal of resolution; and she went through all\r\nthe disgusting details with heroic thoroughness, though, it must be\r\nconfessed, with no very gracious air,\xe2\x80\x94for endurance was the utmost to\r\nwhich her principles could bring her. When she saw, on the back and\r\nshoulders of the child, great welts and calloused spots, ineffaceable\r\nmarks of the system under which she had grown up thus far, her heart\r\nbecame pitiful within her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee there!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane, pointing to the marks, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t that show she\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlimb? We\xe2\x80\x99ll have fine works with her, I reckon. I hate these nigger\r\nyoung uns! so disgusting! I wonder that Mas\xe2\x80\x99r would buy her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cyoung un\xe2\x80\x9d alluded to heard all these comments with the subdued and\r\ndoleful air which seemed habitual to her, only scanning, with a keen\r\nand furtive glance of her flickering eyes, the ornaments which Jane\r\nwore in her ears. When arrayed at last in a suit of decent and whole\r\nclothing, her hair cropped short to her head, Miss Ophelia, with some\r\nsatisfaction, said she looked more Christian-like than she did, and in\r\nher own mind began to mature some plans for her instruction.\r\n\r\nSitting down before her, she began to question her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you, Topsy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDun no, Missis,\xe2\x80\x9d said the image, with a grin that showed all her\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know how old you are? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody ever tell you? Who was your\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever had none!\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, with another grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever had any mother? What do you mean? Where were you born?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever was born!\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Topsy, with another grin, that looked so\r\ngoblin-like, that, if Miss Ophelia had been at all nervous, she might\r\nhave fancied that she had got hold of some sooty gnome from the land of\r\nDiablerie; but Miss Ophelia was not nervous, but plain and\r\nbusiness-like, and she said, with some sternness,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t answer me in that way, child; I\xe2\x80\x99m not playing with you.\r\nTell me where you were born, and who your father and mother were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever was born,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated the creature, more emphatically; \xe2\x80\x9cnever\r\nhad no father nor mother, nor nothin\xe2\x80\x99. I was raised by a speculator,\r\nwith lots of others. Old Aunt Sue used to take car on us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child was evidently sincere, and Jane, breaking into a short laugh,\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, Missis, there\xe2\x80\x99s heaps of \xe2\x80\x99em. Speculators buys \xe2\x80\x99em up cheap,\r\nwhen they\xe2\x80\x99s little, and gets \xe2\x80\x99em raised for market.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you lived with your master and mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDun no, Missis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a year, or more, or less?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDun no, Missis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, Missis, those low negroes,\xe2\x80\x94they can\xe2\x80\x99t tell; they don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nanything about time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane; \xe2\x80\x9cthey don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a year is; they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know their own ages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever heard anything about God, Topsy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child looked bewildered, but grinned as usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who made you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody, as I knows on,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, with a short laugh.\r\n\r\nThe idea appeared to amuse her considerably; for her eyes twinkled, and\r\nshe added,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spect I grow\xe2\x80\x99d. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think nobody never made me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how to sew?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, who thought she would turn\r\nher inquiries to something more tangible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Missis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do?\xe2\x80\x94what did you do for your master and mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFetch water, and wash dishes, and rub knives, and wait on folks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere they good to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpect they was,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, scanning Miss Ophelia cunningly.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia rose from this encouraging colloquy; St. Clare was leaning\r\nover the back of her chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou find virgin soil there, Cousin; put in your own ideas,\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind many to pull up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s ideas of education, like all her other ideas, were very\r\nset and definite; and of the kind that prevailed in New England a\r\ncentury ago, and which are still preserved in some very retired and\r\nunsophisticated parts, where there are no railroads. As nearly as could\r\nbe expressed, they could be comprised in very few words: to teach them\r\nto mind when they were spoken to; to teach them the catechism, sewing,\r\nand reading; and to whip them if they told lies. And though, of course,\r\nin the flood of light that is now poured on education, these are left\r\nfar away in the rear, yet it is an undisputed fact that our\r\ngrandmothers raised some tolerably fair men and women under this\r\nregime, as many of us can remember and testify. At all events, Miss\r\nOphelia knew of nothing else to do; and, therefore, applied her mind to\r\nher heathen with the best diligence she could command.\r\n\r\nThe child was announced and considered in the family as Miss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngirl; and, as she was looked upon with no gracious eye in the kitchen,\r\nMiss Ophelia resolved to confine her sphere of operation and\r\ninstruction chiefly to her own chamber. With a self-sacrifice which\r\nsome of our readers will appreciate, she resolved, instead of\r\ncomfortably making her own bed, sweeping and dusting her own\r\nchamber,\xe2\x80\x94which she had hitherto done, in utter scorn of all offers of\r\nhelp from the chambermaid of the establishment,\xe2\x80\x94to condemn herself to\r\nthe martyrdom of instructing Topsy to perform these operations,\xe2\x80\x94ah, woe\r\nthe day! Did any of our readers ever do the same, they will appreciate\r\nthe amount of her self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia began with Topsy by taking her into her chamber, the first\r\nmorning, and solemnly commencing a course of instruction in the art and\r\nmystery of bed-making.\r\n\r\nBehold, then, Topsy, washed and shorn of all the little braided tails\r\nwherein her heart had delighted, arrayed in a clean gown, with\r\nwell-starched apron, standing reverently before Miss Ophelia, with an\r\nexpression of solemnity well befitting a funeral.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Topsy, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to show you just how my bed is to be made. I am\r\nvery particular about my bed. You must learn exactly how to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d says Topsy, with a deep sigh, and a face of woful\r\nearnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Topsy, look here;\xe2\x80\x94this is the hem of the sheet,\xe2\x80\x94this is the right\r\nside of the sheet, and this is the wrong;\xe2\x80\x94will you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d says Topsy, with another sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, the under sheet you must bring over the bolster,\xe2\x80\x94so\xe2\x80\x94and\r\ntuck it clear down under the mattress nice and smooth,\xe2\x80\x94so,\xe2\x80\x94do you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy, with profound attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the upper sheet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cmust be brought down in this\r\nway, and tucked under firm and smooth at the foot,\xe2\x80\x94so,\xe2\x80\x94the narrow hem\r\nat the foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy, as before;\xe2\x80\x94but we will add, what Miss Ophelia\r\ndid not see, that, during the time when the good lady\xe2\x80\x99s back was turned\r\nin the zeal of her manipulations, the young disciple had contrived to\r\nsnatch a pair of gloves and a ribbon, which she had adroitly slipped\r\ninto her sleeves, and stood with her hands dutifully folded, as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Topsy, let\xe2\x80\x99s see _you_ do this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, pulling off\r\nthe clothes, and seating herself.\r\n\r\nTopsy, with great gravity and adroitness, went through the exercise\r\ncompletely to Miss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction; smoothing the sheets,\r\npatting out every wrinkle, and exhibiting, through the whole process, a\r\ngravity and seriousness with which her instructress was greatly\r\nedified. By an unlucky slip, however, a fluttering fragment of the\r\nribbon hung out of one of her sleeves, just as she was finishing, and\r\ncaught Miss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Instantly, she pounced upon it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this? You naughty, wicked child,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve been stealing this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ribbon was pulled out of Topsy\xe2\x80\x99s own sleeve, yet was she not in the\r\nleast disconcerted; she only looked at it with an air of the most\r\nsurprised and unconscious innocence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws! why, that ar\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Feely\xe2\x80\x99s ribbon, an\xe2\x80\x99t it? How could it a got\r\ncaught in my sleeve?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTopsy, you naughty girl, don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me a lie,\xe2\x80\x94you stole that\r\nribbon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissis, I declar for \xe2\x80\x99t, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t;\xe2\x80\x94never seed it till dis yer blessed\r\nminnit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTopsy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you know it\xe2\x80\x99s wicked to tell lies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never tell no lies, Miss Feely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy, with virtuous gravity;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s jist the truth I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a tellin now, and an\xe2\x80\x99t nothin else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTopsy, I shall have to whip you, if you tell lies so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, Missis, if you\xe2\x80\x99s to whip all day, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say no other way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Topsy, beginning to blubber. \xe2\x80\x9cI never seed dat ar,\xe2\x80\x94it must a got\r\ncaught in my sleeve. Miss Feeley must have left it on the bed, and it\r\ngot caught in the clothes, and so got in my sleeve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia was so indignant at the barefaced lie, that she caught the\r\nchild and shook her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me that again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shake brought the glove on to the floor, from the other sleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you tell me now, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsteal the ribbon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTopsy now confessed to the gloves, but still persisted in denying the\r\nribbon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Topsy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ll confess all about it, I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t whip you this time.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus adjured, Topsy confessed to the ribbon\r\nand gloves, with woful protestations of penitence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, tell me. I know you must have taken other things since you\r\nhave been in the house, for I let you run about all day yesterday. Now,\r\ntell me if you took anything, and I shan\xe2\x80\x99t whip you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, Missis! I took Miss Eva\xe2\x80\x99s red thing she wars on her neck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did, you naughty child!\xe2\x80\x94Well, what else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took Rosa\xe2\x80\x99s yer-rings,\xe2\x80\x94them red ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo bring them to me this minute, both of \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, Missis! I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x94they \xe2\x80\x99s burnt up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurnt up!\xe2\x80\x94what a story! Go get \xe2\x80\x99em, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll whip you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTopsy, with loud protestations, and tears, and groans, declared that\r\nshe _could_ not. \xe2\x80\x9cThey \xe2\x80\x99s burnt up,\xe2\x80\x94they was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you burn \xe2\x80\x99em for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCause I \xe2\x80\x99s wicked,\xe2\x80\x94I is. I \xe2\x80\x99s mighty wicked, any how. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust at this moment, Eva came innocently into the room, with the\r\nidentical coral necklace on her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Eva, where did you get your necklace?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet it? Why, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it on all day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you have it on yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and what is funny, Aunty, I had it on all night. I forgot to take\r\nit off when I went to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia looked perfectly bewildered; the more so, as Rosa, at that\r\ninstant, came into the room, with a basket of newly-ironed linen poised\r\non her head, and the coral ear-drops shaking in her ears!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell anything what to do with such a child!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, in despair. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world did you tell me you took those\r\nthings for, Topsy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Missis said I must \xe2\x80\x99fess; and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of nothin\xe2\x80\x99 else to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99fess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy, rubbing her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, of course, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to confess things you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss Ophelia; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s telling a lie, just as much as the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, now, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy, with an air of innocent wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, there an\xe2\x80\x99t any such thing as truth in that limb,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosa,\r\nlooking indignantly at Topsy. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I was Mas\xe2\x80\x99r St. Clare, I\xe2\x80\x99d whip her\r\ntill the blood run. I would,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d let her catch it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no Rosa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, with an air of command, which the child could\r\nassume at times; \xe2\x80\x9cyou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t talk so, Rosa. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa sakes! Miss Eva, you \xe2\x80\x99s so good, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know nothing how to get\r\nalong with niggers. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way but to cut \xe2\x80\x99em well up, I tell ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRosa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9chush! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you say another word of that sort!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe eye of the child flashed, and her cheek deepened its color.\r\n\r\nRosa was cowed in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Eva has got the St. Clare blood in her, that\xe2\x80\x99s plain. She can\r\nspeak, for all the world, just like her papa,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she passed\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\nEva stood looking at Topsy.\r\n\r\nThere stood the two children representatives of the two extremes of\r\nsociety. The fair, high-bred child, with her golden head, her deep\r\neyes, her spiritual, noble brow, and prince-like movements; and her\r\nblack, keen, subtle, cringing, yet acute neighbor. They stood the\r\nrepresentatives of their races. The Saxon, born of ages of cultivation,\r\ncommand, education, physical and moral eminence; the Afric, born of\r\nages of oppression, submission, ignorance, toil and vice!\r\n\r\nSomething, perhaps, of such thoughts struggled through Eva\xe2\x80\x99s mind. But\r\na child\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts are rather dim, undefined instincts; and in Eva\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnoble nature many such were yearning and working, for which she had no\r\npower of utterance. When Miss Ophelia expatiated on Topsy\xe2\x80\x99s naughty,\r\nwicked conduct, the child looked perplexed and sorrowful, but said,\r\nsweetly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Topsy, why need you steal? You\xe2\x80\x99re going to be taken good care of\r\nnow. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99d rather give you anything of mine, than have you steal\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the first word of kindness the child had ever heard in her life;\r\nand the sweet tone and manner struck strangely on the wild, rude heart,\r\nand a sparkle of something like a tear shone in the keen, round,\r\nglittering eye; but it was followed by the short laugh and habitual\r\ngrin. No! the ear that has never heard anything but abuse is strangely\r\nincredulous of anything so heavenly as kindness; and Topsy only thought\r\nEva\xe2\x80\x99s speech something funny and inexplicable,\xe2\x80\x94she did not believe it.\r\n\r\nBut what was to be done with Topsy? Miss Ophelia found the case a\r\npuzzler; her rules for bringing up didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to apply. She thought\r\nshe would take time to think of it; and, by the way of gaining time,\r\nand in hopes of some indefinite moral virtues supposed to be inherent\r\nin dark closets, Miss Ophelia shut Topsy up in one till she had\r\narranged her ideas further on the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia to St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9chow I\xe2\x80\x99m going to manage\r\nthat child, without whipping her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, whip her, then, to your heart\xe2\x80\x99s content; I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you full\r\npower to do what you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChildren always have to be whipped,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia; \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard\r\nof bringing them up without.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, well, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare; \xe2\x80\x9cdo as you think best. Only I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake one suggestion: I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this child whipped with a poker, knocked\r\ndown with the shovel or tongs, whichever came handiest, &c.; and,\r\nseeing that she is used to that style of operation, I think your\r\nwhippings will have to be pretty energetic, to make much impression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done with her, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have started a serious question,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nanswer it. What is to be done with a human being that can be governed\r\nonly by the lash,\xe2\x80\x94_that_ fails,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a very common state of things down\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I never saw such a child as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch children are very common among us, and such men and women, too.\r\nHow are they to be governed?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s more than I can say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr I either,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cThe horrid cruelties and outrages that\r\nonce and a while find their way into the papers,\xe2\x80\x94such cases as Prue\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nfor example,\xe2\x80\x94what do they come from? In many cases, it is a gradual\r\nhardening process on both sides,\xe2\x80\x94the owner growing more and more cruel,\r\nas the servant more and more callous. Whipping and abuse are like\r\nlaudanum; you have to double the dose as the sensibilities decline. I\r\nsaw this very early when I became an owner; and I resolved never to\r\nbegin, because I did not know when I should stop,\xe2\x80\x94and I resolved, at\r\nleast, to protect my own moral nature. The consequence is, that my\r\nservants act like spoiled children; but I think that better than for us\r\nboth to be brutalized together. You have talked a great deal about our\r\nresponsibilities in educating, Cousin. I really wanted you to _try_\r\nwith one child, who is a specimen of thousands among us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is your system makes such children,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it; but they are _made_,\xe2\x80\x94they exist,\xe2\x80\x94and what _is_ to be done\r\nwith them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I thank you for the experiment. But, then, as it\r\nappears to be a duty, I shall persevere and try, and do the best I\r\ncan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia; and Miss Ophelia, after this, did labor, with\r\na commendable degree of zeal and energy, on her new subject. She\r\ninstituted regular hours and employments for her, and undertook to\r\nteach her to read and sew.\r\n\r\nIn the former art, the child was quick enough. She learned her letters\r\nas if by magic, and was very soon able to read plain reading; but the\r\nsewing was a more difficult matter. The creature was as lithe as a cat,\r\nand as active as a monkey, and the confinement of sewing was her\r\nabomination; so she broke her needles, threw them slyly out of the\r\nwindow, or down in chinks of the walls; she tangled, broke, and dirtied\r\nher thread, or, with a sly movement, would throw a spool away\r\naltogether. Her motions were almost as quick as those of a practised\r\nconjurer, and her command of her face quite as great; and though Miss\r\nOphelia could not help feeling that so many accidents could not\r\npossibly happen in succession, yet she could not, without a\r\nwatchfulness which would leave her no time for anything else, detect\r\nher.\r\n\r\nTopsy was soon a noted character in the establishment. Her talent for\r\nevery species of drollery, grimace, and mimicry,\xe2\x80\x94for dancing, tumbling,\r\nclimbing, singing, whistling, imitating every sound that hit her\r\nfancy,\xe2\x80\x94seemed inexhaustible. In her play-hours, she invariably had\r\nevery child in the establishment at her heels, open-mouthed with\r\nadmiration and wonder,\xe2\x80\x94not excepting Miss Eva, who appeared to be\r\nfascinated by her wild diablerie, as a dove is sometimes charmed by a\r\nglittering serpent. Miss Ophelia was uneasy that Eva should fancy\r\nTopsy\xe2\x80\x99s society so much, and implored St. Clare to forbid it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoh! let the child alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cTopsy will do her good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut so depraved a child,\xe2\x80\x94are you not afraid she will teach her some\r\nmischief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t teach her mischief; she might teach it to some children, but\r\nevil rolls off Eva\xe2\x80\x99s mind like dew off a cabbage-leaf,\xe2\x80\x94not a drop sinks\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be too sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99d never let a child\r\nof mine play with Topsy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, your children needn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cbut mine may; if Eva\r\ncould have been spoiled, it would have been done years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTopsy was at first despised and contemned by the upper servants. They\r\nsoon found reason to alter their opinion. It was very soon discovered\r\nthat whoever cast an indignity on Topsy was sure to meet with some\r\ninconvenient accident shortly after;\xe2\x80\x94either a pair of ear-rings or some\r\ncherished trinket would be missing, or an article of dress would be\r\nsuddenly found utterly ruined, or the person would stumble accidently\r\ninto a pail of hot water, or a libation of dirty slop would\r\nunaccountably deluge them from above when in full gala dress;-and on\r\nall these occasions, when investigation was made, there was nobody\r\nfound to stand sponsor for the indignity. Topsy was cited, and had up\r\nbefore all the domestic judicatories, time and again; but always\r\nsustained her examinations with most edifying innocence and gravity of\r\nappearance. Nobody in the world ever doubted who did the things; but\r\nnot a scrap of any direct evidence could be found to establish the\r\nsuppositions, and Miss Ophelia was too just to feel at liberty to\r\nproceed to any length without it.\r\n\r\nThe mischiefs done were always so nicely timed, also, as further to\r\nshelter the aggressor. Thus, the times for revenge on Rosa and Jane,\r\nthe two chamber maids, were always chosen in those seasons when (as not\r\nunfrequently happened) they were in disgrace with their mistress, when\r\nany complaint from them would of course meet with no sympathy. In\r\nshort, Topsy soon made the household understand the propriety of\r\nletting her alone; and she was let alone, accordingly.\r\n\r\nTopsy was smart and energetic in all manual operations, learning\r\neverything that was taught her with surprising quickness. With a few\r\nlessons, she had learned to do the proprieties of Miss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber in a way with which even that particular lady could find no\r\nfault. Mortal hands could not lay spread smoother, adjust pillows more\r\naccurately, sweep and dust and arrange more perfectly, than Topsy, when\r\nshe chose,\xe2\x80\x94but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t very often choose. If Miss Ophelia, after\r\nthree or four days of careful patient supervision, was so sanguine as\r\nto suppose that Topsy had at last fallen into her way, could do without\r\nover-looking, and so go off and busy herself about something else,\r\nTopsy would hold a perfect carnival of confusion, for some one or two\r\nhours. Instead of making the bed, she would amuse herself with pulling\r\noff the pillowcases, butting her woolly head among the pillows, till it\r\nwould sometimes be grotesquely ornamented with feathers sticking out in\r\nvarious directions; she would climb the posts, and hang head downward\r\nfrom the tops; flourish the sheets and spreads all over the apartment;\r\ndress the bolster up in Miss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s night-clothes, and enact various\r\nperformances with that,\xe2\x80\x94singing and whistling, and making grimaces at\r\nherself in the looking-glass; in short, as Miss Ophelia phrased it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9craising Cain\xe2\x80\x9d generally.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, Miss Ophelia found Topsy with her very best scarlet\r\nIndia Canton crape shawl wound round her head for a turban, going on\r\nwith her rehearsals before the glass in great style,\xe2\x80\x94Miss Ophelia\r\nhaving, with carelessness most unheard-of in her, left the key for once\r\nin her drawer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTopsy!\xe2\x80\x9d she would say, when at the end of all patience, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does\r\nmake you act so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDunno, Missis,\xe2\x80\x94I spects cause I \xe2\x80\x99s so wicked!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything what I shall do with you, Topsy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw, Missis, you must whip me; my old Missis allers whipped me. I an\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nused to workin\xe2\x80\x99 unless I gets whipped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Topsy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to whip you. You can do well, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve a\r\nmind to; what is the reason you won\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, Missis, I \xe2\x80\x99s used to whippin\xe2\x80\x99; I spects it\xe2\x80\x99s good for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia tried the recipe, and Topsy invariably made a terrible\r\ncommotion, screaming, groaning and imploring, though half an hour\r\nafterwards, when roosted on some projection of the balcony, and\r\nsurrounded by a flock of admiring \xe2\x80\x9cyoung uns,\xe2\x80\x9d she would express the\r\nutmost contempt of the whole affair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw, Miss Feely whip!\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill a skeeter, her whippins. Oughter\r\nsee how old Mas\xe2\x80\x99r made the flesh fly; old Mas\xe2\x80\x99r know\xe2\x80\x99d how!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTopsy always made great capital of her own sins and enormities,\r\nevidently considering them as something peculiarly distinguishing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw, you niggers,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say to some of her auditors, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes you\r\nknow you \xe2\x80\x99s all sinners? Well, you is\xe2\x80\x94everybody is. White folks is\r\nsinners too,\xe2\x80\x94Miss Feely says so; but I spects niggers is the biggest\r\nones; but lor! ye an\xe2\x80\x99t any on ye up to me. I \xe2\x80\x99s so awful wicked there\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t nobody do nothin\xe2\x80\x99 with me. I used to keep old Missis a swarin\xe2\x80\x99 at\r\nme half de time. I spects I \xe2\x80\x99s the wickedest critter in the world;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nTopsy would cut a summerset, and come up brisk and shining on to a\r\nhigher perch, and evidently plume herself on the distinction.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia busied herself very earnestly on Sundays, teaching Topsy\r\nthe catechism. Topsy had an uncommon verbal memory, and committed with\r\na fluency that greatly encouraged her instructress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat good do you expect it is going to do her?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it always has done children good. It\xe2\x80\x99s what children always have\r\nto learn, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand it or not,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, children never understand it at the time; but, after they are grown\r\nup, it\xe2\x80\x99ll come to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come to me yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I\xe2\x80\x99ll bear\r\ntestimony that you put it into me pretty thoroughly when I was a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you were always good at learning, Augustine. I used to have great\r\nhopes of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you now?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you were as good as you were when you were a boy, Augustine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, Cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, go ahead and\r\ncatechize Topsy; may be you\xe2\x80\x99ll make out something yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTopsy, who had stood like a black statue during this discussion, with\r\nhands decently folded, now, at a signal from Miss Ophelia, went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur first parents, being left to the freedom of their own will, fell\r\nfrom the state wherein they were created.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTopsy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes twinkled, and she looked inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Topsy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Missis, was dat ar state Kintuck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat state, Topsy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat state dey fell out of. I used to hear Mas\xe2\x80\x99r tell how we came down\r\nfrom Kintuck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to give her a meaning, or she\xe2\x80\x99ll make one,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere seems to be a theory of emigration suggested there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! Augustine, be still,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia; \xe2\x80\x9chow can I do anything, if\r\nyou will be laughing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I won\xe2\x80\x99t disturb the exercises again, on my honor;\xe2\x80\x9d and St. Clare\r\ntook his paper into the parlor, and sat down, till Topsy had finished\r\nher recitations. They were all very well, only that now and then she\r\nwould oddly transpose some important words, and persist in the mistake,\r\nin spite of every effort to the contrary; and St. Clare, after all his\r\npromises of goodness, took a wicked pleasure in these mistakes, calling\r\nTopsy to him whenever he had a mind to amuse himself, and getting her\r\nto repeat the offending passages, in spite of Miss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nremonstrances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you think I can do anything with the child, if you will go on\r\nso, Augustine?\xe2\x80\x9d she would say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is too bad,\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t again; but I do like to hear the droll\r\nlittle image stumble over those big words!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you confirm her in the wrong way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the odds? One word is as good as another to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wanted me to bring her up right; and you ought to remember she is\r\na reasonable creature, and be careful of your influence over her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, dismal! so I ought; but, as Topsy herself says, \xe2\x80\x99I \xe2\x80\x99s so wicked!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn very much this way Topsy\xe2\x80\x99s training proceeded, for a year or\r\ntwo,\xe2\x80\x94Miss Ophelia worrying herself, from day to day, with her, as a\r\nkind of chronic plague, to whose inflictions she became, in time, as\r\naccustomed, as persons sometimes do to the neuralgia or sick headache.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare took the same kind of amusement in the child that a man might\r\nin the tricks of a parrot or a pointer. Topsy, whenever her sins\r\nbrought her into disgrace in other quarters, always took refuge behind\r\nhis chair; and St. Clare, in one way or other, would make peace for\r\nher. From him she got many a stray picayune, which she laid out in nuts\r\nand candies, and distributed, with careless generosity, to all the\r\nchildren in the family; for Topsy, to do her justice, was good-natured\r\nand liberal, and only spiteful in self-defence. She is fairly\r\nintroduced into our _corps de ballet_, and will figure, from time to\r\ntime, in her turn, with other performers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\nKentuck\r\n\r\n\r\nOur readers may not be unwilling to glance back, for a brief interval,\r\nat Uncle Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Cabin, on the Kentucky farm, and see what has been\r\ntranspiring among those whom he had left behind.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the summer afternoon, and the doors and windows of the\r\nlarge parlor all stood open, to invite any stray breeze, that might\r\nfeel in a good humor, to enter. Mr. Shelby sat in a large hall opening\r\ninto the room, and running through the whole length of the house, to a\r\nbalcony on either end. Leisurely tipped back on one chair, with his\r\nheels in another, he was enjoying his after-dinner cigar. Mrs. Shelby\r\nsat in the door, busy about some fine sewing; she seemed like one who\r\nhad something on her mind, which she was seeking an opportunity to\r\nintroduce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Chloe has had a letter from Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! has she? Tom \xe2\x80\x99s got some friend there, it seems. How is the old\r\nboy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been bought by a very fine family, I should think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nShelby,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis kindly treated, and has not much to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad of it,\xe2\x80\x94very glad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, heartily. \xe2\x80\x9cTom,\r\nI suppose, will get reconciled to a Southern residence;\xe2\x80\x94hardly want to\r\ncome up here again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary he inquires very anxiously,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nthe money for his redemption is to be raised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce get business running\r\nwrong, there does seem to be no end to it. It\xe2\x80\x99s like jumping from one\r\nbog to another, all through a swamp; borrow of one to pay another, and\r\nthen borrow of another to pay one,\xe2\x80\x94and these confounded notes falling\r\ndue before a man has time to smoke a cigar and turn round,\xe2\x80\x94dunning\r\nletters and dunning messages,\xe2\x80\x94all scamper and hurry-scurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does seem to me, my dear, that something might be done to\r\nstraighten matters. Suppose we sell off all the horses, and sell one of\r\nyour farms, and pay up square?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, ridiculous, Emily! You are the finest woman in Kentucky; but still\r\nyou haven\xe2\x80\x99t sense to know that you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand business;\xe2\x80\x94women\r\nnever do, and never can.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, \xe2\x80\x9ccould not you give me some little\r\ninsight into yours; a list of all your debts, at least, and of all that\r\nis owed to you, and let me try and see if I can\xe2\x80\x99t help you to\r\neconomize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, bother! don\xe2\x80\x99t plague me, Emily!\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell exactly. I know\r\nsomewhere about what things are likely to be; but there\xe2\x80\x99s no trimming\r\nand squaring my affairs, as Chloe trims crust off her pies. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow anything about business, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Shelby, not knowing any other way of enforcing his ideas,\r\nraised his voice,\xe2\x80\x94a mode of arguing very convenient and convincing,\r\nwhen a gentleman is discussing matters of business with his wife.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby ceased talking, with something of a sigh. The fact was,\r\nthat though her husband had stated she was a woman, she had a clear,\r\nenergetic, practical mind, and a force of character every way superior\r\nto that of her husband; so that it would not have been so very absurd a\r\nsupposition, to have allowed her capable of managing, as Mr. Shelby\r\nsupposed. Her heart was set on performing her promise to Tom and Aunt\r\nChloe, and she sighed as discouragements thickened around her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think we might in some way contrive to raise that money?\r\nPoor Aunt Chloe! her heart is so set on it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, if it is. I think I was premature in promising. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nsure, now, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to tell Chloe, and let her make up her\r\nmind to it. Tom\xe2\x80\x99ll have another wife, in a year or two; and she had\r\nbetter take up with somebody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Shelby, I have taught my people that their marriages are as sacred\r\nas ours. I never could think of giving Chloe such advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity, wife, that you have burdened them with a morality above\r\ntheir condition and prospects. I always thought so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only the morality of the Bible, Mr. Shelby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, Emily, I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to interfere with your religious\r\nnotions; only they seem extremely unfitted for people in that\r\ncondition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is why, from my soul, I\r\nhate the whole thing. I tell you, my dear, _I_ cannot absolve myself\r\nfrom the promises I make to these helpless creatures. If I can get the\r\nmoney no other way I will take music-scholars;\xe2\x80\x94I could get enough, I\r\nknow, and earn the money myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t degrade yourself that way, Emily? I never could consent\r\nto it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDegrade! would it degrade me as much as to break my faith with the\r\nhelpless? No, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are always heroic and transcendental,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Shelby, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nI think you had better think before you undertake such a piece of\r\nQuixotism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of Aunt Chloe,\r\nat the end of the verandah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, Missis,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Chloe, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said her mistress, rising, and going to the\r\nend of the balcony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Missis would come and look at dis yer lot o\xe2\x80\x99 poetry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChloe had a particular fancy for calling poultry poetry,\xe2\x80\x94an application\r\nof language in which she always persisted, notwithstanding frequent\r\ncorrections and advisings from the young members of the family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa sakes!\xe2\x80\x9d she would say, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see; one jis good as turry,\xe2\x80\x94poetry\r\nsuthin good, any how;\xe2\x80\x9d and so poetry Chloe continued to call it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby smiled as she saw a prostrate lot of chickens and ducks,\r\nover which Chloe stood, with a very grave face of consideration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a thinkin whether Missis would be a havin a chicken pie o\xe2\x80\x99 dese\r\nyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Aunt Chloe, I don\xe2\x80\x99t much care;\xe2\x80\x94serve them any way you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChloe stood handling them over abstractedly; it was quite evident that\r\nthe chickens were not what she was thinking of. At last, with the short\r\nlaugh with which her tribe often introduce a doubtful proposal, she\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws me, Missis! what should Mas\xe2\x80\x99r and Missis be a troublin\r\ntheirselves \xe2\x80\x99bout de money, and not a usin what\xe2\x80\x99s right in der hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand Chloe laughed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, Chloe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, nothing doubting,\r\nfrom her knowledge of Chloe\xe2\x80\x99s manner, that she had heard every word of\r\nthe conversation that had passed between her and her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, laws me, Missis!\xe2\x80\x9d said Chloe, laughing again, \xe2\x80\x9cother folks hires\r\nout der niggers and makes money on \xe2\x80\x99em!

Yes, you\r\nmay go; and your wages shall every cent of them be laid aside for your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s redemption.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs when a bright sunbeam turns a dark cloud to silver, so Chloe\xe2\x80\x99s dark\r\nface brightened immediately,\xe2\x80\x94it really shone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws! if Missis isn\xe2\x80\x99t too good!

I\r\nmust speak to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby went up stairs, and Aunt Chloe, delighted, went out to her\r\ncabin, to make her preparation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw sakes, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George! ye didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I \xe2\x80\x99s a gwine to Louisville\r\ntomorrow!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to George, as entering her cabin, he found her busy\r\nin sorting over her baby\xe2\x80\x99s clothes. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d jis look over sis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthings, and get \xe2\x80\x99em straightened up.

Though parted from all his soul held\r\ndear, and though often yearning for what lay beyond, still was he never\r\npositively and consciously miserable; for, so well is the harp of human\r\nfeeling strung, that nothing but a crash that breaks every string can\r\nwholly mar its harmony; and, on looking back to seasons which in review\r\nappear to us as those of deprivation and trial, we can remember that\r\neach hour, as it glided, brought its diversions and alleviations, so\r\nthat, though not happy wholly, we were not, either, wholly miserable.\r\n\r\nTom read, in his only literary cabinet, of one who had \xe2\x80\x9clearned in\r\nwhatsoever state he was, therewith to be content.\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed to him\r\ngood and reasonable doctrine, and accorded well with the settled and\r\nthoughtful habit which he had acquired from the reading of that same\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nHis letter homeward, as we related in the last chapter, was in due time\r\nanswered by Master George, in a good, round, school-boy hand, that Tom\r\nsaid might be read \xe2\x80\x9cmost acrost the room.\xe2\x80\x9d It contained various\r\nrefreshing items of home intelligence, with which our reader is fully\r\nacquainted: stated how Aunt Chloe had been hired out to a confectioner\r\nin Louisville, where her skill in the pastry line was gaining wonderful\r\nsums of money, all of which, Tom was informed, was to be laid up to go\r\nto make up the sum of his redemption money; Mose and Pete were\r\nthriving, and the baby was trotting all about the house, under the care\r\nof Sally and the family generally.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s cabin was shut up for the present; but George expatiated\r\nbrilliantly on ornaments and additions to be made to it when Tom came\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this letter gave a list of George\xe2\x80\x99s school studies, each\r\none headed by a flourishing capital; and also told the names of four\r\nnew colts that appeared on the premises since Tom left; and stated, in\r\nthe same connection, that father and mother were well. The style of the\r\nletter was decidedly concise and terse; but Tom thought it the most\r\nwonderful specimen of composition that had appeared in modern times. He\r\nwas never tired of looking at it, and even held a council with Eva on\r\nthe expediency of getting it framed, to hang up in his room. Nothing\r\nbut the difficulty of arranging it so that both sides of the page would\r\nshow at once stood in the way of this undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe friendship between Tom and Eva had grown with the child\xe2\x80\x99s growth.\r\nIt would be hard to say what place she held in the soft, impressible\r\nheart of her faithful attendant. He loved her as something frail and\r\nearthly, yet almost worshipped her as something heavenly and divine. He\r\ngazed on her as the Italian sailor gazes on his image of the child\r\nJesus,\xe2\x80\x94with a mixture of reverence and tenderness; and to humor her\r\ngraceful fancies, and meet those thousand simple wants which invest\r\nchildhood like a many-colored rainbow, was Tom\xe2\x80\x99s chief delight. In the\r\nmarket, at morning, his eyes were always on the flower-stalls for rare\r\nbouquets for her, and the choicest peach or orange was slipped into his\r\npocket to give to her when he came back; and the sight that pleased him\r\nmost was her sunny head looking out the gate for his distant approach,\r\nand her childish questions,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Uncle Tom, what have you got for me\r\ntoday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNor was Eva less zealous in kind offices, in return. Though a child,\r\nshe was a beautiful reader;\xe2\x80\x94a fine musical ear, a quick poetic fancy,\r\nand an instinctive sympathy with what\xe2\x80\x99s grand and noble, made her such\r\na reader of the Bible as Tom had never before heard. At first, she read\r\nto please her humble friend; but soon her own earnest nature threw out\r\nits tendrils, and wound itself around the majestic book; and Eva loved\r\nit, because it woke in her strange yearnings, and strong, dim emotions,\r\nsuch as impassioned, imaginative children love to feel.\r\n\r\nThe parts that pleased her most were the Revelations and the\r\nProphecies,\xe2\x80\x94parts whose dim and wondrous imagery, and fervent language,\r\nimpressed her the more, that she questioned vainly of their\r\nmeaning;\xe2\x80\x94and she and her simple friend, the old child and the young\r\none, felt just alike about it. All that they knew was, that they spoke\r\nof a glory to be revealed,\xe2\x80\x94a wondrous something yet to come, wherein\r\ntheir soul rejoiced, yet knew not why; and though it be not so in the\r\nphysical, yet in moral science that which cannot be understood is not\r\nalways profitless. For the soul awakes, a trembling stranger, between\r\ntwo dim eternities,\xe2\x80\x94the eternal past, the eternal future. The light\r\nshines only on a small space around her; therefore, she needs must\r\nyearn towards the unknown; and the voices and shadowy movings which\r\ncome to her from out the cloudy pillar of inspiration have each one\r\nechoes and answers in her own expecting nature. Its mystic imagery are\r\nso many talismans and gems inscribed with unknown hieroglyphics; she\r\nfolds them in her bosom, and expects to read them when she passes\r\nbeyond the veil.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LITTLE EVA READING THE BIBLE TO UNCLE TOM IN THE ARBOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time in our story, the whole St. Clare establishment is, for\r\nthe time being, removed to their villa on Lake Pontchartrain. The heats\r\nof summer had driven all who were able to leave the sultry and\r\nunhealthy city, to seek the shores of the lake, and its cool\r\nsea-breezes.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s villa was an East Indian cottage, surrounded by light\r\nverandahs of bamboo-work, and opening on all sides into gardens and\r\npleasure-grounds. The common sitting-room opened on to a large garden,\r\nfragrant with every picturesque plant and flower of the tropics, where\r\nwinding paths ran down to the very shores of the lake, whose silvery\r\nsheet of water lay there, rising and falling in the sunbeams,\xe2\x80\x94a picture\r\nnever for an hour the same, yet every hour more beautiful.\r\n\r\nIt is now one of those intensely golden sunsets which kindles the whole\r\nhorizon into one blaze of glory, and makes the water another sky. The\r\nlake lay in rosy or golden streaks, save where white-winged vessels\r\nglided hither and thither, like so many spirits, and little golden\r\nstars twinkled through the glow, and looked down at themselves as they\r\ntrembled in the water.\r\n\r\nTom and Eva were seated on a little mossy seat, in an arbor, at the\r\nfoot of the garden. It was Sunday evening, and Eva\xe2\x80\x99s Bible lay open on\r\nher knee. She read,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I saw a sea of glass, mingled with fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, suddenly stopping, and pointing to the lake, \xe2\x80\x9cthere \xe2\x80\x99t\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Miss Eva?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see,\xe2\x80\x94there?\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, pointing to the glassy water,\r\nwhich, as it rose and fell, reflected the golden glow of the sky.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x99sea of glass, mingled with fire.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue enough, Miss Eva,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; and Tom sang\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, had I the wings of the morning,\r\n    I\xe2\x80\x99d fly away to Canaan\xe2\x80\x99s shore;\r\nBright angels should convey me home,\r\n    To the new Jerusalem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you suppose new Jerusalem is, Uncle Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, up in the clouds, Miss Eva.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I think I see it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva. \xe2\x80\x9cLook in those clouds!\xe2\x80\x94they look\r\nlike great gates of pearl; and you can see beyond them\xe2\x80\x94far, far\r\noff\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all gold. Tom, sing about \xe2\x80\x99spirits bright.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom sung the words of a well-known Methodist hymn,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see a band of spirits bright,\r\n    That taste the glories there;\r\nThey all are robed in spotless white,\r\n    And conquering palms they bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Tom, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen _them_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\nTom had no doubt of it at all; it did not surprise him in the least. If\r\nEva had told him she had been to heaven, he would have thought it\r\nentirely probable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey come to me sometimes in my sleep, those spirits;\xe2\x80\x9d and Eva\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\ngrew dreamy, and she hummed, in a low voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all robed in spotless white,\r\n    And conquering palms they bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, Miss Eva?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child rose, and pointed her little hand to the sky; the glow of\r\nevening lit her golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly\r\nradiance, and her eyes were bent earnestly on the skies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going _there_,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto the spirits bright, Tom; _I\xe2\x80\x99m going,\r\nbefore long_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe faithful old heart felt a sudden thrust; and Tom thought how often\r\nhe had noticed, within six months, that Eva\xe2\x80\x99s little hands had grown\r\nthinner, and her skin more transparent, and her breath shorter; and\r\nhow, when she ran or played in the garden, as she once could for hours,\r\nshe became soon so tired and languid. He had heard Miss Ophelia speak\r\noften of a cough, that all her medicaments could not cure; and even now\r\nthat fervent cheek and little hand were burning with hectic fever; and\r\nyet the thought that Eva\xe2\x80\x99s words suggested had never come to him till\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nHas there ever been a child like Eva? Yes, there have been; but their\r\nnames are always on grave-stones, and their sweet smiles, their\r\nheavenly eyes, their singular words and ways, are among the buried\r\ntreasures of yearning hearts. In how many families do you hear the\r\nlegend that all the goodness and graces of the living are nothing to\r\nthe peculiar charms of one who _is not_. It is as if heaven had an\r\nespecial band of angels, whose office it was to sojourn for a season\r\nhere, and endear to them the wayward human heart, that they might bear\r\nit upward with them in their homeward flight. When you see that deep,\r\nspiritual light in the eye,\xe2\x80\x94when the little soul reveals itself in\r\nwords sweeter and wiser than the ordinary words of children,\xe2\x80\x94hope not\r\nto retain that child; for the seal of heaven is on it, and the light of\r\nimmortality looks out from its eyes.\r\n\r\nEven so, beloved Eva! fair star of thy dwelling! Thou art passing away;\r\nbut they that love thee dearest know it not.\r\n\r\nThe colloquy between Tom and Eva was interrupted by a hasty call from\r\nMiss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva\xe2\x80\x94Eva!\xe2\x80\x94why, child, the dew is falling; you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be out there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEva and Tom hastened in.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia was old, and skilled in the tactics of nursing. She was\r\nfrom New England, and knew well the first guileful footsteps of that\r\nsoft, insidious disease, which sweeps away so many of the fairest and\r\nloveliest, and, before one fibre of life seems broken, seals them\r\nirrevocably for death.\r\n\r\nShe had noted the slight, dry cough, the daily brightening cheek; nor\r\ncould the lustre of the eye, and the airy buoyancy born of fever,\r\ndeceive her.\r\n\r\nShe tried to communicate her fears to St. Clare; but he threw back her\r\nsuggestions with a restless petulance, unlike his usual careless\r\ngood-humor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be croaking, Cousin,\xe2\x80\x94I hate it!\xe2\x80\x9d he would say; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you see\r\nthat the child is only growing. Children always lose strength when they\r\ngrow fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she has that cough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! nonsense of that cough!\xe2\x80\x94it is not anything. She has taken a little\r\ncold, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that was just the way Eliza Jane was taken, and Ellen and Maria\r\nSanders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! stop these hobgoblin\xe2\x80\x99 nurse legends. You old hands got so wise,\r\nthat a child cannot cough, or sneeze, but you see desperation and ruin\r\nat hand. Only take care of the child, keep her from the night air, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t let her play too hard, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll do well enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo St. Clare said; but he grew nervous and restless. He watched Eva\r\nfeverishly day by day, as might be told by the frequency with which he\r\nrepeated over that \xe2\x80\x9cthe child was quite well\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanything in that cough,\xe2\x80\x94it was only some little stomach affection, such\r\nas children often had. But he kept by her more than before, took her\r\noftener to ride with him, brought home every few days some receipt or\r\nstrengthening mixture,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the child _needed_ it, but\r\nthen it would not do her any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf it must be told, the thing that struck a deeper pang to his heart\r\nthan anything else was the daily increasing maturity of the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind and feelings. While still retaining all a child\xe2\x80\x99s fanciful graces,\r\nyet she often dropped, unconsciously, words of such a reach of thought,\r\nand strange unworldly wisdom, that they seemed to be an inspiration. At\r\nsuch times, St. Clare would feel a sudden thrill, and clasp her in his\r\narms, as if that fond clasp could save her; and his heart rose up with\r\nwild determination to keep her, never to let her go.\r\n\r\nThe child\xe2\x80\x99s whole heart and soul seemed absorbed in works of love and\r\nkindness. Impulsively generous she had always been; but there was a\r\ntouching and womanly thoughtfulness about her now, that every one\r\nnoticed. She still loved to play with Topsy, and the various colored\r\nchildren; but she now seemed rather a spectator than an actor of their\r\nplays, and she would sit for half an hour at a time, laughing at the\r\nodd tricks of Topsy,\xe2\x80\x94and then a shadow would seem to pass across her\r\nface, her eyes grew misty, and her thoughts were afar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, suddenly, to her mother, one day, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy don\xe2\x80\x99t we\r\nteach our servants to read?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a question child! People never do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it is no use for them to read. It don\xe2\x80\x99t help them to work any\r\nbetter, and they are not made for anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they ought to read the Bible, mamma, to learn God\xe2\x80\x99s will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! they can get that read to them all _they_ need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me, mamma, the Bible is for every one to read themselves.\r\nThey need it a great many times when there is nobody to read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva, you are an odd child,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Ophelia has taught Topsy to read,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and you see how much good it does. Topsy is the worst creature I\r\never saw!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s poor Mammy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva. \xe2\x80\x9cShe does love the Bible so much, and\r\nwishes so she could read! And what will she do when I can\xe2\x80\x99t read to\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarie was busy, turning over the contents of a drawer, as she answered,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course, by and by, Eva, you will have other things to think\r\nof besides reading the Bible round to servants. Not but that is very\r\nproper; I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it myself, when I had health. But when you come to be\r\ndressing and going into company, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have time. See here!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cthese jewels I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you when you come out. I wore\r\nthem to my first ball. I can tell you, Eva, I made a sensation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEva took the jewel-case, and lifted from it a diamond necklace. Her\r\nlarge, thoughtful eyes rested on them, but it was plain her thoughts\r\nwere elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow sober you look child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre these worth a great deal of money, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, they are. Father sent to France for them. They are worth a\r\nsmall fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cto do what I pleased with!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you do with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d sell them, and buy a place in the free states, and take all our\r\npeople there, and hire teachers, to teach them to read and write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEva was cut short by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet up a boarding-school! Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you teach them to play on the\r\npiano, and paint on velvet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d teach them to read their own Bible, and write their own letters,\r\nand read letters that are written to them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, steadily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow, mamma, it does come very hard on them that they can\xe2\x80\x99t do these\r\nthings. Tom feels it\xe2\x80\x94Mammy does,\xe2\x80\x94a great many of them do. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Eva; you are only a child! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about\r\nthese things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cbesides, your talking makes my head ache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarie always had a headache on hand for any conversation that did not\r\nexactly suit her.\r\n\r\nEva stole away; but after that, she assiduously gave Mammy reading\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\nHenrique\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time, St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s brother Alfred, with his eldest son, a boy\r\nof twelve, spent a day or two with the family at the lake.\r\n\r\nNo sight could be more singular and beautiful than that of these twin\r\nbrothers. Nature, instead of instituting resemblances between them, had\r\nmade them opposites on every point; yet a mysterious tie seemed to\r\nunite them in a closer friendship than ordinary.\r\n\r\nThey used to saunter, arm in arm, up and down the alleys and walks of\r\nthe garden. Augustine, with his blue eyes and golden hair, his\r\nethereally flexible form and vivacious features; and Alfred, dark-eyed,\r\nwith haughty Roman profile, firmly-knit limbs, and decided bearing.\r\nThey were always abusing each other\xe2\x80\x99s opinions and practices, and yet\r\nnever a whit the less absorbed in each other\xe2\x80\x99s society; in fact, the\r\nvery contrariety seemed to unite them, like the attraction between\r\nopposite poles of the magnet.\r\n\r\nHenrique, the eldest son of Alfred, was a noble, dark-eyed, princely\r\nboy, full of vivacity and spirit; and, from the first moment of\r\nintroduction, seemed to be perfectly fascinated by the spirituelle\r\ngraces of his cousin Evangeline.\r\n\r\nEva had a little pet pony, of a snowy whiteness. It was easy as a\r\ncradle, and as gentle as its little mistress; and this pony was now\r\nbrought up to the back verandah by Tom, while a little mulatto boy of\r\nabout thirteen led along a small black Arabian, which had just been\r\nimported, at a great expense, for Henrique.\r\n\r\nHenrique had a boy\xe2\x80\x99s pride in his new possession; and, as he advanced\r\nand took the reins out of the hands of his little groom, he looked\r\ncarefully over him, and his brow darkened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this, Dodo, you little lazy dog! you haven\xe2\x80\x99t rubbed my horse\r\ndown, this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dodo, submissively; \xe2\x80\x9che got that dust on his own\r\nself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou rascal, shut your mouth!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henrique, violently raising his\r\nriding-whip. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy was a handsome, bright-eyed mulatto, of just Henrique\xe2\x80\x99s size,\r\nand his curling hair hung round a high, bold forehead. He had white\r\nblood in his veins, as could be seen by the quick flush in his cheek,\r\nand the sparkle of his eye, as he eagerly tried to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r Henrique!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\nHenrique struck him across the face with his riding-whip, and, seizing\r\none of his arms, forced him on to his knees, and beat him till he was\r\nout of breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you impudent dog! Now will you learn not to answer back when I\r\nspeak to you? Take the horse back, and clean him properly. I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach\r\nyou your place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cI specs what he was gwine to say was, that\r\nthe horse would roll when he was bringing him up from the stable; he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso full of spirits,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the way he got that dirt on him; I looked to\r\nhis cleaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hold your tongue till you\xe2\x80\x99re asked to speak!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henrique,\r\nturning on his heel, and walking up the steps to speak to Eva, who\r\nstood in her riding-dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Cousin, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry this stupid fellow has kept you waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s sit down here, on this seat till they come. What\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter, Cousin?\xe2\x80\x94you look sober.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you be so cruel and wicked to poor Dodo?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCruel,\xe2\x80\x94wicked!\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, with unaffected surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nmean, dear Eva?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to call me dear Eva, when you do so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Cousin, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know Dodo; it\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to manage him,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s so full of lies and excuses. The only way is to put him down at\r\nonce,\xe2\x80\x94not let him open his mouth; that\xe2\x80\x99s the way papa manages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Uncle Tom said it was an accident, and he never tells what isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an uncommon old nigger, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henrique. \xe2\x80\x9cDodo will lie as\r\nfast as he can speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou frighten him into deceiving, if you treat him so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Eva, you\xe2\x80\x99ve really taken such a fancy to Dodo, that I shall be\r\njealous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you beat him,\xe2\x80\x94and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, well, it may go for some time when he does, and don\xe2\x80\x99t get it. A few\r\ncuts never come amiss with Dodo,\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a regular spirit, I can tell you;\r\nbut I won\xe2\x80\x99t beat him again before you, if it troubles you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEva was not satisfied, but found it in vain to try to make her handsome\r\ncousin understand her feelings.\r\n\r\nDodo soon appeared, with the horses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Dodo, you\xe2\x80\x99ve done pretty well, this time,\xe2\x80\x9d said his young\r\nmaster, with a more gracious air. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, and hold Miss Eva\xe2\x80\x99s horse\r\nwhile I put her on to the saddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDodo came and stood by Eva\xe2\x80\x99s pony. His face was troubled; his eyes\r\nlooked as if he had been crying.\r\n\r\nHenrique, who valued himself on his gentlemanly adroitness in all\r\nmatters of gallantry, soon had his fair cousin in the saddle, and,\r\ngathering the reins, placed them in her hands.\r\n\r\nBut Eva bent to the other side of the horse, where Dodo was standing,\r\nand said, as he relinquished the reins,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good boy, Dodo;\xe2\x80\x94thank\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDodo looked up in amazement into the sweet young face; the blood rushed\r\nto his cheeks, and the tears to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Dodo,\xe2\x80\x9d said his master, imperiously.\r\n\r\nDodo sprang and held the horse, while his master mounted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a picayune for you to buy candy with, Dodo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henrique;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgo get some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Henrique cantered down the walk after Eva. Dodo stood looking after\r\nthe two children. One had given him money; and one had given him what\r\nhe wanted far more,\xe2\x80\x94a kind word, kindly spoken. Dodo had been only a\r\nfew months away from his mother. His master had bought him at a slave\r\nwarehouse, for his handsome face, to be a match to the handsome pony;\r\nand he was now getting his breaking in, at the hands of his young\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the beating had been witnessed by the two brothers St.\r\nClare, from another part of the garden.\r\n\r\nAugustine\xe2\x80\x99s cheek flushed; but he only observed, with his usual\r\nsarcastic carelessness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s what we may call republican education, Alfred?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenrique is a devil of a fellow, when his blood\xe2\x80\x99s up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred,\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you consider this an instructive practice for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAugustine, drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Henrique is a regular little\r\ntempest;\xe2\x80\x94his mother and I have given him up, long ago. But, then, that\r\nDodo is a perfect sprite,\xe2\x80\x94no amount of whipping can hurt him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this by way of teaching Henrique the first verse of a republican\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncatechism, \xe2\x80\x99All men are born free and equal!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred; \xe2\x80\x9cone of Tom Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s pieces of French sentiment\r\nand humbug. It\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly ridiculous to have that going the rounds\r\namong us, to this day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, significantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can see plainly enough that all men are\r\n_not_ born free, nor born equal; they are born anything else. For my\r\npart, I think half this republican talk sheer humbug. It is the\r\neducated, the intelligent, the wealthy, the refined, who ought to have\r\nequal rights and not the canaille.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can keep the canaille of that opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Augustine. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\ntook _their_ turn once, in France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, they must be _kept down_, consistently, steadily, as I\r\n_should_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred, setting his foot hard down as if he were\r\nstanding on somebody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes a terrible slip when they get up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Augustine,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin St.\r\nDomingo, for instance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of that, in this country. We must\r\nset our face against all this educating, elevating talk, that is\r\ngetting about now; the lower class must not be educated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is past praying for,\xe2\x80\x9d said Augustine; \xe2\x80\x9ceducated they will be, and\r\nwe have only to say how. Our system is educating them in barbarism and\r\nbrutality. We are breaking all humanizing ties, and making them brute\r\nbeasts; and, if they get the upper hand, such we shall find them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey shall never get the upper hand!\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare; \xe2\x80\x9cput on the steam, fasten down the\r\nescape-valve, and sit on it, and see where you\xe2\x80\x99ll land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred, \xe2\x80\x9cwe _will_ see. I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid to sit on the\r\nescape-valve, as long as the boilers are strong, and the machinery\r\nworks well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nobles in Louis XVI.\xe2\x80\x98s time thought just so; and Austria and Pius\r\nIX. think so now; and, some pleasant morning, you may all be caught up\r\nto meet each other in the air, _when the boilers burst_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Dies declarabit_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Augustine, \xe2\x80\x9cif there is anything that is revealed\r\nwith the strength of a divine law in our times, it is that the masses\r\nare to rise, and the under class become the upper one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one of your red republican humbugs, Augustine! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\never take to the stump;\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d make a famous stump orator! Well, I hope\r\nI shall be dead before this millennium of your greasy masses comes on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreasy or not greasy, they will govern _you_, when their time comes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Augustine; \xe2\x80\x9cand they will be just such rulers as you make them.\r\nThe French noblesse chose to have the people \xe2\x80\x99_sans culottes_,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nthey had \xe2\x80\x99_sans culotte_\xe2\x80\x99 governors to their hearts\xe2\x80\x99 content. The\r\npeople of Hayti\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, come, Augustine! as if we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had enough of that abominable,\r\ncontemptible Hayti![1] The Haytiens were not Anglo Saxons; if they had\r\nbeen there would have been another story. The Anglo Saxon is the\r\ndominant race of the world, and _is to be so_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1] In August 1791, as a consequence of the French Revolution, the\r\n black slaves and mulattoes on Haiti rose in revolt against the whites,\r\n and in the period of turmoil that followed enormous cruelties were\r\n practised by both sides. The \xe2\x80\x9cEmperor\xe2\x80\x9d Dessalines, come to power in\r\n 1804, massacred all the whites on the island. Haitian bloodshed became\r\n an argument to show the barbarous nature of the Negro, a doctrine\r\n Wendell Phillips sought to combat in his celebrated lecture on\r\n Toussaint L\xe2\x80\x99Ouverture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there is a pretty fair infusion of Anglo Saxon blood among our\r\nslaves, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Augustine. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are plenty among them who have\r\nonly enough of the African to give a sort of tropical warmth and fervor\r\nto our calculating firmness and foresight. If ever the San Domingo hour\r\ncomes, Anglo Saxon blood will lead on the day. Sons of white fathers,\r\nwith all our haughty feelings burning in their veins, will not always\r\nbe bought and sold and traded. They will rise, and raise with them\r\ntheir mother\xe2\x80\x99s race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff!\xe2\x80\x94nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Augustine, \xe2\x80\x9cthere goes an old saying to this effect, \xe2\x80\x99As\r\nit was in the days of Noah so shall it be;\xe2\x80\x94they ate, they drank, they\r\nplanted, they builded, and knew not till the flood came and took\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the whole, Augustine, I think your talents might do for a circuit\r\nrider,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cNever you fear for us; possession is\r\nour nine points. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the power. This subject race,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nstamping firmly, \xe2\x80\x9cis down and shall _stay_ down! We have energy enough\r\nto manage our own powder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSons trained like your Henrique will be grand guardians of your\r\npowder-magazines,\xe2\x80\x9d said Augustine,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cso cool and self-possessed! The\r\nproverb says, \xe2\x80\x99They that cannot govern themselves cannot govern\r\nothers.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a trouble there\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred, thoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt\r\nthat our system is a difficult one to train children under. It gives\r\ntoo free scope to the passions, altogether, which, in our climate, are\r\nhot enough. I find trouble with Henrique. The boy is generous and\r\nwarm-hearted, but a perfect fire-cracker when excited. I believe I\r\nshall send him North for his education, where obedience is more\r\nfashionable, and where he will associate more with equals, and less\r\nwith dependents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince training children is the staple work of the human race,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAugustine, \xe2\x80\x9cI should think it something of a consideration that our\r\nsystem does not work well there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not for some things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred; \xe2\x80\x9cfor others, again, it\r\ndoes. It makes boys manly and courageous; and the very vices of an\r\nabject race tend to strengthen in them the opposite virtues. I think\r\nHenrique, now, has a keener sense of the beauty of truth, from seeing\r\nlying and deception the universal badge of slavery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Christian-like view of the subject, certainly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Augustine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true, Christian-like or not; and is about as Christian-like as\r\nmost other things in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s no use in talking, Augustine. I believe we\xe2\x80\x99ve been round\r\nand round this old track five hundred times, more or less. What do you\r\nsay to a game of backgammon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two brothers ran up the verandah steps, and were soon seated at a\r\nlight bamboo stand, with the backgammon-board between them. As they\r\nwere setting their men, Alfred said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, Augustine, if I thought as you do, I should do something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you would,\xe2\x80\x94you are one of the doing sort,\xe2\x80\x94but what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, elevate your own servants, for a specimen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred, with a\r\nhalf-scornful smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might as well set Mount \xc3\x86tna on them flat, and tell them to stand\r\nup under it, as tell me to elevate my servants under all the\r\nsuperincumbent mass of society upon them. One man can do nothing,\r\nagainst the whole action of a community. Education, to do anything,\r\nmust be a state education; or there must be enough agreed in it to make\r\na current.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take the first throw,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred; and the brothers were soon\r\nlost in the game, and heard no more till the scraping of horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet\r\nwas heard under the verandah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere come the children,\xe2\x80\x9d said Augustine, rising. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Alf! Did\r\nyou ever see anything so beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d And, in truth, it _was_ a\r\nbeautiful sight. Henrique, with his bold brow, and dark, glossy curls,\r\nand glowing cheek, was laughing gayly as he bent towards his fair\r\ncousin, as they came on. She was dressed in a blue riding dress, with a\r\ncap of the same color. Exercise had given a brilliant hue to her\r\ncheeks, and heightened the effect of her singularly transparent skin,\r\nand golden hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! what perfectly dazzling beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Alfred. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell\r\nyou, Auguste, won\xe2\x80\x99t she make some hearts ache, one of these days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will, too truly,\xe2\x80\x94God knows I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid so!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, in a\r\ntone of sudden bitterness, as he hurried down to take her off her\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva darling! you\xe2\x80\x99re not much tired?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he clasped her in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child; but her short, hard breathing alarmed her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you ride so fast, dear?\xe2\x80\x94you know it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt so well, papa, and liked it so much, I forgot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare carried her in his arms into the parlor, and laid her on the\r\nsofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenrique, you must be careful of Eva,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cyou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t ride fast\r\nwith her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take her under my care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henrique, seating himself by the\r\nsofa, and taking Eva\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nEva soon found herself much better. Her father and uncle resumed their\r\ngame, and the children were left together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Eva, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry papa is only going to stay two days here,\r\nand then I shan\xe2\x80\x99t see you again for ever so long! If I stay with you,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d try to be good, and not be cross to Dodo, and so on. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nto treat Dodo ill; but, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got such a quick temper. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nreally bad to him, though. I give him a picayune, now and then; and you\r\nsee he dresses well. I think, on the whole, Dodo \xe2\x80\x99s pretty well off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you think you were well off, if there were not one creature in\r\nthe world near you to love you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x94Well, of course not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have taken Dodo away from all the friends he ever had, and now\r\nhe has not a creature to love him;\xe2\x80\x94nobody can be good that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, as I know of. I can\xe2\x80\x99t get his mother and I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t love him myself, nor anybody else, as I know of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Love_ Dodo! Why, Eva, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have me! I may _like_ him well\r\nenough; but you don\xe2\x80\x99t _love_ your servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow odd!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t the Bible say we must love everybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, the Bible! To be sure, it says a great many such things; but, then,\r\nnobody ever thinks of doing them,\xe2\x80\x94you know, Eva, nobody does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEva did not speak; her eyes were fixed and thoughtful for a few\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cdear Cousin, do love poor Dodo, and be kind\r\nto him, for my sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could love anything, for your sake, dear Cousin; for I really think\r\nyou are the loveliest creature that I ever saw!\xe2\x80\x9d And Henrique spoke\r\nwith an earnestness that flushed his handsome face. Eva received it\r\nwith perfect simplicity, without even a change of feature; merely\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you feel so, dear Henrique! I hope you will\r\nremember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dinner-bell put an end to the interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\nForeshadowings\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days after this, Alfred St. Clare and Augustine parted; and Eva,\r\nwho had been stimulated, by the society of her young cousin, to\r\nexertions beyond her strength, began to fail rapidly. St. Clare was at\r\nlast willing to call in medical advice,\xe2\x80\x94a thing from which he had\r\nalways shrunk, because it was the admission of an unwelcome truth.\r\n\r\nBut, for a day or two, Eva was so unwell as to be confined to the\r\nhouse; and the doctor was called.\r\n\r\nMarie St. Clare had taken no notice of the child\xe2\x80\x99s gradually decaying\r\nhealth and strength, because she was completely absorbed in studying\r\nout two or three new forms of disease to which she believed she herself\r\nwas a victim. It was the first principle of Marie\xe2\x80\x99s belief that nobody\r\never was or could be so great a sufferer as _herself_; and, therefore,\r\nshe always repelled quite indignantly any suggestion that any one\r\naround her could be sick. She was always sure, in such a case, that it\r\nwas nothing but laziness, or want of energy; and that, if they had had\r\nthe suffering _she_ had, they would soon know the difference.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia had several times tried to awaken her maternal fears about\r\nEva; but to no avail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see as anything ails the child,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say; \xe2\x80\x9cshe runs\r\nabout, and plays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she has a cough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCough! you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to tell _me_ about a cough. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been\r\nsubject to a cough, all my days. When I was of Eva\xe2\x80\x99s age, they thought\r\nI was in a consumption. Night after night, Mammy used to sit up with\r\nme. O! Eva\xe2\x80\x99s cough is not anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she gets weak, and is short-breathed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw! I\xe2\x80\x99ve had that, years and years; it\xe2\x80\x99s only a nervous affection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she sweats so, nights!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have, these ten years. Very often, night after night, my\r\nclothes will be wringing wet. There won\xe2\x80\x99t be a dry thread in my\r\nnight-clothes and the sheets will be so that Mammy has to hang them up\r\nto dry! Eva doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sweat anything like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia shut her mouth for a season. But, now that Eva was fairly\r\nand visibly prostrated, and a doctor called, Marie, all on a sudden,\r\ntook a new turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe knew it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cshe always felt it, that she was destined to\r\nbe the most miserable of mothers. Here she was, with her wretched\r\nhealth, and her only darling child going down to the grave before her\r\neyes;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Marie routed up Mammy nights, and rumpussed and scolded,\r\nwith more energy than ever, all day, on the strength of this new\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Marie, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk so!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought not to give\r\nup the case so, at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not a mother\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, St. Clare! You never could\r\nunderstand me!\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t talk so, as if it were a gone case!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t take it as indifferently as you can, St. Clare. If _you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfeel when your only child is in this alarming state, I do. It\xe2\x80\x99s a blow\r\ntoo much for me, with all I was bearing before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Eva is very delicate, _that_ I\r\nalways knew; and that she has grown so rapidly as to exhaust her\r\nstrength; and that her situation is critical. But just now she is only\r\nprostrated by the heat of the weather, and by the excitement of her\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s visit, and the exertions she made. The physician says there is\r\nroom for hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course, if you can look on the bright side, pray do; it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmercy if people haven\xe2\x80\x99t sensitive feelings, in this world. I am sure I\r\nwish I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel as I do; it only makes me completely wretched! I\r\nwish I _could_ be as easy as the rest of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the \xe2\x80\x9crest of them\xe2\x80\x9d had good reason to breathe the same prayer, for\r\nMarie paraded her new misery as the reason and apology for all sorts of\r\ninflictions on every one about her. Every word that was spoken by\r\nanybody, everything that was done or was not done everywhere, was only\r\na new proof that she was surrounded by hard-hearted, insensible beings,\r\nwho were unmindful of her peculiar sorrows. Poor Eva heard some of\r\nthese speeches; and nearly cried her little eyes out, in pity for her\r\nmamma, and in sorrow that she should make her so much distress.\r\n\r\nIn a week or two, there was a great improvement of symptoms,\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nthose deceitful lulls, by which her inexorable disease so often\r\nbeguiles the anxious heart, even on the verge of the grave. Eva\xe2\x80\x99s step\r\nwas again in the garden,\xe2\x80\x94in the balconies; she played and laughed\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x94and her father, in a transport, declared that they should soon\r\nhave her as hearty as anybody. Miss Ophelia and the physician alone\r\nfelt no encouragement from this illusive truce. There was one other\r\nheart, too, that felt the same certainty, and that was the little heart\r\nof Eva. What is it that sometimes speaks in the soul so calmly, so\r\nclearly, that its earthly time is short? Is it the secret instinct of\r\ndecaying nature, or the soul\xe2\x80\x99s impulsive throb, as immortality draws\r\non? Be it what it may, it rested in the heart of Eva, a calm, sweet,\r\nprophetic certainty that Heaven was near; calm as the light of sunset,\r\nsweet as the bright stillness of autumn, there her little heart\r\nreposed, only troubled by sorrow for those who loved her so dearly.\r\n\r\nFor the child, though nursed so tenderly, and though life was unfolding\r\nbefore her with every brightness that love and wealth could give, had\r\nno regret for herself in dying.\r\n\r\nIn that book which she and her simple old friend had read so much\r\ntogether, she had seen and taken to her young heart the image of one\r\nwho loved the little child; and, as she gazed and mused, He had ceased\r\nto be an image and a picture of the distant past, and come to be a\r\nliving, all-surrounding reality. His love enfolded her childish heart\r\nwith more than mortal tenderness; and it was to Him, she said, she was\r\ngoing, and to his home.\r\n\r\nBut her heart yearned with sad tenderness for all that she was to leave\r\nbehind. Her father most,\xe2\x80\x94for Eva, though she never distinctly thought\r\nso, had an instinctive perception that she was more in his heart than\r\nany other. She loved her mother because she was so loving a creature,\r\nand all the selfishness that she had seen in her only saddened and\r\nperplexed her; for she had a child\xe2\x80\x99s implicit trust that her mother\r\ncould not do wrong. There was something about her that Eva never could\r\nmake out; and she always smoothed it over with thinking that, after\r\nall, it was mamma, and she loved her very dearly indeed.\r\n\r\nShe felt, too, for those fond, faithful servants, to whom she was as\r\ndaylight and sunshine. Children do not usually generalize; but Eva was\r\nan uncommonly mature child, and the things that she had witnessed of\r\nthe evils of the system under which they were living had fallen, one by\r\none, into the depths of her thoughtful, pondering heart. She had vague\r\nlongings to do something for them,\xe2\x80\x94to bless and save not only them, but\r\nall in their condition,\xe2\x80\x94longings that contrasted sadly with the\r\nfeebleness of her little frame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, one day, when she was reading to her friend, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan understand why Jesus _wanted_ to die for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Miss Eva?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt so, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it Miss Eva?\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you; but, when I saw those poor creatures on the boat,\r\nyou know, when you came up and I,\xe2\x80\x94some had lost their mothers, and some\r\ntheir husbands, and some mothers cried for their little children\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhen I heard about poor Prue,\xe2\x80\x94oh, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that dreadful!\xe2\x80\x94and a great\r\nmany other times, I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt that I would be glad to die, if my dying\r\ncould stop all this misery. _I would_ die for them, Tom, if I could,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the child, earnestly, laying her little thin hand on his.\r\n\r\nTom looked at the child with awe; and when she, hearing her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice, glided away, he wiped his eyes many times, as he looked after\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s jest no use tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to keep Miss Eva here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mammy, whom\r\nhe met a moment after. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s mark in her forehead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mammy, raising her hands; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve allers said so.\r\nShe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t never like a child that\xe2\x80\x99s to live\xe2\x80\x94there was allers something\r\ndeep in her eyes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve told Missis so, many the time; it\xe2\x80\x99s a comin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntrue,\xe2\x80\x94we all sees it,\xe2\x80\x94dear, little, blessed lamb!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEva came tripping up the verandah steps to her father. It was late in\r\nthe afternoon, and the rays of the sun formed a kind of glory behind\r\nher, as she came forward in her white dress, with her golden hair and\r\nglowing cheeks, her eyes unnaturally bright with the slow fever that\r\nburned in her veins.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare had called her to show a statuette that he had been buying\r\nfor her; but her appearance, as she came on, impressed him suddenly and\r\npainfully. There is a kind of beauty so intense, yet so fragile, that\r\nwe cannot bear to look at it. Her father folded her suddenly in his\r\narms, and almost forgot what he was going to tell her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva, dear, you are better now-a-days,\xe2\x80\x94are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, with sudden firmness \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had things I wanted to say\r\nto you, a great while. I want to say them now, before I get weaker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare trembled as Eva seated herself in his lap. She laid her head\r\non his bosom, and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all no use, papa, to keep it to myself any longer. The time is\r\ncoming that I am going to leave you. I am going, and never to come\r\nback!\xe2\x80\x9d and Eva sobbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, now, my dear little Eva!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, trembling as he spoke,\r\nbut speaking cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got nervous and low-spirited; you\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t indulge such gloomy thoughts. See here, I\xe2\x80\x99ve bought a statuette\r\nfor you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, putting it gently away, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t deceive\r\nyourself!\xe2\x80\x94I am _not_ any better, I know it perfectly well,\xe2\x80\x94and I am\r\ngoing, before long. I am not nervous,\xe2\x80\x94I am not low-spirited. If it were\r\nnot for you, papa, and my friends, I should be perfectly happy. I want\r\nto go,\xe2\x80\x94I long to go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, dear child, what has made your poor little heart so sad? You have\r\nhad everything, to make you happy, that could be given you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had rather be in heaven; though, only for my friends\xe2\x80\x99 sake, I would\r\nbe willing to live. There are a great many things here that make me\r\nsad, that seem dreadful to me; I had rather be there; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto leave you,\xe2\x80\x94it almost breaks my heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you sad, and seems dreadful, Eva?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, things that are done, and done all the time. I feel sad for our\r\npoor people; they love me dearly, and they are all good and kind to me.\r\nI wish, papa, they were all _free_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Eva, child, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think they are well enough off now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, but, papa, if anything should happen to you, what would become of\r\nthem? There are very few men like you, papa. Uncle Alfred isn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nyou, and mamma isn\xe2\x80\x99t; and then, think of poor old Prue\xe2\x80\x99s owners! What\r\nhorrid things people do, and can do!\xe2\x80\x9d and Eva shuddered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, you are too sensitive. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I ever let you hear\r\nsuch stories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, that\xe2\x80\x99s what troubles me, papa. You want me to live so happy, and\r\nnever to have any pain,\xe2\x80\x94never suffer anything,\xe2\x80\x94not even hear a sad\r\nstory, when other poor creatures have nothing but pain and sorrow, all\r\ntheir lives;\xe2\x80\x94it seems selfish. I ought to know such things, I ought to\r\nfeel about them! Such things always sunk into my heart; they went down\r\ndeep; I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought and thought about them. Papa, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there any way to\r\nhave all slaves made free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult question, dearest. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that this way\r\nis a very bad one; a great many people think so; I do myself; I heartily\r\nwish that there were not a slave in the land; but, then, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat is to be done about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, you are such a good man, and so noble, and kind, and you always\r\nhave a way of saying things that is so pleasant, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you go all\r\nround and try to persuade people to do right about this? When I am\r\ndead, papa, then you will think of me, and do it for my sake. I would\r\ndo it, if I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are dead, Eva,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cO, child,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me so! You are all I have on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor old Prue\xe2\x80\x99s child was all that she had,\xe2\x80\x94and yet she had to hear it\r\ncrying, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it! Papa, these poor creatures love their\r\nchildren as much as you do me. O! do something for them! There\xe2\x80\x99s poor\r\nMammy loves her children; I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her cry when she talked about them.\r\nAnd Tom loves his children; and it\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful, papa, that such things\r\nare happening, all the time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, soothingly; \xe2\x80\x9conly don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndistress yourself, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of dying, and I will do anything you\r\nwish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd promise me, dear father, that Tom shall have his freedom as soon\r\nas\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she stopped, and said, in a hesitating tone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear, I will do anything in the world,\xe2\x80\x94anything you could ask me\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, laying her burning cheek against his, \xe2\x80\x9chow\r\nI wish we could go together!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, dearest?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo our Saviour\xe2\x80\x99s home; it\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet and peaceful there\xe2\x80\x94it is all so\r\nloving there!\xe2\x80\x9d The child spoke unconsciously, as of a place where she\r\nhad often been. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to go, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare drew her closer to him, but was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will come to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, speaking in a voice of calm\r\ncertainty which she often used unconsciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall come after you. I shall not forget you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shadows of the solemn evening closed round them deeper and deeper,\r\nas St. Clare sat silently holding the little frail form to his bosom.\r\nHe saw no more the deep eyes, but the voice came over him as a spirit\r\nvoice, and, as in a sort of judgment vision, his whole past life rose\r\nin a moment before his eyes: his mother\xe2\x80\x99s prayers and hymns; his own\r\nearly yearnings and aspirings for good; and, between them and this\r\nhour, years of worldliness and scepticism, and what man calls\r\nrespectable living. We can think _much_, very much, in a moment. St.\r\nClare saw and felt many things, but spoke nothing; and, as it grew\r\ndarker, he took his child to her bed-room; and, when she was prepared\r\nfor rest; he sent away the attendants, and rocked her in his arms, and\r\nsung to her till she was asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\nThe Little Evangelist\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday afternoon. St. Clare was stretched on a bamboo lounge in\r\nthe verandah, solacing himself with a cigar. Marie lay reclined on a\r\nsofa, opposite the window opening on the verandah, closely secluded,\r\nunder an awning of transparent gauze, from the outrages of the\r\nmosquitos, and languidly holding in her hand an elegantly bound\r\nprayer-book. She was holding it because it was Sunday, and she imagined\r\nshe had been reading it,\xe2\x80\x94though, in fact, she had been only taking a\r\nsuccession of short naps, with it open in her hand.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia, who, after some rummaging, had hunted up a small\r\nMethodist meeting within riding distance, had gone out, with Tom as\r\ndriver, to attend it; and Eva had accompanied them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Augustine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie after dozing a while, \xe2\x80\x9cI must send to\r\nthe city after my old Doctor Posey; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the complaint of\r\nthe heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; why need you send for him? This doctor that attends Eva seems\r\nskilful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not trust him in a critical case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cand I think I\r\nmay say mine is becoming so! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking of it, these two or\r\nthree nights past; I have such distressing pains, and such strange\r\nfeelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Marie, you are blue; I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s heart complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say _you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cI was prepared to expect _that_.\r\nYou can be alarmed enough, if Eva coughs, or has the least thing the\r\nmatter with her; but you never think of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly agreeable to you to have heart disease, why, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntry and maintain you have it,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare; \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I only hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t be sorry for this, when it\xe2\x80\x99s too late!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, believe it or not, my distress about Eva, and the\r\nexertions I have made with that dear child, have developed what I have\r\nlong suspected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat the _exertions_ were which Marie referred to, it would have been\r\ndifficult to state. St. Clare quietly made this commentary to himself,\r\nand went on smoking, like a hard-hearted wretch of a man as he was,\r\ntill a carriage drove up before the verandah, and Eva and Miss Ophelia\r\nalighted.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia marched straight to her own chamber, to put away her\r\nbonnet and shawl, as was always her manner, before she spoke a word on\r\nany subject; while Eva came, at St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s call, and was sitting on\r\nhis knee, giving him an account of the services they had heard.\r\n\r\nThey soon heard loud exclamations from Miss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s room, which, like\r\nthe one in which they were sitting, opened on to the verandah and\r\nviolent reproof addressed to somebody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat new witchcraft has Tops been brewing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\ncommotion is of her raising, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, in a moment after, Miss Ophelia, in high indignation, came\r\ndragging the culprit along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome out here, now!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI _will_ tell your master!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the case now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Augustine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe case is, that I cannot be plagued with this child, any longer!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s past all bearing; flesh and blood cannot endure it! Here, I locked\r\nher up, and gave her a hymn to study; and what does she do, but spy out\r\nwhere I put my key, and has gone to my bureau, and got a\r\nbonnet-trimming, and cut it all to pieces to make dolls\xe2\x80\x99 jackets! I\r\nnever saw anything like it, in my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you, Cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99d find out that these\r\ncreatures can\xe2\x80\x99t be brought up without severity. If I had _my_ way,\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking reproachfully at St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d send that\r\nchild out, and have her thoroughly whipped; I\xe2\x80\x99d have her whipped till\r\nshe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt it,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me of the lovely rule of\r\nwoman! I never saw above a dozen women that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t half kill a horse,\r\nor a servant, either, if they had their own way with them!\xe2\x80\x94let alone a\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no use in this shilly-shally way of yours, St. Clare!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarie. \xe2\x80\x9cCousin is a woman of sense, and she sees it now, as plain as I\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia had just the capability of indignation that belongs to the\r\nthorough-paced housekeeper, and this had been pretty actively roused by\r\nthe artifice and wastefulness of the child; in fact, many of my lady\r\nreaders must own that they should have felt just so in her\r\ncircumstances; but Marie\xe2\x80\x99s words went beyond her, and she felt less\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the child treated so, for the world,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut,\r\nI am sure, Augustine, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. I\xe2\x80\x99ve taught and taught;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve talked till I\xe2\x80\x99m tired; I\xe2\x80\x99ve whipped her; I\xe2\x80\x99ve punished her in\r\nevery way I can think of, and she\xe2\x80\x99s just what she was at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Tops, you monkey!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, calling the child up to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTopsy came up; her round, hard eyes glittering and blinking with a\r\nmixture of apprehensiveness and their usual odd drollery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you behave so?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, who could not help being\r\namused with the child\xe2\x80\x99s expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpects it\xe2\x80\x99s my wicked heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy, demurely; \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Feely says\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see how much Miss Ophelia has done for you? She says she has\r\ndone everything she can think of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, yes, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r! old Missis used to say so, too. She whipped me a heap\r\nharder, and used to pull my har, and knock my head agin the door; but\r\nit didn\xe2\x80\x99t do me no good! I spects, if they \xe2\x80\x99s to pull every spire o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhar out o\xe2\x80\x99 my head, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do no good, neither,\xe2\x80\x94I \xe2\x80\x99s so wicked!\r\nLaws! I \xe2\x80\x99s nothin but a nigger, no ways!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shall have to give her up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nthat trouble any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99d just like to ask one question,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if your Gospel is not strong enough to save one heathen child,\r\nthat you can have at home here, all to yourself, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of\r\nsending one or two poor missionaries off with it among thousands of\r\njust such? I suppose this child is about a fair sample of what\r\nthousands of your heathen are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia did not make an immediate answer; and Eva, who had stood a\r\nsilent spectator of the scene thus far, made a silent sign to Topsy to\r\nfollow her. There was a little glass-room at the corner of the\r\nverandah, which St. Clare used as a sort of reading-room; and Eva and\r\nTopsy disappeared into this place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s Eva going about, now?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare; \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, advancing on tiptoe, he lifted up a curtain that covered the\r\nglass-door, and looked in. In a moment, laying his finger on his lips,\r\nhe made a silent gesture to Miss Ophelia to come and look. There sat\r\nthe two children on the floor, with their side faces towards them.\r\nTopsy, with her usual air of careless drollery and unconcern; but,\r\nopposite to her, Eva, her whole face fervent with feeling, and tears in\r\nher large eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does make you so bad, Topsy? Why won\xe2\x80\x99t you try and be good? Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou love _anybody_, Topsy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonno nothing \xe2\x80\x99bout love; I loves candy and sich, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTopsy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you love your father and mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever had none, ye know. I telled ye that, Miss Eva.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, sadly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you any brother, or sister,\r\nor aunt, or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, none on \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x94never had nothing nor nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Topsy, if you\xe2\x80\x99d only try to be good, you might\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t never be nothin\xe2\x80\x99 but a nigger, if I was ever so good,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTopsy. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could be skinned, and come white, I\xe2\x80\x99d try then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut people can love you, if you are black, Topsy. Miss Ophelia would\r\nlove you, if you were good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTopsy gave the short, blunt laugh that was her common mode of\r\nexpressing incredulity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she can\xe2\x80\x99t bar me, \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99m a nigger!\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99s soon have a toad\r\ntouch her! There can\xe2\x80\x99t nobody love niggers, and niggers can\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99! _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy, beginning to whistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Topsy, poor child, _I_ love you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, with a sudden burst of\r\nfeeling, and laying her little thin, white hand on Topsy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nlove you, because you haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any father, or mother, or\r\nfriends;\xe2\x80\x94because you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a poor, abused child! I love you, and I\r\nwant you to be good. I am very unwell, Topsy, and I think I shan\xe2\x80\x99t live\r\na great while; and it really grieves me, to have you be so naughty. I\r\nwish you would try to be good, for my sake;\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little while I\r\nshall be with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe round, keen eyes of the black child were overcast with\r\ntears;\xe2\x80\x94large, bright drops rolled heavily down, one by one, and fell on\r\nthe little white hand. Yes, in that moment, a ray of real belief, a ray\r\nof heavenly love, had penetrated the darkness of her heathen soul! She\r\nlaid her head down between her knees, and wept and sobbed,\xe2\x80\x94while the\r\nbeautiful child, bending over her, looked like the picture of some\r\nbright angel stooping to reclaim a sinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Topsy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you know that Jesus loves all alike? He\r\nis just as willing to love you, as me. He loves you just as I do,\xe2\x80\x94only\r\nmore, because he is better. He will help you to be good; and you can go\r\nto Heaven at last, and be an angel forever, just as much as if you were\r\nwhite. Only think of it, Topsy!\xe2\x80\x94_you_ can be one of those spirits\r\nbright, Uncle Tom sings about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, dear Miss Eva, dear Miss Eva!\xe2\x80\x9d said the child; \xe2\x80\x9cI will try, I will\r\ntry; I never did care nothin\xe2\x80\x99 about it before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare, at this instant, dropped the curtain. \xe2\x80\x9cIt puts me in mind of\r\nmother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Miss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true what she told me; if we\r\nwant to give sight to the blind, we must be willing to do as Christ\r\ndid,\xe2\x80\x94call them to us, and _put our hands on them_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always had a prejudice against negroes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, I never could bear to have that child touch me; but, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think she knew it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust any child to find that out,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no keeping\r\nit from them. But I believe that all the trying in the world to benefit\r\na child, and all the substantial favors you can do them, will never\r\nexcite one emotion of gratitude, while that feeling of repugnance\r\nremains in the heart;\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a queer kind of a fact,\xe2\x80\x94but so it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I can help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia; \xe2\x80\x9cthey _are_\r\ndisagreeable to me,\xe2\x80\x94this child in particular,\xe2\x80\x94how can I help feeling\r\nso?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva does, it seems.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s so loving! After all, though, she\xe2\x80\x99s no more than\r\nChrist-like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I were like her. She might\r\nteach me a lesson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time a little child had been used to instruct\r\nan old disciple, if it _were_ so,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\nDeath\r\n\r\n\r\nWeep not for those whom the veil of the tomb,\r\nIn life\xe2\x80\x99s early morning, hath hid from our eyes.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] \xe2\x80\x9cWeep Not for Those,\xe2\x80\x9d a poem by Thomas Moore (1779-1852).\r\n\r\n\r\nEva\xe2\x80\x99s bed-room was a spacious apartment, which, like all the other\r\nrooms in the house, opened on to the broad verandah. The room\r\ncommunicated, on one side, with her father and mother\xe2\x80\x99s apartment; on\r\nthe other, with that appropriated to Miss Ophelia. St. Clare had\r\ngratified his own eye and taste, in furnishing this room in a style\r\nthat had a peculiar keeping with the character of her for whom it was\r\nintended. The windows were hung with curtains of rose-colored and white\r\nmuslin, the floor was spread with a matting which had been ordered in\r\nParis, to a pattern of his own device, having round it a border of\r\nrose-buds and leaves, and a centre-piece with full-flown roses. The\r\nbedstead, chairs, and lounges, were of bamboo, wrought in peculiarly\r\ngraceful and fanciful patterns. Over the head of the bed was an\r\nalabaster bracket, on which a beautiful sculptured angel stood, with\r\ndrooping wings, holding out a crown of myrtle-leaves. From this\r\ndepended, over the bed, light curtains of rose-colored gauze, striped\r\nwith silver, supplying that protection from mosquitos which is an\r\nindispensable addition to all sleeping accommodation in that climate.\r\nThe graceful bamboo lounges were amply supplied with cushions of\r\nrose-colored damask, while over them, depending from the hands of\r\nsculptured figures, were gauze curtains similar to those of the bed. A\r\nlight, fanciful bamboo table stood in the middle of the room, where a\r\nParian vase, wrought in the shape of a white lily, with its buds,\r\nstood, ever filled with flowers. On this table lay Eva\xe2\x80\x99s books and\r\nlittle trinkets, with an elegantly wrought alabaster writing-stand,\r\nwhich her father had supplied to her when he saw her trying to improve\r\nherself in writing. There was a fireplace in the room, and on the\r\nmarble mantle above stood a beautifully wrought statuette of Jesus\r\nreceiving little children, and on either side marble vases, for which\r\nit was Tom\xe2\x80\x99s pride and delight to offer bouquets every morning. Two or\r\nthree exquisite paintings of children, in various attitudes,\r\nembellished the wall. In short, the eye could turn nowhere without\r\nmeeting images of childhood, of beauty, and of peace. Those little eyes\r\nnever opened, in the morning light, without falling on something which\r\nsuggested to the heart soothing and beautiful thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe deceitful strength which had buoyed Eva up for a little while was\r\nfast passing away; seldom and more seldom her light footstep was heard\r\nin the verandah, and oftener and oftener she was found reclined on a\r\nlittle lounge by the open window, her large, deep eyes fixed on the\r\nrising and falling waters of the lake.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the middle of the afternoon, as she was so\r\nreclining,\xe2\x80\x94her Bible half open, her little transparent fingers lying\r\nlistlessly between the leaves,\xe2\x80\x94suddenly she heard her mother\xe2\x80\x99s voice,\r\nin sharp tones, in the verandah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now, you baggage!\xe2\x80\x94what new piece of mischief! You\xe2\x80\x99ve been picking\r\nthe flowers, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d and Eva heard the sound of a smart slap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw, Missis! they \xe2\x80\x99s for Miss Eva,\xe2\x80\x9d she heard a voice say, which she\r\nknew belonged to Topsy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Eva! A pretty excuse!\xe2\x80\x94you suppose she wants _your_ flowers, you\r\ngood-for-nothing nigger! Get along off with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a moment, Eva was off from her lounge, and in the verandah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, don\xe2\x80\x99t, mother! I should like the flowers; do give them to me; I\r\nwant them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Eva, your room is full now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t have too many,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva. \xe2\x80\x9cTopsy, do bring them here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTopsy, who had stood sullenly, holding down her head, now came up and\r\noffered her flowers. She did it with a look of hesitation and\r\nbashfulness, quite unlike the eldrich boldness and brightness which was\r\nusual with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful bouquet!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, looking at it.\r\n\r\nIt was rather a singular one,\xe2\x80\x94a brilliant scarlet geranium, and one\r\nsingle white japonica, with its glossy leaves. It was tied up with an\r\nevident eye to the contrast of color, and the arrangement of every leaf\r\nhad carefully been studied.\r\n\r\nTopsy looked pleased, as Eva said,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTopsy, you arrange flowers very\r\nprettily. Here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cis this vase I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any flowers for. I\r\nwish you\xe2\x80\x99d arrange something every day for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s odd!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world do you want that\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, mamma; you\xe2\x80\x99d as lief as not Topsy should do it,\xe2\x80\x94had you\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, anything you please, dear! Topsy, you hear your young\r\nmistress;\xe2\x80\x94see that you mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTopsy made a short courtesy, and looked down; and, as she turned away,\r\nEva saw a tear roll down her dark cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, mamma, I knew poor Topsy wanted to do something for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEva to her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, nonsense! it\xe2\x80\x99s only because she likes to do mischief. She knows she\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t pick flowers,\xe2\x80\x94so she does it; that\xe2\x80\x99s all there is to it. But,\r\nif you fancy to have her pluck them, so be it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, I think Topsy is different from what she used to be; she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrying to be a good girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to try a good while before _she_ gets to be good,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarie, with a careless laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, mamma, poor Topsy! everything has always been against\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot since she\xe2\x80\x99s been here, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. If she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been talked to, and\r\npreached to, and every earthly thing done that anybody could do;\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s just so ugly, and always will be; you can\xe2\x80\x99t make anything of the\r\ncreature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, mamma, it\xe2\x80\x99s so different to be brought up as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been, with so\r\nmany friends, so many things to make me good and happy; and to be\r\nbrought up as she\xe2\x80\x99s been, all the time, till she came here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, yawning,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdear me, how hot it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, you believe, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, that Topsy could become an angel, as\r\nwell as any of us, if she were a Christian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTopsy! what a ridiculous idea! Nobody but you would ever think of it.\r\nI suppose she could, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, mamma, isn\xe2\x80\x99t God her father, as much as ours? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Jesus her\r\nSaviour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that may be. I suppose God made everybody,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\nis my smelling-bottle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s such a pity,\xe2\x80\x94oh! _such_ a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, looking out on the\r\ndistant lake, and speaking half to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a pity?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that any one, who could be a bright angel, and live with angels,\r\nshould go all down, down down, and nobody help them!\xe2\x80\x94oh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we can\xe2\x80\x99t help it; it\xe2\x80\x99s no use worrying, Eva! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto be done; we ought to be thankful for our own advantages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly can be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry to think of poor folks that\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s odd enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure my religion makes me\r\nthankful for my advantages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to have some of my hair cut off,\xe2\x80\x94a good deal\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, I want to give some away to my friends, while I am able to give\r\nit to them myself. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you ask aunty to come and cut it for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarie raised her voice, and called Miss Ophelia, from the other room.\r\n\r\nThe child half rose from her pillow as she came in, and, shaking down\r\nher long golden-brown curls, said, rather playfully, \xe2\x80\x9cCome aunty, shear\r\nthe sheep!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, who just then entered with some fruit he\r\nhad been out to get for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, I just want aunty to cut off some of my hair;\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s too much\r\nof it, and it makes my head hot. Besides, I want to give some of it\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia came, with her scissors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care,\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t spoil the looks of it!\xe2\x80\x9d said her father; \xe2\x80\x9ccut\r\nunderneath, where it won\xe2\x80\x99t show. Eva\xe2\x80\x99s curls are my pride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, papa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I want them kept handsome against the time I take you up to\r\nyour uncle\xe2\x80\x99s plantation, to see Cousin Henrique,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, in a\r\ngay tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never go there, papa;\xe2\x80\x94I am going to a better country. O, do\r\nbelieve me! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, papa, that I get weaker, every day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you insist that I shall believe such a cruel thing, Eva?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nher father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly because it is _true_, papa: and, if you will believe it now,\r\nperhaps you will get to feel about it as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare closed his lips, and stood gloomily eying the long, beautiful\r\ncurls, which, as they were separated from the child\xe2\x80\x99s head, were laid,\r\none by one, in her lap. She raised them up, looked earnestly at them,\r\ntwined them around her thin fingers, and looked from time to time,\r\nanxiously at her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been foreboding!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s just what has\r\nbeen preying on my health, from day to day, bringing me downward to the\r\ngrave, though nobody regards it. I have seen this, long. St. Clare, you\r\nwill see, after a while, that I was right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich will afford you great consolation, no doubt!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, in\r\na dry, bitter tone.\r\n\r\nMarie lay back on a lounge, and covered her face with her cambric\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\nEva\xe2\x80\x99s clear blue eye looked earnestly from one to the other. It was the\r\ncalm, comprehending gaze of a soul half loosed from its earthly bonds;\r\nit was evident she saw, felt, and appreciated, the difference between\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\nShe beckoned with her hand to her father. He came and sat down by her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, my strength fades away every day, and I know I must go. There\r\nare some things I want to say and do,\xe2\x80\x94that I ought to do; and you are\r\nso unwilling to have me speak a word on this subject. But it must come;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no putting it off. Do be willing I should speak now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child, I _am_ willing!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, covering his eyes with one\r\nhand, and holding up Eva\xe2\x80\x99s hand with the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, I want to see all our people together. I have some things I\r\n_must_ say to them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Well_,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, in a tone of dry endurance.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia despatched a messenger, and soon the whole of the servants\r\nwere convened in the room.\r\n\r\nEva lay back on her pillows; her hair hanging loosely about her face,\r\nher crimson cheeks contrasting painfully with the intense whiteness of\r\nher complexion and the thin contour of her limbs and features, and her\r\nlarge, soul-like eyes fixed earnestly on every one.\r\n\r\nThe servants were struck with a sudden emotion. The spiritual face, the\r\nlong locks of hair cut off and lying by her, her father\xe2\x80\x99s averted face,\r\nand Marie\xe2\x80\x99s sobs, struck at once upon the feelings of a sensitive and\r\nimpressible race; and, as they came in, they looked one on another,\r\nsighed, and shook their heads. There was a deep silence, like that of a\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nEva raised herself, and looked long and earnestly round at every one.\r\nAll looked sad and apprehensive. Many of the women hid their faces in\r\ntheir aprons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sent for you all, my dear friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I love you. I\r\nlove you all; and I have something to say to you, which I want you\r\nalways to remember. . . . I am going to leave you. In a few more weeks\r\nyou will see me no more\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the child was interrupted by bursts of groans, sobs, and\r\nlamentations, which broke from all present, and in which her slender\r\nvoice was lost entirely. She waited a moment, and then, speaking in a\r\ntone that checked the sobs of all, she said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you love me, you must not interrupt me so. Listen to what I say. I\r\nwant to speak to you about your souls. . . . Many of you, I am afraid,\r\nare very careless. You are thinking only about this world. I want you\r\nto remember that there is a beautiful world, where Jesus is. I am going\r\nthere, and you can go there. It is for you, as much as me. But, if you\r\nwant to go there, you must not live idle, careless, thoughtless lives.\r\nYou must be Christians. You must remember that each one of you can\r\nbecome angels, and be angels forever. . . . If you want to be\r\nChristians, Jesus will help you. You must pray to him; you must read\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child checked herself, looked piteously at them, and said,\r\nsorrowfully,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO dear! you _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ read\xe2\x80\x94poor souls!\xe2\x80\x9d and she hid her face in the\r\npillow and sobbed, while many a smothered sob from those she was\r\naddressing, who were kneeling on the floor, aroused her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, raising her face and smiling brightly through\r\nher tears, \xe2\x80\x9cI have prayed for you; and I know Jesus will help you, even\r\nif you can\xe2\x80\x99t read. Try all to do the best you can; pray every day; ask\r\nHim to help you, and get the Bible read to you whenever you can; and I\r\nthink I shall see you all in heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen,\xe2\x80\x9d was the murmured response from the lips of Tom and Mammy, and\r\nsome of the elder ones, who belonged to the Methodist church. The\r\nyounger and more thoughtless ones, for the time completely overcome,\r\nwere sobbing, with their heads bowed upon their knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cyou all love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; oh, yes! indeed we do! Lord bless her!\xe2\x80\x9d was the involuntary\r\nanswer of all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know you do! There isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of you that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always been\r\nvery kind to me; and I want to give you something that, when you look\r\nat, you shall always remember me, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give all of you a curl\r\nof my hair; and, when you look at it, think that I loved you and am\r\ngone to heaven, and that I want to see you all there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the scene, as, with tears and sobs, they\r\ngathered round the little creature, and took from her hands what seemed\r\nto them a last mark of her love. They fell on their knees; they sobbed,\r\nand prayed, and kissed the hem of her garment; and the elder ones\r\npoured forth words of endearment, mingled in prayers and blessings,\r\nafter the manner of their susceptible race.\r\n\r\nAs each one took their gift, Miss Ophelia, who was apprehensive for the\r\neffect of all this excitement on her little patient, signed to each one\r\nto pass out of the apartment.\r\n\r\nAt last, all were gone but Tom and Mammy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Uncle Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cis a beautiful one for you. O, I am so\r\nhappy, Uncle Tom, to think I shall see you in heaven,\xe2\x80\x94for I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\r\nshall; and Mammy,\xe2\x80\x94dear, good, kind Mammy!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, fondly throwing\r\nher arms round her old nurse,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI know you\xe2\x80\x99ll be there, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Miss Eva, don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I can live without ye, no how!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nfaithful creature. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Pears like it\xe2\x80\x99s just taking everything off the\r\nplace to oncet!\xe2\x80\x9d and Mammy gave way to a passion of grief.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia pushed her and Tom gently from the apartment, and thought\r\nthey were all gone; but, as she turned, Topsy was standing there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you start up from?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy, wiping the tears from her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cO, Miss Eva,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a bad girl; but won\xe2\x80\x99t you give _me_ one, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, poor Topsy! to be sure, I will. There\xe2\x80\x94every time you look at\r\nthat, think that I love you, and wanted you to be a good girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Miss Eva, I _is_ tryin!\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy, earnestly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, Lor, it\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nhard to be good! \xe2\x80\x99Pears like I an\xe2\x80\x99t used to it, no ways!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJesus knows it, Topsy; he is sorry for you; he will help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTopsy, with her eyes hid in her apron, was silently passed from the\r\napartment by Miss Ophelia; but, as she went, she hid the precious curl\r\nin her bosom.\r\n\r\nAll being gone, Miss Ophelia shut the door. That worthy lady had wiped\r\naway many tears of her own, during the scene; but concern for the\r\nconsequence of such an excitement to her young charge was uppermost in\r\nher mind.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare had been sitting, during the whole time, with his hand\r\nshading his eyes, in the same attitude.\r\n\r\nWhen they were all gone, he sat so still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, gently, laying her hand on his.\r\n\r\nHe gave a sudden start and shiver; but made no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear papa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I cannot_,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cI _cannot_ have it so! The\r\nAlmighty hath dealt _very bitterly_ with me!\xe2\x80\x9d and St. Clare pronounced\r\nthese words with a bitter emphasis, indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugustine! has not God a right to do what he will with his own?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so; but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it any easier to bear,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nwith a dry, hard, tearless manner, as he turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, you break my heart!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, rising and throwing herself into\r\nhis arms; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not feel so!\xe2\x80\x9d and the child sobbed and wept with a\r\nviolence which alarmed them all, and turned her father\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts at\r\nonce to another channel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, Eva,\xe2\x80\x94there, dearest! Hush! hush! I was wrong; I was wicked. I\r\nwill feel any way, do any way,\xe2\x80\x94only don\xe2\x80\x99t distress yourself; don\xe2\x80\x99t sob\r\nso. I will be resigned; I was wicked to speak as I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEva soon lay like a wearied dove in her father\xe2\x80\x99s arms; and he, bending\r\nover her, soothed her by every tender word he could think of.\r\n\r\nMarie rose and threw herself out of the apartment into her own, when\r\nshe fell into violent hysterics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t give me a curl, Eva,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, smiling sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all yours, papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, smiling\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyours and mamma\xe2\x80\x99s; and\r\nyou must give dear aunty as many as she wants. I only gave them to our\r\npoor people myself, because you know, papa, they might be forgotten\r\nwhen I am gone, and because I hoped it might help them remember. . . .\r\nYou are a Christian, are you not, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You are so good, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you can help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is being a Christian, Eva?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoving Christ most of all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, Eva?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never saw him,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat makes no difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe him, and in a few days\r\nI shall _see_ him;\xe2\x80\x9d and the young face grew fervent, radiant with joy.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare said no more. It was a feeling which he had seen before in\r\nhis mother; but no chord within vibrated to it.\r\n\r\nEva, after this, declined rapidly; there was no more any doubt of the\r\nevent; the fondest hope could not be blinded. Her beautiful room was\r\navowedly a sick room; and Miss Ophelia day and night performed the\r\nduties of a nurse,\xe2\x80\x94and never did her friends appreciate her value more\r\nthan in that capacity. With so well-trained a hand and eye, such\r\nperfect adroitness and practice in every art which could promote\r\nneatness and comfort, and keep out of sight every disagreeable incident\r\nof sickness,\xe2\x80\x94with such a perfect sense of time, such a clear,\r\nuntroubled head, such exact accuracy in remembering every prescription\r\nand direction of the doctors,\xe2\x80\x94she was everything to him. They who had\r\nshrugged their shoulders at her little peculiarities and setnesses, so\r\nunlike the careless freedom of southern manners, acknowledged that now\r\nshe was the exact person that was wanted.\r\n\r\nUncle Tom was much in Eva\xe2\x80\x99s room. The child suffered much from nervous\r\nrestlessness, and it was a relief to her to be carried; and it was\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s greatest delight to carry her little frail form in his arms,\r\nresting on a pillow, now up and down her room, now out into the\r\nverandah; and when the fresh sea-breezes blew from the lake,\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nchild felt freshest in the morning,\xe2\x80\x94he would sometimes walk with her\r\nunder the orange-trees in the garden, or, sitting down in some of their\r\nold seats, sing to her their favorite old hymns.\r\n\r\nHer father often did the same thing; but his frame was slighter, and\r\nwhen he was weary, Eva would say to him,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, papa, let Tom take me. Poor fellow! it pleases him; and you know\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all he can do now, and he wants to do something!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I, Eva!\xe2\x80\x9d said her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, papa, you can do everything, and are everything to me. You read\r\nto me,\xe2\x80\x94you sit up nights,\xe2\x80\x94and Tom has only this one thing, and his\r\nsinging; and I know, too, he does it easier than you can. He carries me\r\nso strong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe desire to do something was not confined to Tom. Every servant in\r\nthe establishment showed the same feeling, and in their way did what\r\nthey could.\r\n\r\nPoor Mammy\xe2\x80\x99s heart yearned towards her darling; but she found no\r\nopportunity, night or day, as Marie declared that the state of her mind\r\nwas such, it was impossible for her to rest; and, of course, it was\r\nagainst her principles to let any one else rest. Twenty times in a\r\nnight, Mammy would be roused to rub her feet, to bathe her head, to\r\nfind her pocket-handkerchief, to see what the noise was in Eva\xe2\x80\x99s room,\r\nto let down a curtain because it was too light, or to put it up because\r\nit was too dark; and, in the daytime, when she longed to have some\r\nshare in the nursing of her pet, Marie seemed unusually ingenious in\r\nkeeping her busy anywhere and everywhere all over the house, or about\r\nher own person; so that stolen interviews and momentary glimpses were\r\nall she could obtain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel it my duty to be particularly careful of myself, now,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwould say, \xe2\x80\x9cfeeble as I am, and with the whole care and nursing of that\r\ndear child upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought our cousin relieved you\r\nof that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk like a man, St. Clare,\xe2\x80\x94just as if a mother _could_ be\r\nrelieved of the care of a child in that state; but, then, it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nalike,\xe2\x80\x94no one ever knows what I feel! I can\xe2\x80\x99t throw things off, as you\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare smiled. You must excuse him, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x94for St.\r\nClare could smile yet. For so bright and placid was the farewell voyage\r\nof the little spirit,\xe2\x80\x94by such sweet and fragrant breezes was the small\r\nbark borne towards the heavenly shores,\xe2\x80\x94that it was impossible to\r\nrealize that it was death that was approaching. The child felt no\r\npain,\xe2\x80\x94only a tranquil, soft weakness, daily and almost insensibly\r\nincreasing; and she was so beautiful, so loving, so trustful, so happy,\r\nthat one could not resist the soothing influence of that air of\r\ninnocence and peace which seemed to breathe around her. St. Clare found\r\na strange calm coming over him. It was not hope,\xe2\x80\x94that was impossible;\r\nit was not resignation; it was only a calm resting in the present,\r\nwhich seemed so beautiful that he wished to think of no future. It was\r\nlike that hush of spirit which we feel amid the bright, mild woods of\r\nautumn, when the bright hectic flush is on the trees, and the last\r\nlingering flowers by the brook; and we joy in it all the more, because\r\nwe know that soon it will all pass away.\r\n\r\nThe friend who knew most of Eva\xe2\x80\x99s own imaginings and foreshadowings was\r\nher faithful bearer, Tom. To him she said what she would not disturb\r\nher father by saying. To him she imparted those mysterious intimations\r\nwhich the soul feels, as the cords begin to unbind, ere it leaves its\r\nclay forever.\r\n\r\nTom, at last, would not sleep in his room, but lay all night in the\r\nouter verandah, ready to rouse at every call.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Tom, what alive have you taken to sleeping anywhere and\r\neverywhere, like a dog, for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you was one\r\nof the orderly sort, that liked to lie in bed in a Christian way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, Miss Feely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, mysteriously. \xe2\x80\x9cI do, but now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t speak loud; Mas\xe2\x80\x99r St. Clare won\xe2\x80\x99t hear on \xe2\x80\x99t; but Miss\r\nFeely, you know there must be somebody watchin\xe2\x80\x99 for the bridegroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know it says in Scripture, \xe2\x80\x98At midnight there was a great cry\r\nmade. Behold, the bridegroom cometh.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m spectin now,\r\nevery night, Miss Feely,\xe2\x80\x94and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep out o\xe2\x80\x99 hearin, no ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Uncle Tom, what makes you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Eva, she talks to me. The Lord, he sends his messenger in the\r\nsoul. I must be thar, Miss Feely; for when that ar blessed child goes\r\ninto the kingdom, they\xe2\x80\x99ll open the door so wide, we\xe2\x80\x99ll all get a look\r\nin at the glory, Miss Feely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Tom, did Miss Eva say she felt more unwell than usual tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but she telled me, this morning, she was coming nearer,\xe2\x80\x94thar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthem that tells it to the child, Miss Feely. It\xe2\x80\x99s the angels,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ntrumpet sound afore the break o\xe2\x80\x99 day,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, quoting from a\r\nfavorite hymn.\r\n\r\nThis dialogue passed between Miss Ophelia and Tom, between ten and\r\neleven, one evening, after her arrangements had all been made for the\r\nnight, when, on going to bolt her outer door, she found Tom stretched\r\nalong by it, in the outer verandah.\r\n\r\nShe was not nervous or impressible; but the solemn, heart-felt manner\r\nstruck her. Eva had been unusually bright and cheerful, that afternoon,\r\nand had sat raised in her bed, and looked over all her little trinkets\r\nand precious things, and designated the friends to whom she would have\r\nthem given; and her manner was more animated, and her voice more\r\nnatural, than they had known it for weeks. Her father had been in, in\r\nthe evening, and had said that Eva appeared more like her former self\r\nthan ever she had done since her sickness; and when he kissed her for\r\nthe night, he said to Miss Ophelia,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCousin, we may keep her with us,\r\nafter all; she is certainly better;\xe2\x80\x9d and he had retired with a lighter\r\nheart in his bosom than he had had there for weeks.\r\n\r\nBut at midnight,\xe2\x80\x94strange, mystic hour!\xe2\x80\x94when the veil between the frail\r\npresent and the eternal future grows thin,\xe2\x80\x94then came the messenger!\r\n\r\nThere was a sound in that chamber, first of one who stepped quickly. It\r\nwas Miss Ophelia, who had resolved to sit up all night with her little\r\ncharge, and who, at the turn of the night, had discerned what\r\nexperienced nurses significantly call \xe2\x80\x9ca change.\xe2\x80\x9d The outer door was\r\nquickly opened, and Tom, who was watching outside, was on the alert, in\r\na moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo for the doctor, Tom! lose not a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia; and,\r\nstepping across the room, she rapped at St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words fell on his heart like clods upon a coffin. Why did they?\r\nHe was up and in the room in an instant, and bending over Eva, who\r\nstill slept.\r\n\r\nWhat was it he saw that made his heart stand still? Why was no word\r\nspoken between the two? Thou canst say, who hast seen that same\r\nexpression on the face dearest to thee;\xe2\x80\x94that look indescribable,\r\nhopeless, unmistakable, that says to thee that thy beloved is no longer\r\nthine.\r\n\r\nOn the face of the child, however, there was no ghastly imprint,\xe2\x80\x94only a\r\nhigh and almost sublime expression,\xe2\x80\x94the overshadowing presence of\r\nspiritual natures, the dawning of immortal life in that childish soul.\r\n\r\nThey stood there so still, gazing upon her, that even the ticking of\r\nthe watch seemed too loud. In a few moments, Tom returned, with the\r\ndoctor. He entered, gave one look, and stood silent as the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did this change take place?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in a low whisper, to Miss\r\nOphelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the turn of the night,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\nMarie, roused by the entrance of the doctor, appeared, hurriedly, from\r\nthe next room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugustine! Cousin!\xe2\x80\x94O!\xe2\x80\x94what!\xe2\x80\x9d she hurriedly began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, hoarsely; _\xe2\x80\x9cshe is dying!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nMammy heard the words, and flew to awaken the servants. The house was\r\nsoon roused,\xe2\x80\x94lights were seen, footsteps heard, anxious faces thronged\r\nthe verandah, and looked tearfully through the glass doors; but St.\r\nClare heard and said nothing,\xe2\x80\x94he saw only _that look_ on the face of\r\nthe little sleeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, if she would only wake, and speak once more!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and,\r\nstooping over her, he spoke in her ear,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cEva, darling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe large blue eyes unclosed\xe2\x80\x94a smile passed over her face;\xe2\x80\x94she tried to\r\nraise her head, and to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know me, Eva?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, with a last effort, throwing her arms\r\nabout his neck. In a moment they dropped again; and, as St. Clare\r\nraised his head, he saw a spasm of mortal agony pass over the face,\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nstruggled for breath, and threw up her little hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, God, this is dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning away in agony, and\r\nwringing Tom\xe2\x80\x99s hand, scarce conscious what he was doing. \xe2\x80\x9cO, Tom, my\r\nboy, it is killing me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom had his master\xe2\x80\x99s hands between his own; and, with tears streaming\r\ndown his dark cheeks, looked up for help where he had always been used\r\nto look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray that this may be cut short!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthis wrings my\r\nheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, bless the Lord! it\xe2\x80\x99s over,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s over, dear Master!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9clook\r\nat her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child lay panting on her pillows, as one exhausted,\xe2\x80\x94the large clear\r\neyes rolled up and fixed. Ah, what said those eyes, that spoke so much\r\nof heaven! Earth was past,\xe2\x80\x94and earthly pain; but so solemn, so\r\nmysterious, was the triumphant brightness of that face, that it checked\r\neven the sobs of sorrow. They pressed around her, in breathless\r\nstillness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, gently.\r\n\r\nShe did not hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Eva, tell us what you see! What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said her father.\r\n\r\nA bright, a glorious smile passed over her face, and she said,\r\nbrokenly,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cO! love,\xe2\x80\x94joy,\xe2\x80\x94peace!\xe2\x80\x9d gave one sigh and passed from death\r\nunto life!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, beloved child! the bright, eternal doors have closed after\r\nthee; we shall see thy sweet face no more. O, woe for them who watched\r\nthy entrance into heaven, when they shall wake and find only the cold\r\ngray sky of daily life, and thou gone forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis Is the Last of Earth\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the last of Earth! I am content,\xe2\x80\x9d last words of John\r\n Quincy Adams, uttered February 21, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statuettes and pictures in Eva\xe2\x80\x99s room were shrouded in white\r\nnapkins, and only hushed breathings and muffled footfalls were heard\r\nthere, and the light stole in solemnly through windows partially\r\ndarkened by closed blinds.\r\n\r\nThe bed was draped in white; and there, beneath the drooping\r\nangel-figure, lay a little sleeping form,\xe2\x80\x94sleeping never to waken!\r\n\r\nThere she lay, robed in one of the simple white dresses she had been\r\nwont to wear when living; the rose-colored light through the curtains\r\ncast over the icy coldness of death a warm glow. The heavy eyelashes\r\ndrooped softly on the pure cheek; the head was turned a little to one\r\nside, as if in natural sleep, but there was diffused over every\r\nlineament of the face that high celestial expression, that mingling of\r\nrapture and repose, which showed it was no earthly or temporary sleep,\r\nbut the long, sacred rest which \xe2\x80\x9cHe giveth to his beloved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is no death to such as thou, dear Eva! neither darkness nor\r\nshadow of death; only such a bright fading as when the morning star\r\nfades in the golden dawn. Thine is the victory without the battle,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ncrown without the conflict.\r\n\r\nSo did St. Clare think, as, with folded arms, he stood there gazing.\r\nAh! who shall say what he did think? for, from the hour that voices had\r\nsaid, in the dying chamber, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is gone,\xe2\x80\x9d it had been all a dreary\r\nmist, a heavy \xe2\x80\x9cdimness of anguish.\xe2\x80\x9d He had heard voices around him; he\r\nhad had questions asked, and answered them; they had asked him when he\r\nwould have the funeral, and where they should lay her; and he had\r\nanswered, impatiently, that he cared not.\r\n\r\nAdolph and Rosa had arranged the chamber; volatile, fickle and\r\nchildish, as they generally were, they were soft-hearted and full of\r\nfeeling; and, while Miss Ophelia presided over the general details of\r\norder and neatness, it was their hands that added those soft, poetic\r\ntouches to the arrangements, that took from the death-room the grim and\r\nghastly air which too often marks a New England funeral.\r\n\r\nThere were still flowers on the shelves,\xe2\x80\x94all white, delicate and\r\nfragrant, with graceful, drooping leaves. Eva\xe2\x80\x99s little table, covered\r\nwith white, bore on it her favorite vase, with a single white moss\r\nrose-bud in it. The folds of the drapery, the fall of the curtains, had\r\nbeen arranged and rearranged, by Adolph and Rosa, with that nicety of\r\neye which characterizes their race. Even now, while St. Clare stood\r\nthere thinking, little Rosa tripped softly into the chamber with a\r\nbasket of white flowers. She stepped back when she saw St. Clare, and\r\nstopped respectfully; but, seeing that he did not observe her, she came\r\nforward to place them around the dead. St. Clare saw her as in a dream,\r\nwhile she placed in the small hands a fair cape jessamine, and, with\r\nadmirable taste, disposed other flowers around the couch.\r\n\r\nThe door opened again, and Topsy, her eyes swelled with crying,\r\nappeared, holding something under her apron. Rosa made a quick\r\nforbidding gesture; but she took a step into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must go out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosa, in a sharp, positive whisper; \xe2\x80\x9c_you_\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t any business here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, do let me! I brought a flower,\xe2\x80\x94such a pretty one!\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy,\r\nholding up a half-blown tea rose-bud. \xe2\x80\x9cDo let me put just one there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet along!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosa, more decidedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her stay!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, suddenly stamping his foot. \xe2\x80\x9cShe shall\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosa suddenly retreated, and Topsy came forward and laid her offering\r\nat the feet of the corpse; then suddenly, with a wild and bitter cry,\r\nshe threw herself on the floor alongside the bed, and wept, and moaned\r\naloud.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia hastened into the room, and tried to raise and silence\r\nher; but in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Miss Eva! oh, Miss Eva! I wish I \xe2\x80\x99s dead, too,\xe2\x80\x94I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a piercing wildness in the cry; the blood flushed into St.\r\nClare\xe2\x80\x99s white, marble-like face, and the first tears he had shed since\r\nEva died stood in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, in a softened voice; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t cry so.\r\nMiss Eva is gone to heaven; she is an angel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t see her!\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy. \xe2\x80\x9cI never shall see her!\xe2\x80\x9d and she\r\nsobbed again.\r\n\r\nThey all stood a moment in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_She_ said she _loved_ me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshe did! O, dear! oh, dear!\r\nthere an\xe2\x80\x99t _nobody_ left now,\xe2\x80\x94there an\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true enough\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare; \xe2\x80\x9cbut do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Miss Ophelia,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csee if you can\xe2\x80\x99t comfort the poor creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI jist wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t never been born,\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nbe born, no ways; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see no use on \xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia raised her gently, but firmly, and took her from the room;\r\nbut, as she did so, some tears fell from her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTopsy, you poor child,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she led her into her room, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngive up! _I_ can love you, though I am not like that dear little child.\r\nI hope I\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt something of the love of Christ from her. I can love\r\nyou; I do, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to help you to grow up a good Christian girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s voice was more than her words, and more than that were\r\nthe honest tears that fell down her face. From that hour, she acquired\r\nan influence over the mind of the destitute child that she never lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, my Eva, whose little hour on earth did so much of good,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nSt. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat account have I to give for my long years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were, for a while, soft whisperings and footfalls in the chamber,\r\nas one after another stole in, to look at the dead; and then came the\r\nlittle coffin; and then there was a funeral, and carriages drove to the\r\ndoor, and strangers came and were seated; and there were white scarfs\r\nand ribbons, and crape bands, and mourners dressed in black crape; and\r\nthere were words read from the Bible, and prayers offered; and St.\r\nClare lived, and walked, and moved, as one who has shed every tear;\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nthe last he saw only one thing, that golden head in the coffin; but\r\nthen he saw the cloth spread over it, the lid of the coffin closed; and\r\nhe walked, when he was put beside the others, down to a little place at\r\nthe bottom of the garden, and there, by the mossy seat where she and\r\nTom had talked, and sung, and read so often, was the little grave. St.\r\nClare stood beside it,\xe2\x80\x94looked vacantly down; he saw them lower the\r\nlittle coffin; he heard, dimly, the solemn words, \xe2\x80\x9cI am the\r\nresurrection and the Life; he that believeth in me, though he were\r\ndead, yet shall he live;\xe2\x80\x9d and, as the earth was cast in and filled up\r\nthe little grave, he could not realize that it was his Eva that they\r\nwere hiding from his sight.\r\n\r\nNor was it!\xe2\x80\x94not Eva, but only the frail seed of that bright, immortal\r\nform with which she shall yet come forth, in the day of the Lord Jesus!\r\n\r\nAnd then all were gone, and the mourners went back to the place which\r\nshould know her no more; and Marie\xe2\x80\x99s room was darkened, and she lay on\r\nthe bed, sobbing and moaning in uncontrollable grief, and calling every\r\nmoment for the attentions of all her servants. Of course, they had no\r\ntime to cry,\xe2\x80\x94why should they? the grief was _her_ grief, and she was\r\nfully convinced that nobody on earth did, could, or would feel it as\r\nshe did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Clare did not shed a tear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9che didn\xe2\x80\x99t sympathize with\r\nher; it was perfectly wonderful to think how hard-hearted and unfeeling\r\nhe was, when he must know how she suffered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo much are people the slave of their eye and ear, that many of the\r\nservants really thought that Missis was the principal sufferer in the\r\ncase, especially as Marie began to have hysterical spasms, and sent for\r\nthe doctor, and at last declared herself dying; and, in the running and\r\nscampering, and bringing up hot bottles, and heating of flannels, and\r\nchafing, and fussing, that ensued, there was quite a diversion.\r\n\r\nTom, however, had a feeling at his own heart, that drew him to his\r\nmaster. He followed him wherever he walked, wistfully and sadly; and\r\nwhen he saw him sitting, so pale and quiet, in Eva\xe2\x80\x99s room, holding\r\nbefore his eyes her little open Bible, though seeing no letter or word\r\nof what was in it, there was more sorrow to Tom in that still, fixed,\r\ntearless eye, than in all Marie\xe2\x80\x99s moans and lamentations.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the St. Clare family were back again in the city;\r\nAugustine, with the restlessness of grief, longing for another scene,\r\nto change the current of his thoughts. So they left the house and\r\ngarden, with its little grave, and came back to New Orleans; and St.\r\nClare walked the streets busily, and strove to fill up the chasm in his\r\nheart with hurry and bustle, and change of place; and people who saw\r\nhim in the street, or met him at the cafe, knew of his loss only by the\r\nweed on his hat; for there he was, smiling and talking, and reading the\r\nnewspaper, and speculating on politics, and attending to business\r\nmatters; and who could see that all this smiling outside was but a\r\nhollowed shell over a heart that was a dark and silent sepulchre?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. St. Clare is a singular man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie to Miss Ophelia, in a\r\ncomplaining tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI used to think, if there was anything in the world\r\nhe did love, it was our dear little Eva; but he seems to be forgetting\r\nher very easily. I cannot ever get him to talk about her. I really did\r\nthink he would show more feeling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill waters run deepest, they used to tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia,\r\noracularly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in such things; it\xe2\x80\x99s all talk. If people have\r\nfeeling, they will show it,\xe2\x80\x94they can\xe2\x80\x99t help it; but, then, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great\r\nmisfortune to have feeling. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have been made like St. Clare.\r\nMy feelings prey upon me so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, Missis, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r St. Clare is gettin\xe2\x80\x99 thin as a shader. They say,\r\nhe don\xe2\x80\x99t never eat nothin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mammy. \xe2\x80\x9cI know he don\xe2\x80\x99t forget Miss\r\nEva; I know there couldn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody,\xe2\x80\x94dear, little, blessed cretur!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, wiping her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at all events, he has no consideration for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken one word of sympathy, and he must know how much more a\r\nmother feels than any man can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe heart knoweth its own bitterness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I think. I know just what I feel,\xe2\x80\x94nobody else seems\r\nto. Eva used to, but she is gone!\xe2\x80\x9d and Marie lay back on her lounge,\r\nand began to sob disconsolately.\r\n\r\nMarie was one of those unfortunately constituted mortals, in whose eyes\r\nwhatever is lost and gone assumes a value which it never had in\r\npossession. Whatever she had, she seemed to survey only to pick flaws\r\nin it; but, once fairly away, there was no end to her valuation of it.\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation was taking place in the parlor another was\r\ngoing on in St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s library.\r\n\r\nTom, who was always uneasily following his master about, had seen him\r\ngo to his library, some hours before; and, after vainly waiting for him\r\nto come out, determined, at last, to make an errand in. He entered\r\nsoftly. St. Clare lay on his lounge, at the further end of the room. He\r\nwas lying on his face, with Eva\xe2\x80\x99s Bible open before him, at a little\r\ndistance. Tom walked up, and stood by the sofa. He hesitated; and,\r\nwhile he was hesitating, St. Clare suddenly raised himself up. The\r\nhonest face, so full of grief, and with such an imploring expression of\r\naffection and sympathy, struck his master. He laid his hand on Tom\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand bowed down his forehead on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Tom, my boy, the whole world is as empty as an egg-shell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x94I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, oh, if Mas\xe2\x80\x99r could only\r\nlook up,\xe2\x80\x94up where our dear Miss Eva is,\xe2\x80\x94up to the dear Lord Jesus!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Tom! I do look up; but the trouble is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything, when\r\nI do, I wish I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom sighed heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to be given to children, and poor, honest fellows, like you,\r\nto see what we can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cHow comes it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou has \xe2\x80\x99hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmurmured Tom; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe,\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the habit of\r\ndoubting,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to believe this Bible,\xe2\x80\x94and I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, pray to the good Lord,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Lord, I believe; help thou my\r\nunbelief.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows anything about anything?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, his eyes wandering\r\ndreamily, and speaking to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWas all that beautiful love and\r\nfaith only one of the ever-shifting phases of human feeling, having\r\nnothing real to rest on, passing away with the little breath? And is\r\nthere no more Eva,\xe2\x80\x94no heaven,\xe2\x80\x94no Christ,\xe2\x80\x94nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, dear Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, there is! I know it; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, falling\r\non his knees. \xe2\x80\x9cDo, do, dear Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know there\xe2\x80\x99s any Christ, Tom! You never saw the Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFelt Him in my soul, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x94feel Him now! O, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, when I was sold\r\naway from my old woman and the children, I was jest a\xe2\x80\x99most broke up. I\r\nfelt as if there warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothin\xe2\x80\x99 left; and then the good Lord, he stood\r\nby me, and he says, \xe2\x80\x98Fear not, Tom;\xe2\x80\x99 and he brings light and joy in a\r\npoor feller\xe2\x80\x99s soul,\xe2\x80\x94makes all peace; and I \xe2\x80\x99s so happy, and loves\r\neverybody, and feels willin\xe2\x80\x99 jest to be the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s, and have the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill done, and be put jest where the Lord wants to put me. I know it\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come from me, cause I \xe2\x80\x99s a poor, complainin\xe2\x80\x99 cretur; it comes\r\nfrom the Lord; and I know He\xe2\x80\x99s willin\xe2\x80\x99 to do for Mas\xe2\x80\x99r.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom spoke with fast-running tears and choking voice. St. Clare leaned\r\nhis head on his shoulder, and wrung the hard, faithful, black hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, you love me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI \xe2\x80\x99s willin\xe2\x80\x99 to lay down my life, this blessed day, to see Mas\xe2\x80\x99r a\r\nChristian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor, foolish boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, half-raising himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nworth the love of one good, honest heart, like yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, dere\xe2\x80\x99s more than me loves you,\xe2\x80\x94the blessed Lord Jesus loves\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeels it in my soul. O, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r! \xe2\x80\x99the love of Christ, that passeth\r\nknowledge.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSingular!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, turning away, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the story of a man that\r\nlived and died eighteen hundred years ago can affect people so yet. But\r\nhe was no man,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo man ever had such long and\r\nliving power! O, that I could believe what my mother taught me, and\r\npray as I did when I was a boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mas\xe2\x80\x99r pleases,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Eva used to read this so\r\nbeautifully. I wish Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99d be so good as read it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get no\r\nreadin\xe2\x80\x99, hardly, now Miss Eva\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chapter was the eleventh of John,\xe2\x80\x94the touching account of the\r\nraising of Lazarus, St. Clare read it aloud, often pausing to wrestle\r\ndown feelings which were roused by the pathos of the story. Tom knelt\r\nbefore him, with clasped hands, and with an absorbed expression of\r\nlove, trust, adoration, on his quiet face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d said his Master, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is all _real_ to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can jest fairly _see_ it Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had your eyes, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish, to the dear Lord, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r had!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Tom, you know that I have a great deal more knowledge than you;\r\nwhat if I should tell you that I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe this Bible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, holding up his hands, with a deprecating gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it shake your faith some, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a grain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom, you must know I know the most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you jest read how he hides from the wise and\r\nprudent, and reveals unto babes? But Mas\xe2\x80\x99r wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in earnest, for\r\nsartin, now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Tom, I was not. I don\xe2\x80\x99t disbelieve, and I think there is reason to\r\nbelieve; and still I don\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s a troublesome bad habit I\xe2\x80\x99ve got,\r\nTom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mas\xe2\x80\x99r would only pray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know I don\xe2\x80\x99t, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Mas\xe2\x80\x99r?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would, Tom, if there was anybody there when I pray; but it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nspeaking unto nothing, when I do. But come, Tom, you pray now, and show\r\nme how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s heart was full; he poured it out in prayer, like waters that have\r\nbeen long suppressed. One thing was plain enough; Tom thought there was\r\nsomebody to hear, whether there were or not. In fact, St. Clare felt\r\nhimself borne, on the tide of his faith and feeling, almost to the\r\ngates of that heaven he seemed so vividly to conceive. It seemed to\r\nbring him nearer to Eva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, when Tom rose. \xe2\x80\x9cI like to hear\r\nyou, Tom; but go, now, and leave me alone; some other time, I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom silently left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\nReunion\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek after week glided away in the St. Clare mansion, and the waves of\r\nlife settled back to their usual flow, where that little bark had gone\r\ndown. For how imperiously, how coolly, in disregard of all one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeeling, does the hard, cold, uninteresting course of daily realities\r\nmove on! Still must we eat, and drink, and sleep, and wake again,\xe2\x80\x94still\r\nbargain, buy, sell, ask and answer questions,\xe2\x80\x94pursue, in short, a\r\nthousand shadows, though all interest in them be over; the cold\r\nmechanical habit of living remaining, after all vital interest in it\r\nhas fled.\r\n\r\nAll the interests and hopes of St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s life had unconsciously wound\r\nthemselves around this child. It was for Eva that he had managed his\r\nproperty; it was for Eva that he had planned the disposal of his time;\r\nand, to do this and that for Eva,\xe2\x80\x94to buy, improve, alter, and arrange,\r\nor dispose something for her,\xe2\x80\x94had been so long his habit, that now she\r\nwas gone, there seemed nothing to be thought of, and nothing to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nTrue, there was another life,\xe2\x80\x94a life which, once believed in, stands as\r\na solemn, significant figure before the otherwise unmeaning ciphers of\r\ntime, changing them to orders of mysterious, untold value. St. Clare\r\nknew this well; and often, in many a weary hour, he heard that slender,\r\nchildish voice calling him to the skies, and saw that little hand\r\npointing to him the way of life; but a heavy lethargy of sorrow lay on\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x94he could not arise. He had one of those natures which could better\r\nand more clearly conceive of religious things from its own perceptions\r\nand instincts, than many a matter-of-fact and practical Christian. The\r\ngift to appreciate and the sense to feel the finer shades and relations\r\nof moral things, often seems an attribute of those whose whole life\r\nshows a careless disregard of them. Hence Moore, Byron, Goethe, often\r\nspeak words more wisely descriptive of the true religious sentiment,\r\nthan another man, whose whole life is governed by it. In such minds,\r\ndisregard of religion is a more fearful treason,\xe2\x80\x94a more deadly sin.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare had never pretended to govern himself by any religious\r\nobligation; and a certain fineness of nature gave him such an\r\ninstinctive view of the extent of the requirements of Christianity,\r\nthat he shrank, by anticipation, from what he felt would be the\r\nexactions of his own conscience, if he once did resolve to assume them.\r\nFor, so inconsistent is human nature, especially in the ideal, that not\r\nto undertake a thing at all seems better than to undertake and come\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nStill St. Clare was, in many respects, another man. He read his little\r\nEva\xe2\x80\x99s Bible seriously and honestly; he thought more soberly and\r\npractically of his relations to his servants,\xe2\x80\x94enough to make him\r\nextremely dissatisfied with both his past and present course; and one\r\nthing he did, soon after his return to New Orleans, and that was to\r\ncommence the legal steps necessary to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s emancipation, which was to\r\nbe perfected as soon as he could get through the necessary formalities.\r\nMeantime, he attached himself to Tom more and more, every day. In all\r\nthe wide world, there was nothing that seemed to remind him so much of\r\nEva; and he would insist on keeping him constantly about him, and,\r\nfastidious and unapproachable as he was with regard to his deeper\r\nfeelings, he almost thought aloud to Tom. Nor would any one have\r\nwondered at it, who had seen the expression of affection and devotion\r\nwith which Tom continually followed his young master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, the day after he had commenced the legal\r\nformalities for his enfranchisement, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to make a free man of\r\nyou;\xe2\x80\x94so have your trunk packed, and get ready to set out for Kentuck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sudden light of joy that shone in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s face as he raised his hands\r\nto heaven, his emphatic \xe2\x80\x9cBless the Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d rather discomposed St. Clare;\r\nhe did not like it that Tom should be so ready to leave him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t had such very bad times here, that you need be in such a\r\nrapture, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r! \xe2\x80\x99tan\xe2\x80\x99t that,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s bein\xe2\x80\x99 a _freeman!_ that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\njoyin\xe2\x80\x99 for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think, for your own part, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been better off\r\nthan to be free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_No, indeed_, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r St. Clare,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with a flash of energy. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nindeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly have earned, by your work, such\r\nclothes and such living as I have given you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnows all that, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r St. Clare; Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s been too good; but, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d rather have poor clothes, poor house, poor everything, and have \xe2\x80\x99em\r\n_mine_, than have the best, and have \xe2\x80\x99em any man\xe2\x80\x99s else,\xe2\x80\x94I had _so_,\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r; I think it\xe2\x80\x99s natur, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so, Tom, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be going off and leaving me, in a month\r\nor so,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, rather discontentedly. \xe2\x80\x9cThough why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, no\r\nmortal knows,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a gayer tone; and, getting up, he began to\r\nwalk the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot while Mas\xe2\x80\x99r is in trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stay with Mas\xe2\x80\x99r as\r\nlong as he wants me,\xe2\x80\x94so as I can be any use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot while I\xe2\x80\x99m in trouble, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, looking sadly out of\r\nthe window. . . . \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when will _my_ trouble be over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Mas\xe2\x80\x99r St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s a Christian,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you really mean to stay by till that day comes?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare,\r\nhalf smiling, as he turned from the window, and laid his hand on Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Tom, you soft, silly boy! I won\xe2\x80\x99t keep you till that\r\nday. Go home to your wife and children, and give my love to all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI \xe2\x80\x99s faith to believe that day will come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, earnestly, and\r\nwith tears in his eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Lord has a work for Mas\xe2\x80\x99r.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA work, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, now, Tom, give me your views on\r\nwhat sort of a work it is;\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, even a poor fellow like me has a work from the Lord; and Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\r\nSt. Clare, that has larnin, and riches, and friends,\xe2\x80\x94how much he might\r\ndo for the Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, you seem to think the Lord needs a great deal done for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSt. Clare, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe does for the Lord when we does for his critturs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood theology, Tom; better than Dr. B. preaches, I dare swear,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSt. Clare.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was here interrupted by the announcement of some\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\nMarie St. Clare felt the loss of Eva as deeply as she could feel\r\nanything; and, as she was a woman that had a great faculty of making\r\neverybody unhappy when she was, her immediate attendants had still\r\nstronger reason to regret the loss of their young mistress, whose\r\nwinning ways and gentle intercessions had so often been a shield to\r\nthem from the tyrannical and selfish exactions of her mother. Poor old\r\nMammy, in particular, whose heart, severed from all natural domestic\r\nties, had consoled itself with this one beautiful being, was almost\r\nheart-broken. She cried day and night, and was, from excess of sorrow,\r\nless skilful and alert in her ministrations of her mistress than usual,\r\nwhich drew down a constant storm of invectives on her defenceless head.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia felt the loss; but, in her good and honest heart, it bore\r\nfruit unto everlasting life. She was more softened, more gentle; and,\r\nthough equally assiduous in every duty, it was with a chastened and\r\nquiet air, as one who communed with her own heart not in vain. She was\r\nmore diligent in teaching Topsy,\xe2\x80\x94taught her mainly from the Bible,\xe2\x80\x94did\r\nnot any longer shrink from her touch, or manifest an ill-repressed\r\ndisgust, because she felt none. She viewed her now through the softened\r\nmedium that Eva\xe2\x80\x99s hand had first held before her eyes, and saw in her\r\nonly an immortal creature, whom God had sent to be led by her to glory\r\nand virtue. Topsy did not become at once a saint; but the life and\r\ndeath of Eva did work a marked change in her. The callous indifference\r\nwas gone; there was now sensibility, hope, desire, and the striving for\r\ngood,\xe2\x80\x94a strife irregular, interrupted, suspended oft, but yet renewed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Topsy had been sent for by Miss Ophelia, she came,\r\nhastily thrusting something into her bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing there, you limb? You\xe2\x80\x99ve been stealing something,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound,\xe2\x80\x9d said the imperious little Rosa, who had been sent to\r\ncall her, seizing her, at the same time, roughly by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go \xe2\x80\x99long, Miss Rosa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Topsy, pulling from her; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98tan\xe2\x80\x99t none\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 your business!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone o\xe2\x80\x99 your sa\xe2\x80\x99ce!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosa, \xe2\x80\x9cI saw you hiding something,\xe2\x80\x94I know\r\nyer tricks,\xe2\x80\x9d and Rosa seized her arm, and tried to force her hand into\r\nher bosom, while Topsy, enraged, kicked and fought valiantly for what\r\nshe considered her rights. The clamor and confusion of the battle drew\r\nMiss Ophelia and St. Clare both to the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been stealing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI han\xe2\x80\x99t, neither!\xe2\x80\x9d vociferated Topsy, sobbing with passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me that, whatever it is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, firmly.\r\n\r\nTopsy hesitated; but, on a second order, pulled out of her bosom a\r\nlittle parcel done up in the foot of one of her own old stockings.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia turned it out. There was a small book, which had been\r\ngiven to Topsy by Eva, containing a single verse of Scripture, arranged\r\nfor every day in the year, and in a paper the curl of hair that she had\r\ngiven her on that memorable day when she had taken her last farewell.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare was a good deal affected at the sight of it; the little book\r\nhad been rolled in a long strip of black crape, torn from the funeral\r\nweeds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you wrap _this_ round the book for?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, holding\r\nup the crape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCause,\xe2\x80\x94cause,\xe2\x80\x94cause \xe2\x80\x99t was Miss Eva. O, don\xe2\x80\x99t take \xe2\x80\x99em away, please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said; and, sitting flat down on the floor, and putting her apron\r\nover her head, she began to sob vehemently.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious mixture of the pathetic and the ludicrous,\xe2\x80\x94the little\r\nold stockings,\xe2\x80\x94black crape,\xe2\x80\x94text-book,\xe2\x80\x94fair, soft curl,\xe2\x80\x94and Topsy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nutter distress.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare smiled; but there were tears in his eyes, as he said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t cry; you shall have them!\xe2\x80\x9d and, putting them\r\ntogether, he threw them into her lap, and drew Miss Ophelia with him\r\ninto the parlor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really think you can make something of that concern,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\npointing with his thumb backward over his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cAny mind that is\r\ncapable of a _real sorrow_ is capable of good. You must try and do\r\nsomething with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child has improved greatly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cI have great\r\nhopes of her; but, Augustine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laying her hand on his arm,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cone thing I want to ask; whose is this child to be?\xe2\x80\x94yours or mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I gave her to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Augustine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not legally;\xe2\x80\x94I want her to be mine legally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhew! cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Augustine. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will the Abolition Society think?\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ll have a day of fasting appointed for this backsliding, if you\r\nbecome a slaveholder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, nonsense! I want her mine, that I may have a right to take her to\r\nthe free States, and give her her liberty, that all I am trying to do\r\nbe not undone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, cousin, what an awful \xe2\x80\x99doing evil that good may come\xe2\x80\x99! I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nencourage it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to joke, but to reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nno use in my trying to make this child a Christian child, unless I save\r\nher from all the chances and reverses of slavery; and, if you really\r\nare willing I should have her, I want you to give me a deed of gift, or\r\nsome legal paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cI will;\xe2\x80\x9d and he sat down, and unfolded a\r\nnewspaper to read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I want it done now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your hurry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause now is the only time there ever is to do a thing in,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, here\xe2\x80\x99s paper, pen, and ink; just write a\r\npaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare, like most men of his class of mind, cordially hated the\r\npresent tense of action, generally; and, therefore, he was considerably\r\nannoyed by Miss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s downrightness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you take my word? One would\r\nthink you had taken lessons of the Jews, coming at a fellow so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to make sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may die, or fail,\r\nand then Topsy be hustled off to auction, spite of all I can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, you are quite provident. Well, seeing I\xe2\x80\x99m in the hands of a\r\nYankee, there is nothing for it but to concede;\xe2\x80\x9d and St. Clare rapidly\r\nwrote off a deed of gift, which, as he was well versed in the forms of\r\nlaw, he could easily do, and signed his name to it in sprawling\r\ncapitals, concluding by a tremendous flourish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that black and white, now, Miss Vermont?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he\r\nhanded it to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cBut must it not be witnessed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, bother!\xe2\x80\x94yes. Here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, opening the door into Marie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napartment, \xe2\x80\x9cMarie, Cousin wants your autograph; just put your name down\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, as she ran over the paper. \xe2\x80\x9cRidiculous! I\r\nthought Cousin was too pious for such horrid things,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, as she\r\ncarelessly wrote her name; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, if she has a fancy for that article, I\r\nam sure she\xe2\x80\x99s welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, now, she\xe2\x80\x99s yours, body and soul,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, handing the\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more mine now than she was before,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody but God\r\nhas a right to give her to me; but I can protect her now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s yours by a fiction of law, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, as he\r\nturned back into the parlor, and sat down to his paper.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia, who seldom sat much in Marie\xe2\x80\x99s company, followed him into\r\nthe parlor, having first carefully laid away the paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugustine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, suddenly, as she sat knitting, \xe2\x80\x9chave you ever\r\nmade any provision for your servants, in case of your death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, as he read on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen all your indulgence to them may prove a great cruelty, by and\r\nby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare had often thought the same thing himself; but he answered,\r\nnegligently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I mean to make a provision, by and by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, one of these days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if you should die first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousin, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, laying down his paper and\r\nlooking at her. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I show symptoms of yellow fever or\r\ncholera, that you are making post mortem arrangements with such zeal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98In the midst of life we are in death,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare rose up, and laying the paper down, carelessly, walked to the\r\ndoor that stood open on the verandah, to put an end to a conversation\r\nthat was not agreeable to him. Mechanically, he repeated the last word\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x94_\xe2\x80\x9cDeath!\xe2\x80\x9d_\xe2\x80\x94and, as he leaned against the railings, and watched\r\nthe sparkling water as it rose and fell in the fountain; and, as in a\r\ndim and dizzy haze, saw flowers and trees and vases of the courts, he\r\nrepeated, again the mystic word so common in every mouth, yet of such\r\nfearful power,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDEATH!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cStrange that there should be such a word,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cand such a thing, and we ever forget it; that one should be\r\nliving, warm and beautiful, full of hopes, desires and wants, one day,\r\nand the next be gone, utterly gone, and forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a warm, golden evening; and, as he walked to the other end of\r\nthe verandah, he saw Tom busily intent on his Bible, pointing, as he\r\ndid so, with his finger to each successive word, and whispering them to\r\nhimself with an earnest air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant me to read to you, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, seating himself\r\ncarelessly by him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mas\xe2\x80\x99r pleases,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, gratefully, \xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r makes it so much\r\nplainer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare took the book and glanced at the place, and began reading one\r\nof the passages which Tom had designated by the heavy marks around it.\r\nIt ran as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all his holy angels\r\nwith him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before\r\nhim shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from\r\nanother, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.\xe2\x80\x9d St. Clare\r\nread on in an animated voice, till he came to the last of the verses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen shall the king say unto him on his left hand, Depart from me, ye\r\ncursed, into everlasting fire: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me no\r\nmeat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye\r\ntook me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: I was sick, and in\r\nprison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they answer unto Him, Lord\r\nwhen saw we thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or\r\nsick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? Then shall he say\r\nunto them, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these my\r\nbrethren, ye did it not to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare seemed struck with this last passage, for he read it\r\ntwice,\xe2\x80\x94the second time slowly, and as if he were revolving the words in\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthese folks that get such hard measure seem to have\r\nbeen doing just what I have,\xe2\x80\x94living good, easy, respectable lives; and\r\nnot troubling themselves to inquire how many of their brethren were\r\nhungry or athirst, or sick, or in prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom did not answer.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare rose up and walked thoughtfully up and down the verandah,\r\nseeming to forget everything in his own thoughts; so absorbed was he,\r\nthat Tom had to remind him twice that the teabell had rung, before he\r\ncould get his attention.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare was absent and thoughtful, all tea-time. After tea, he and\r\nMarie and Miss Ophelia took possession of the parlor almost in silence.\r\n\r\nMarie disposed herself on a lounge, under a silken mosquito curtain,\r\nand was soon sound asleep. Miss Ophelia silently busied herself with\r\nher knitting. St. Clare sat down to the piano, and began playing a soft\r\nand melancholy movement with the \xc3\x86olian accompaniment. He seemed in a\r\ndeep reverie, and to be soliloquizing to himself by music. After a\r\nlittle, he opened one of the drawers, took out an old music-book whose\r\nleaves were yellow with age, and began turning it over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cthis was one of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbooks,\xe2\x80\x94and here is her handwriting,\xe2\x80\x94come and look at it. She copied and\r\narranged this from Mozart\xe2\x80\x99s Requiem.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Ophelia came accordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was something she used to sing often,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\r\ncan hear her now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe struck a few majestic chords, and began singing that grand old Latin\r\npiece, the \xe2\x80\x9cDies Ir\xc3\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom, who was listening in the outer verandah, was drawn by the sound to\r\nthe very door, where he stood earnestly. He did not understand the\r\nwords, of course; but the music and manner of singing appeared to\r\naffect him strongly, especially when St. Clare sang the more pathetic\r\nparts. Tom would have sympathized more heartily, if he had known the\r\nmeaning of the beautiful words:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecordare Jesu pie\r\nQuod sum causa tu\xc3\xa6r vi\xc3\xa6\r\nNe me perdas, illa die\r\nQu\xc3\xa6rens me sedisti lassus\r\nRedemisti crucem passus\r\nTantus labor non sit cassus.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] These lines have been thus rather inadequately translated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink, O Jesus, for what reason\r\nThou endured\xe2\x80\x99st earth\xe2\x80\x99s spite and treason,\r\nNor me lose, in that dread season;\r\nSeeking me, thy worn feet hasted,\r\nOn the cross thy soul death tasted,\r\nLet not all these toils be wasted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Mrs. Stowe\xe2\x80\x99s note.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Clare threw a deep and pathetic expression into the words; for the\r\nshadowy veil of years seemed drawn away, and he seemed to hear his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s voice leading his. Voice and instrument seemed both living,\r\nand threw out with vivid sympathy those strains which the ethereal\r\nMozart first conceived as his own dying requiem.\r\n\r\nWhen St. Clare had done singing, he sat leaning his head upon his hand\r\na few moments, and then began walking up and down the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a sublime conception is that of a last judgment!\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nrighting of all the wrongs of ages!\xe2\x80\x94a solving of all moral problems, by\r\nan unanswerable wisdom! It is, indeed, a wonderful image.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fearful one to us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ought to be to me, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare stopping,\r\nthoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI was reading to Tom, this afternoon, that chapter in\r\nMatthew that gives an account of it, and I have been quite struck with\r\nit. One should have expected some terrible enormities charged to those\r\nwho are excluded from Heaven, as the reason; but no,\xe2\x80\x94they are condemned\r\nfor _not_ doing positive good, as if that included every possible\r\nharm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cit is impossible for a person who does\r\nno good not to do harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, speaking abstractedly, but with deep\r\nfeeling, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat shall be said of one whose own heart, whose education,\r\nand the wants of society, have called in vain to some noble purpose;\r\nwho has floated on, a dreamy, neutral spectator of the struggles,\r\nagonies, and wrongs of man, when he should have been a worker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he ought to repent, and begin\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways practical and to the point!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, his face breaking\r\nout into a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never leave me any time for general reflections,\r\nCousin; you always bring me short up against the actual present; you\r\nhave a kind of eternal _now_, always in your mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ is all the time I have anything to do with,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear little Eva,\xe2\x80\x94poor child!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cshe had set her little\r\nsimple soul on a good work for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the first time since Eva\xe2\x80\x99s death that he had ever said as many\r\nwords as these to her, and he spoke now evidently repressing very\r\nstrong feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy view of Christianity is such,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I think no man can\r\nconsistently profess it without throwing the whole weight of his being\r\nagainst this monstrous system of injustice that lies at the foundation\r\nof all our society; and, if need be, sacrificing himself in the battle.\r\nThat is, I mean that _I_ could not be a Christian otherwise, though I\r\nhave certainly had intercourse with a great many enlightened and\r\nChristian people who did no such thing; and I confess that the apathy\r\nof religious people on this subject, their want of perception of wrongs\r\nthat filled me with horror, have engendered in me more scepticism than\r\nany other thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew all this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, because I have had only that kind of benevolence which consists in\r\nlying on a sofa, and cursing the church and clergy for not being\r\nmartyrs and confessors. One can see, you know, very easily, how others\r\nought to be martyrs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are you going to do differently now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod only knows the future,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cI am braver than I was,\r\nbecause I have lost all; and he who has nothing to lose can afford all\r\nrisks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy duty, I hope, to the poor and lowly, as fast as I find it out,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid St. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cbeginning with my own servants, for whom I have yet\r\ndone nothing; and, perhaps, at some future day, it may appear that I\r\ncan do something for a whole class; something to save my country from\r\nthe disgrace of that false position in which she now stands before all\r\ncivilized nations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose it possible that a nation ever will voluntarily\r\nemancipate?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a day of great deeds. Heroism\r\nand disinterestedness are rising up, here and there, in the earth. The\r\nHungarian nobles set free millions of serfs, at an immense pecuniary\r\nloss; and, perhaps, among us may be found generous spirits, who do not\r\nestimate honor and justice by dollars and cents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, suppose we should rise up tomorrow and emancipate, who would\r\neducate these millions, and teach them how to use their freedom? They\r\nnever would rise to do much among us. The fact is, we are too lazy and\r\nunpractical, ourselves, ever to give them much of an idea of that\r\nindustry and energy which is necessary to form them into men. They will\r\nhave to go north, where labor is the fashion,\xe2\x80\x94the universal custom; and\r\ntell me, now, is there enough Christian philanthropy, among your\r\nnorthern states, to bear with the process of their education and\r\nelevation? You send thousands of dollars to foreign missions; but could\r\nyou endure to have the heathen sent into your towns and villages, and\r\ngive your time, and thoughts, and money, to raise them to the Christian\r\nstandard? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to know. If we emancipate, are you willing\r\nto educate? How many families, in your town, would take a negro man and\r\nwoman, teach them, bear with them, and seek to make them Christians?\r\nHow many merchants would take Adolph, if I wanted to make him a clerk;\r\nor mechanics, if I wanted him taught a trade? If I wanted to put Jane\r\nand Rosa to a school, how many schools are there in the northern states\r\nthat would take them in? how many families that would board them? and\r\nyet they are as white as many a woman, north or south. You see, Cousin,\r\nI want justice done us. We are in a bad position. We are the more\r\n_obvious_ oppressors of the negro; but the unchristian prejudice of the\r\nnorth is an oppressor almost equally severe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Cousin, I know it is so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI know it was so\r\nwith me, till I saw that it was my duty to overcome it; but, I trust I\r\nhave overcome it; and I know there are many good people at the north,\r\nwho in this matter need only to be _taught_ what their duty is, to do\r\nit. It would certainly be a greater self-denial to receive heathen\r\namong us, than to send missionaries to them; but I think we would do\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ would, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see anything you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, if you thought it your duty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not uncommonly good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cOthers would, if\r\nthey saw things as I do. I intend to take Topsy home, when I go. I\r\nsuppose our folks will wonder, at first; but I think they will be\r\nbrought to see as I do. Besides, I know there are many people at the\r\nnorth who do exactly what you said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but they are a minority; and, if we should begin to emancipate to\r\nany extent, we should soon hear from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia did not reply. There was a pause of some moments; and St.\r\nClare\xe2\x80\x99s countenance was overcast by a sad, dreamy expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what makes me think of my mother so much, tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a strange kind of feeling, as if she were near me. I keep\r\nthinking of things she used to say. Strange, what brings these past\r\nthings so vividly back to us, sometimes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare walked up and down the room for some minutes more, and then\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down street, a few moments, and hear the news,\r\ntonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took his hat, and passed out.\r\n\r\nTom followed him to the passage, out of the court, and asked if he\r\nshould attend him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be back in an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom sat down in the verandah. It was a beautiful moonlight evening, and\r\nhe sat watching the rising and falling spray of the fountain, and\r\nlistening to its murmur. Tom thought of his home, and that he should\r\nsoon be a free man, and able to return to it at will. He thought how he\r\nshould work to buy his wife and boys. He felt the muscles of his brawny\r\narms with a sort of joy, as he thought they would soon belong to\r\nhimself, and how much they could do to work out the freedom of his\r\nfamily. Then he thought of his noble young master, and, ever second to\r\nthat, came the habitual prayer that he had always offered for him; and\r\nthen his thoughts passed on to the beautiful Eva, whom he now thought\r\nof among the angels; and he thought till he almost fancied that that\r\nbright face and golden hair were looking upon him, out of the spray of\r\nthe fountain. And, so musing, he fell asleep, and dreamed he saw her\r\ncoming bounding towards him, just as she used to come, with a wreath of\r\njessamine in her hair, her cheeks bright, and her eyes radiant with\r\ndelight; but, as he looked, she seemed to rise from the ground; her\r\ncheeks wore a paler hue,\xe2\x80\x94her eyes had a deep, divine radiance, a golden\r\nhalo seemed around her head,\xe2\x80\x94and she vanished from his sight; and Tom\r\nwas awakened by a loud knocking, and a sound of many voices at the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nHe hastened to undo it; and, with smothered voices and heavy tread,\r\ncame several men, bringing a body, wrapped in a cloak, and lying on a\r\nshutter. The light of the lamp fell full on the face; and Tom gave a\r\nwild cry of amazement and despair, that rung through all the galleries,\r\nas the men advanced, with their burden, to the open parlor door, where\r\nMiss Ophelia still sat knitting.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare had turned into a cafe, to look over an evening paper. As he\r\nwas reading, an affray arose between two gentlemen in the room, who\r\nwere both partially intoxicated. St. Clare and one or two others made\r\nan effort to separate them, and St. Clare received a fatal stab in the\r\nside with a bowie-knife, which he was attempting to wrest from one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe house was full of cries and lamentations, shrieks and screams,\r\nservants frantically tearing their hair, throwing themselves on the\r\nground, or running distractedly about, lamenting. Tom and Miss Ophelia\r\nalone seemed to have any presence of mind; for Marie was in strong\r\nhysteric convulsions. At Miss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s direction, one of the lounges\r\nin the parlor was hastily prepared, and the bleeding form laid upon it.\r\nSt. Clare had fainted, through pain and loss of blood; but, as Miss\r\nOphelia applied restoratives, he revived, opened his eyes, looked\r\nfixedly on them, looked earnestly around the room, his eyes travelling\r\nwistfully over every object, and finally they rested on his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nThe physician now arrived, and made his examination. It was evident,\r\nfrom the expression of his face, that there was no hope; but he applied\r\nhimself to dressing the wound, and he and Miss Ophelia and Tom\r\nproceeded composedly with this work, amid the lamentations and sobs and\r\ncries of the affrighted servants, who had clustered about the doors and\r\nwindows of the verandah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the physician, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must turn all these creatures out; all\r\ndepends on his being kept quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Clare opened his eyes, and looked fixedly on the distressed beings,\r\nwhom Miss Ophelia and the doctor were trying to urge from the\r\napartment. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor creatures!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and an expression of bitter\r\nself-reproach passed over his face. Adolph absolutely refused to go.\r\nTerror had deprived him of all presence of mind; he threw himself along\r\nthe floor, and nothing could persuade him to rise. The rest yielded to\r\nMiss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s urgent representations, that their master\xe2\x80\x99s safety\r\ndepended on their stillness and obedience.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare could say but little; he lay with his eyes shut, but it was\r\nevident that he wrestled with bitter thoughts. After a while, he laid\r\nhis hand on Tom\xe2\x80\x99s, who was kneeling beside him, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cTom! poor\r\nfellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am dying!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, pressing his hand; \xe2\x80\x9cpray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would like a clergyman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said the physician.\r\n\r\nSt. Clare hastily shook his head, and said again to Tom, more\r\nearnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cPray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Tom did pray, with all his mind and strength, for the soul that was\r\npassing,\xe2\x80\x94the soul that seemed looking so steadily and mournfully from\r\nthose large, melancholy blue eyes. It was literally prayer offered with\r\nstrong crying and tears.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom ceased to speak, St. Clare reached out and took his hand,\r\nlooking earnestly at him, but saying nothing. He closed his eyes, but\r\nstill retained his hold; for, in the gates of eternity, the black hand\r\nand the white hold each other with an equal clasp. He murmured softly\r\nto himself, at broken intervals,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecordare Jesu pie\xe2\x80\x94\r\n*  *  *  *\r\nNe me perdas\xe2\x80\x94illa die\r\nQu\xc3\xa6rens me\xe2\x80\x94sedisti lassus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the words he had been singing that evening were\r\npassing through his mind,\xe2\x80\x94words of entreaty addressed to Infinite Pity.\r\nHis lips moved at intervals, as parts of the hymn fell brokenly from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis mind is wandering,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! it is coming HOME, at last!\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Clare, energetically; \xe2\x80\x9cat\r\nlast! at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe effort of speaking exhausted him. The sinking paleness of death\r\nfell on him; but with it there fell, as if shed from the wings of some\r\npitying spirit, a beautiful expression of peace, like that of a wearied\r\nchild who sleeps.\r\n\r\nSo he lay for a few moments. They saw that the mighty hand was on him.\r\nJust before the spirit parted, he opened his eyes, with a sudden light,\r\nas of joy and recognition, and said _\xe2\x80\x9cMother!\xe2\x80\x9d_ and then he was gone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\nThe Unprotected\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hear often of the distress of the negro servants, on the loss of a\r\nkind master; and with good reason, for no creature on God\xe2\x80\x99s earth is\r\nleft more utterly unprotected and desolate than the slave in these\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe child who has lost a father has still the protection of friends,\r\nand of the law; he is something, and can do something,\xe2\x80\x94has acknowledged\r\nrights and position; the slave has none. The law regards him, in every\r\nrespect, as devoid of rights as a bale of merchandise. The only\r\npossible acknowledgment of any of the longings and wants of a human and\r\nimmortal creature, which are given to him, comes to him through the\r\nsovereign and irresponsible will of his master; and when that master is\r\nstricken down, nothing remains.\r\n\r\nThe number of those men who know how to use wholly irresponsible power\r\nhumanely and generously is small. Everybody knows this, and the slave\r\nknows it best of all; so that he feels that there are ten chances of\r\nhis finding an abusive and tyrannical master, to one of his finding a\r\nconsiderate and kind one. Therefore is it that the wail over a kind\r\nmaster is loud and long, as well it may be.\r\n\r\nWhen St. Clare breathed his last, terror and consternation took hold of\r\nall his household. He had been stricken down so in a moment, in the\r\nflower and strength of his youth! Every room and gallery of the house\r\nresounded with sobs and shrieks of despair.\r\n\r\nMarie, whose nervous system had been enervated by a constant course of\r\nself-indulgence, had nothing to support the terror of the shock, and,\r\nat the time her husband breathed his last, was passing from one\r\nfainting fit to another; and he to whom she had been joined in the\r\nmysterious tie of marriage passed from her forever, without the\r\npossibility of even a parting word.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia, with characteristic strength and self-control, had\r\nremained with her kinsman to the last,\xe2\x80\x94all eye, all ear, all attention;\r\ndoing everything of the little that could be done, and joining with her\r\nwhole soul in the tender and impassioned prayers which the poor slave\r\nhad poured forth for the soul of his dying master.\r\n\r\nWhen they were arranging him for his last rest, they found upon his\r\nbosom a small, plain miniature case, opening with a spring. It was the\r\nminiature of a noble and beautiful female face; and on the reverse,\r\nunder a crystal, a lock of dark hair. They laid them back on the\r\nlifeless breast,\xe2\x80\x94dust to dust,\xe2\x80\x94poor mournful relics of early dreams,\r\nwhich once made that cold heart beat so warmly!\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s whole soul was filled with thoughts of eternity; and while he\r\nministered around the lifeless clay, he did not once think that the\r\nsudden stroke had left him in hopeless slavery. He felt at peace about\r\nhis master; for in that hour, when he had poured forth his prayer into\r\nthe bosom of his Father, he had found an answer of quietness and\r\nassurance springing up within himself. In the depths of his own\r\naffectionate nature, he felt able to perceive something of the fulness\r\nof Divine love; for an old oracle hath thus written,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHe that dwelleth\r\nin love dwelleth in God, and God in him.\xe2\x80\x9d Tom hoped and trusted, and\r\nwas at peace.\r\n\r\nBut the funeral passed, with all its pageant of black crape, and\r\nprayers, and solemn faces; and back rolled the cool, muddy waves of\r\nevery-day life; and up came the everlasting hard inquiry of \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to\r\nbe done next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt rose to the mind of Marie, as, dressed in loose morning-robes, and\r\nsurrounded by anxious servants, she sat up in a great easy-chair, and\r\ninspected samples of crape and bombazine. It rose to Miss Ophelia, who\r\nbegan to turn her thoughts towards her northern home. It rose, in\r\nsilent terrors, to the minds of the servants, who well knew the\r\nunfeeling, tyrannical character of the mistress in whose hands they\r\nwere left. All knew, very well, that the indulgences which had been\r\naccorded to them were not from their mistress, but from their master;\r\nand that, now he was gone, there would be no screen between them and\r\nevery tyrannous infliction which a temper soured by affliction might\r\ndevise.\r\n\r\nIt was about a fortnight after the funeral, that Miss Ophelia, busied\r\none day in her apartment, heard a gentle tap at the door. She opened\r\nit, and there stood Rosa, the pretty young quadroon, whom we have\r\nbefore often noticed, her hair in disorder, and her eyes swelled with\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Miss Feeley,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, falling on her knees, and catching the\r\nskirt of her dress, \xe2\x80\x9c_do, do go_ to Miss Marie for me! do plead for me!\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to send me out to be whipped\xe2\x80\x94look there!\xe2\x80\x9d And she handed to\r\nMiss Ophelia a paper.\r\n\r\nIt was an order, written in Marie\xe2\x80\x99s delicate Italian hand, to the\r\nmaster of a whipping-establishment to give the bearer fifteen lashes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been doing?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Miss Feely, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got such a bad temper; it\xe2\x80\x99s very bad of me.\r\nI was trying on Miss Marie\xe2\x80\x99s dress, and she slapped my face; and I\r\nspoke out before I thought, and was saucy; and she said that she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbring me down, and have me know, once for all, that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to\r\nbe so topping as I had been; and she wrote this, and says I shall carry\r\nit. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather she\xe2\x80\x99d kill me, right out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia stood considering, with the paper in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Miss Feely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosa, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the whipping so much,\r\nif Miss Marie or you was to do it; but, to be sent to a _man!_ and such\r\na horrid man,\xe2\x80\x94the shame of it, Miss Feely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia well knew that it was the universal custom to send women\r\nand young girls to whipping-houses, to the hands of the lowest of\r\nmen,\xe2\x80\x94men vile enough to make this their profession,\xe2\x80\x94there to be\r\nsubjected to brutal exposure and shameful correction. She had _known_\r\nit before; but hitherto she had never realized it, till she saw the\r\nslender form of Rosa almost convulsed with distress. All the honest\r\nblood of womanhood, the strong New England blood of liberty, flushed to\r\nher cheeks, and throbbed bitterly in her indignant heart; but, with\r\nhabitual prudence and self-control, she mastered herself, and, crushing\r\nthe paper firmly in her hand, she merely said to Rosa,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, child, while I go to your mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShameful! monstrous! outrageous!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, as she was\r\ncrossing the parlor.\r\n\r\nShe found Marie sitting up in her easy-chair, with Mammy standing by\r\nher, combing her hair; Jane sat on the ground before her, busy in\r\nchafing her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you find yourself, today?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\nA deep sigh, and a closing of the eyes, was the only reply, for a\r\nmoment; and then Marie answered, \xe2\x80\x9cO, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Cousin; I suppose\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m as well as I ever shall be!\xe2\x80\x9d and Marie wiped her eyes with a\r\ncambric handkerchief, bordered with an inch deep of black.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, with a short, dry cough, such as commonly\r\nintroduces a difficult subject,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI came to speak with you about poor\r\nRosa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were open wide enough now, and a flush rose to her sallow\r\ncheeks, as she answered, sharply,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what about her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very sorry for her fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is, is she? She\xe2\x80\x99ll be sorrier, before I\xe2\x80\x99ve done with her! I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nendured that child\xe2\x80\x99s impudence long enough; and now I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring her\r\ndown,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll make her lie in the dust!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut could not you punish her some other way,\xe2\x80\x94some way that would be\r\nless shameful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to shame her; that\xe2\x80\x99s just what I want. She has all her life\r\npresumed on her delicacy, and her good looks, and her lady-like airs,\r\ntill she forgets who she is;\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give her one lesson that will\r\nbring her down, I fancy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Cousin, consider that, if you destroy delicacy and a sense of\r\nshame in a young girl, you deprave her very fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelicacy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, with a scornful laugh,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca fine word for such as\r\nshe! I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach her, with all her airs, that she\xe2\x80\x99s no better than the\r\nraggedest black wench that walks the streets! She\xe2\x80\x99ll take no more airs\r\nwith me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will answer to God for such cruelty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, with\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCruelty,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know what the cruelty is! I wrote orders for only\r\nfifteen lashes, and told him to put them on lightly. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno cruelty there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo cruelty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure any girl might rather be\r\nkilled outright!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might seem so to anybody with your feeling; but all these creatures\r\nget used to it; it\xe2\x80\x99s the only way they can be kept in order. Once let\r\nthem feel that they are to take any airs about delicacy, and all that,\r\nand they\xe2\x80\x99ll run all over you, just as my servants always have. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbegun now to bring them under; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have them all to know that I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsend one out to be whipped, as soon as another, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nthemselves!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, looking around her decidedly.\r\n\r\nJane hung her head and cowered at this, for she felt as if it was\r\nparticularly directed to her. Miss Ophelia sat for a moment, as if she\r\nhad swallowed some explosive mixture, and were ready to burst. Then,\r\nrecollecting the utter uselessness of contention with such a nature,\r\nshe shut her lips resolutely, gathered herself up, and walked out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to go back and tell Rosa that she could do nothing for her;\r\nand, shortly after, one of the man-servants came to say that her\r\nmistress had ordered him to take Rosa with him to the whipping-house,\r\nwhither she was hurried, in spite of her tears and entreaties.\r\n\r\nA few days after, Tom was standing musing by the balconies, when he was\r\njoined by Adolph, who, since the death of his master, had been entirely\r\ncrest-fallen and disconsolate. Adolph knew that he had always been an\r\nobject of dislike to Marie; but while his master lived he had paid but\r\nlittle attention to it. Now that he was gone, he had moved about in\r\ndaily dread and trembling, not knowing what might befall him next.\r\nMarie had held several consultations with her lawyer; after\r\ncommunicating with St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s brother, it was determined to sell the\r\nplace, and all the servants, except her own personal property, and\r\nthese she intended to take with her, and go back to her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplantation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo ye know, Tom, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all got to be sold?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adolph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you hear that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hid myself behind the curtains when Missis was talking with the\r\nlawyer. In a few days we shall be sent off to auction, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord\xe2\x80\x99s will be done!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, folding his arms and sighing\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll never get another such a master,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adolph, apprehensively;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99d rather be sold than take my chance under Missis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom turned away; his heart was full. The hope of liberty, the thought\r\nof distant wife and children, rose up before his patient soul, as to\r\nthe mariner shipwrecked almost in port rises the vision of the\r\nchurch-spire and loving roofs of his native village, seen over the top\r\nof some black wave only for one last farewell. He drew his arms tightly\r\nover his bosom, and choked back the bitter tears, and tried to pray.\r\nThe poor old soul had such a singular, unaccountable prejudice in favor\r\nof liberty, that it was a hard wrench for him; and the more he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy will be done,\xe2\x80\x9d the worse he felt.\r\n\r\nHe sought Miss Ophelia, who, ever since Eva\xe2\x80\x99s death, had treated him\r\nwith marked and respectful kindness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Feely,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r St. Clare promised me my freedom. He told\r\nme that he had begun to take it out for me; and now, perhaps, if Miss\r\nFeely would be good enough to speak bout it to Missis, she would feel\r\nlike goin\xe2\x80\x99 on with it, was it as Mas\xe2\x80\x99r St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll speak for you, Tom, and do my best,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, if\r\nit depends on Mrs. St. Clare, I can\xe2\x80\x99t hope much for you;\xe2\x80\x94nevertheless,\r\nI will try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis incident occurred a few days after that of Rosa, while Miss\r\nOphelia was busied in preparations to return north.\r\n\r\nSeriously reflecting within herself, she considered that perhaps she\r\nhad shown too hasty a warmth of language in her former interview with\r\nMarie; and she resolved that she would now endeavor to moderate her\r\nzeal, and to be as conciliatory as possible. So the good soul gathered\r\nherself up, and, taking her knitting, resolved to go into Marie\xe2\x80\x99s room,\r\nbe as agreeable as possible, and negotiate Tom\xe2\x80\x99s case with all the\r\ndiplomatic skill of which she was mistress.\r\n\r\nShe found Marie reclining at length upon a lounge, supporting herself\r\non one elbow by pillows, while Jane, who had been out shopping, was\r\ndisplaying before her certain samples of thin black stuffs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, selecting one; \xe2\x80\x9conly I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about its\r\nbeing properly mourning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, Missis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane, volubly, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. General Derbennon wore just\r\nthis very thing, after the General died, last summer; it makes up\r\nlovely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie to Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of custom, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can judge\r\nabout it better than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a dress in the world that I\r\ncan wear; and, as I am going to break up the establishment, and go off,\r\nnext week, I must decide upon something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s brother has written, and he and the lawyer think that\r\nthe servants and furniture had better be put up at auction, and the\r\nplace left with our lawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I wanted to speak with you about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nOphelia. \xe2\x80\x9cAugustine promised Tom his liberty, and began the legal forms\r\nnecessary to it. I hope you will use your influence to have it\r\nperfected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I shall do no such thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cTom is one of\r\nthe most valuable servants on the place,\xe2\x80\x94it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be afforded, any\r\nway. Besides, what does he want of liberty? He\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal better\r\noff as he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he does desire it, very earnestly, and his master promised it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss Ophelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say he does want it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cthey all want it, just\r\nbecause they are a discontented set,\xe2\x80\x94always wanting what they haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngot. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m principled against emancipating, in any case. Keep a\r\nnegro under the care of a master, and he does well enough, and is\r\nrespectable; but set them free, and they get lazy, and won\xe2\x80\x99t work, and\r\ntake to drinking, and go all down to be mean, worthless fellows, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen it tried, hundreds of times. It\xe2\x80\x99s no favor to set them free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Tom is so steady, industrious, and pious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me! I\xe2\x80\x99ve see a hundred like him. He\xe2\x80\x99ll do very\r\nwell, as long as he\xe2\x80\x99s taken care of,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, then, consider,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you set him up for\r\nsale, the chances of his getting a bad master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, that\xe2\x80\x99s all humbug!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie; \xe2\x80\x9cit isn\xe2\x80\x99t one time in a hundred\r\nthat a good fellow gets a bad master; most masters are good, for all\r\nthe talk that is made. I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived and grown up here, in the South, and\r\nI never yet was acquainted with a master that didn\xe2\x80\x99t treat his servants\r\nwell,\xe2\x80\x94quite as well as is worth while. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel any fears on that\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ophelia, energetically, \xe2\x80\x9cI know it was one of the\r\nlast wishes of your husband that Tom should have his liberty; it was\r\none of the promises that he made to dear little Eva on her death-bed,\r\nand I should not think you would feel at liberty to disregard it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarie had her face covered with her handkerchief at this appeal, and\r\nbegan sobbing and using her smelling-bottle, with great vehemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody goes against me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody is so inconsiderate!\r\nI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have expected that _you_ would bring up all these\r\nremembrances of my troubles to me,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s so inconsiderate! But nobody\r\never does consider,\xe2\x80\x94my trials are so peculiar! It\xe2\x80\x99s so hard, that when\r\nI had only one daughter, she should have been taken!\xe2\x80\x94and when I had a\r\nhusband that just exactly suited me,\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m so hard to be suited!\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nshould be taken! And you seem to have so little feeling for me, and\r\nkeep bringing it up to me so carelessly,\xe2\x80\x94when you know how it overcomes\r\nme! I suppose you mean well; but it is very inconsiderate,\xe2\x80\x94very!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nMarie sobbed, and gasped for breath, and called Mammy to open the\r\nwindow, and to bring her the camphor-bottle, and to bathe her head, and\r\nunhook her dress. And, in the general confusion that ensued, Miss\r\nOphelia made her escape to her apartment.\r\n\r\nShe saw, at once, that it would do no good to say anything more; for\r\nMarie had an indefinite capacity for hysteric fits; and, after this,\r\nwhenever her husband\xe2\x80\x99s or Eva\xe2\x80\x99s wishes with regard to the servants were\r\nalluded to, she always found it convenient to set one in operation.\r\nMiss Ophelia, therefore, did the next best thing she could for Tom,\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwrote a letter to Mrs. Shelby for him, stating his troubles, and urging\r\nthem to send to his relief.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Tom and Adolph, and some half a dozen other servants,\r\nwere marched down to a slave-warehouse, to await the convenience of the\r\ntrader, who was going to make up a lot for auction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\nThe Slave Warehouse\r\n\r\n\r\nA slave warehouse! Perhaps some of my readers conjure up horrible\r\nvisions of such a place. They fancy some foul, obscure den, some\r\nhorrible _Tartarus \xe2\x80\x9cinformis, ingens, cui lumen ademptum.\xe2\x80\x9d_ But no,\r\ninnocent friend; in these days men have learned the art of sinning\r\nexpertly and genteelly, so as not to shock the eyes and senses of\r\nrespectable society. Human property is high in the market; and is,\r\ntherefore, well fed, well cleaned, tended, and looked after, that it\r\nmay come to sale sleek, and strong, and shining. A slave-warehouse in\r\nNew Orleans is a house externally not much unlike many others, kept\r\nwith neatness; and where every day you may see arranged, under a sort\r\nof shed along the outside, rows of men and women, who stand there as a\r\nsign of the property sold within.\r\n\r\nThen you shall be courteously entreated to call and examine, and shall\r\nfind an abundance of husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, fathers,\r\nmothers, and young children, to be \xe2\x80\x9csold separately, or in lots to suit\r\nthe convenience of the purchaser;\xe2\x80\x9d and that soul immortal, once bought\r\nwith blood and anguish by the Son of God, when the earth shook, and the\r\nrocks rent, and the graves were opened, can be sold, leased, mortgaged,\r\nexchanged for groceries or dry goods, to suit the phases of trade, or\r\nthe fancy of the purchaser.\r\n\r\nIt was a day or two after the conversation between Marie and Miss\r\nOphelia, that Tom, Adolph, and about half a dozen others of the St.\r\nClare estate, were turned over to the loving kindness of Mr. Skeggs,\r\nthe keeper of a depot on \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 street, to await the auction, next day.\r\n\r\nTom had with him quite a sizable trunk full of clothing, as had most\r\nothers of them. They were ushered, for the night, into a long room,\r\nwhere many other men, of all ages, sizes, and shades of complexion,\r\nwere assembled, and from which roars of laughter and unthinking\r\nmerriment were proceeding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ha! that\xe2\x80\x99s right. Go it, boys,\xe2\x80\x94go it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Skeggs, the\r\nkeeper. \xe2\x80\x9cMy people are always so merry! Sambo, I see!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nspeaking approvingly to a burly negro who was performing tricks of low\r\nbuffoonery, which occasioned the shouts which Tom had heard.\r\n\r\nAs might be imagined, Tom was in no humor to join these proceedings;\r\nand, therefore, setting his trunk as far as possible from the noisy\r\ngroup, he sat down on it, and leaned his face against the wall.\r\n\r\nThe dealers in the human article make scrupulous and systematic efforts\r\nto promote noisy mirth among them, as a means of drowning reflection,\r\nand rendering them insensible to their condition. The whole object of\r\nthe training to which the negro is put, from the time he is sold in the\r\nnorthern market till he arrives south, is systematically directed\r\ntowards making him callous, unthinking, and brutal. The slave-dealer\r\ncollects his gang in Virginia or Kentucky, and drives them to some\r\nconvenient, healthy place,\xe2\x80\x94often a watering place,\xe2\x80\x94to be fattened. Here\r\nthey are fed full daily; and, because some incline to pine, a fiddle is\r\nkept commonly going among them, and they are made to dance daily; and\r\nhe who refuses to be merry\xe2\x80\x94in whose soul thoughts of wife, or child, or\r\nhome, are too strong for him to be gay\xe2\x80\x94is marked as sullen and\r\ndangerous, and subjected to all the evils which the ill will of an\r\nutterly irresponsible and hardened man can inflict upon him. Briskness,\r\nalertness, and cheerfulness of appearance, especially before observers,\r\nare constantly enforced upon them, both by the hope of thereby getting\r\na good master, and the fear of all that the driver may bring upon them\r\nif they prove unsalable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dat ar nigger doin here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo, coming up to Tom, after Mr.\r\nSkeggs had left the room. Sambo was a full black, of great size, very\r\nlively, voluble, and full of trick and grimace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you doin here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo, coming up to Tom, and poking him\r\nfacetiously in the side. \xe2\x80\x9cMeditatin\xe2\x80\x99, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am to be sold at the auction tomorrow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSold at auction,\xe2\x80\x94haw! haw! boys, an\xe2\x80\x99t this yer fun? I wish\xe2\x80\x99t I was\r\ngwine that ar way!\xe2\x80\x94tell ye, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I make em laugh? But how is\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x94dis yer whole lot gwine tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo, laying his hand\r\nfreely on Adolph\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to let me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Adolph, fiercely, straightening himself\r\nup, with extreme disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw, now, boys! dis yer\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99 yer white niggers,\xe2\x80\x94kind o\xe2\x80\x99 cream\r\ncolor, ye know, scented!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, coming up to Adolph and snuffing. \xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nLor! he\xe2\x80\x99d do for a tobaccer-shop; they could keep him to scent snuff!\r\nLor, he\xe2\x80\x99d keep a whole shope agwine,\xe2\x80\x94he would!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, keep off, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adolph, enraged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, now, how touchy we is,\xe2\x80\x94we white niggers! Look at us now!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nSambo gave a ludicrous imitation of Adolph\xe2\x80\x99s manner; \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s de airs\r\nand graces. We\xe2\x80\x99s been in a good family, I specs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adolph; \xe2\x80\x9cI had a master that could have bought you all for\r\nold truck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, now, only think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gentlemens that we is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI belonged to the St. Clare family,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adolph, proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, you did! Be hanged if they ar\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t lucky to get shet of ye. Spects\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99s gwine to trade ye off with a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 cracked tea-pots and sich\r\nlike!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo, with a provoking grin.\r\n\r\nAdolph, enraged at this taunt, flew furiously at his adversary,\r\nswearing and striking on every side of him. The rest laughed and\r\nshouted, and the uproar brought the keeper to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now, boys? Order,\xe2\x80\x94order!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, coming in and flourishing a\r\nlarge whip.\r\n\r\nAll fled in different directions, except Sambo, who, presuming on the\r\nfavor which the keeper had to him as a licensed wag, stood his ground,\r\nducking his head with a facetious grin, whenever the master made a dive\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, \xe2\x80\x99tan\xe2\x80\x99t us,\xe2\x80\x94we \xe2\x80\x99s reglar stiddy,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s these yer new hands;\r\nthey \xe2\x80\x99s real aggravatin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x94kinder pickin\xe2\x80\x99 at us, all time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe keeper, at this, turned upon Tom and Adolph, and distributing a few\r\nkicks and cuffs without much inquiry, and leaving general orders for\r\nall to be good boys and go to sleep, left the apartment.\r\n\r\nWhile this scene was going on in the men\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping-room, the reader\r\nmay be curious to take a peep at the corresponding apartment allotted\r\nto the women. Stretched out in various attitudes over the floor, he may\r\nsee numberless sleeping forms of every shade of complexion, from the\r\npurest ebony to white, and of all years, from childhood to old age,\r\nlying now asleep. Here is a fine bright girl, of ten years, whose\r\nmother was sold out yesterday, and who tonight cried herself to sleep\r\nwhen nobody was looking at her. Here, a worn old negress, whose thin\r\narms and callous fingers tell of hard toil, waiting to be sold\r\ntomorrow, as a cast-off article, for what can be got for her; and some\r\nforty or fifty others, with heads variously enveloped in blankets or\r\narticles of clothing, lie stretched around them. But, in a corner,\r\nsitting apart from the rest, are two females of a more interesting\r\nappearance than common. One of these is a respectably-dressed mulatto\r\nwoman between forty and fifty, with soft eyes and a gentle and pleasing\r\nphysiognomy. She has on her head a high-raised turban, made of a gay\r\nred Madras handkerchief, of the first quality, her dress is neatly\r\nfitted, and of good material, showing that she has been provided for\r\nwith a careful hand. By her side, and nestling closely to her, is a\r\nyoung girl of fifteen,\xe2\x80\x94her daughter. She is a quadroon, as may be seen\r\nfrom her fairer complexion, though her likeness to her mother is quite\r\ndiscernible. She has the same soft, dark eye, with longer lashes, and\r\nher curling hair is of a luxuriant brown. She also is dressed with\r\ngreat neatness, and her white, delicate hands betray very little\r\nacquaintance with servile toil. These two are to be sold tomorrow, in\r\nthe same lot with the St. Clare servants; and the gentleman to whom\r\nthey belong, and to whom the money for their sale is to be transmitted,\r\nis a member of a Christian church in New York, who will receive the\r\nmoney, and go thereafter to the sacrament of his Lord and theirs, and\r\nthink no more of it.\r\n\r\nThese two, whom we shall call Susan and Emmeline, had been the personal\r\nattendants of an amiable and pious lady of New Orleans, by whom they\r\nhad been carefully and piously instructed and trained. They had been\r\ntaught to read and write, diligently instructed in the truths of\r\nreligion, and their lot had been as happy an one as in their condition\r\nit was possible to be. But the only son of their protectress had the\r\nmanagement of her property; and, by carelessness and extravagance\r\ninvolved it to a large amount, and at last failed. One of the largest\r\ncreditors was the respectable firm of B. & Co., in New York. B. & Co.\r\nwrote to their lawyer in New Orleans, who attached the real estate\r\n(these two articles and a lot of plantation hands formed the most\r\nvaluable part of it), and wrote word to that effect to New York.\r\nBrother B., being, as we have said, a Christian man, and a resident in\r\na free State, felt some uneasiness on the subject. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\ntrading in slaves and souls of men,\xe2\x80\x94of course, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t; but, then,\r\nthere were thirty thousand dollars in the case, and that was rather too\r\nmuch money to be lost for a principle; and so, after much considering,\r\nand asking advice from those that he knew would advise to suit him,\r\nBrother B. wrote to his lawyer to dispose of the business in the way\r\nthat seemed to him the most suitable, and remit the proceeds.\r\n\r\nThe day after the letter arrived in New Orleans, Susan and Emmeline\r\nwere attached, and sent to the depot to await a general auction on the\r\nfollowing morning; and as they glimmer faintly upon us in the moonlight\r\nwhich steals through the grated window, we may listen to their\r\nconversation. Both are weeping, but each quietly, that the other may\r\nnot hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, just lay your head on my lap, and see if you can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep a\r\nlittle,\xe2\x80\x9d says the girl, trying to appear calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t any heart to sleep, Em; I can\xe2\x80\x99t; it\xe2\x80\x99s the last night we may\r\nbe together!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, mother, don\xe2\x80\x99t say so! perhaps we shall get sold together,\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nknows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf \xe2\x80\x99t was anybody\xe2\x80\x99s else case, I should say so, too, Em,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nwoman; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m so feard of losin\xe2\x80\x99 you that I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything but\r\nthe danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, mother, the man said we were both likely, and would sell well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan remembered the man\xe2\x80\x99s looks and words. With a deadly sickness at\r\nher heart, she remembered how he had looked at Emmeline\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and\r\nlifted up her curly hair, and pronounced her a first-rate article.\r\nSusan had been trained as a Christian, brought up in the daily reading\r\nof the Bible, and had the same horror of her child\xe2\x80\x99s being sold to a\r\nlife of shame that any other Christian mother might have; but she had\r\nno hope,\xe2\x80\x94no protection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, I think we might do first rate, if you could get a place as\r\ncook, and I as chambermaid or seamstress, in some family. I dare say we\r\nshall. Let\xe2\x80\x99s both look as bright and lively as we can, and tell all we\r\ncan do, and perhaps we shall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to brush your hair all back straight, tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSusan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for, mother? I don\xe2\x80\x99t look near so well, that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll sell better so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why!\xe2\x80\x9d said the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRespectable families would be more apt to buy you, if they saw you\r\nlooked plain and decent, as if you wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to look handsome. I\r\nknow their ways better \xe2\x80\x99n you do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mother, then I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, Emmeline, if we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever see each other again, after\r\ntomorrow,\xe2\x80\x94if I\xe2\x80\x99m sold way up on a plantation somewhere, and you\r\nsomewhere else,\xe2\x80\x94always remember how you\xe2\x80\x99ve been brought up, and all\r\nMissis has told you; take your Bible with you, and your hymn-book; and\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99re faithful to the Lord, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be faithful to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo speaks the poor soul, in sore discouragement; for she knows that\r\ntomorrow any man, however vile and brutal, however godless and\r\nmerciless, if he only has money to pay for her, may become owner of her\r\ndaughter, body and soul; and then, how is the child to be faithful? She\r\nthinks of all this, as she holds her daughter in her arms, and wishes\r\nthat she were not handsome and attractive. It seems almost an\r\naggravation to her to remember how purely and piously, how much above\r\nthe ordinary lot, she has been brought up. But she has no resort but to\r\n_pray_; and many such prayers to God have gone up from those same trim,\r\nneatly-arranged, respectable slave-prisons,\xe2\x80\x94prayers which God has not\r\nforgotten, as a coming day shall show; for it is written, \xe2\x80\x9cWho causeth\r\none of these little ones to offend, it were better for him that a\r\nmillstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the\r\ndepths of the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soft, earnest, quiet moonbeam looks in fixedly, marking the bars of\r\nthe grated windows on the prostrate, sleeping forms. The mother and\r\ndaughter are singing together a wild and melancholy dirge, common as a\r\nfuneral hymn among the slaves:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, where is weeping Mary?\r\nO, where is weeping Mary?\r\n          \xe2\x80\x99Rived in the goodly land.\r\nShe is dead and gone to Heaven;\r\nShe is dead and gone to Heaven;\r\n          \xe2\x80\x99Rived in the goodly land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThese words, sung by voices of a peculiar and melancholy sweetness, in\r\nan air which seemed like the sighing of earthy despair after heavenly\r\nhope, floated through the dark prison rooms with a pathetic cadence, as\r\nverse after verse was breathed out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, where are Paul and Silas?\r\nO, where are Paul and Silas?\r\n          Gone to the goodly land.\r\nThey are dead and gone to Heaven;\r\nThey are dead and gone to Heaven;\r\n          \xe2\x80\x99Rived in the goodly land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSing on poor souls! The night is short, and the morning will part you\r\nforever!\r\n\r\nBut now it is morning, and everybody is astir; and the worthy Mr.\r\nSkeggs is busy and bright, for a lot of goods is to be fitted out for\r\nauction. There is a brisk lookout on the toilet; injunctions passed\r\naround to every one to put on their best face and be spry; and now all\r\nare arranged in a circle for a last review, before they are marched up\r\nto the Bourse.\r\n\r\nMr. Skeggs, with his palmetto on and his cigar in his mouth, walks\r\naround to put farewell touches on his wares.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, stepping in front of Susan and Emmeline.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your curls, gal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl looked timidly at her mother, who, with the smooth adroitness\r\ncommon among her class, answers,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was telling her, last night, to put up her hair smooth and neat, and\r\nnot havin\xe2\x80\x99 it flying about in curls; looks more respectable so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, peremptorily, turning to the girl; \xe2\x80\x9cyou go\r\nright along, and curl yourself real smart!\xe2\x80\x9d He added, giving a crack to\r\na rattan he held in his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd be back in quick time, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go and help her,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, to the mother. \xe2\x80\x9cThem curls may make a\r\nhundred dollars difference in the sale of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBeneath a splendid dome were men of all nations, moving to and fro,\r\nover the marble pave. On every side of the circular area were little\r\ntribunes, or stations, for the use of speakers and auctioneers. Two of\r\nthese, on opposite sides of the area, were now occupied by brilliant\r\nand talented gentlemen, enthusiastically forcing up, in English and\r\nFrench commingled, the bids of connoisseurs in their various wares. A\r\nthird one, on the other side, still unoccupied, was surrounded by a\r\ngroup, waiting the moment of sale to begin. And here we may recognize\r\nthe St. Clare servants,\xe2\x80\x94Tom, Adolph, and others; and there, too, Susan\r\nand Emmeline, awaiting their turn with anxious and dejected faces.\r\nVarious spectators, intending to purchase, or not intending, examining,\r\nand commenting on their various points and faces with the same freedom\r\nthat a set of jockeys discuss the merits of a horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHulloa, Alf! what brings you here?\xe2\x80\x9d said a young exquisite, slapping\r\nthe shoulder of a sprucely-dressed young man, who was examining Adolph\r\nthrough an eye-glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I was wanting a valet, and I heard that St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s lot was\r\ngoing. I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d just look at his\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch me ever buying any of St. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s people! Spoilt niggers, every\r\none. Impudent as the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear that!\xe2\x80\x9d said the first. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I get \xe2\x80\x99em, I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon have their\r\nairs out of them; they\xe2\x80\x99ll soon find that they\xe2\x80\x99ve another kind of master\r\nto deal with than Monsieur St. Clare. \xe2\x80\x99Pon my word, I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy that\r\nfellow. I like the shape of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find it\xe2\x80\x99ll take all you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep him. He\xe2\x80\x99s deucedly\r\nextravagant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but my lord will find that he _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ be extravagant with _me_.\r\nJust let him be sent to the calaboose a few times, and thoroughly\r\ndressed down! I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you if it don\xe2\x80\x99t bring him to a sense of his\r\nways! O, I\xe2\x80\x99ll reform him, up hill and down,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll see. I buy him,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s flat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom had been standing wistfully examining the multitude of faces\r\nthronging around him, for one whom he would wish to call master. And if\r\nyou should ever be under the necessity, sir, of selecting, out of two\r\nhundred men, one who was to become your absolute owner and disposer,\r\nyou would, perhaps, realize, just as Tom did, how few there were that\r\nyou would feel at all comfortable in being made over to. Tom saw\r\nabundance of men,\xe2\x80\x94great, burly, gruff men; little, chirping, dried men;\r\nlong-favored, lank, hard men; and every variety of stubbed-looking,\r\ncommonplace men, who pick up their fellow-men as one picks up chips,\r\nputting them into the fire or a basket with equal unconcern, according\r\nto their convenience; but he saw no St. Clare.\r\n\r\nA little before the sale commenced, a short, broad, muscular man, in a\r\nchecked shirt considerably open at the bosom, and pantaloons much the\r\nworse for dirt and wear, elbowed his way through the crowd, like one\r\nwho is going actively into a business; and, coming up to the group,\r\nbegan to examine them systematically. From the moment that Tom saw him\r\napproaching, he felt an immediate and revolting horror at him, that\r\nincreased as he came near. He was evidently, though short, of gigantic\r\nstrength. His round, bullet head, large, light-gray eyes, with their\r\nshaggy, sandy eyebrows, and stiff, wiry, sun-burned hair, were rather\r\nunprepossessing items, it is to be confessed; his large, coarse mouth\r\nwas distended with tobacco, the juice of which, from time to time, he\r\nejected from him with great decision and explosive force; his hands\r\nwere immensely large, hairy, sun-burned, freckled, and very dirty, and\r\ngarnished with long nails, in a very foul condition. This man proceeded\r\nto a very free personal examination of the lot. He seized Tom by the\r\njaw, and pulled open his mouth to inspect his teeth; made him strip up\r\nhis sleeve, to show his muscle; turned him round, made him jump and\r\nspring, to show his paces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was you raised?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, briefly, to these investigations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Kintuck, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, looking about, as if for deliverance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad care of Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s farm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikely story!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, shortly, as he passed on. He paused a\r\nmoment before Dolph; then spitting a discharge of tobacco-juice on his\r\nwell-blacked boots, and giving a contemptuous umph, he walked on. Again\r\nhe stopped before Susan and Emmeline. He put out his heavy, dirty hand,\r\nand drew the girl towards him; passed it over her neck and bust, felt\r\nher arms, looked at her teeth, and then pushed her back against her\r\nmother, whose patient face showed the suffering she had been going\r\nthrough at every motion of the hideous stranger.\r\n\r\nThe girl was frightened, and began to cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop that, you minx!\xe2\x80\x9d said the salesman; \xe2\x80\x9cno whimpering here,\xe2\x80\x94the sale\r\nis going to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d And accordingly the sale begun.\r\n\r\nAdolph was knocked off, at a good sum, to the young gentlemen who had\r\npreviously stated his intention of buying him; and the other servants\r\nof the St. Clare lot went to various bidders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, up with you, boy! d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the auctioneer to Tom.\r\n\r\nTom stepped upon the block, gave a few anxious looks round; all seemed\r\nmingled in a common, indistinct noise,\xe2\x80\x94the clatter of the salesman\r\ncrying off his qualifications in French and English, the quick fire of\r\nFrench and English bids; and almost in a moment came the final thump of\r\nthe hammer, and the clear ring on the last syllable of the word\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cdollars,\xe2\x80\x9d_ as the auctioneer announced his price, and Tom was made\r\nover.\xe2\x80\x94He had a master!\r\n\r\nHe was pushed from the block;\xe2\x80\x94the short, bullet-headed man seizing him\r\nroughly by the shoulder, pushed him to one side, saying, in a harsh\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cStand there, _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom hardly realized anything; but still the bidding went on,\xe2\x80\x94ratting,\r\nclattering, now French, now English. Down goes the hammer again,\xe2\x80\x94Susan\r\nis sold! She goes down from the block, stops, looks wistfully back,\xe2\x80\x94her\r\ndaughter stretches her hands towards her. She looks with agony in the\r\nface of the man who has bought her,\xe2\x80\x94a respectable middle-aged man, of\r\nbenevolent countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, please do buy my daughter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to, but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it!\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman,\r\nlooking, with painful interest, as the young girl mounted the block,\r\nand looked around her with a frightened and timid glance.\r\n\r\nThe blood flushes painfully in her otherwise colorless cheek, her eye\r\nhas a feverish fire, and her mother groans to see that she looks more\r\nbeautiful than she ever saw her before. The auctioneer sees his\r\nadvantage, and expatiates volubly in mingled French and English, and\r\nbids rise in rapid succession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything in reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said the benevolent-looking gentleman,\r\npressing in and joining with the bids. In a few moments they have run\r\nbeyond his purse. He is silent; the auctioneer grows warmer; but bids\r\ngradually drop off. It lies now between an aristocratic old citizen and\r\nour bullet-headed acquaintance. The citizen bids for a few turns,\r\ncontemptuously measuring his opponent; but the bullet-head has the\r\nadvantage over him, both in obstinacy and concealed length of purse,\r\nand the controversy lasts but a moment; the hammer falls,\xe2\x80\x94he has got\r\nthe girl, body and soul, unless God help her!\r\n\r\nHer master is Mr. Legree, who owns a cotton plantation on the Red\r\nRiver. She is pushed along into the same lot with Tom and two other\r\nmen, and goes off, weeping as she goes.\r\n\r\nThe benevolent gentleman is sorry; but, then, the thing happens every\r\nday! One sees girls and mothers crying, at these sales, _always!_ it\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, &c.; and he walks off, with his acquisition, in\r\nanother direction.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, the lawyer of the Christian firm of B. & Co., New York,\r\nsend on their money to them. On the reverse of that draft, so obtained,\r\nlet them write these words of the great Paymaster, to whom they shall\r\nmake up their account in a future day: _\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he maketh inquisition for\r\nblood, he forgetteth not the cry of the humble!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\nThe Middle Passage\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look upon\r\niniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and\r\nholdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more\r\nrighteous than he?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94HAB. 1: 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the lower part of a small, mean boat, on the Red River, Tom\r\nsat,\xe2\x80\x94chains on his wrists, chains on his feet, and a weight heavier\r\nthan chains lay on his heart. All had faded from his sky,\xe2\x80\x94moon and\r\nstar; all had passed by him, as the trees and banks were now passing,\r\nto return no more. Kentucky home, with wife and children, and indulgent\r\nowners; St. Clare home, with all its refinements and splendors; the\r\ngolden head of Eva, with its saint-like eyes; the proud, gay, handsome,\r\nseemingly careless, yet ever-kind St. Clare; hours of ease and\r\nindulgent leisure,\xe2\x80\x94all gone! and in place thereof, _what_ remains?\r\n\r\nIt is one of the bitterest apportionments of a lot of slavery, that the\r\nnegro, sympathetic and assimilative, after acquiring, in a refined\r\nfamily, the tastes and feelings which form the atmosphere of such a\r\nplace, is not the less liable to become the bond-slave of the coarsest\r\nand most brutal,\xe2\x80\x94just as a chair or table, which once decorated the\r\nsuperb saloon, comes, at last, battered and defaced, to the barroom of\r\nsome filthy tavern, or some low haunt of vulgar debauchery. The great\r\ndifference is, that the table and chair cannot feel, and the _man_ can;\r\nfor even a legal enactment that he shall be \xe2\x80\x9ctaken, reputed, adjudged\r\nin law, to be a chattel personal,\xe2\x80\x9d cannot blot out his soul, with its\r\nown private little world of memories, hopes, loves, fears, and desires.\r\n\r\nMr. Simon Legree, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s master, had purchased slaves at one place and\r\nanother, in New Orleans, to the number of eight, and driven them,\r\nhandcuffed, in couples of two and two, down to the good steamer Pirate,\r\nwhich lay at the levee, ready for a trip up the Red River.\r\n\r\nHaving got them fairly on board, and the boat being off, he came round,\r\nwith that air of efficiency which ever characterized him, to take a\r\nreview of them. Stopping opposite to Tom, who had been attired for sale\r\nin his best broadcloth suit, with well-starched linen and shining\r\nboots, he briefly expressed himself as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom stood up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake off that stock!\xe2\x80\x9d and, as Tom, encumbered by his fetters,\r\nproceeded to do it, he assisted him, by pulling it, with no gentle\r\nhand, from his neck, and putting it in his pocket.\r\n\r\nLegree now turned to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s trunk, which, previous to this, he had been\r\nransacking, and, taking from it a pair of old pantaloons and\r\ndilapidated coat, which Tom had been wont to put on about his\r\nstable-work, he said, liberating Tom\xe2\x80\x99s hands from the handcuffs, and\r\npointing to a recess in among the boxes,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go there, and put these on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom obeyed, and in a few moments returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake off your boots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Legree.\r\n\r\nTom did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the former, throwing him a pair of coarse, stout shoes,\r\nsuch as were common among the slaves, \xe2\x80\x9cput these on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn Tom\xe2\x80\x99s hurried exchange, he had not forgotten to transfer his\r\ncherished Bible to his pocket. It was well he did so; for Mr. Legree,\r\nhaving refitted Tom\xe2\x80\x99s handcuffs, proceeded deliberately to investigate\r\nthe contents of his pockets. He drew out a silk handkerchief, and put\r\nit into his own pocket. Several little trifles, which Tom had\r\ntreasured, chiefly because they had amused Eva, he looked upon with a\r\ncontemptuous grunt, and tossed them over his shoulder into the river.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s Methodist hymn-book, which, in his hurry, he had forgotten, he\r\nnow held up and turned over.\r\n\r\nHumph! pious, to be sure. So, what\xe2\x80\x99s yer name,\xe2\x80\x94you belong to the\r\nchurch, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon have _that_ out of you. I have none o\xe2\x80\x99 yer bawling,\r\npraying, singing niggers on my place; so remember. Now, mind yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, with a stamp and a fierce glance of his gray eye, directed at\r\nTom, \xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99m_ your church now! You understand,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be as _I_\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething within the silent black man answered _No!_ and, as if\r\nrepeated by an invisible voice, came the words of an old prophetic\r\nscroll, as Eva had often read them to him,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFear not! for I have\r\nredeemed thee. I have called thee by name. Thou art MINE!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Simon Legree heard no voice. That voice is one he never shall hear.\r\nHe only glared for a moment on the downcast face of Tom, and walked\r\noff. He took Tom\xe2\x80\x99s trunk, which contained a very neat and abundant\r\nwardrobe, to the forecastle, where it was soon surrounded by various\r\nhands of the boat. With much laughing, at the expense of niggers who\r\ntried to be gentlemen, the articles very readily were sold to one and\r\nanother, and the empty trunk finally put up at auction. It was a good\r\njoke, they all thought, especially to see how Tom looked after his\r\nthings, as they were going this way and that; and then the auction of\r\nthe trunk, that was funnier than all, and occasioned abundant\r\nwitticisms.\r\n\r\nThis little affair being over, Simon sauntered up again to his\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Tom, I\xe2\x80\x99ve relieved you of any extra baggage, you see. Take mighty\r\ngood care of them clothes. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be long enough \xe2\x80\x99fore you get more. I\r\ngo in for making niggers careful; one suit has to do for one year, on\r\nmy place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimon next walked up to the place where Emmeline was sitting, chained\r\nto another woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, chucking her under the chin, \xe2\x80\x9ckeep up your\r\nspirits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe involuntary look of horror, fright and aversion, with which the\r\ngirl regarded him, did not escape his eye. He frowned fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone o\xe2\x80\x99 your shines, gal! you\xe2\x80\x99s got to keep a pleasant face, when I\r\nspeak to ye,\xe2\x80\x94d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear? And you, you old yellow poco moonshine!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, giving a shove to the mulatto woman to whom Emmeline was chained,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you carry that sort of face! You\xe2\x80\x99s got to look chipper, I tell\r\nye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, all on ye,\xe2\x80\x9d he said retreating a pace or two back, \xe2\x80\x9clook at\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x94look at me,\xe2\x80\x94look me right in the eye,\xe2\x80\x94_straight_, now!\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nstamping his foot at every pause.\r\n\r\nAs by a fascination, every eye was now directed to the glaring\r\ngreenish-gray eye of Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, doubling his great, heavy fist into something\r\nresembling a blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s hammer, \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x99ye see this fist? Heft it!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, bringing it down on Tom\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at these yer bones! Well, I\r\ntell ye this yer fist has got as hard as iron _knocking down niggers_.\r\nI never see the nigger, yet, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring down with one crack,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, bringing his fist down so near to the face of Tom that he\r\nwinked and drew back. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t keep none o\xe2\x80\x99 yer cussed overseers; I\r\ndoes my own overseeing; and I tell you things _is_ seen to. You\xe2\x80\x99s every\r\none on ye got to toe the mark, I tell ye; quick,\xe2\x80\x94straight,\xe2\x80\x94the moment I\r\nspeak. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way to keep in with me. Ye won\xe2\x80\x99t find no soft spot in\r\nme, nowhere. So, now, mind yerselves; for I don\xe2\x80\x99t show no mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe women involuntarily drew in their breath, and the whole gang sat\r\nwith downcast, dejected faces. Meanwhile, Simon turned on his heel, and\r\nmarched up to the bar of the boat for a dram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way I begin with my niggers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, to a gentlemanly\r\nman, who had stood by him during his speech. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my system to begin\r\nstrong,\xe2\x80\x94just let \xe2\x80\x99em know what to expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, looking upon him with the curiosity of a\r\nnaturalist studying some out-of-the-way specimen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed. I\xe2\x80\x99m none o\xe2\x80\x99 yer gentlemen planters, with lily fingers, to\r\nslop round and be cheated by some old cuss of an overseer! Just feel of\r\nmy knuckles, now; look at my fist. Tell ye, sir, the flesh on \xe2\x80\x99t has\r\ncome jest like a stone, practising on nigger\xe2\x80\x94feel on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger applied his fingers to the implement in question, and\r\nsimply said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99T is hard enough; and, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cpractice has made your\r\nheart just like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, I may say so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simon, with a hearty laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s as little soft in me as in any one going. Tell you, nobody\r\ncomes it over me! Niggers never gets round me, neither with squalling\r\nnor soft soap,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a fine lot there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simon. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s that Tom, they telled me he was suthin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nuncommon. I paid a little high for him, tendin\xe2\x80\x99 him for a driver and a\r\nmanaging chap; only get the notions out that he\xe2\x80\x99s larnt by bein\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntreated as niggers never ought to be, he\xe2\x80\x99ll do prime! The yellow woman\r\nI got took in on. I rayther think she\xe2\x80\x99s sickly, but I shall put her\r\nthrough for what she\xe2\x80\x99s worth; she may last a year or two. I don\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nfor savin\xe2\x80\x99 niggers. Use up, and buy more, \xe2\x80\x99s my way;-makes you less\r\ntrouble, and I\xe2\x80\x99m quite sure it comes cheaper in the end;\xe2\x80\x9d and Simon\r\nsipped his glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how long do they generally last?\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, donno; \xe2\x80\x99cordin\xe2\x80\x99 as their constitution is. Stout fellers last six\r\nor seven years; trashy ones gets worked up in two or three. I used to,\r\nwhen I fust begun, have considerable trouble fussin\xe2\x80\x99 with \xe2\x80\x99em and\r\ntrying to make \xe2\x80\x99em hold out,\xe2\x80\x94doctorin\xe2\x80\x99 on \xe2\x80\x99em up when they\xe2\x80\x99s sick, and\r\ngivin\xe2\x80\x99 on \xe2\x80\x99em clothes and blankets, and what not, tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to keep \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nall sort o\xe2\x80\x99 decent and comfortable. Law, \xe2\x80\x99t wasn\xe2\x80\x99t no sort o\xe2\x80\x99 use; I\r\nlost money on \xe2\x80\x99em, and \xe2\x80\x99t was heaps o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble. Now, you see, I just\r\nput \xe2\x80\x99em straight through, sick or well. When one nigger\xe2\x80\x99s dead, I buy\r\nanother; and I find it comes cheaper and easier, every way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger turned away, and seated himself beside a gentleman, who\r\nhad been listening to the conversation with repressed uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not take that fellow to be any specimen of Southern\r\nplanters,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hope not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young gentleman, with emphasis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a mean, low, brutal fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet your laws allow him to hold any number of human beings subject\r\nto his absolute will, without even a shadow of protection; and, low as\r\nhe is, you cannot say that there are not many such.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are also many considerate and humane men\r\namong planters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranted,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, in my opinion, it is you\r\nconsiderate, humane men, that are responsible for all the brutality and\r\noutrage wrought by these wretches; because, if it were not for your\r\nsanction and influence, the whole system could not keep foothold for an\r\nhour. If there were no planters except such as that one,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\npointing with his finger to Legree, who stood with his back to them,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe whole thing would go down like a millstone. It is your\r\nrespectability and humanity that licenses and protects his brutality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly have a high opinion of my good nature,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nplanter, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I advise you not to talk quite so loud, as there\r\nare people on board the boat who might not be quite so tolerant to\r\nopinion as I am. You had better wait till I get up to my plantation,\r\nand there you may abuse us all, quite at your leisure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman colored and smiled, and the two were soon busy in a\r\ngame of backgammon. Meanwhile, another conversation was going on in the\r\nlower part of the boat, between Emmeline and the mulatto woman with\r\nwhom she was confined. As was natural, they were exchanging with each\r\nother some particulars of their history.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho did you belong to?\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my Mas\xe2\x80\x99r was Mr. Ellis,\xe2\x80\x94lived on Levee-street. P\xe2\x80\x99raps you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he good to you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMostly, till he tuk sick. He\xe2\x80\x99s lain sick, off and on, more than six\r\nmonths, and been orful oneasy. \xe2\x80\x99Pears like he warnt willin\xe2\x80\x99 to have\r\nnobody rest, day or night; and got so curous, there couldn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody\r\nsuit him. \xe2\x80\x99Pears like he just grew crosser, every day; kep me up nights\r\ntill I got farly beat out, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep awake no longer; and cause\r\nI got to sleep, one night, Lors, he talk so orful to me, and he tell me\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d sell me to just the hardest master he could find; and he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\npromised me my freedom, too, when he died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad you any friends?\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my husband,\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a blacksmith. Mas\xe2\x80\x99r gen\xe2\x80\x99ly hired him out. They\r\ntook me off so quick, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have time to see him; and I\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nfour children. O, dear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, covering her face with her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nIt is a natural impulse, in every one, when they hear a tale of\r\ndistress, to think of something to say by way of consolation. Emmeline\r\nwanted to say something, but she could not think of anything to say.\r\nWhat was there to be said? As by a common consent, they both avoided,\r\nwith fear and dread, all mention of the horrible man who was now their\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nTrue, there is religious trust for even the darkest hour. The mulatto\r\nwoman was a member of the Methodist church, and had an unenlightened\r\nbut very sincere spirit of piety. Emmeline had been educated much more\r\nintelligently,\xe2\x80\x94taught to read and write, and diligently instructed in\r\nthe Bible, by the care of a faithful and pious mistress; yet, would it\r\nnot try the faith of the firmest Christian, to find themselves\r\nabandoned, apparently, of God, in the grasp of ruthless violence? How\r\nmuch more must it shake the faith of Christ\xe2\x80\x99s poor little ones, weak in\r\nknowledge and tender in years!\r\n\r\nThe boat moved on,\xe2\x80\x94freighted with its weight of sorrow,\xe2\x80\x94up the red,\r\nmuddy, turbid current, through the abrupt tortuous windings of the Red\r\nriver; and sad eyes gazed wearily on the steep red-clay banks, as they\r\nglided by in dreary sameness. At last the boat stopped at a small town,\r\nand Legree, with his party, disembarked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\nDark Places\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of\r\ncruelty.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] Ps. 74:20.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrailing wearily behind a rude wagon, and over a ruder road, Tom and\r\nhis associates faced onward.\r\n\r\nIn the wagon was seated Simon Legree and the two women, still fettered\r\ntogether, were stowed away with some baggage in the back part of it,\r\nand the whole company were seeking Legree\xe2\x80\x99s plantation, which lay a\r\ngood distance off.\r\n\r\nIt was a wild, forsaken road, now winding through dreary pine barrens,\r\nwhere the wind whispered mournfully, and now over log causeways,\r\nthrough long cypress swamps, the doleful trees rising out of the slimy,\r\nspongy ground, hung with long wreaths of funeral black moss, while ever\r\nand anon the loathsome form of the mocassin snake might be seen sliding\r\namong broken stumps and shattered branches that lay here and there,\r\nrotting in the water.\r\n\r\nIt is disconsolate enough, this riding, to the stranger, who, with\r\nwell-filled pocket and well-appointed horse, threads the lonely way on\r\nsome errand of business; but wilder, drearier, to the man enthralled,\r\nwhom every weary step bears further from all that man loves and prays\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nSo one should have thought, that witnessed the sunken and dejected\r\nexpression on those dark faces; the wistful, patient weariness with\r\nwhich those sad eyes rested on object after object that passed them in\r\ntheir sad journey.\r\n\r\nSimon rode on, however, apparently well pleased, occasionally pulling\r\naway at a flask of spirit, which he kept in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he turned back and caught a glance at the\r\ndispirited faces behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cStrike up a song, boys,\xe2\x80\x94come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men looked at each other, and the \xe2\x80\x9c_come_\xe2\x80\x9d was repeated, with a\r\nsmart crack of the whip which the driver carried in his hands. Tom\r\nbegan a Methodist hymn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJerusalem, my happy home,\r\n    Name ever dear to me!\r\nWhen shall my sorrows have an end,\r\n    Thy joys when shall\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] _Jerusalem, my happy home_,\xe2\x80\x9d anonymous hymn dating from the latter\r\n part of the sixteenth century, sung to the tune of \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Stephen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Words derive from St. Augustine\xe2\x80\x99s _Meditations_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up, you black cuss!\xe2\x80\x9d roared Legree; \xe2\x80\x9cdid ye think I wanted any o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyer infernal old Methodism? I say, tune up, now, something real\r\nrowdy,\xe2\x80\x94quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the other men struck up one of those unmeaning songs, common\r\namong the slaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r see\xe2\x80\x99d me cotch a coon,\r\n    High boys, high!\r\nHe laughed to split,\xe2\x80\x94d\xe2\x80\x99ye see the moon,\r\n    Ho! ho! ho! boys, ho!\r\nHo! yo! hi\xe2\x80\x94e! _oh!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe singer appeared to make up the song to his own pleasure, generally\r\nhitting on rhyme, without much attempt at reason; and the party took up\r\nthe chorus, at intervals,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo! ho! ho! boys, ho!\r\nHigh\xe2\x80\x94e\xe2\x80\x94oh! high\xe2\x80\x94e\xe2\x80\x94oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was sung very boisterouly, and with a forced attempt at merriment;\r\nbut no wail of despair, no words of impassioned prayer, could have had\r\nsuch a depth of woe in them as the wild notes of the chorus. As if the\r\npoor, dumb heart, threatened,\xe2\x80\x94prisoned,\xe2\x80\x94took refuge in that\r\ninarticulate sanctuary of music, and found there a language in which to\r\nbreathe its prayer to God! There was a prayer in it, which Simon could\r\nnot hear. He only heard the boys singing noisily, and was well pleased;\r\nhe was making them \xe2\x80\x9ckeep up their spirits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my little dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning to Emmeline, and laying his\r\nhand on her shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re almost home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Legree scolded and stormed, Emmeline was terrified; but when he\r\nlaid his hand on her, and spoke as he now did, she felt as if she had\r\nrather he would strike her. The expression of his eyes made her soul\r\nsick, and her flesh creep. Involuntarily she clung closer to the\r\nmulatto woman by her side, as if she were her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t ever wear ear-rings,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking hold of her small ear\r\nwith his coarse fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline, trembling and looking down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a pair, when we get home, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a good girl.\r\nYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be so frightened; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to make you work very hard.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have fine times with me, and live like a lady,\xe2\x80\x94only be a good\r\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLegree had been drinking to that degree that he was inclining to be\r\nvery gracious; and it was about this time that the enclosures of the\r\nplantation rose to view. The estate had formerly belonged to a\r\ngentleman of opulence and taste, who had bestowed some considerable\r\nattention to the adornment of his grounds. Having died insolvent, it\r\nhad been purchased, at a bargain, by Legree, who used it, as he did\r\neverything else, merely as an implement for money-making. The place had\r\nthat ragged, forlorn appearance, which is always produced by the\r\nevidence that the care of the former owner has been left to go to utter\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a smooth-shaven lawn before the house, dotted here and\r\nthere with ornamental shrubs, was now covered with frowsy tangled\r\ngrass, with horseposts set up, here and there, in it, where the turf\r\nwas stamped away, and the ground littered with broken pails, cobs of\r\ncorn, and other slovenly remains. Here and there, a mildewed jessamine\r\nor honeysuckle hung raggedly from some ornamental support, which had\r\nbeen pushed to one side by being used as a horse-post. What once was a\r\nlarge garden was now all grown over with weeds, through which, here and\r\nthere, some solitary exotic reared its forsaken head. What had been a\r\nconservatory had now no window-shades, and on the mouldering shelves\r\nstood some dry, forsaken flower-pots, with sticks in them, whose dried\r\nleaves showed they had once been plants.\r\n\r\nThe wagon rolled up a weedy gravel walk, under a noble avenue of China\r\ntrees, whose graceful forms and ever-springing foliage seemed to be the\r\nonly things there that neglect could not daunt or alter,\xe2\x80\x94like noble\r\nspirits, so deeply rooted in goodness, as to flourish and grow stronger\r\namid discouragement and decay.\r\n\r\nThe house had been large and handsome. It was built in a manner common\r\nat the South; a wide verandah of two stories running round every part\r\nof the house, into which every outer door opened, the lower tier being\r\nsupported by brick pillars.\r\n\r\nBut the place looked desolate and uncomfortable; some windows stopped\r\nup with boards, some with shattered panes, and shutters hanging by a\r\nsingle hinge,\xe2\x80\x94all telling of coarse neglect and discomfort.\r\n\r\nBits of board, straw, old decayed barrels and boxes, garnished the\r\nground in all directions; and three or four ferocious-looking dogs,\r\nroused by the sound of the wagon-wheels, came tearing out, and were\r\nwith difficulty restrained from laying hold of Tom and his companions,\r\nby the effort of the ragged servants who came after them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe see what ye\xe2\x80\x99d get!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, caressing the dogs with grim\r\nsatisfaction, and turning to Tom and his companions. \xe2\x80\x9cYe see what ye\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nget, if ye try to run off. These yer dogs has been raised to track\r\nniggers; and they\xe2\x80\x99d jest as soon chaw one on ye up as eat their supper.\r\nSo, mind yerself! How now, Sambo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, to a ragged fellow, without\r\nany brim to his hat, who was officious in his attentions. \xe2\x80\x9cHow have\r\nthings been going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFust rate, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuimbo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree to another, who was making zealous demonstrations\r\nto attract his attention, \xe2\x80\x9cye minded what I telled ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuess I did, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese two colored men were the two principal hands on the plantation.\r\nLegree had trained them in savageness and brutality as systematically\r\nas he had his bull-dogs; and, by long practice in hardness and cruelty,\r\nbrought their whole nature to about the same range of capacities. It is\r\na common remark, and one that is thought to militate strongly against\r\nthe character of the race, that the negro overseer is always more\r\ntyrannical and cruel than the white one. This is simply saying that the\r\nnegro mind has been more crushed and debased than the white. It is no\r\nmore true of this race than of every oppressed race, the world over.\r\nThe slave is always a tyrant, if he can get a chance to be one.\r\n\r\nLegree, like some potentates we read of in history, governed his\r\nplantation by a sort of resolution of forces. Sambo and Quimbo\r\ncordially hated each other; the plantation hands, one and all,\r\ncordially hated them; and, by playing off one against another, he was\r\npretty sure, through one or the other of the three parties, to get\r\ninformed of whatever was on foot in the place.\r\n\r\nNobody can live entirely without social intercourse; and Legree\r\nencouraged his two black satellites to a kind of coarse familiarity\r\nwith him,\xe2\x80\x94a familiarity, however, at any moment liable to get one or\r\nthe other of them into trouble; for, on the slightest provocation, one\r\nof them always stood ready, at a nod, to be a minister of his vengeance\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nAs they stood there now by Legree, they seemed an apt illustration of\r\nthe fact that brutal men are lower even than animals. Their coarse,\r\ndark, heavy features; their great eyes, rolling enviously on each\r\nother; their barbarous, guttural, half-brute intonation; their\r\ndilapidated garments fluttering in the wind,\xe2\x80\x94were all in admirable\r\nkeeping with the vile and unwholesome character of everything about the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, you Sambo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, \xe2\x80\x9ctake these yer boys down to the\r\nquarters; and here\xe2\x80\x99s a gal I\xe2\x80\x99ve got for _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as he\r\nseparated the mulatto woman from Emmeline, and pushed her towards\r\nhim;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI promised to bring you one, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman gave a start, and drawing back, said, suddenly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r! I left my old man in New Orleans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of that, you\xe2\x80\x94; won\xe2\x80\x99t you want one here? None o\xe2\x80\x99 your words,\xe2\x80\x94go\r\nlong!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, raising his whip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Emmeline, \xe2\x80\x9cyou go in here with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA dark, wild face was seen, for a moment, to glance at the window of\r\nthe house; and, as Legree opened the door, a female voice said\r\nsomething, in a quick, imperative tone. Tom, who was looking, with\r\nanxious interest, after Emmeline, as she went in, noticed this, and\r\nheard Legree answer, angrily, \xe2\x80\x9cYou may hold your tongue! I\xe2\x80\x99ll do as I\r\nplease, for all you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom heard no more; for he was soon following Sambo to the quarters. The\r\nquarters was a little sort of street of rude shanties, in a row, in a\r\npart of the plantation, far off from the house. They had a forlorn,\r\nbrutal, forsaken air. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s heart sunk when he saw them. He had been\r\ncomforting himself with the thought of a cottage, rude, indeed, but one\r\nwhich he might make neat and quiet, and where he might have a shelf for\r\nhis Bible, and a place to be alone out of his laboring hours. He looked\r\ninto several; they were mere rude shells, destitute of any species of\r\nfurniture, except a heap of straw, foul with dirt, spread confusedly\r\nover the floor, which was merely the bare ground, trodden hard by the\r\ntramping of innumerable feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of these will be mine?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, to Sambo, submissively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDunno; ken turn in here, I spose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo; \xe2\x80\x9cspects thar\xe2\x80\x99s room for\r\nanother thar; thar\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty smart heap o\xe2\x80\x99 niggers to each on \xe2\x80\x99em,\r\nnow; sure, I dunno what I \xe2\x80\x99s to do with more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late in the evening when the weary occupants of the shanties\r\ncame flocking home,\xe2\x80\x94men and women, in soiled and tattered garments,\r\nsurly and uncomfortable, and in no mood to look pleasantly on\r\nnew-comers. The small village was alive with no inviting sounds;\r\nhoarse, guttural voices contending at the hand-mills where their morsel\r\nof hard corn was yet to be ground into meal, to fit it for the cake\r\nthat was to constitute their only supper. From the earliest dawn of the\r\nday, they had been in the fields, pressed to work under the driving\r\nlash of the overseers; for it was now in the very heat and hurry of the\r\nseason, and no means was left untried to press every one up to the top\r\nof their capabilities. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d says the negligent lounger; \xe2\x80\x9cpicking\r\ncotton isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard work.\xe2\x80\x9d Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? And it isn\xe2\x80\x99t much inconvenience,\r\neither, to have one drop of water fall on your head; yet the worst\r\ntorture of the inquisition is produced by drop after drop, drop after\r\ndrop, falling moment after moment, with monotonous succession, on the\r\nsame spot; and work, in itself not hard, becomes so, by being pressed,\r\nhour after hour, with unvarying, unrelenting sameness, with not even\r\nthe consciousness of free-will to take from its tediousness. Tom looked\r\nin vain among the gang, as they poured along, for companionable faces.\r\nHe saw only sullen, scowling, imbruted men, and feeble, discouraged\r\nwomen, or women that were not women,\xe2\x80\x94the strong pushing away the\r\nweak,\xe2\x80\x94the gross, unrestricted animal selfishness of human beings, of\r\nwhom nothing good was expected and desired; and who, treated in every\r\nway like brutes, had sunk as nearly to their level as it was possible\r\nfor human beings to do. To a late hour in the night the sound of the\r\ngrinding was protracted; for the mills were few in number compared with\r\nthe grinders, and the weary and feeble ones were driven back by the\r\nstrong, and came on last in their turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo yo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo, coming to the mulatto woman, and throwing down a\r\nbag of corn before her; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a cuss yo name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, Lucy, yo my woman now. Yo grind dis yer corn, and get _my_ supper\r\nbaked, ye har?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI an\xe2\x80\x99t your woman, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t be!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, with the sharp,\r\nsudden courage of despair; \xe2\x80\x9cyou go long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll kick yo, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo, raising his foot threateningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe may kill me, if ye choose,\xe2\x80\x94the sooner the better! Wish\xe2\x80\x99t I was\r\ndead!\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Sambo, you go to spilin\xe2\x80\x99 the hands, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Mas\xe2\x80\x99r o\xe2\x80\x99 you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Quimbo, who was busy at the mill, from which he had viciously\r\ndriven two or three tired women, who were waiting to grind their corn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him ye won\xe2\x80\x99t let the women come to the mills, yo old\r\nnigger!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo. \xe2\x80\x9cYo jes keep to yo own row.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was hungry with his day\xe2\x80\x99s journey, and almost faint for want of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThar, yo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Quimbo, throwing down a coarse bag, which contained a\r\npeck of corn; \xe2\x80\x9cthar, nigger, grab, take car on \xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x94yo won\xe2\x80\x99t get no\r\nmore, _dis_ yer week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom waited till a late hour, to get a place at the mills; and then,\r\nmoved by the utter weariness of two women, whom he saw trying to grind\r\ntheir corn there, he ground for them, put together the decaying brands\r\nof the fire, where many had baked cakes before them, and then went\r\nabout getting his own supper. It was a new kind of work there,\xe2\x80\x94a deed\r\nof charity, small as it was; but it woke an answering touch in their\r\nhearts,\xe2\x80\x94an expression of womanly kindness came over their hard faces;\r\nthey mixed his cake for him, and tended its baking; and Tom sat down by\r\nthe light of the fire, and drew out his Bible,\xe2\x80\x94for he had need for\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Bible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord! han\xe2\x80\x99t seen un since I was in Kentuck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas you raised in Kentuck?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and well raised, too; never \xe2\x80\x99spected to come to dis yer!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe woman, sighing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s dat ar book, any way?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the Bible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws a me! what\xe2\x80\x99s dat?\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo tell! you never hearn on \xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other woman. \xe2\x80\x9cI used to har\r\nMissis a readin\xe2\x80\x99 on \xe2\x80\x99t, sometimes, in Kentuck; but, laws o\xe2\x80\x99 me! we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t har nothin\xe2\x80\x99 here but crackin\xe2\x80\x99 and swarin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead a piece, anyways!\xe2\x80\x9d said the first woman, curiously, seeing Tom\r\nattentively poring over it.\r\n\r\nTom read,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCome unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I\r\nwill give you rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem\xe2\x80\x99s good words, enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman; \xe2\x80\x9cwho says \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI jest wish I know\xe2\x80\x99d whar to find Him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman. \xe2\x80\x9cI would go;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99pears like I never should get rested again. My flesh is fairly sore,\r\nand I tremble all over, every day, and Sambo\xe2\x80\x99s allers a jawin\xe2\x80\x99 at me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99cause I doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pick faster; and nights it\xe2\x80\x99s most midnight \xe2\x80\x99fore I can\r\nget my supper; and den \xe2\x80\x99pears like I don\xe2\x80\x99t turn over and shut my eyes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99fore I hear de horn blow to get up, and at it agin in de mornin\xe2\x80\x99. If I\r\nknew whar de Lor was, I\xe2\x80\x99d tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s here, he\xe2\x80\x99s everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, you an\xe2\x80\x99t gwine to make me believe dat ar! I know de Lord an\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98tan\xe2\x80\x99t no use talking, though. I\xe2\x80\x99s jest gwine\r\nto camp down, and sleep while I ken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe women went off to their cabins, and Tom sat alone, by the\r\nsmouldering fire, that flickered up redly in his face.\r\n\r\nThe silver, fair-browed moon rose in the purple sky, and looked down,\r\ncalm and silent, as God looks on the scene of misery and\r\noppression,\xe2\x80\x94looked calmly on the lone black man, as he sat, with his\r\narms folded, and his Bible on his knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs God HERE?\xe2\x80\x9d Ah, how is it possible for the untaught heart to keep\r\nits faith, unswerving, in the face of dire misrule, and palpable,\r\nunrebuked injustice? In that simple heart waged a fierce conflict; the\r\ncrushing sense of wrong, the foreshadowing, of a whole life of future\r\nmisery, the wreck of all past hopes, mournfully tossing in the soul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsight, like dead corpses of wife, and child, and friend, rising from\r\nthe dark wave, and surging in the face of the half-drowned mariner! Ah,\r\nwas it easy _here_ to believe and hold fast the great password of\r\nChristian faith, that \xe2\x80\x9cGod IS, and is the REWARDER of them that\r\ndiligently seek Him\xe2\x80\x9d?\r\n\r\nTom rose, disconsolate, and stumbled into the cabin that had been\r\nallotted to him. The floor was already strewn with weary sleepers, and\r\nthe foul air of the place almost repelled him; but the heavy night-dews\r\nwere chill, and his limbs weary, and, wrapping about him a tattered\r\nblanket, which formed his only bed-clothing, he stretched himself in\r\nthe straw and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nIn dreams, a gentle voice came over his ear; he was sitting on the\r\nmossy seat in the garden by Lake Pontchartrain, and Eva, with her\r\nserious eyes bent downward, was reading to him from the Bible; and he\r\nheard her read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and the\r\nrivers they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the\r\nfire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon\r\nthee; for I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGradually the words seemed to melt and fade, as in a divine music; the\r\nchild raised her deep eyes, and fixed them lovingly on him, and rays of\r\nwarmth and comfort seemed to go from them to his heart; and, as if\r\nwafted on the music, she seemed to rise on shining wings, from which\r\nflakes and spangles of gold fell off like stars, and she was gone.\r\n\r\nTom woke. Was it a dream? Let it pass for one. But who shall say that\r\nthat sweet young spirit, which in life so yearned to comfort and\r\nconsole the distressed, was forbidden of God to assume this ministry\r\nafter death?\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful belief,\r\n    That ever round our head\r\nAre hovering, on angel wings,\r\n    The spirits of the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\nCassy\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no\r\ncomforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but\r\nthey had no comforter.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94ECCL. 4:1\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took but a short time to familiarize Tom with all that was to be\r\nhoped or feared in his new way of life. He was an expert and efficient\r\nworkman in whatever he undertook; and was, both from habit and\r\nprinciple, prompt and faithful. Quiet and peaceable in his disposition,\r\nhe hoped, by unremitting diligence, to avert from himself at least a\r\nportion of the evils of his condition. He saw enough of abuse and\r\nmisery to make him sick and weary; but he determined to toil on, with\r\nreligious patience, committing himself to Him that judgeth righteously,\r\nnot without hope that some way of escape might yet be opened to him.\r\n\r\nLegree took a silent note of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s availability. He rated him as a\r\nfirst-class hand; and yet he felt a secret dislike to him,\xe2\x80\x94the native\r\nantipathy of bad to good. He saw, plainly, that when, as was often the\r\ncase, his violence and brutality fell on the helpless, Tom took notice\r\nof it; for, so subtle is the atmosphere of opinion, that it will make\r\nitself felt, without words; and the opinion even of a slave may annoy a\r\nmaster. Tom in various ways manifested a tenderness of feeling, a\r\ncommiseration for his fellow-sufferers, strange and new to them, which\r\nwas watched with a jealous eye by Legree. He had purchased Tom with a\r\nview of eventually making him a sort of overseer, with whom he might,\r\nat times, intrust his affairs, in short absences; and, in his view, the\r\nfirst, second, and third requisite for that place, was _hardness_.\r\nLegree made up his mind, that, as Tom was not hard to his hand, he\r\nwould harden him forthwith; and some few weeks after Tom had been on\r\nthe place, he determined to commence the process.\r\n\r\nOne morning, when the hands were mustered for the field, Tom noticed,\r\nwith surprise, a new comer among them, whose appearance excited his\r\nattention. It was a woman, tall and slenderly formed, with remarkably\r\ndelicate hands and feet, and dressed in neat and respectable garments.\r\nBy the appearance of her face, she might have been between thirty-five\r\nand forty; and it was a face that, once seen, could never be\r\nforgotten,\xe2\x80\x94one of those that, at a glance, seem to convey to us an idea\r\nof a wild, painful, and romantic history. Her forehead was high, and\r\nher eyebrows marked with beautiful clearness. Her straight, well-formed\r\nnose, her finely-cut mouth, and the graceful contour of her head and\r\nneck, showed that she must once have been beautiful; but her face was\r\ndeeply wrinkled with lines of pain, and of proud and bitter endurance.\r\nHer complexion was sallow and unhealthy, her cheeks thin, her features\r\nsharp, and her whole form emaciated. But her eye was the most\r\nremarkable feature,\xe2\x80\x94so large, so heavily black, overshadowed by long\r\nlashes of equal darkness, and so wildly, mournfully despairing. There\r\nwas a fierce pride and defiance in every line of her face, in every\r\ncurve of the flexible lip, in every motion of her body; but in her eye\r\nwas a deep, settled night of anguish,\xe2\x80\x94an expression so hopeless and\r\nunchanging as to contrast fearfully with the scorn and pride expressed\r\nby her whole demeanor.\r\n\r\nWhere she came from, or who she was, Tom did not know. The first he did\r\nknow, she was walking by his side, erect and proud, in the dim gray of\r\nthe dawn. To the gang, however, she was known; for there was much\r\nlooking and turning of heads, and a smothered yet apparent exultation\r\namong the miserable, ragged, half-starved creatures by whom she was\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot to come to it, at last,\xe2\x80\x94glad of it!\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe! he! he!\xe2\x80\x9d said another; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll know how good it is, Misse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see her work!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonder if she\xe2\x80\x99ll get a cutting up, at night, like the rest of us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to see her down for a flogging, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bound!\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\r\n\r\nThe woman took no notice of these taunts, but walked on, with the same\r\nexpression of angry scorn, as if she heard nothing. Tom had always\r\nlived among refined, and cultivated people, and he felt intuitively,\r\nfrom her air and bearing, that she belonged to that class; but how or\r\nwhy she could be fallen to those degrading circumstances, he could not\r\ntell. The women neither looked at him nor spoke to him, though, all the\r\nway to the field, she kept close at his side.\r\n\r\nTom was soon busy at his work; but, as the woman was at no great\r\ndistance from him, he often glanced an eye to her, at her work. He saw,\r\nat a glance, that a native adroitness and handiness made the task to\r\nher an easier one than it proved to many. She picked very fast and very\r\nclean, and with an air of scorn, as if she despised both the work and\r\nthe disgrace and humiliation of the circumstances in which she was\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day, Tom was working near the mulatto woman who\r\nhad been bought in the same lot with himself. She was evidently in a\r\ncondition of great suffering, and Tom often heard her praying, as she\r\nwavered and trembled, and seemed about to fall down. Tom silently as he\r\ncame near to her, transferred several handfuls of cotton from his own\r\nsack to hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, looking surprised; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll get you\r\ninto trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then Sambo came up. He seemed to have a special spite against this\r\nwoman; and, flourishing his whip, said, in brutal, guttural tones,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dis yer, Luce,\xe2\x80\x94foolin\xe2\x80\x99 a\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d and, with the word, kicking the woman\r\nwith his heavy cowhide shoe, he struck Tom across the face with his\r\nwhip.\r\n\r\nTom silently resumed his task; but the woman, before at the last point\r\nof exhaustion, fainted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring her to!\xe2\x80\x9d said the driver, with a brutal grin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give\r\nher something better than camphire!\xe2\x80\x9d and, taking a pin from his\r\ncoat-sleeve, he buried it to the head in her flesh. The woman groaned,\r\nand half rose. \xe2\x80\x9cGet up, you beast, and work, will yer, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll show yer\r\na trick more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman seemed stimulated, for a few moments, to an unnatural\r\nstrength, and worked with desperate eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee that you keep to dat ar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cor yer\xe2\x80\x99ll wish yer\xe2\x80\x99s dead\r\ntonight, I reckin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I do now!\xe2\x80\x9d Tom heard her say; and again he heard her say, \xe2\x80\x9cO,\r\nLord, how long! O, Lord, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you help us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the risk of all that he might suffer, Tom came forward again, and\r\nput all the cotton in his sack into the woman\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t! you donno what they\xe2\x80\x99ll do to ye!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can bar it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cbetter \xe2\x80\x99n you;\xe2\x80\x9d and he was at his place\r\nagain. It passed in a moment.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the stranger woman whom we have described, and who had, in\r\nthe course of her work, come near enough to hear Tom\xe2\x80\x99s last words,\r\nraised her heavy black eyes, and fixed them, for a second, on him;\r\nthen, taking a quantity of cotton from her basket, she placed it in\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know nothing about this place,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cor you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ndone that. When you\xe2\x80\x99ve been here a month, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be done helping\r\nanybody; you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it hard enough to take care of your own skin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord forbid, Missis!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, using instinctively to his field\r\ncompanion the respectful form proper to the high bred with whom he had\r\nlived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord never visits these parts,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, bitterly, as she\r\nwent nimbly forward with her work; and again the scornful smile curled\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\nBut the action of the woman had been seen by the driver, across the\r\nfield; and, flourishing his whip, he came up to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! what!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the woman, with an air of triumph, \xe2\x80\x9cYou a\r\nfoolin\xe2\x80\x99? Go along! yer under me now,\xe2\x80\x94mind yourself, or yer\xe2\x80\x99ll cotch\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA glance like sheet-lightning suddenly flashed from those black eyes;\r\nand, facing about, with quivering lip and dilated nostrils, she drew\r\nherself up, and fixed a glance, blazing with rage and scorn, on the\r\ndriver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDog!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9ctouch _me_, if you dare! I\xe2\x80\x99ve power enough, yet, to\r\nhave you torn by the dogs, burnt alive, cut to inches! I\xe2\x80\x99ve only to say\r\nthe word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat de devil you here for, den?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, evidently cowed, and\r\nsullenly retreating a step or two. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t mean no harm, Misse Cassy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your distance, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman. And, in truth, the man\r\nseemed greatly inclined to attend to something at the other end of the\r\nfield, and started off in quick time.\r\n\r\nThe woman suddenly turned to her work, and labored with a despatch that\r\nwas perfectly astonishing to Tom. She seemed to work by magic. Before\r\nthe day was through, her basket was filled, crowded down, and piled,\r\nand she had several times put largely into Tom\xe2\x80\x99s. Long after dusk, the\r\nwhole weary train, with their baskets on their heads, defiled up to the\r\nbuilding appropriated to the storing and weighing the cotton. Legree\r\nwas there, busily conversing with the two drivers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat ar Tom\xe2\x80\x99s gwine to make a powerful deal o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble; kept a puttin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninto Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s basket.\xe2\x80\x94One o\xe2\x80\x99 these yer dat will get all der niggers to\r\nfeelin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99bused, if Masir don\xe2\x80\x99t watch him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey-dey! The black cuss!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get a breakin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nin, won\xe2\x80\x99t he, boys?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth negroes grinned a horrid grin, at this intimation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay! Let Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Legree alone, for breakin\xe2\x80\x99 in! De debil heself\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t beat Mas\xe2\x80\x99r at dat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Quimbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, boys, the best way is to give him the flogging to do, till he\r\ngets over his notions. Break him in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99ll have hard work to get dat out o\xe2\x80\x99 him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll have to come out of him, though!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, as he rolled his\r\ntobacco in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, dar\xe2\x80\x99s Lucy,\xe2\x80\x94de aggravatinest, ugliest wench on de place!\xe2\x80\x9d pursued\r\nSambo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, Sam; I shall begin to think what\xe2\x80\x99s the reason for your\r\nspite agin Lucy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r knows she sot herself up agin Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have me,\r\nwhen he telled her to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d a flogged her into \xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, spitting, \xe2\x80\x9conly there\xe2\x80\x99s such\r\na press o\xe2\x80\x99 work, it don\xe2\x80\x99t seem wuth a while to upset her jist now.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s slender; but these yer slender gals will bear half killin\xe2\x80\x99 to get\r\ntheir own way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, Lucy was real aggravatin\xe2\x80\x99 and lazy, sulkin\xe2\x80\x99 round; wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nnothin,\xe2\x80\x94and Tom he stuck up for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did, eh! Wal, then, Tom shall have the pleasure of flogging her.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be a good practice for him, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t put it on to the gal\r\nlike you devils, neither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, ho! haw! haw! haw!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed both the sooty wretches; and the\r\ndiabolical sounds seemed, in truth, a not unapt expression of the\r\nfiendish character which Legree gave them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, but, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, Tom and Misse Cassy, and dey among \xe2\x80\x99em, filled Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbasket. I ruther guess der weight \xe2\x80\x99s in it, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I do the weighing!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, emphatically.\r\n\r\nBoth the drivers again laughed their diabolical laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cMisse Cassy did her day\xe2\x80\x99s work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe picks like de debil and all his angels!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got \xe2\x80\x99em all in her, I believe!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree; and, growling a\r\nbrutal oath, he proceeded to the weighing-room.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly the weary, dispirited creatures, wound their way into the room,\r\nand, with crouching reluctance, presented their baskets to be weighed.\r\n\r\nLegree noted on a slate, on the side of which was pasted a list of\r\nnames, the amount.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s basket was weighed and approved; and he looked, with an anxious\r\nglance, for the success of the woman he had befriended.\r\n\r\nTottering with weakness, she came forward, and delivered her basket. It\r\nwas of full weight, as Legree well perceived; but, affecting anger, he\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you lazy beast! short again! stand aside, you\xe2\x80\x99ll catch it,\r\npretty soon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman gave a groan of utter despair, and sat down on a board.\r\n\r\nThe person who had been called Misse Cassy now came forward, and, with\r\na haughty, negligent air, delivered her basket. As she delivered it,\r\nLegree looked in her eyes with a sneering yet inquiring glance.\r\n\r\nShe fixed her black eyes steadily on him, her lips moved slightly, and\r\nshe said something in French. What it was, no one knew; but Legree\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface became perfectly demoniacal in its expression, as she spoke; he\r\nhalf raised his hand, as if to strike,\xe2\x80\x94a gesture which she regarded\r\nwith fierce disdain, as she turned and walked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, \xe2\x80\x9ccome here, you Tom. You see, I telled ye I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t buy ye jest for the common work; I mean to promote ye, and make\r\na driver of ye; and tonight ye may jest as well begin to get yer hand\r\nin. Now, ye jest take this yer gal and flog her; ye\xe2\x80\x99ve seen enough on\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nto know how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9chopes Mas\xe2\x80\x99r won\xe2\x80\x99t set me at that.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s what I an\xe2\x80\x99t used to,\xe2\x80\x94never did,\xe2\x80\x94and can\xe2\x80\x99t do, no way possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99ll larn a pretty smart chance of things ye never did know, before\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve done with ye!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, taking up a cowhide, and striking Tom\r\na heavy blow cross the cheek, and following up the infliction by a\r\nshower of blows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he stopped to rest; \xe2\x80\x9cnow, will ye tell me ye can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, putting up his hand, to wipe the blood, that\r\ntrickled down his face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m willin\xe2\x80\x99 to work, night and day, and work\r\nwhile there\xe2\x80\x99s life and breath in me; but this yer thing I can\xe2\x80\x99t feel it\r\nright to do;\xe2\x80\x94and, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, I _never_ shall do it,\xe2\x80\x94_never_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom had a remarkably smooth, soft voice, and a habitually respectful\r\nmanner, that had given Legree an idea that he would be cowardly, and\r\neasily subdued. When he spoke these last words, a thrill of amazement\r\nwent through every one; the poor woman clasped her hands, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nLord!\xe2\x80\x9d and every one involuntarily looked at each other and drew in\r\ntheir breath, as if to prepare for the storm that was about to burst.\r\n\r\nLegree looked stupefied and confounded; but at last burst forth,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\r\nye blasted black beast! tell _me_ ye don\xe2\x80\x99t think it _right_ to do what\r\nI tell ye! What have any of you cussed cattle to do with thinking\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s right? I\xe2\x80\x99ll put a stop to it! Why, what do ye think ye are? May\r\nbe ye think ye\xe2\x80\x99r a gentleman master, Tom, to be a telling your master\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s right, and what ain\xe2\x80\x99t! So you pretend it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong to flog the\r\ngal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cthe poor crittur\xe2\x80\x99s sick and feeble; \xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwould be downright cruel, and it\xe2\x80\x99s what I never will do, nor begin to.\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r, if you mean to kill me, kill me; but, as to my raising my hand\r\nagin any one here, I never shall,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll die first!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom spoke in a mild voice, but with a decision that could not be\r\nmistaken. Legree shook with anger; his greenish eyes glared fiercely,\r\nand his very whiskers seemed to curl with passion; but, like some\r\nferocious beast, that plays with its victim before he devours it, he\r\nkept back his strong impulse to proceed to immediate violence, and\r\nbroke out into bitter raillery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here\xe2\x80\x99s a pious dog, at last, let down among us sinners!\xe2\x80\x94a saint,\r\na gentleman, and no less, to talk to us sinners about our sins!\r\nPowerful holy critter, he must be! Here, you rascal, you make believe\r\nto be so pious,\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t you never hear, out of yer Bible, \xe2\x80\x99Servants,\r\nobey yer masters\xe2\x80\x99? An\xe2\x80\x99t I yer master? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I pay down twelve hundred\r\ndollars, cash, for all there is inside yer old cussed black shell? An\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyer mine, now, body and soul?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, giving Tom a violent kick with\r\nhis heavy boot; \xe2\x80\x9ctell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the very depth of physical suffering, bowed by brutal oppression,\r\nthis question shot a gleam of joy and triumph through Tom\xe2\x80\x99s soul. He\r\nsuddenly stretched himself up, and, looking earnestly to heaven, while\r\nthe tears and blood that flowed down his face mingled, he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! no! no! my soul an\xe2\x80\x99t yours, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r! You haven\xe2\x80\x99t bought it,\xe2\x80\x94ye can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbuy it! It\xe2\x80\x99s been bought and paid for, by one that is able to keep\r\nit;\xe2\x80\x94no matter, no matter, you can\xe2\x80\x99t harm me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, with a sneer; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll see! Here,\r\nSambo, Quimbo, give this dog such a breakin\xe2\x80\x99 in as he won\xe2\x80\x99t get over,\r\nthis month!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two gigantic negroes that now laid hold of Tom, with fiendish\r\nexultation in their faces, might have formed no unapt personification\r\nof powers of darkness. The poor woman screamed with apprehension, and\r\nall rose, as by a general impulse, while they dragged him unresisting\r\nfrom the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\nThe Quadroon\xe2\x80\x99s Story\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd behold the tears of such as are oppressed; and on the side of their\r\noppressors there was power. Wherefore I praised the dead that are\r\nalready dead more than the living that are yet alive.\xe2\x80\x94ECCL. 4:1.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late at night, and Tom lay groaning and bleeding alone, in an\r\nold forsaken room of the gin-house, among pieces of broken machinery,\r\npiles of damaged cotton, and other rubbish which had there accumulated.\r\n\r\nThe night was damp and close, and the thick air swarmed with myriads of\r\nmosquitos, which increased the restless torture of his wounds; whilst a\r\nburning thirst\xe2\x80\x94a torture beyond all others\xe2\x80\x94filled up the uttermost\r\nmeasure of physical anguish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, good Lord! _Do_ look down,\xe2\x80\x94give me the victory!\xe2\x80\x94give me the victory\r\nover all!\xe2\x80\x9d prayed poor Tom, in his anguish.\r\n\r\nA footstep entered the room, behind him, and the light of a lantern\r\nflashed on his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there? O, for the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s massy, please give me some water!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman Cassy\xe2\x80\x94for it was she,\xe2\x80\x94set down her lantern, and, pouring\r\nwater from a bottle, raised his head, and gave him drink. Another and\r\nanother cup were drained, with feverish eagerness.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASSY MINISTERING TO UNCLE TOM AFTER HIS WHIPPING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink all ye want,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI knew how it would be. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nfirst time I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out in the night, carrying water to such as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Missis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, when he had done drinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t call me Missis! I\xe2\x80\x99m a miserable slave, like yourself,\xe2\x80\x94a lower\r\none than you can ever be!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, bitterly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut now,\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\ngoing to the door, and dragging in a small pallaise, over which she had\r\nspread linen cloths wet with cold water, \xe2\x80\x9ctry, my poor fellow, to roll\r\nyourself on to this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStiff with wounds and bruises, Tom was a long time in accomplishing\r\nthis movement; but, when done, he felt a sensible relief from the\r\ncooling application to his wounds.\r\n\r\nThe woman, whom long practice with the victims of brutality had made\r\nfamiliar with many healing arts, went on to make many applications to\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s wounds, by means of which he was soon somewhat relieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, when she had raised his head on a roll of\r\ndamaged cotton, which served for a pillow, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s the best I can do\r\nfor you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom thanked her; and the woman, sitting down on the floor, drew up her\r\nknees, and embracing them with her arms, looked fixedly before her,\r\nwith a bitter and painful expression of countenance. Her bonnet fell\r\nback, and long wavy streams of black hair fell around her singular and\r\nmelancholy-face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use, my poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out, at last, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s of no use,\r\nthis you\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to do. You were a brave fellow,\xe2\x80\x94you had the\r\nright on your side; but it\xe2\x80\x99s all in vain, and out of the question, for\r\nyou to struggle. You are in the devil\xe2\x80\x99s hands;\xe2\x80\x94he is the strongest, and\r\nyou must give up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGive up! and, had not human weakness and physical agony whispered that,\r\nbefore? Tom started; for the bitter woman, with her wild eyes and\r\nmelancholy voice, seemed to him an embodiment of the temptation with\r\nwhich he had been wrestling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord! O Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d he groaned, \xe2\x80\x9chow can I give up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no use calling on the Lord,\xe2\x80\x94he never hears,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman,\r\nsteadily; \xe2\x80\x9cthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t any God, I believe; or, if there is, he\xe2\x80\x99s taken\r\nsides against us. All goes against us, heaven and earth. Everything is\r\npushing us into hell. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom closed his eyes, and shuddered at the dark, atheistic words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, \xe2\x80\x9c_you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it\xe2\x80\x94I do.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been on this place five years, body and soul, under this man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfoot; and I hate him as I do the devil! Here you are, on a lone\r\nplantation, ten miles from any other, in the swamps; not a white person\r\nhere, who could testify, if you were burned alive,\xe2\x80\x94if you were scalded,\r\ncut into inch-pieces, set up for the dogs to tear, or hung up and\r\nwhipped to death. There\xe2\x80\x99s no law here, of God or man, that can do you,\r\nor any one of us, the least good; and, this man! there\xe2\x80\x99s no earthly\r\nthing that he\xe2\x80\x99s too good to do. I could make any one\xe2\x80\x99s hair rise, and\r\ntheir teeth chatter, if I should only tell what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and been\r\nknowing to, here,\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s no use resisting! Did I _want_ to live with\r\nhim? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I a woman delicately bred; and he,\xe2\x80\x94God in heaven! what was\r\nhe, and is he? And yet, I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived with him, these five years, and\r\ncursed every moment of my life,\xe2\x80\x94night and day! And now, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a new\r\none,\xe2\x80\x94a young thing, only fifteen, and she brought up, she says,\r\npiously. Her good mistress taught her to read the Bible; and she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrought her Bible here\xe2\x80\x94to hell with her!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the woman laughed a wild\r\nand doleful laugh, that rung, with a strange, supernatural sound,\r\nthrough the old ruined shed.\r\n\r\nTom folded his hands; all was darkness and horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Jesus! Lord Jesus! have you quite forgot us poor critturs?\xe2\x80\x9d burst\r\nforth, at last;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chelp, Lord, I perish!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman sternly continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are these miserable low dogs you work with, that you should\r\nsuffer on their account? Every one of them would turn against you, the\r\nfirst time they got a chance. They are all of \xe2\x80\x99em as low and cruel to\r\neach other as they can be; there\xe2\x80\x99s no use in your suffering to keep\r\nfrom hurting them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor critturs!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat made \xe2\x80\x99em cruel?\xe2\x80\x94and, if I give out, I\r\nshall get used to \xe2\x80\x99t, and grow, little by little, just like \xe2\x80\x99em! No,\r\nno, Missis! I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost everything,\xe2\x80\x94wife, and children, and home, and a\r\nkind Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x94and he would have set me free, if he\xe2\x80\x99d only lived a week\r\nlonger; I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost everything in _this_ world, and it\xe2\x80\x99s clean gone,\r\nforever,\xe2\x80\x94and now I _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ lose Heaven, too; no, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get to be\r\nwicked, besides all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it can\xe2\x80\x99t be that the Lord will lay sin to our account,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nwoman; \xe2\x80\x9che won\xe2\x80\x99t charge it to us, when we\xe2\x80\x99re forced to it; he\xe2\x80\x99ll charge\r\nit to them that drove us to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that won\xe2\x80\x99t keep us from growing wicked. If I get\r\nto be as hard-hearted as that ar\xe2\x80\x99 Sambo, and as wicked, it won\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nmuch odds to me how I come so; it\xe2\x80\x99s the bein\xe2\x80\x99 so,\xe2\x80\x94that ar\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\ndreadin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman fixed a wild and startled look on Tom, as if a new thought\r\nhad struck her; and then, heavily groaning, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God a\xe2\x80\x99 mercy! you speak the truth! O\xe2\x80\x94O\xe2\x80\x94O!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and, with groans, she\r\nfell on the floor, like one crushed and writhing under the extremity of\r\nmental anguish.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, a while, in which the breathing of both parties\r\ncould be heard, when Tom faintly said, \xe2\x80\x9cO, please, Missis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman suddenly rose up, with her face composed to its usual stern,\r\nmelancholy expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Missis, I saw \xe2\x80\x99em throw my coat in that ar\xe2\x80\x99 corner, and in my\r\ncoat-pocket is my Bible;\xe2\x80\x94if Missis would please get it for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCassy went and got it. Tom opened, at once, to a heavily marked\r\npassage, much worn, of the last scenes in the life of Him by whose\r\nstripes we are healed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Missis would only be so good as read that ar\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s better than\r\nwater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCassy took the book, with a dry, proud air, and looked over the\r\npassage. She then read aloud, in a soft voice, and with a beauty of\r\nintonation that was peculiar, that touching account of anguish and of\r\nglory. Often, as she read, her voice faltered, and sometimes failed her\r\naltogether, when she would stop, with an air of frigid composure, till\r\nshe had mastered herself. When she came to the touching words, \xe2\x80\x9cFather\r\nforgive them, for they know not what they do,\xe2\x80\x9d she threw down the book,\r\nand, burying her face in the heavy masses of her hair, she sobbed\r\naloud, with a convulsive violence.\r\n\r\nTom was weeping, also, and occasionally uttering a smothered\r\nejaculation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we only could keep up to that ar\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit seemed to come so\r\nnatural to him, and we have to fight so hard for \xe2\x80\x99t! O Lord, help us! O\r\nblessed Lord Jesus, do help us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, after a while, \xe2\x80\x9cI can see that, some how, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nquite \xe2\x80\x99bove me in everything; but there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing Missis might learn\r\neven from poor Tom. Ye said the Lord took sides against us, because he\r\nlets us be \xe2\x80\x99bused and knocked round; but ye see what come on his own\r\nSon,\xe2\x80\x94the blessed Lord of Glory,\xe2\x80\x94wan\xe2\x80\x99t he allays poor? and have we, any\r\non us, yet come so low as he come? The Lord han\xe2\x80\x99t forgot us,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsartin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 that ar\xe2\x80\x99. If we suffer with him, we shall also reign,\r\nScripture says; but, if we deny Him, he also will deny us. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\nall suffer?\xe2\x80\x94the Lord and all his? It tells how they was stoned and sawn\r\nasunder, and wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, and was\r\ndestitute, afflicted, tormented. Sufferin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99t no reason to make us\r\nthink the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s turned agin us; but jest the contrary, if only we hold\r\non to him, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give up to sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why does he put us where we can\xe2\x80\x99t help but sin?\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we _can_ help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99ll you do? Tomorrow they\xe2\x80\x99ll be at you\r\nagain. I know \xe2\x80\x99em; I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen all their doings; I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to think of\r\nall they\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you to;\xe2\x80\x94and they\xe2\x80\x99ll make you give out, at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord Jesus!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cyou _will_ take care of my soul? O Lord,\r\ndo!\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t let me give out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard all this crying and praying before;\r\nand yet, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been broken down, and brought under. There\xe2\x80\x99s Emmeline,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s trying to hold on, and you\xe2\x80\x99re trying,\xe2\x80\x94but what use? You must give\r\nup, or be killed by inches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I _will_ die!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cSpin it out as long as they can,\r\nthey can\xe2\x80\x99t help my dying, some time!\xe2\x80\x94and, after that, they can\xe2\x80\x99t do no\r\nmore. I\xe2\x80\x99m clar, I\xe2\x80\x99m set! I _know_ the Lord\xe2\x80\x99ll help me, and bring me\r\nthrough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman did not answer; she sat with her black eyes intently fixed on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay be it\xe2\x80\x99s the way,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured to herself; \xe2\x80\x9cbut those that _have_\r\ngiven up, there\xe2\x80\x99s no hope for them!\xe2\x80\x94none! We live in filth, and grow\r\nloathsome, till we loathe ourselves! And we long to die, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndare to kill ourselves!\xe2\x80\x94No hope! no hope! no hope?\xe2\x80\x94this girl now,\xe2\x80\x94just\r\nas old as I was!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see me now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, speaking to Tom very rapidly; \xe2\x80\x9csee what I\r\nam! Well, I was brought up in luxury; the first I remember is, playing\r\nabout, when I was a child, in splendid parlors,\xe2\x80\x94when I was kept dressed\r\nup like a doll, and company and visitors used to praise me. There was a\r\ngarden opening from the saloon windows; and there I used to play\r\nhide-and-go-seek, under the orange-trees, with my brothers and sisters.\r\nI went to a convent, and there I learned music, French and embroidery,\r\nand what not; and when I was fourteen, I came out to my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfuneral. He died very suddenly, and when the property came to be\r\nsettled, they found that there was scarcely enough to cover the debts;\r\nand when the creditors took an inventory of the property, I was set\r\ndown in it. My mother was a slave woman, and my father had always meant\r\nto set me free; but he had not done it, and so I was set down in the\r\nlist. I\xe2\x80\x99d always known who I was, but never thought much about it.\r\nNobody ever expects that a strong, healthy man is going to die. My\r\nfather was a well man only four hours before he died;\xe2\x80\x94it was one of the\r\nfirst cholera cases in New Orleans. The day after the funeral, my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s wife took her children, and went up to her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplantation. I thought they treated me strangely, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. There\r\nwas a young lawyer who they left to settle the business; and he came\r\nevery day, and was about the house, and spoke very politely to me. He\r\nbrought with him, one day, a young man, whom I thought the handsomest I\r\nhad ever seen. I shall never forget that evening. I walked with him in\r\nthe garden. I was lonesome and full of sorrow, and he was so kind and\r\ngentle to me; and he told me that he had seen me before I went to the\r\nconvent, and that he had loved me a great while, and that he would be\r\nmy friend and protector;\xe2\x80\x94in short, though he didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me, he had\r\npaid two thousand dollars for me, and I was his property,\xe2\x80\x94I became his\r\nwillingly, for I loved him. Loved!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, stopping. \xe2\x80\x9cO, how I\r\n_did_ love that man! How I love him now,\xe2\x80\x94and always shall, while I\r\nbreathe! He was so beautiful, so high, so noble! He put me into a\r\nbeautiful house, with servants, horses, and carriages, and furniture,\r\nand dresses. Everything that money could buy, he gave me; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nset any value on all that,\xe2\x80\x94I only cared for him. I loved him better\r\nthan my God and my own soul, and, if I tried, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do any other\r\nway from what he wanted me to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted only one thing\xe2\x80\x94I did want him to _marry_ me. I thought, if he\r\nloved me as he said he did, and if I was what he seemed to think I was,\r\nhe would be willing to marry me and set me free. But he convinced me\r\nthat it would be impossible; and he told me that, if we were only\r\nfaithful to each other, it was marriage before God. If that is true,\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t I that man\xe2\x80\x99s wife? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I faithful? For seven years, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nstudy every look and motion, and only live and breathe to please him?\r\nHe had the yellow fever, and for twenty days and nights I watched with\r\nhim. I alone,\xe2\x80\x94and gave him all his medicine, and did everything for\r\nhim; and then he called me his good angel, and said I\xe2\x80\x99d saved his life.\r\nWe had two beautiful children. The first was a boy, and we called him\r\nHenry. He was the image of his father,\xe2\x80\x94he had such beautiful eyes, such\r\na forehead, and his hair hung all in curls around it; and he had all\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s spirit, and his talent, too. Little Elise, he said, looked\r\nlike me. He used to tell me that I was the most beautiful woman in\r\nLouisiana, he was so proud of me and the children. He used to love to\r\nhave me dress them up, and take them and me about in an open carriage,\r\nand hear the remarks that people would make on us; and he used to fill\r\nmy ears constantly with the fine things that were said in praise of me\r\nand the children. O, those were happy days! I thought I was as happy as\r\nany one could be; but then there came evil times. He had a cousin come\r\nto New Orleans, who was his particular friend,\xe2\x80\x94he thought all the world\r\nof him;\xe2\x80\x94but, from the first time I saw him, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell why, I\r\ndreaded him; for I felt sure he was going to bring misery on us. He got\r\nHenry to going out with him, and often he would not come home nights\r\ntill two or three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I did not dare say a word; for Henry was so\r\nhigh spirited, I was afraid to. He got him to the gaming-houses; and he\r\nwas one of the sort that, when he once got a going there, there was no\r\nholding back. And then he introduced him to another lady, and I saw\r\nsoon that his heart was gone from me. He never told me, but I saw it,\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nknew it, day after day,\xe2\x80\x94I felt my heart breaking, but I could not say a\r\nword! At this, the wretch offered to buy me and the children of Henry,\r\nto clear off his gambling debts, which stood in the way of his marrying\r\nas he wished;\xe2\x80\x94and _he sold us_. He told me, one day, that he had\r\nbusiness in the country, and should be gone two or three weeks. He\r\nspoke kinder than usual, and said he should come back; but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeceive me. I knew that the time had come; I was just like one turned\r\ninto stone; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak, nor shed a tear. He kissed me and kissed\r\nthe children, a good many times, and went out. I saw him get on his\r\nhorse, and I watched him till he was quite out of sight; and then I\r\nfell down, and fainted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen _he_ came, the cursed wretch! he came to take possession. He told\r\nme that he had bought me and my children; and showed me the papers. I\r\ncursed him before God, and told him I\xe2\x80\x99d die sooner than live with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Just as you please,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98but, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t behave reasonably,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll sell both the children, where you shall never see them again.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\ntold me that he always had meant to have me, from the first time he saw\r\nme; and that he had drawn Henry on, and got him in debt, on purpose to\r\nmake him willing to sell me. That he got him in love with another\r\nwoman; and that I might know, after all that, that he should not give\r\nup for a few airs and tears, and things of that sort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave up, for my hands were tied. He had my children;\xe2\x80\x94whenever I\r\nresisted his will anywhere, he would talk about selling them, and he\r\nmade me as submissive as he desired. O, what a life it was! to live\r\nwith my heart breaking, every day,\xe2\x80\x94to keep on, on, on, loving, when it\r\nwas only misery; and to be bound, body and soul, to one I hated. I used\r\nto love to read to Henry, to play to him, to waltz with him, and sing\r\nto him; but everything I did for this one was a perfect drag,\xe2\x80\x94yet I was\r\nafraid to refuse anything. He was very imperious, and harsh to the\r\nchildren. Elise was a timid little thing; but Henry was bold and\r\nhigh-spirited, like his father, and he had never been brought under, in\r\nthe least, by any one. He was always finding fault, and quarrelling\r\nwith him; and I used to live in daily fear and dread. I tried to make\r\nthe child respectful;\xe2\x80\x94I tried to keep them apart, for I held on to\r\nthose children like death; but it did no good. _He sold both those\r\nchildren_. He took me to ride, one day, and when I came home, they were\r\nnowhere to be found! He told me he had sold them; he showed me the\r\nmoney, the price of their blood. Then it seemed as if all good forsook\r\nme. I raved and cursed,\xe2\x80\x94cursed God and man; and, for a while, I\r\nbelieve, he really was afraid of me. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up so. He told\r\nme that my children were sold, but whether I ever saw their faces\r\nagain, depended on him; and that, if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quiet, they should smart\r\nfor it. Well, you can do anything with a woman, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got her\r\nchildren. He made me submit; he made me be peaceable; he flattered me\r\nwith hopes that, perhaps, he would buy them back; and so things went\r\non, a week or two. One day, I was out walking, and passed by the\r\ncalaboose; I saw a crowd about the gate, and heard a child\xe2\x80\x99s voice,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsuddenly my Henry broke away from two or three men who were holding\r\nhim, and ran, screaming, and caught my dress. They came up to him,\r\nswearing dreadfully; and one man, whose face I shall never forget, told\r\nhim that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get away so; that he was going with him into the\r\ncalaboose, and he\xe2\x80\x99d get a lesson there he\xe2\x80\x99d never forget. I tried to\r\nbeg and plead,\xe2\x80\x94they only laughed; the poor boy screamed and looked into\r\nmy face, and held on to me, until, in tearing him off, they tore the\r\nskirt of my dress half away; and they carried him in, screaming\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Mother! mother! mother!\xe2\x80\x99 There was one man stood there seemed to pity\r\nme. I offered him all the money I had, if he\xe2\x80\x99d only interfere. He shook\r\nhis head, and said that the boy had been impudent and disobedient, ever\r\nsince he bought him; that he was going to break him in, once for all. I\r\nturned and ran; and every step of the way, I thought that I heard him\r\nscream. I got into the house; ran, all out of breath, to the parlor,\r\nwhere I found Butler. I told him, and begged him to go and interfere.\r\nHe only laughed, and told me the boy had got his deserts. He\xe2\x80\x99d got to\r\nbe broken in,\xe2\x80\x94the sooner the better; \xe2\x80\x99what did I expect?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed to me something in my head snapped, at that moment. I felt\r\ndizzy and furious. I remember seeing a great sharp bowie-knife on the\r\ntable; I remember something about catching it, and flying upon him; and\r\nthen all grew dark, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any more,\xe2\x80\x94not for days and days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I came to myself, I was in a nice room,\xe2\x80\x94but not mine. An old\r\nblack woman tended me; and a doctor came to see me, and there was a\r\ngreat deal of care taken of me. After a while, I found that he had gone\r\naway, and left me at this house to be sold; and that\xe2\x80\x99s why they took\r\nsuch pains with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to get well, and hoped I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; but, in spite of me\r\nthe fever went off and I grew healthy, and finally got up. Then, they\r\nmade me dress up, every day; and gentlemen used to come in and stand\r\nand smoke their cigars, and look at me, and ask questions, and debate\r\nmy price. I was so gloomy and silent, that none of them wanted me. They\r\nthreatened to whip me, if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gayer, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t take some pains to\r\nmake myself agreeable. At length, one day, came a gentleman named\r\nStuart. He seemed to have some feeling for me; he saw that something\r\ndreadful was on my heart, and he came to see me alone, a great many\r\ntimes, and finally persuaded me to tell him. He bought me, at last, and\r\npromised to do all he could to find and buy back my children. He went\r\nto the hotel where my Henry was; they told him he had been sold to a\r\nplanter up on Pearl River; that was the last that I ever heard. Then he\r\nfound where my daughter was; an old woman was keeping her. He offered\r\nan immense sum for her, but they would not sell her. Butler found out\r\nthat it was for me he wanted her; and he sent me word that I should\r\nnever have her. Captain Stuart was very kind to me; he had a splendid\r\nplantation, and took me to it. In the course of a year, I had a son\r\nborn. O, that child!\xe2\x80\x94how I loved it! How just like my poor Henry the\r\nlittle thing looked! But I had made up my mind,\xe2\x80\x94yes, I had. I would\r\nnever again let a child live to grow up! I took the little fellow in my\r\narms, when he was two weeks old, and kissed him, and cried over him;\r\nand then I gave him laudanum, and held him close to my bosom, while he\r\nslept to death. How I mourned and cried over it! and who ever dreamed\r\nthat it was anything but a mistake, that had made me give it the\r\nlaudanum? but it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the few things that I\xe2\x80\x99m glad of, now. I am\r\nnot sorry, to this day; he, at least, is out of pain. What better than\r\ndeath could I give him, poor child! After a while, the cholera came,\r\nand Captain Stuart died; everybody died that wanted to live,\xe2\x80\x94and I,\xe2\x80\x94I,\r\nthough I went down to death\xe2\x80\x99s door,\xe2\x80\x94_I lived!_ Then I was sold, and\r\npassed from hand to hand, till I grew faded and wrinkled, and I had a\r\nfever; and then this wretch bought me, and brought me here,\xe2\x80\x94and here I\r\nam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman stopped. She had hurried on through her story, with a wild,\r\npassionate utterance; sometimes seeming to address it to Tom, and\r\nsometimes speaking as in a soliloquy. So vehement and overpowering was\r\nthe force with which she spoke, that, for a season, Tom was beguiled\r\neven from the pain of his wounds, and, raising himself on one elbow,\r\nwatched her as she paced restlessly up and down, her long black hair\r\nswaying heavily about her, as she moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is a God,\xe2\x80\x94a God\r\nthat looks down and sees all these things. May be it\xe2\x80\x99s so. The sisters\r\nin the convent used to tell me of a day of judgment, when everything is\r\ncoming to light;\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t there be vengeance, then!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey think it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, what we suffer,\xe2\x80\x94nothing, what our children\r\nsuffer! It\xe2\x80\x99s all a small matter; yet I\xe2\x80\x99ve walked the streets when it\r\nseemed as if I had misery enough in my one heart to sink the city. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nwished the houses would fall on me, or the stones sink under me. Yes!\r\nand, in the judgment day, I will stand up before God, a witness against\r\nthose that have ruined me and my children, body and soul!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a girl, I thought I was religious; I used to love God and\r\nprayer. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m a lost soul, pursued by devils that torment me day and\r\nnight; they keep pushing me on and on\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, too, some of\r\nthese days!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, clenching her hand, while an insane light\r\nglanced in her heavy black eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send him where he belongs,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nshort way, too,\xe2\x80\x94one of these nights, if they burn me alive for it!\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\nwild, long laugh rang through the deserted room, and ended in a\r\nhysteric sob; she threw herself on the floor, in convulsive sobbing and\r\nstruggles.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, the frenzy fit seemed to pass off; she rose slowly,\r\nand seemed to collect herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I do anything more for you, my poor fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, approaching\r\nwhere Tom lay; \xe2\x80\x9cshall I give you some more water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a graceful and compassionate sweetness in her voice and\r\nmanner, as she said this, that formed a strange contrast with the\r\nformer wildness.\r\n\r\nTom drank the water, and looked earnestly and pitifully into her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Missis, I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d go to him that can give you living waters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to him! Where is he? Who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim that you read of to me,\xe2\x80\x94the Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used to see the picture of him, over the altar, when I was a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Cassy, her dark eyes fixing themselves in an expression of\r\nmournful reverie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, _he isn\xe2\x80\x99t here!_ there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing here, but sin\r\nand long, long, long despair! O!\xe2\x80\x9d She laid her hand on her breast and\r\ndrew in her breath, as if to lift a heavy weight.\r\n\r\nTom looked as if he would speak again; but she cut him short, with a\r\ndecided gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk, my poor fellow. Try to sleep, if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d And, placing\r\nwater in his reach, and making whatever little arrangements for his\r\ncomforts she could, Cassy left the shed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\nThe Tokens\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd slight, withal, may be the things that bring\r\nBack on the heart the weight which it would fling\r\nAside forever; it may be a sound,\r\nA flower, the wind, the ocean, which shall wound,\xe2\x80\x94\r\nStriking the electric chain wherewith we\xe2\x80\x99re darkly bound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_Childe Harold\xe2\x80\x99s Pilgrimage, Can_. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sitting-room of Legree\xe2\x80\x99s establishment was a large, long room, with\r\na wide, ample fireplace. It had once been hung with a showy and\r\nexpensive paper, which now hung mouldering, torn and discolored, from\r\nthe damp walls. The place had that peculiar sickening, unwholesome\r\nsmell, compounded of mingled damp, dirt and decay, which one often\r\nnotices in close old houses. The wall-paper was defaced, in spots, by\r\nslops of beer and wine; or garnished with chalk memorandums, and long\r\nsums footed up, as if somebody had been practising arithmetic there. In\r\nthe fireplace stood a brazier full of burning charcoal; for, though the\r\nweather was not cold, the evenings always seemed damp and chilly in\r\nthat great room; and Legree, moreover, wanted a place to light his\r\ncigars, and heat his water for punch. The ruddy glare of the charcoal\r\ndisplayed the confused and unpromising aspect of the room,\xe2\x80\x94saddles,\r\nbridles, several sorts of harness, riding-whips, overcoats, and various\r\narticles of clothing, scattered up and down the room in confused\r\nvariety; and the dogs, of whom we have before spoken, had encamped\r\nthemselves among them, to suit their own taste and convenience.\r\n\r\nLegree was just mixing himself a tumbler of punch, pouring his hot\r\nwater from a cracked and broken-nosed pitcher, grumbling, as he did so,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlague on that Sambo, to kick up this yer row between me and the new\r\nhands! The fellow won\xe2\x80\x99t be fit to work for a week, now,\xe2\x80\x94right in the\r\npress of the season!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, just like you,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice, behind his chair. It was the woman\r\nCassy, who had stolen upon his soliloquy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah! you she-devil! you\xe2\x80\x99ve come back, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, coolly; \xe2\x80\x9ccome to have my own way, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lie, you jade! I\xe2\x80\x99ll be up to my word. Either behave yourself, or\r\nstay down to the quarters, and fare and work with the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather, ten thousand times,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, \xe2\x80\x9clive in the dirtiest\r\nhole at the quarters, than be under your hoof!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you _are_ under my hoof, for all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning upon her,\r\nwith a savage grin; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s one comfort. So, sit down here on my knee,\r\nmy dear, and hear to reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, laying hold on her wrist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimon Legree, take care!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, with a sharp flash of her\r\neye, a glance so wild and insane in its light as to be almost\r\nappalling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of me, Simon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, deliberately; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve reason to be! But be careful, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the devil in me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last words she whispered in a hissing tone, close to his ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out! I believe, to my soul, you have!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, pushing her\r\nfrom him, and looking uncomfortably at her. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, Cassy,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you be friends with me, as you used to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUsed to!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, bitterly. She stopped short,\xe2\x80\x94a word of choking\r\nfeelings, rising in her heart, kept her silent.\r\n\r\nCassy had always kept over Legree the kind of influence that a strong,\r\nimpassioned woman can ever keep over the most brutal man; but, of late,\r\nshe had grown more and more irritable and restless, under the hideous\r\nyoke of her servitude, and her irritability, at times, broke out into\r\nraving insanity; and this liability made her a sort of object of dread\r\nto Legree, who had that superstitious horror of insane persons which is\r\ncommon to coarse and uninstructed minds. When Legree brought Emmeline\r\nto the house, all the smouldering embers of womanly feeling flashed up\r\nin the worn heart of Cassy, and she took part with the girl; and a\r\nfierce quarrel ensued between her and Legree. Legree, in a fury, swore\r\nshe should be put to field service, if she would not be peaceable.\r\nCassy, with proud scorn, declared she _would_ go to the field. And she\r\nworked there one day, as we have described, to show how perfectly she\r\nscorned the threat.\r\n\r\nLegree was secretly uneasy, all day; for Cassy had an influence over\r\nhim from which he could not free himself. When she presented her basket\r\nat the scales, he had hoped for some concession, and addressed her in a\r\nsort of half conciliatory, half scornful tone; and she had answered\r\nwith the bitterest contempt.\r\n\r\nThe outrageous treatment of poor Tom had roused her still more; and she\r\nhad followed Legree to the house, with no particular intention, but to\r\nupbraid him for his brutality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish, Cassy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d behave yourself decently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ talk about behaving decently! And what have you been doing?\xe2\x80\x94you,\r\nwho haven\xe2\x80\x99t even sense enough to keep from spoiling one of your best\r\nhands, right in the most pressing season, just for your devilish\r\ntemper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a fool, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, to let any such brangle come up,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLegree; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, when the boy set up his will, he had to be broke in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon you won\xe2\x80\x99t break _him_ in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, rising, passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to know if I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t? He\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first nigger that ever came it round me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll break\r\nevery bone in his body, but he _shall_ give up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then the door opened, and Sambo entered. He came forward, bowing,\r\nand holding out something in a paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that, you dog?\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a witch thing, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething that niggers gets from witches. Keeps \xe2\x80\x99em from feelin\xe2\x80\x99 when\r\nthey \xe2\x80\x99s flogged. He had it tied round his neck, with a black string.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLegree, like most godless and cruel men, was superstitious. He took the\r\npaper, and opened it uneasily.\r\n\r\nThere dropped out of it a silver dollar, and a long, shining curl of\r\nfair hair,\xe2\x80\x94hair which, like a living thing, twined itself round\r\nLegree\xe2\x80\x99s fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamnation!\xe2\x80\x9d he screamed, in sudden passion, stamping on the floor, and\r\npulling furiously at the hair, as if it burned him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did this\r\ncome from? Take it off!\xe2\x80\x94burn it up!\xe2\x80\x94burn it up!\xe2\x80\x9d he screamed, tearing\r\nit off, and throwing it into the charcoal. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you bring it to me\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSambo stood, with his heavy mouth wide open, and aghast with wonder;\r\nand Cassy, who was preparing to leave the apartment, stopped, and\r\nlooked at him in perfect amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you bring me any more of your devilish things!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, shaking\r\nhis fist at Sambo, who retreated hastily towards the door; and, picking\r\nup the silver dollar, he sent it smashing through the window-pane, out\r\ninto the darkness.\r\n\r\nSambo was glad to make his escape. When he was gone, Legree seemed a\r\nlittle ashamed of his fit of alarm. He sat doggedly down in his chair,\r\nand began sullenly sipping his tumbler of punch.\r\n\r\nCassy prepared herself for going out, unobserved by him; and slipped\r\naway to minister to poor Tom, as we have already related.\r\n\r\nAnd what was the matter with Legree? and what was there in a simple\r\ncurl of fair hair to appall that brutal man, familiar with every form\r\nof cruelty? To answer this, we must carry the reader backward in his\r\nhistory. Hard and reprobate as the godless man seemed now, there had\r\nbeen a time when he had been rocked on the bosom of a mother,\xe2\x80\x94cradled\r\nwith prayers and pious hymns,\xe2\x80\x94his now seared brow bedewed with the\r\nwaters of holy baptism. In early childhood, a fair-haired woman had led\r\nhim, at the sound of Sabbath bell, to worship and to pray. Far in New\r\nEngland that mother had trained her only son, with long, unwearied\r\nlove, and patient prayers. Born of a hard-tempered sire, on whom that\r\ngentle woman had wasted a world of unvalued love, Legree had followed\r\nin the steps of his father. Boisterous, unruly, and tyrannical, he\r\ndespised all her counsel, and would none of her reproof; and, at an\r\nearly age, broke from her, to seek his fortunes at sea. He never came\r\nhome but once, after; and then, his mother, with the yearning of a\r\nheart that must love something, and has nothing else to love, clung to\r\nhim, and sought, with passionate prayers and entreaties, to win him\r\nfrom a life of sin, to his soul\xe2\x80\x99s eternal good.\r\n\r\nThat was Legree\xe2\x80\x99s day of grace; then good angels called him; then he\r\nwas almost persuaded, and mercy held him by the hand. His heart inly\r\nrelented,\xe2\x80\x94there was a conflict,\xe2\x80\x94but sin got the victory, and he set all\r\nthe force of his rough nature against the conviction of his conscience.\r\nHe drank and swore,\xe2\x80\x94was wilder and more brutal than ever. And, one\r\nnight, when his mother, in the last agony of her despair, knelt at his\r\nfeet, he spurned her from him,\xe2\x80\x94threw her senseless on the floor, and,\r\nwith brutal curses, fled to his ship. The next Legree heard of his\r\nmother was, when, one night, as he was carousing among drunken\r\ncompanions, a letter was put into his hand. He opened it, and a lock of\r\nlong, curling hair fell from it, and twined about his fingers. The\r\nletter told him his mother was dead, and that, dying, she blest and\r\nforgave him.\r\n\r\nThere is a dread, unhallowed necromancy of evil, that turns things\r\nsweetest and holiest to phantoms of horror and affright. That pale,\r\nloving mother,\xe2\x80\x94her dying prayers, her forgiving love,\xe2\x80\x94wrought in that\r\ndemoniac heart of sin only as a damning sentence, bringing with it a\r\nfearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation. Legree burned\r\nthe hair, and burned the letter; and when he saw them hissing and\r\ncrackling in the flame, inly shuddered as he thought of everlasting\r\nfires. He tried to drink, and revel, and swear away the memory; but\r\noften, in the deep night, whose solemn stillness arraigns the bad soul\r\nin forced communion with herself, he had seen that pale mother rising\r\nby his bedside, and felt the soft twining of that hair around his\r\nfingers, till the cold sweat would roll down his face, and he would\r\nspring from his bed in horror. Ye who have wondered to hear, in the\r\nsame evangel, that God is love, and that God is a consuming fire, see\r\nye not how, to the soul resolved in evil, perfect love is the most\r\nfearful torture, the seal and sentence of the direst despair?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlast it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree to himself, as he sipped his liquor; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere did\r\nhe get that? If it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look just like\xe2\x80\x94whoo! I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d forgot\r\nthat. Curse me, if I think there\xe2\x80\x99s any such thing as forgetting\r\nanything, any how,\xe2\x80\x94hang it! I\xe2\x80\x99m lonesome! I mean to call Em. She hates\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94the monkey! I don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll _make_ her come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLegree stepped out into a large entry, which went up stairs, by what\r\nhad formerly been a superb winding staircase; but the passage-way was\r\ndirty and dreary, encumbered with boxes and unsightly litter. The\r\nstairs, uncarpeted, seemed winding up, in the gloom, to nobody knew\r\nwhere! The pale moonlight streamed through a shattered fanlight over\r\nthe door; the air was unwholesome and chilly, like that of a vault.\r\n\r\nLegree stopped at the foot of the stairs, and heard a voice singing. It\r\nseemed strange and ghostlike in that dreary old house, perhaps because\r\nof the already tremulous state of his nerves. Hark! what is it?\r\n\r\nA wild, pathetic voice, chants a hymn common among the slaves:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO there\xe2\x80\x99ll be mourning, mourning, mourning,\r\nO there\xe2\x80\x99ll be mourning, at the judgment-seat of Christ!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlast the girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll choke her.\xe2\x80\x94Em! Em!\xe2\x80\x9d he called,\r\nharshly; but only a mocking echo from the walls answered him. The sweet\r\nvoice still sung on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParents and children there shall part!\r\nParents and children there shall part!\r\n    Shall part to meet no more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd clear and loud swelled through the empty halls the refrain,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO there\xe2\x80\x99ll be mourning, mourning, mourning,\r\nO there\xe2\x80\x99ll be mourning, at the judgment-seat of Christ!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nLegree stopped. He would have been ashamed to tell of it, but large\r\ndrops of sweat stood on his forehead, his heart beat heavy and thick\r\nwith fear; he even thought he saw something white rising and glimmering\r\nin the gloom before him, and shuddered to think what if the form of his\r\ndead mother should suddenly appear to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, as he stumbled back in the\r\nsitting-room, and sat down; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll let that fellow alone, after this!\r\nWhat did I want of his cussed paper? I b\xe2\x80\x99lieve I am bewitched, sure\r\nenough! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been shivering and sweating, ever since! Where did he get\r\nthat hair? It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been _that!_ I burnt _that_ up, I know I\r\ndid! It would be a joke, if hair could rise from the dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh, Legree! that golden tress _was_ charmed; each hair had in it a\r\nspell of terror and remorse for thee, and was used by a mightier power\r\nto bind thy cruel hands from inflicting uttermost evil on the helpless!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, stamping and whistling to the dogs, \xe2\x80\x9cwake up,\r\nsome of you, and keep me company!\xe2\x80\x9d but the dogs only opened one eye at\r\nhim, sleepily, and closed it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have Sambo and Quimbo up here, to sing and dance one of their\r\nhell dances, and keep off these horrid notions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree; and,\r\nputting on his hat, he went on to the verandah, and blew a horn, with\r\nwhich he commonly summoned his two sable drivers.\r\n\r\nLegree was often wont, when in a gracious humor, to get these two\r\nworthies into his sitting-room, and, after warming them up with\r\nwhiskey, amuse himself by setting them to singing, dancing or fighting,\r\nas the humor took him.\r\n\r\nIt was between one and two o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, as Cassy was returning\r\nfrom her ministrations to poor Tom, that she heard the sound of wild\r\nshrieking, whooping, halloing, and singing, from the sitting-room,\r\nmingled with the barking of dogs, and other symptoms of general uproar.\r\n\r\nShe came up on the verandah steps, and looked in. Legree and both the\r\ndrivers, in a state of furious intoxication, were singing, whooping,\r\nupsetting chairs, and making all manner of ludicrous and horrid\r\ngrimaces at each other.\r\n\r\nShe rested her small, slender hand on the window-blind, and looked\r\nfixedly at them;\xe2\x80\x94there was a world of anguish, scorn, and fierce\r\nbitterness, in her black eyes, as she did so. \xe2\x80\x9cWould it be a sin to rid\r\nthe world of such a wretch?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself.\r\n\r\nShe turned hurriedly away, and, passing round to a back door, glided up\r\nstairs, and tapped at Emmeline\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\nEmmeline and Cassy\r\n\r\n\r\nCassy entered the room, and found Emmeline sitting, pale with fear, in\r\nthe furthest corner of it. As she came in, the girl started up\r\nnervously; but, on seeing who it was, rushed forward, and catching her\r\narm, said, \xe2\x80\x9cO Cassy, is it you? I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve come! I was afraid\r\nit was\xe2\x80\x94. O, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a horrid noise there has been, down\r\nstairs, all this evening!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it often enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Cassy! do tell me,\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t we get away from this place? I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare where,\xe2\x80\x94into the swamp among the snakes,\xe2\x80\x94anywhere! _Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ we\r\nget _somewhere_ away from here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowhere, but into our graves,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever try?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen enough of trying and what comes of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to live in the swamps, and gnaw the bark from trees. I\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of snakes! I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have one near me than him,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEmmeline, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere have been a good many here of your opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nyou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay in the swamps,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d be tracked by the dogs, and\r\nbrought back, and then\xe2\x80\x94then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would he do?\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, looking, with breathless interest,\r\ninto her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ he do, you\xe2\x80\x99d better ask,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s learned\r\nhis trade well, among the pirates in the West Indies. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsleep much, if I should tell you things I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen,\xe2\x80\x94things that he tells\r\nof, sometimes, for good jokes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard screams here that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen able to get out of my head for weeks and weeks. There\xe2\x80\x99s a place\r\nway out down by the quarters, where you can see a black, blasted tree,\r\nand the ground all covered with black ashes. Ask anyone what was done\r\nthere, and see if they will dare to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. I hate to think of it. And I tell you, the Lord only\r\nknows what we may see tomorrow, if that poor fellow holds out as he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbegun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrid!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline, every drop of blood receding from her cheeks.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Cassy, do tell me what I shall do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve done. Do the best you can,\xe2\x80\x94do what you must,\xe2\x80\x94and make it up\r\nin hating and cursing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted to make me drink some of his hateful brandy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I hate it so\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better drink,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy. \xe2\x80\x9cI hated it, too; and now I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlive without it. One must have something;\xe2\x80\x94things don\xe2\x80\x99t look so\r\ndreadful, when you take that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother used to tell me never to touch any such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mother_ told you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, with a thrilling and bitter emphasis\r\non the word mother. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat use is it for mothers to say anything? You\r\nare all to be bought and paid for, and your souls belong to whoever\r\ngets you. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way it goes. I say, _drink_ brandy; drink all you\r\ncan, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll make things come easier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Cassy! do pity me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity you!\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t I? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I a daughter,\xe2\x80\x94Lord knows where she is, and\r\nwhose she is, now,\xe2\x80\x94going the way her mother went, before her, I\r\nsuppose, and that her children must go, after her! There\xe2\x80\x99s no end to\r\nthe curse\xe2\x80\x94forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I\xe2\x80\x99d never been born!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline, wringing her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an old wish with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got used to wishing\r\nthat. I\xe2\x80\x99d die, if I dared to,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking out into the darkness,\r\nwith that still, fixed despair which was the habitual expression of her\r\nface when at rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be wicked to kill one\xe2\x80\x99s self,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why,\xe2\x80\x94no wickeder than things we live and do, day after\r\nday. But the sisters told me things, when I was in the convent, that\r\nmake me afraid to die. If it would only be the end of us, why, then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmmeline turned away, and hid her face in her hands.\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation was passing in the chamber, Legree, overcome\r\nwith his carouse, had sunk to sleep in the room below. Legree was not\r\nan habitual drunkard. His coarse, strong nature craved, and could\r\nendure, a continual stimulation, that would have utterly wrecked and\r\ncrazed a finer one. But a deep, underlying spirit of cautiousness\r\nprevented his often yielding to appetite in such measure as to lose\r\ncontrol of himself.\r\n\r\nThis night, however, in his feverish efforts to banish from his mind\r\nthose fearful elements of woe and remorse which woke within him, he had\r\nindulged more than common; so that, when he had discharged his sable\r\nattendants, he fell heavily on a settle in the room, and was sound\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nO! how dares the bad soul to enter the shadowy world of sleep?\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nland whose dim outlines lie so fearfully near to the mystic scene of\r\nretribution! Legree dreamed. In his heavy and feverish sleep, a veiled\r\nform stood beside him, and laid a cold, soft hand upon him. He thought\r\nhe knew who it was; and shuddered, with creeping horror, though the\r\nface was veiled. Then he thought he felt _that hair_ twining round his\r\nfingers; and then, that it slid smoothly round his neck, and tightened\r\nand tightened, and he could not draw his breath; and then he thought\r\nvoices _whispered_ to him,\xe2\x80\x94whispers that chilled him with horror. Then\r\nit seemed to him he was on the edge of a frightful abyss, holding on\r\nand struggling in mortal fear, while dark hands stretched up, and were\r\npulling him over; and Cassy came behind him laughing, and pushed him.\r\nAnd then rose up that solemn veiled figure, and drew aside the veil. It\r\nwas his mother; and she turned away from him, and he fell down, down,\r\ndown, amid a confused noise of shrieks, and groans, and shouts of demon\r\nlaughter,\xe2\x80\x94and Legree awoke.\r\n\r\nCalmly the rosy hue of dawn was stealing into the room. The morning\r\nstar stood, with its solemn, holy eye of light, looking down on the man\r\nof sin, from out the brightening sky. O, with what freshness, what\r\nsolemnity and beauty, is each new day born; as if to say to insensate\r\nman, \xe2\x80\x9cBehold! thou hast one more chance! _Strive_ for immortal glory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThere is no speech nor language where this voice is not heard; but the\r\nbold, bad man heard it not. He woke with an oath and a curse. What to\r\nhim was the gold and purple, the daily miracle of morning! What to him\r\nthe sanctity of the star which the Son of God has hallowed as his own\r\nemblem? Brute-like, he saw without perceiving; and, stumbling forward,\r\npoured out a tumbler of brandy, and drank half of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a h\xe2\x80\x94l of a night!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Cassy, who just then entered\r\nfrom an opposite door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get plenty of the same sort, by and by,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, dryly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, you minx?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find out, one of these days,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cassy, in the same tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow Simon, I\xe2\x80\x99ve one piece of advice to give you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil, you have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy advice is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, steadily, as she began adjusting some\r\nthings about the room, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you let Tom alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat business is \xe2\x80\x99t of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? To be sure, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it should be. If you want to pay\r\ntwelve hundred for a fellow, and use him right up in the press of the\r\nseason, just to serve your own spite, it\xe2\x80\x99s no business of mine, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone what I could for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have? What business have you meddling in my matters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, to be sure. I\xe2\x80\x99ve saved you some thousands of dollars, at\r\ndifferent times, by taking care of your hands,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all the thanks I\r\nget. If your crop comes shorter into market than any of theirs, you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t lose your bet, I suppose? Tompkins won\xe2\x80\x99t lord it over you, I\r\nsuppose,\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99ll pay down your money like a lady, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? I think\r\nI see you doing it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLegree, like many other planters, had but one form of ambition,\xe2\x80\x94to have\r\nin the heaviest crop of the season,\xe2\x80\x94and he had several bets on this\r\nvery present season pending in the next town. Cassy, therefore, with\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s tact, touched the only string that could be made to vibrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him off at what he\xe2\x80\x99s got,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he shall\r\nbeg my pardon, and promise better fashions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he won\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to know _why_, Mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, in the extreme of\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he\xe2\x80\x99s done right, and he knows it, and won\xe2\x80\x99t say he\xe2\x80\x99s done\r\nwrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho a cuss cares what he knows? The nigger shall say what I please,\r\nor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr, you\xe2\x80\x99ll lose your bet on the cotton crop, by keeping him out of the\r\nfield, just at this very press.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he _will_ give up,\xe2\x80\x94course, he will; don\xe2\x80\x99t I know what niggers is?\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll beg like a dog, this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t, Simon; you don\xe2\x80\x99t know this kind. You may kill him by\r\ninches,\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t get the first word of confession out of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x94where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, going out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the waste-room of the gin-house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy.\r\n\r\nLegree, though he talked so stoutly to Cassy, still sallied forth from\r\nthe house with a degree of misgiving which was not common with him. His\r\ndreams of the past night, mingled with Cassy\xe2\x80\x99s prudential suggestions,\r\nconsiderably affected his mind. He resolved that nobody should be\r\nwitness of his encounter with Tom; and determined, if he could not\r\nsubdue him by bullying, to defer his vengeance, to be wreaked in a more\r\nconvenient season.\r\n\r\nThe solemn light of dawn\xe2\x80\x94the angelic glory of the morning-star\xe2\x80\x94had\r\nlooked in through the rude window of the shed where Tom was lying; and,\r\nas if descending on that star-beam, came the solemn words, \xe2\x80\x9cI am the\r\nroot and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nmysterious warnings and intimations of Cassy, so far from discouraging\r\nhis soul, in the end had roused it as with a heavenly call. He did not\r\nknow but that the day of his death was dawning in the sky; and his\r\nheart throbbed with solemn throes of joy and desire, as he thought that\r\nthe wondrous _all_, of which he had often pondered,\xe2\x80\x94the great white\r\nthrone, with its ever radiant rainbow; the white-robed multitude, with\r\nvoices as many waters; the crowns, the palms, the harps,\xe2\x80\x94might all\r\nbreak upon his vision before that sun should set again. And, therefore,\r\nwithout shuddering or trembling, he heard the voice of his persecutor,\r\nas he drew near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, with a contemptuous kick, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you find\r\nyourself? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell yer I could larn yer a thing or two? How do yer\r\nlike it\xe2\x80\x94eh? How did yer whaling agree with yer, Tom? An\xe2\x80\x99t quite so\r\ncrank as ye was last night. Ye couldn\xe2\x80\x99t treat a poor sinner, now, to a\r\nbit of sermon, could ye,\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom answered nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up, you beast!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, kicking him again.\r\n\r\nThis was a difficult matter for one so bruised and faint; and, as Tom\r\nmade efforts to do so, Legree laughed brutally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes ye so spry, this morning, Tom? Cotched cold, may be, last\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom by this time had gained his feet, and was confronting his master\r\nwith a steady, unmoved front.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil, you can!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, looking him over. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t got enough yet. Now, Tom, get right down on yer knees and beg\r\nmy pardon, for yer shines last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom did not move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown, you dog!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, striking him with his riding-whip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r Legree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do it. I did only what I thought was\r\nright. I shall do just so again, if ever the time comes. I never will\r\ndo a cruel thing, come what may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but ye don\xe2\x80\x99t know what may come, Master Tom. Ye think what you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot is something. I tell you \xe2\x80\x99tan\xe2\x80\x99t anything,\xe2\x80\x94nothing \xe2\x80\x99t all. How would\r\nye like to be tied to a tree, and have a slow fire lit up around\r\nye;\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be pleasant,\xe2\x80\x94eh, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cI know ye can do dreadful things; but,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nstretched himself upward and clasped his hands,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut, after ye\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nkilled the body, there an\xe2\x80\x99t no more ye can do. And O, there\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nETERNITY to come, after that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nETERNITY,\xe2\x80\x94the word thrilled through the black man\xe2\x80\x99s soul with light and\r\npower, as he spoke; it thrilled through the sinner\xe2\x80\x99s soul, too, like\r\nthe bite of a scorpion. Legree gnashed on him with his teeth, but rage\r\nkept him silent; and Tom, like a man disenthralled, spoke, in a clear\r\nand cheerful voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r Legree, as ye bought me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a true and faithful servant to\r\nye. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give ye all the work of my hands, all my time, all my\r\nstrength; but my soul I won\xe2\x80\x99t give up to mortal man. I will hold on to\r\nthe Lord, and put his commands before all,\xe2\x80\x94die or live; you may be sure\r\non \xe2\x80\x99t. Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Legree, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a grain afeard to die. I\xe2\x80\x99d as soon die as\r\nnot. Ye may whip me, starve me, burn me,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99ll only send me sooner\r\nwhere I want to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make ye give out, though, \xe2\x80\x99fore I\xe2\x80\x99ve done!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, in a\r\nrage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have _help_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll never do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil\xe2\x80\x99s going to help you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord Almighty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x94n you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, as with one blow of his fist he felled Tom to\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nA cold soft hand fell on Legree\xe2\x80\x99s at this moment. He turned,\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nCassy\xe2\x80\x99s; but the cold soft touch recalled his dream of the night\r\nbefore, and, flashing through the chambers of his brain, came all the\r\nfearful images of the night-watches, with a portion of the horror that\r\naccompanied them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be a fool?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, in French. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him go! Let me alone\r\nto get him fit to be in the field again. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it just as I told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey say the alligator, the rhinoceros, though enclosed in bullet-proof\r\nmail, have each a spot where they are vulnerable; and fierce, reckless,\r\nunbelieving reprobates, have commonly this point in superstitious\r\ndread.\r\n\r\nLegree turned away, determined to let the point go for the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have it your own way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, doggedly, to Cassy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark, ye!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t deal with ye now, because the\r\nbusiness is pressing, and I want all my hands; but I _never_ forget.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll score it against ye, and sometime I\xe2\x80\x99ll have my pay out o\xe2\x80\x99 yer old\r\nblack hide,\xe2\x80\x94mind ye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLegree turned, and went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, looking darkly after him; \xe2\x80\x9cyour reckoning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto come, yet!\xe2\x80\x94My poor fellow, how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord God hath sent his angel, and shut the lion\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, for this\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor this time, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy; \xe2\x80\x9cbut now you\xe2\x80\x99ve got his ill\r\nwill upon you, to follow you day in, day out, hanging like a dog on\r\nyour throat,\xe2\x80\x94sucking your blood, bleeding away your life, drop by drop.\r\nI know the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\nLiberty\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter with what solemnities he may have been devoted upon the\r\naltar of slavery, the moment he touches the sacred soil of Britain, the\r\naltar and the God sink together in the dust, and he stands redeemed,\r\nregenerated, and disenthralled, by the irresistible genius of universal\r\nemancipation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Curran_.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] John Philpot Curran (1750-1817), Irish orator and judge who worked\r\n for Catholic emancipation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA while we must leave Tom in the hands of his persecutors, while we\r\nturn to pursue the fortunes of George and his wife, whom we left in\r\nfriendly hands, in a farmhouse on the road-side.\r\n\r\nTom Loker we left groaning and touzling in a most immaculately clean\r\nQuaker bed, under the motherly supervision of Aunt Dorcas, who found\r\nhim to the full as tractable a patient as a sick bison.\r\n\r\nImagine a tall, dignified, spiritual woman, whose clear muslin cap\r\nshades waves of silvery hair, parted on a broad, clear forehead, which\r\noverarches thoughtful gray eyes. A snowy handkerchief of lisse crape is\r\nfolded neatly across her bosom; her glossy brown silk dress rustles\r\npeacefully, as she glides up and down the chamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom Loker, giving a great throw to the bedclothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must request thee, Thomas, not to use such language,\xe2\x80\x9d says Aunt\r\nDorcas, as she quietly rearranged the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I won\xe2\x80\x99t, granny, if I can help it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is enough\r\nto make a fellow swear,\xe2\x80\x94so cursedly hot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorcas removed a comforter from the bed, straightened the clothes\r\nagain, and tucked them in till Tom looked something like a chrysalis;\r\nremarking, as she did so,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish, friend, thee would leave off cursing and swearing, and think\r\nupon thy ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cshould I think of _them_ for? Last thing\r\never _I_ want to think of\xe2\x80\x94hang it all!\xe2\x80\x9d And Tom flounced over,\r\nuntucking and disarranging everything, in a manner frightful to behold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat fellow and gal are here, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, sullenly, after a\r\npause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorcas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d better be off up to the lake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cthe quicker the\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably they will do so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Dorcas, knitting peacefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hark ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got correspondents in Sandusky, that\r\nwatch the boats for us. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if I tell, now.

Her description\xe2\x80\x99s out in Sandusky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will attend to that matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorcas, with characteristic\r\ncomposure.\r\n\r\nAs we at this place take leave of Tom Loker, we may as well say, that,\r\nhaving lain three weeks at the Quaker dwelling, sick with a rheumatic\r\nfever, which set in, in company with his other afflictions, Tom arose\r\nfrom his bed a somewhat sadder and wiser man; and, in place of\r\nslave-catching, betook himself to life in one of the new settlements,\r\nwhere his talents developed themselves more happily in trapping bears,\r\nwolves, and other inhabitants of the forest, in which he made himself\r\nquite a name in the land. Tom always spoke reverently of the Quakers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNice people,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say; \xe2\x80\x9cwanted to convert me, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nit, exactly. But, tell ye what, stranger, they do fix up a sick fellow\r\nfirst rate,\xe2\x80\x94no mistake. Make jist the tallest kind o\xe2\x80\x99 broth and\r\nknicknacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Tom had informed them that their party would be looked for in\r\nSandusky, it was thought prudent to divide them. Jim, with his old\r\nmother, was forwarded separately; and a night or two after, George and\r\nEliza, with their child, were driven privately into Sandusky, and\r\nlodged beneath a hospital roof, preparatory to taking their last\r\npassage on the lake.\r\n\r\nTheir night was now far spent, and the morning star of liberty rose\r\nfair before them!\xe2\x80\x94electric word! What is it? Is there anything more in\r\nit than a name\xe2\x80\x94a rhetorical flourish? Why, men and women of America,\r\ndoes your heart\xe2\x80\x99s blood thrill at that word, for which your fathers\r\nbled, and your braver mothers were willing that their noblest and best\r\nshould die?\r\n\r\nIs there anything in it glorious and dear for a nation, that is not\r\nalso glorious and dear for a man? What is freedom to a nation, but\r\nfreedom to the individuals in it? What is freedom to that young man,\r\nwho sits there, with his arms folded over his broad chest, the tint of\r\nAfrican blood in his cheek, its dark fires in his eyes,\xe2\x80\x94what is freedom\r\nto George Harris? To your fathers, freedom was the right of a nation to\r\nbe a nation. To him, it is the right of a man to be a man, and not a\r\nbrute; the right to call the wife of his bosom his wife, and to protect\r\nher from lawless violence; the right to protect and educate his child;\r\nthe right to have a home of his own, a religion of his own, a character\r\nof his own, unsubject to the will of another. All these thoughts were\r\nrolling and seething in George\xe2\x80\x99s breast, as he was pensively leaning\r\nhis head on his hand, watching his wife, as she was adapting to her\r\nslender and pretty form the articles of man\xe2\x80\x99s attire, in which it was\r\ndeemed safest she should make her escape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as she stood before the glass, and shook down\r\nher silky abundance of black curly hair. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, George, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost a\r\npity, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she held up some of it, playfully,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpity\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all got to come off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge smiled sadly, and made no answer.\r\n\r\nEliza turned to the glass, and the scissors glittered as one long lock\r\nafter another was detached from her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, now, that\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking up a hair-brush; \xe2\x80\x9cnow for a\r\nfew fancy touches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, an\xe2\x80\x99t I a pretty young fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning around to her\r\nhusband, laughing and blushing at the same time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always will be pretty, do what you will,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does make you so sober?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, kneeling on one knee, and\r\nlaying her hand on his. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are only within twenty-four hours of\r\nCanada, they say. Only a day and a night on the lake, and then\xe2\x80\x94oh,\r\nthen!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Eliza!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, drawing her towards him; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is it! Now my\r\nfate is all narrowing down to a point. To come so near, to be almost in\r\nsight, and then lose all. I should never live under it, Eliza.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, hopefully. \xe2\x80\x9cThe good Lord would not have\r\nbrought us so far, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to carry us through. I seem to\r\nfeel him with us, George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a blessed woman, Eliza!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, clasping her with a\r\nconvulsive grasp. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x94oh, tell me! can this great mercy be for us?\r\nWill these years and years of misery come to an end?\xe2\x80\x94shall we be free?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure of it, George,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, looking upward, while tears of\r\nhope and enthusiasm shone on her long, dark lashes. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel it in me,\r\nthat God is going to bring us out of bondage, this very day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will believe you, Eliza,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, rising suddenly up, \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nbelieve,\xe2\x80\x94come let\xe2\x80\x99s be off. Well, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, holding her off at\r\narm\xe2\x80\x99s length, and looking admiringly at her, \xe2\x80\x9cyou _are_ a pretty little\r\nfellow. That crop of little, short curls, is quite becoming. Put on\r\nyour cap. So\xe2\x80\x94a little to one side. I never saw you look quite so\r\npretty. But, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost time for the carriage;\xe2\x80\x94I wonder if Mrs. Smyth\r\nhas got Harry rigged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and a respectable, middle-aged woman entered, leading\r\nlittle Harry, dressed in girl\xe2\x80\x99s clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pretty girl he makes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, turning him round. \xe2\x80\x9cWe call\r\nhim Harriet, you see;\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t the name come nicely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child stood gravely regarding his mother in her new and strange\r\nattire, observing a profound silence, and occasionally drawing deep\r\nsighs, and peeping at her from under his dark curls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Harry know mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, stretching her hands toward him.\r\n\r\nThe child clung shyly to the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome Eliza, why do you try to coax him, when you know that he has got\r\nto be kept away from you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s foolish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza; \xe2\x80\x9cyet, I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to have him turn\r\naway from me. But come,\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x99s my cloak? Here,\xe2\x80\x94how is it men put on\r\ncloaks, George?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must wear it so,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband, throwing it over his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, imitating the motion,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand I must stamp, and\r\ntake long steps, and try to look saucy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t exert yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is, now and then, a modest\r\nyoung man; and I think it would be easier for you to act that\r\ncharacter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd these gloves! mercy upon us!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, my hands are lost\r\nin them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI advise you to keep them on pretty strictly,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nslender paw might bring us all out. Now, Mrs. Smyth, you are to go\r\nunder our charge, and be our aunty,\xe2\x80\x94you mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Smyth, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there have been men down, warning\r\nall the packet captains against a man and woman, with a little boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have!\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if we see any such people, we can tell\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA hack now drove to the door, and the friendly family who had received\r\nthe fugitives crowded around them with farewell greetings.\r\n\r\nThe disguises the party had assumed were in accordance with the hints\r\nof Tom Loker. Mrs. Smyth, a respectable woman from the settlement in\r\nCanada, whither they were fleeing, being fortunately about crossing the\r\nlake to return thither, had consented to appear as the aunt of little\r\nHarry; and, in order to attach him to her, he had been allowed to\r\nremain, the two last days, under her sole charge; and an extra amount\r\nof petting, jointed to an indefinite amount of seed-cakes and candy,\r\nhad cemented a very close attachment on the part of the young\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nThe hack drove to the wharf. The two young men, as they appeared,\r\nwalked up the plank into the boat, Eliza gallantly giving her arm to\r\nMrs. Smyth, and George attending to their baggage.\r\n\r\nGeorge was standing at the captain\xe2\x80\x99s office, settling for his party,\r\nwhen he overheard two men talking by his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve watched every one that came on board,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re not on this boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice was that of the clerk of the boat. The speaker whom he\r\naddressed was our sometime friend Marks, who, with that valuable\r\nperseverance which characterized him, had come on to Sandusky, seeking\r\nwhom he might devour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would scarcely know the woman from a white one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marks. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nman is a very light mulatto; he has a brand in one of his hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hand with which George was taking the tickets and change trembled a\r\nlittle; but he turned coolly around, fixed an unconcerned glance on the\r\nface of the speaker, and walked leisurely toward another part of the\r\nboat, where Eliza stood waiting for him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Smyth, with little Harry, sought the seclusion of the ladies\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncabin, where the dark beauty of the supposed little girl drew many\r\nflattering comments from the passengers.\r\n\r\nGeorge had the satisfaction, as the bell rang out its farewell peal, to\r\nsee Marks walk down the plank to the shore; and drew a long sigh of\r\nrelief, when the boat had put a returnless distance between them.\r\n\r\nIt was a superb day. The blue waves of Lake Erie danced, rippling and\r\nsparkling, in the sun-light. A fresh breeze blew from the shore, and\r\nthe lordly boat ploughed her way right gallantly onward.\r\n\r\nO, what an untold world there is in one human heart! Who thought, as\r\nGeorge walked calmly up and down the deck of the steamer, with his shy\r\ncompanion at his side, of all that was burning in his bosom? The mighty\r\ngood that seemed approaching seemed too good, too fair, even to be a\r\nreality; and he felt a jealous dread, every moment of the day, that\r\nsomething would rise to snatch it from him.\r\n\r\nBut the boat swept on. Hours fleeted, and, at last, clear and full rose\r\nthe blessed English shores; shores charmed by a mighty spell,\xe2\x80\x94with one\r\ntouch to dissolve every incantation of slavery, no matter in what\r\nlanguage pronounced, or by what national power confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FUGITIVES ARE SAVE IN A FREE LAND.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge and his wife stood arm in arm, as the boat neared the small town\r\nof Amherstberg, in Canada. His breath grew thick and short; a mist\r\ngathered before his eyes; he silently pressed the little hand that lay\r\ntrembling on his arm. The bell rang; the boat stopped. Scarcely seeing\r\nwhat he did, he looked out his baggage, and gathered his little party.\r\nThe little company were landed on the shore. They stood still till the\r\nboat had cleared; and then, with tears and embracings, the husband and\r\nwife, with their wondering child in their arms, knelt down and lifted\r\nup their hearts to God!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99T was something like the burst from death to life;\r\n    From the grave\xe2\x80\x99s cerements to the robes of heaven;\r\nFrom sin\xe2\x80\x99s dominion, and from passion\xe2\x80\x99s strife,\r\n    To the pure freedom of a soul forgiven;\r\n    Where all the bonds of death and hell are riven,\r\nAnd mortal puts on immortality,\r\nWhen Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s hand hath turned the golden key,\r\nAnd Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s voice hath said, _Rejoice, thy soul is free.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little party were soon guided, by Mrs. Smyth, to the hospitable\r\nabode of a good missionary, whom Christian charity has placed here as a\r\nshepherd to the outcast and wandering, who are constantly finding an\r\nasylum on this shore.\r\n\r\nWho can speak the blessedness of that first day of freedom? Is not the\r\n_sense_ of liberty a higher and a finer one than any of the five? To\r\nmove, speak and breathe,\xe2\x80\x94go out and come in unwatched, and free from\r\ndanger! Who can speak the blessings of that rest which comes down on\r\nthe free man\xe2\x80\x99s pillow, under laws which insure to him the rights that\r\nGod has given to man? How fair and precious to that mother was that\r\nsleeping child\xe2\x80\x99s face, endeared by the memory of a thousand dangers!\r\nHow impossible was it to sleep, in the exuberant possession of such\r\nblessedness! And yet, these two had not one acre of ground,\xe2\x80\x94not a roof\r\nthat they could call their own,\xe2\x80\x94they had spent their all, to the last\r\ndollar. They had nothing more than the birds of the air, or the flowers\r\nof the field,\xe2\x80\x94yet they could not sleep for joy. \xe2\x80\x9cO, ye who take freedom\r\nfrom man, with what words shall ye answer it to God?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\nThe Victory\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks be unto God, who giveth us the victory.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] I Cor. 15:57.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave not many of us, in the weary way of life, felt, in some hours, how\r\nfar easier it were to die than to live?\r\n\r\nThe martyr, when faced even by a death of bodily anguish and horror,\r\nfinds in the very terror of his doom a strong stimulant and tonic.\r\nThere is a vivid excitement, a thrill and fervor, which may carry\r\nthrough any crisis of suffering that is the birth-hour of eternal glory\r\nand rest.\r\n\r\nBut to live,\xe2\x80\x94to wear on, day after day, of mean, bitter, low, harassing\r\nservitude, every nerve dampened and depressed, every power of feeling\r\ngradually smothered,\xe2\x80\x94this long and wasting heart-martyrdom, this slow,\r\ndaily bleeding away of the inward life, drop by drop, hour after\r\nhour,\xe2\x80\x94this is the true searching test of what there may be in man or\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom stood face to face with his persecutor, and heard his threats,\r\nand thought in his very soul that his hour was come, his heart swelled\r\nbravely in him, and he thought he could bear torture and fire, bear\r\nanything, with the vision of Jesus and heaven but just a step beyond;\r\nbut, when he was gone, and the present excitement passed off, came back\r\nthe pain of his bruised and weary limbs,\xe2\x80\x94came back the sense of his\r\nutterly degraded, hopeless, forlorn estate; and the day passed wearily\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nLong before his wounds were healed, Legree insisted that he should be\r\nput to the regular field-work; and then came day after day of pain and\r\nweariness, aggravated by every kind of injustice and indignity that the\r\nill-will of a mean and malicious mind could devise. Whoever, in _our_\r\ncircumstances, has made trial of pain, even with all the alleviations\r\nwhich, for us, usually attend it, must know the irritation that comes\r\nwith it. Tom no longer wondered at the habitual surliness of his\r\nassociates; nay, he found the placid, sunny temper, which had been the\r\nhabitude of his life, broken in on, and sorely strained, by the inroads\r\nof the same thing. He had flattered himself on leisure to read his\r\nBible; but there was no such thing as leisure there. In the height of\r\nthe season, Legree did not hesitate to press all his hands through,\r\nSundays and week-days alike. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x94he made more cotton by\r\nit, and gained his wager; and if it wore out a few more hands, he could\r\nbuy better ones. At first, Tom used to read a verse or two of his\r\nBible, by the flicker of the fire, after he had returned from his daily\r\ntoil; but, after the cruel treatment he received, he used to come home\r\nso exhausted, that his head swam and his eyes failed when he tried to\r\nread; and he was fain to stretch himself down, with the others, in\r\nutter exhaustion.\r\n\r\nIs it strange that the religious peace and trust, which had upborne him\r\nhitherto, should give way to tossings of soul and despondent darkness?\r\nThe gloomiest problem of this mysterious life was constantly before his\r\neyes,\xe2\x80\x94souls crushed and ruined, evil triumphant, and God silent. It was\r\nweeks and months that Tom wrestled, in his own soul, in darkness and\r\nsorrow. He thought of Miss Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s letter to his Kentucky friends,\r\nand would pray earnestly that God would send him deliverance. And then\r\nhe would watch, day after day, in the vague hope of seeing somebody\r\nsent to redeem him; and, when nobody came, he would crush back to his\r\nsoul bitter thoughts,\xe2\x80\x94that it was vain to serve God, that God had\r\nforgotten him. He sometimes saw Cassy; and sometimes, when summoned to\r\nthe house, caught a glimpse of the dejected form of Emmeline, but held\r\nvery little communion with either; in fact, there was no time for him\r\nto commune with anybody.\r\n\r\nOne evening, he was sitting, in utter dejection and prostration, by a\r\nfew decaying brands, where his coarse supper was baking. He put a few\r\nbits of brushwood on the fire, and strove to raise the light, and then\r\ndrew his worn Bible from his pocket. There were all the marked\r\npassages, which had thrilled his soul so often,\xe2\x80\x94words of patriarchs and\r\nseers, poets and sages, who from early time had spoken courage to\r\nman,\xe2\x80\x94voices from the great cloud of witnesses who ever surround us in\r\nthe race of life. Had the word lost its power, or could the failing eye\r\nand weary sense no longer answer to the touch of that mighty\r\ninspiration? Heavily sighing, he put it in his pocket. A coarse laugh\r\nroused him; he looked up,\xe2\x80\x94Legree was standing opposite to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, old boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou find your religion don\xe2\x80\x99t work, it seems!\r\nI thought I should get that through your wool, at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cruel taunt was more than hunger and cold and nakedness. Tom was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I meant to do well by you, when I\r\nbought you. You might have been better off than Sambo, or Quimbo\r\neither, and had easy times; and, instead of getting cut up and\r\nthrashed, every day or two, ye might have had liberty to lord it round,\r\nand cut up the other niggers; and ye might have had, now and then, a\r\ngood warming of whiskey punch. Come, Tom, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\nbe reasonable?\xe2\x80\x94heave that ar old pack of trash in the fire, and join my\r\nchurch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, fervently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see the Lord an\xe2\x80\x99t going to help you; if he had been, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave let _me_ get you! This yer religion is all a mess of lying\r\ntrumpery, Tom. I know all about it. Ye\xe2\x80\x99d better hold to me; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsomebody, and can do something!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll hold on. The Lord may help me, or not\r\nhelp; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold to him, and believe him to the last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more fool you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, spitting scornfully at him, and\r\nspurning him with his foot. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; I\xe2\x80\x99ll chase you down, yet, and\r\nbring you under,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll see!\xe2\x80\x9d and Legree turned away.\r\n\r\nWhen a heavy weight presses the soul to the lowest level at which\r\nendurance is possible, there is an instant and desperate effort of\r\nevery physical and moral nerve to throw off the weight; and hence the\r\nheaviest anguish often precedes a return tide of joy and courage. So\r\nwas it now with Tom. The atheistic taunts of his cruel master sunk his\r\nbefore dejected soul to the lowest ebb; and, though the hand of faith\r\nstill held to the eternal rock, it was a numb, despairing grasp. Tom\r\nsat, like one stunned, at the fire. Suddenly everything around him\r\nseemed to fade, and a vision rose before him of one crowned with\r\nthorns, buffeted and bleeding. Tom gazed, in awe and wonder, at the\r\nmajestic patience of the face; the deep, pathetic eyes thrilled him to\r\nhis inmost heart; his soul woke, as, with floods of emotion, he\r\nstretched out his hands and fell upon his knees,\xe2\x80\x94when, gradually, the\r\nvision changed: the sharp thorns became rays of glory; and, in splendor\r\ninconceivable, he saw that same face bending compassionately towards\r\nhim, and a voice said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe that overcometh shall sit down with me on my\r\nthrone, even as I also overcome, and am set down with my Father on his\r\nthrone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow long Tom lay there, he knew not. When he came to himself, the fire\r\nwas gone out, his clothes were wet with the chill and drenching dews;\r\nbut the dread soul-crisis was past, and, in the joy that filled him, he\r\nno longer felt hunger, cold, degradation, disappointment, wretchedness.\r\nFrom his deepest soul, he that hour loosed and parted from every hope\r\nin life that now is, and offered his own will an unquestioning\r\nsacrifice to the Infinite. Tom looked up to the silent, ever-living\r\nstars,\xe2\x80\x94types of the angelic hosts who ever look down on man; and the\r\nsolitude of the night rung with the triumphant words of a hymn, which\r\nhe had sung often in happier days, but never with such feeling as now:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe earth shall be dissolved like snow,\r\n    The sun shall cease to shine;\r\nBut God, who called me here below,\r\n    Shall be forever mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when this mortal life shall fail,\r\n    And flesh and sense shall cease,\r\nI shall possess within the veil\r\n    A life of joy and peace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we\xe2\x80\x99ve been there ten thousand years,\r\n    Bright shining like the sun,\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve no less days to sing God\xe2\x80\x99s praise\r\n    Than when we first begun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have been familiar with the religious histories of the slave\r\npopulation know that relations like what we have narrated are very\r\ncommon among them. We have heard some from their own lips, of a very\r\ntouching and affecting character. The psychologist tells us of a state,\r\nin which the affections and images of the mind become so dominant and\r\noverpowering, that they press into their service the outward imagining.\r\nWho shall measure what an all-pervading Spirit may do with these\r\ncapabilities of our mortality, or the ways in which He may encourage\r\nthe desponding souls of the desolate? If the poor forgotten slave\r\nbelieves that Jesus hath appeared and spoken to him, who shall\r\ncontradict him? Did He not say that his mission, in all ages, was to\r\nbind up the broken-hearted, and set at liberty them that are bruised?\r\n\r\nWhen the dim gray of dawn woke the slumberers to go forth to the field,\r\nthere was among those tattered and shivering wretches one who walked\r\nwith an exultant tread; for firmer than the ground he trod on was his\r\nstrong faith in Almighty, eternal love. Ah, Legree, try all your forces\r\nnow! Utmost agony, woe, degradation, want, and loss of all things,\r\nshall only hasten on the process by which he shall be made a king and a\r\npriest unto God!\r\n\r\nFrom this time, an inviolable sphere of peace encompassed the lowly\r\nheart of the oppressed one,\xe2\x80\x94an ever-present Saviour hallowed it as a\r\ntemple. Past now the bleeding of earthly regrets; past its fluctuations\r\nof hope, and fear, and desire; the human will, bent, and bleeding, and\r\nstruggling long, was now entirely merged in the Divine. So short now\r\nseemed the remaining voyage of life,\xe2\x80\x94so near, so vivid, seemed eternal\r\nblessedness,\xe2\x80\x94that life\xe2\x80\x99s uttermost woes fell from him unharming.\r\n\r\nAll noticed the change in his appearance. Cheerfulness and alertness\r\nseemed to return to him, and a quietness which no insult or injury\r\ncould ruffle seemed to possess him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil\xe2\x80\x99s got into Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d Legree said to Sambo. \xe2\x80\x9cA while ago he\r\nwas all down in the mouth, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s peart as a cricket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDunno, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r; gwine to run off, mebbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike to see him try that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, with a savage grin, \xe2\x80\x9cwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe, Sambo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuess we would! Haw! haw! ho!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sooty gnome, laughing\r\nobsequiously. \xe2\x80\x9cLord, de fun! To see him stickin\xe2\x80\x99 in de mud,\xe2\x80\x94chasin\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\ntarin\xe2\x80\x99 through de bushes, dogs a holdin\xe2\x80\x99 on to him! Lord, I laughed fit\r\nto split, dat ar time we cotched Molly. I thought they\xe2\x80\x99d a had her all\r\nstripped up afore I could get \xe2\x80\x99em off. She car\xe2\x80\x99s de marks o\xe2\x80\x99 dat ar\r\nspree yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon she will, to her grave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree. \xe2\x80\x9cBut now, Sambo, you\r\nlook sharp. If the nigger\xe2\x80\x99s got anything of this sort going, trip him\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r, let me lone for dat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tree de coon. Ho, ho,\r\nho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was spoken as Legree was getting on his horse, to go to the\r\nneighboring town. That night, as he was returning, he thought he would\r\nturn his horse and ride round the quarters, and see if all was safe.\r\n\r\nIt was a superb moonlight night, and the shadows of the graceful China\r\ntrees lay minutely pencilled on the turf below, and there was that\r\ntransparent stillness in the air which it seems almost unholy to\r\ndisturb. Legree was a little distance from the quarters, when he heard\r\nthe voice of some one singing. It was not a usual sound there, and he\r\npaused to listen. A musical tenor voice sang,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I can read my title clear\r\n    To mansions in the skies,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll bid farewell to every fear,\r\n    And wipe my weeping eyes\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould earth against my soul engage,\r\n    And hellish darts be hurled,\r\nThen I can smile at Satan\xe2\x80\x99s rage,\r\n    And face a frowning world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet cares like a wild deluge come,\r\n    And storms of sorrow fall,\r\nMay I but safely reach my home,\r\n    My God, my Heaven, my All.\xe2\x80\x9d[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] \xe2\x80\x9cOn My Journey Home,\xe2\x80\x9d hymn by Isaac Watts, found in many of the\r\n southern country songbooks of the ante bellum period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo ho!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree to himself, \xe2\x80\x9che thinks so, does he? How I hate\r\nthese cursed Methodist hymns! Here, you nigger,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, coming\r\nsuddenly out upon Tom, and raising his riding-whip, \xe2\x80\x9chow dare you be\r\ngettin\xe2\x80\x99 up this yer row, when you ought to be in bed? Shut yer old\r\nblack gash, and get along in with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with ready cheerfulness, as he rose to go in.\r\n\r\nLegree was provoked beyond measure by Tom\xe2\x80\x99s evident happiness; and\r\nriding up to him, belabored him over his head and shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you dog,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9csee if you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel so comfortable, after\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the blows fell now only on the outer man, and not, as before, on\r\nthe heart. Tom stood perfectly submissive; and yet Legree could not\r\nhide from himself that his power over his bond thrall was somehow gone.\r\nAnd, as Tom disappeared in his cabin, and he wheeled his horse suddenly\r\nround, there passed through his mind one of those vivid flashes that\r\noften send the lightning of conscience across the dark and wicked soul.\r\nHe understood full well that it was GOD who was standing between him\r\nand his victim, and he blasphemed him. That submissive and silent man,\r\nwhom taunts, nor threats, nor stripes, nor cruelties, could disturb,\r\nroused a voice within him, such as of old his Master roused in the\r\ndemoniac soul, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of\r\nNazareth?\xe2\x80\x94art thou come to torment us before the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s whole soul overflowed with compassion and sympathy for the poor\r\nwretches by whom he was surrounded. To him it seemed as if his\r\nlife-sorrows were now over, and as if, out of that strange treasury of\r\npeace and joy, with which he had been endowed from above, he longed to\r\npour out something for the relief of their woes. It is true,\r\nopportunities were scanty; but, on the way to the fields, and back\r\nagain, and during the hours of labor, chances fell in his way of\r\nextending a helping-hand to the weary, the disheartened and\r\ndiscouraged. The poor, worn-down, brutalized creatures, at first, could\r\nscarce comprehend this; but, when it was continued week after week, and\r\nmonth after month, it began to awaken long-silent chords in their\r\nbenumbed hearts. Gradually and imperceptibly the strange, silent,\r\npatient man, who was ready to bear every one\xe2\x80\x99s burden, and sought help\r\nfrom none,\xe2\x80\x94who stood aside for all, and came last, and took least, yet\r\nwas foremost to share his little all with any who needed,\xe2\x80\x94the man who,\r\nin cold nights, would give up his tattered blanket to add to the\r\ncomfort of some woman who shivered with sickness, and who filled the\r\nbaskets of the weaker ones in the field, at the terrible risk of coming\r\nshort in his own measure,\xe2\x80\x94and who, though pursued with unrelenting\r\ncruelty by their common tyrant, never joined in uttering a word of\r\nreviling or cursing,\xe2\x80\x94this man, at last, began to have a strange power\r\nover them; and, when the more pressing season was past, and they were\r\nallowed again their Sundays for their own use, many would gather\r\ntogether to hear from him of Jesus. They would gladly have met to hear,\r\nand pray, and sing, in some place, together; but Legree would not\r\npermit it, and more than once broke up such attempts, with oaths and\r\nbrutal execrations,\xe2\x80\x94so that the blessed news had to circulate from\r\nindividual to individual. Yet who can speak the simple joy with which\r\nsome of those poor outcasts, to whom life was a joyless journey to a\r\ndark unknown, heard of a compassionate Redeemer and a heavenly home? It\r\nis the statement of missionaries, that, of all races of the earth, none\r\nhave received the Gospel with such eager docility as the African. The\r\nprinciple of reliance and unquestioning faith, which is its foundation,\r\nis more a native element in this race than any other; and it has often\r\nbeen found among them, that a stray seed of truth, borne on some breeze\r\nof accident into hearts the most ignorant, has sprung up into fruit,\r\nwhose abundance has shamed that of higher and more skilful culture.\r\n\r\nThe poor mulatto woman, whose simple faith had been well-nigh crushed\r\nand overwhelmed, by the avalanche of cruelty and wrong which had fallen\r\nupon her, felt her soul raised up by the hymns and passages of Holy\r\nWrit, which this lowly missionary breathed into her ear in intervals,\r\nas they were going to and returning from work; and even the half-crazed\r\nand wandering mind of Cassy was soothed and calmed by his simple and\r\nunobtrusive influences.\r\n\r\nStung to madness and despair by the crushing agonies of a life, Cassy\r\nhad often resolved in her soul an hour of retribution, when her hand\r\nshould avenge on her oppressor all the injustice and cruelty to which\r\nshe had been witness, or which _she_ had in her own person suffered.\r\n\r\nOne night, after all in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s cabin were sunk in sleep, he was suddenly\r\naroused by seeing her face at the hole between the logs, that served\r\nfor a window. She made a silent gesture for him to come out.\r\n\r\nTom came out the door. It was between one and two o\xe2\x80\x99clock at\r\nnight,\xe2\x80\x94broad, calm, still moonlight. Tom remarked, as the light of the\r\nmoon fell upon Cassy\xe2\x80\x99s large, black eyes, that there was a wild and\r\npeculiar glare in them, unlike their wonted fixed despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Father Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laying her small hand on his wrist,\r\nand drawing him forward with a force as if the hand were of steel;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccome here,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve news for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Misse Cassy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like your liberty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have it, Misse, in God\xe2\x80\x99s time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cAy, but you may\r\nhave it tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, with a flash of sudden energy. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in a whisper, fixing her black eyes on him. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nalong! He\xe2\x80\x99s asleep\xe2\x80\x94sound. I put enough into his brandy to keep him so.\r\nI wish I\xe2\x80\x99d had more,\xe2\x80\x94I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have wanted you. But come, the back\r\ndoor is unlocked; there\xe2\x80\x99s an axe there, I put it there,\xe2\x80\x94his room door\r\nis open; I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the way. I\xe2\x80\x99d a done it myself, only my arms are\r\nso weak. Come along!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for ten thousand worlds, Misse!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, firmly, stopping and\r\nholding her back, as she was pressing forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut think of all these poor creatures,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy. \xe2\x80\x9cWe might set them\r\nall free, and go somewhere in the swamps, and find an island, and live\r\nby ourselves; I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of its being done. Any life is better than\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! good never comes of wickedness. I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner\r\nchop my right hand off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen _I_ shall do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, turning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Misse Cassy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, throwing himself before her, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the dear\r\nLord\xe2\x80\x99s sake that died for ye, don\xe2\x80\x99t sell your precious soul to the\r\ndevil, that way! Nothing but evil will come of it. The Lord hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncalled us to wrath. We must suffer, and wait his time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I waited?\xe2\x80\x94waited till my head is dizzy and\r\nmy heart sick? What has he made me suffer? What has he made hundreds of\r\npoor creatures suffer? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he wringing the life-blood out of you? I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ncalled on; they call me! His time\xe2\x80\x99s come, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have his heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, holding her small hands, which were clenched\r\nwith spasmodic violence. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, ye poor, lost soul, that ye mustn\xe2\x80\x99t do.\r\nThe dear, blessed Lord never shed no blood but his own, and that he\r\npoured out for us when we was enemies. Lord, help us to follow his\r\nsteps, and love our enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, with a fierce glare; \xe2\x80\x9clove _such_ enemies! It isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nin flesh and blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Misse, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, looking up; \xe2\x80\x9cbut _He_ gives it to us,\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s the victory. When we can love and pray over all and through\r\nall, the battle\xe2\x80\x99s past, and the victory\xe2\x80\x99s come,\xe2\x80\x94glory be to God!\xe2\x80\x9d And,\r\nwith streaming eyes and choking voice, the black man looked up to\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nAnd this, oh Africa! latest called of nations,\xe2\x80\x94called to the crown of\r\nthorns, the scourge, the bloody sweat, the cross of agony,\xe2\x80\x94this is to\r\nbe _thy_ victory; by this shalt thou reign with Christ when his kingdom\r\nshall come on earth.\r\n\r\nThe deep fervor of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, the softness of his voice, his\r\ntears, fell like dew on the wild, unsettled spirit of the poor woman. A\r\nsoftness gathered over the lurid fires of her eye; she looked down, and\r\nTom could feel the relaxing muscles of her hands, as she said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you that evil spirits followed me? O! Father Tom, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t pray,\xe2\x80\x94I wish I could. I never have prayed since my children were\r\nsold! What you say must be right, I know it must; but when I try to\r\npray, I can only hate and curse. I can\xe2\x80\x99t pray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor soul!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, compassionately. \xe2\x80\x9cSatan desires to have ye, and\r\nsift ye as wheat. I pray the Lord for ye. O! Misse Cassy, turn to the\r\ndear Lord Jesus. He came to bind up the broken-hearted, and comfort all\r\nthat mourn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCassy stood silent, while large, heavy tears dropped from her downcast\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMisse Cassy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, in a hesitating tone, after surveying her in\r\nsilence, \xe2\x80\x9cif ye only could get away from here,\xe2\x80\x94if the thing was\r\npossible,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99vise ye and Emmeline to do it; that is, if ye could go\r\nwithout blood-guiltiness,\xe2\x80\x94not otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you try it with us, Father Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9ctime was when I would; but the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s given me a work\r\namong these yer poor souls, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay with \xe2\x80\x99em and bear my cross\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x99em till the end. It\xe2\x80\x99s different with you; it\xe2\x80\x99s a snare to\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s more\xe2\x80\x99n you can stand,\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99d better go, if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know no way but through the grave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no beast or\r\nbird but can find a home some where; even the snakes and the alligators\r\nhave their places to lie down and be quiet; but there\xe2\x80\x99s no place for\r\nus. Down in the darkest swamps, their dogs will hunt us out, and find\r\nus. Everybody and everything is against us; even the very beasts side\r\nagainst us,\xe2\x80\x94and where shall we go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom stood silent; at length he said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim that saved Daniel in the den of lions,\xe2\x80\x94that saved the children in\r\nthe fiery furnace,\xe2\x80\x94Him that walked on the sea, and bade the winds be\r\nstill,\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s alive yet; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve faith to believe he can deliver you.\r\nTry it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll pray, with all my might, for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy what strange law of mind is it that an idea long overlooked, and\r\ntrodden under foot as a useless stone, suddenly sparkles out in new\r\nlight, as a discovered diamond?\r\n\r\nCassy had often revolved, for hours, all possible or probable schemes\r\nof escape, and dismissed them all, as hopeless and impracticable; but\r\nat this moment there flashed through her mind a plan, so simple and\r\nfeasible in all its details, as to awaken an instant hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Tom, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Lord help ye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\nThe Stratagem\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe way of the wicked is as darkness; he knoweth not at what he\r\nstumbleth.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] Prov. 4:19.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe garret of the house that Legree occupied, like most other garrets,\r\nwas a great, desolate space, dusty, hung with cobwebs, and littered\r\nwith cast-off lumber. The opulent family that had inhabited the house\r\nin the days of its splendor had imported a great deal of splendid\r\nfurniture, some of which they had taken away with them, while some\r\nremained standing desolate in mouldering, unoccupied rooms, or stored\r\naway in this place. One or two immense packing-boxes, in which this\r\nfurniture was brought, stood against the sides of the garret. There was\r\na small window there, which let in, through its dingy, dusty panes, a\r\nscanty, uncertain light on the tall, high-backed chairs and dusty\r\ntables, that had once seen better days. Altogether, it was a weird and\r\nghostly place; but, ghostly as it was, it wanted not in legends among\r\nthe superstitious negroes, to increase its terrors. Some few years\r\nbefore, a negro woman, who had incurred Legree\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure, was\r\nconfined there for several weeks. What passed there, we do not say; the\r\nnegroes used to whisper darkly to each other; but it was known that the\r\nbody of the unfortunate creature was one day taken down from there, and\r\nburied; and, after that, it was said that oaths and cursings, and the\r\nsound of violent blows, used to ring through that old garret, and\r\nmingled with wailings and groans of despair. Once, when Legree chanced\r\nto overhear something of this kind, he flew into a violent passion, and\r\nswore that the next one that told stories about that garret should have\r\nan opportunity of knowing what was there, for he would chain them up\r\nthere for a week. This hint was enough to repress talking, though, of\r\ncourse, it did not disturb the credit of the story in the least.\r\n\r\nGradually, the staircase that led to the garret, and even the\r\npassage-way to the staircase, were avoided by every one in the house,\r\nfrom every one fearing to speak of it, and the legend was gradually\r\nfalling into desuetude. It had suddenly occurred to Cassy to make use\r\nof the superstitious excitability, which was so great in Legree, for\r\nthe purpose of her liberation, and that of her fellow-sufferer.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping-room of Cassy was directly under the garret. One day,\r\nwithout consulting Legree, she suddenly took it upon her, with some\r\nconsiderable ostentation, to change all the furniture and appurtenances\r\nof the room to one at some considerable distance. The under-servants,\r\nwho were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling\r\nabout with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo! you Cass!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s in the wind now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing; only I choose to have another room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, doggedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what for, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI choose to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil you do! and what for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to get some sleep, now and then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, dryly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak out, you minx!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! nothing. I suppose it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t disturb _you!_ Only groans, and\r\npeople scuffing, and rolling round on the garret floor, half the night,\r\nfrom twelve to morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople up garret!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, uneasily, but forcing a laugh; \xe2\x80\x9cwho\r\nare they, Cassy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCassy raised her sharp, black eyes, and looked in the face of Legree,\r\nwith an expression that went through his bones, as she said, \xe2\x80\x9cTo be\r\nsure, Simon, who are they? I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have _you_ tell me. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow, I suppose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith an oath, Legree struck at her with his riding-whip; but she glided\r\nto one side, and passed through the door, and looking back, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep in that room, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know all about it. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter try it!\xe2\x80\x9d and then immediately she shut and locked the door.\r\n\r\nLegree blustered and swore, and threatened to break down the door; but\r\napparently thought better of it, and walked uneasily into the\r\nsitting-room. Cassy perceived that her shaft had struck home; and, from\r\nthat hour, with the most exquisite address, she never ceased to\r\ncontinue the train of influences she had begun.\r\n\r\nIn a knot-hole of the garret, that had opened, she had inserted the\r\nneck of an old bottle, in such a manner that when there was the least\r\nwind, most doleful and lugubrious wailing sounds proceeded from it,\r\nwhich, in a high wind, increased to a perfect shriek, such as to\r\ncredulous and superstitious ears might easily seem to be that of horror\r\nand despair.\r\n\r\nThese sounds were, from time to time, heard by the servants, and\r\nrevived in full force the memory of the old ghost legend. A\r\nsuperstitious creeping horror seemed to fill the house; and though no\r\none dared to breathe it to Legree, he found himself encompassed by it,\r\nas by an atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNo one is so thoroughly superstitious as the godless man. The Christian\r\nis composed by the belief of a wise, all-ruling Father, whose presence\r\nfills the void unknown with light and order; but to the man who has\r\ndethroned God, the spirit-land is, indeed, in the words of the Hebrew\r\npoet, \xe2\x80\x9ca land of darkness and the shadow of death,\xe2\x80\x9d without any order,\r\nwhere the light is as darkness. Life and death to him are haunted\r\ngrounds, filled with goblin forms of vague and shadowy dread.\r\n\r\nLegree had had the slumbering moral elements in him roused by his\r\nencounters with Tom,\xe2\x80\x94roused, only to be resisted by the determinate\r\nforce of evil; but still there was a thrill and commotion of the dark,\r\ninner world, produced by every word, or prayer, or hymn, that reacted\r\nin superstitious dread.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Cassy over him was of a strange and singular kind. He\r\nwas her owner, her tyrant and tormentor. She was, as he knew, wholly,\r\nand without any possibility of help or redress, in his hands; and yet\r\nso it is, that the most brutal man cannot live in constant association\r\nwith a strong female influence, and not be greatly controlled by it.\r\nWhen he first bought her, she was, as she said, a woman delicately\r\nbred; and then he crushed her, without scruple, beneath the foot of his\r\nbrutality. But, as time, and debasing influences, and despair, hardened\r\nwomanhood within her, and waked the fires of fiercer passions, she had\r\nbecome in a measure his mistress, and he alternately tyrannized over\r\nand dreaded her.\r\n\r\nThis influence had become more harassing and decided, since partial\r\ninsanity had given a strange, weird, unsettled cast to all her words\r\nand language.\r\n\r\nA night or two after this, Legree was sitting in the old sitting-room,\r\nby the side of a flickering wood fire, that threw uncertain glances\r\nround the room. It was a stormy, windy night, such as raises whole\r\nsquadrons of nondescript noises in rickety old houses. Windows were\r\nrattling, shutters flapping, and wind carousing, rumbling, and tumbling\r\ndown the chimney, and, every once in a while, puffing out smoke and\r\nashes, as if a legion of spirits were coming after them. Legree had\r\nbeen casting up accounts and reading newspapers for some hours, while\r\nCassy sat in the corner; sullenly looking into the fire. Legree laid\r\ndown his paper, and seeing an old book lying on the table, which he had\r\nnoticed Cassy reading, the first part of the evening, took it up, and\r\nbegan to turn it over. It was one of those collections of stories of\r\nbloody murders, ghostly legends, and supernatural visitations, which,\r\ncoarsely got up and illustrated, have a strange fascination for one who\r\nonce begins to read them.\r\n\r\nLegree poohed and pished, but read, turning page after page, till,\r\nfinally, after reading some way, he threw down the book, with an oath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in ghosts, do you, Cass?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, taking the tongs\r\nand settling the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\xe2\x80\x99d more sense than to let noises\r\nscare _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter what I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, sullenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFellows used to try to frighten me with their yarns at sea,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLegree. \xe2\x80\x9cNever come it round me that way. I\xe2\x80\x99m too tough for any such\r\ntrash, tell ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCassy sat looking intensely at him in the shadow of the corner. There\r\nwas that strange light in her eyes that always impressed Legree with\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem noises was nothing but rats and the wind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree. \xe2\x80\x9cRats\r\nwill make a devil of a noise. I used to hear \xe2\x80\x99em sometimes down in the\r\nhold of the ship; and wind,\xe2\x80\x94Lord\xe2\x80\x99s sake! ye can make anything out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCassy knew Legree was uneasy under her eyes, and, therefore, she made\r\nno answer, but sat fixing them on him, with that strange, unearthly\r\nexpression, as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, speak out, woman,\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan rats walk down stairs, and come walking through the entry, and\r\nopen a door when you\xe2\x80\x99ve locked it and set a chair against it?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCassy; \xe2\x80\x9cand come walk, walk, walking right up to your bed, and put out\r\ntheir hand, so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCassy kept her glittering eyes fixed on Legree, as she spoke, and he\r\nstared at her like a man in the nightmare, till, when she finished by\r\nlaying her hand, icy cold, on his, he sprung back, with an oath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman! what do you mean? Nobody did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, no,\xe2\x80\x94of course not,\xe2\x80\x94did I say they did?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, with a smile of\r\nchilling derision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94did\xe2\x80\x94have you really seen?\xe2\x80\x94Come, Cass, what is it, now,\xe2\x80\x94speak out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may sleep there, yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, \xe2\x80\x9cif you want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid it come from the garret, Cassy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_It_,\xe2\x80\x94what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what you told of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, with dogged sullenness.\r\n\r\nLegree walked up and down the room, uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have this yer thing examined. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look into it, this very night.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll take my pistols\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy; \xe2\x80\x9csleep in that room. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see you doing it.\r\nFire your pistols,\xe2\x80\x94do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLegree stamped his foot, and swore violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t swear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy; \xe2\x80\x9cnobody knows who may be hearing you. Hark!\r\nWhat was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, starting.\r\n\r\nA heavy old Dutch clock, that stood in the corner of the room, began,\r\nand slowly struck twelve.\r\n\r\nFor some reason or other, Legree neither spoke nor moved; a vague\r\nhorror fell on him; while Cassy, with a keen, sneering glitter in her\r\neyes, stood looking at him, counting the strokes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock; well _now_ we\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, turning, and opening\r\nthe door into the passage-way, and standing as if listening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark! What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, raising her finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only the wind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you hear how cursedly it\r\nblows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimon, come here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, in a whisper, laying her hand on his,\r\nand leading him to the foot of the stairs: \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know what _that_ is?\r\nHark!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA wild shriek came pealing down the stairway. It came from the garret.\r\nLegree\xe2\x80\x99s knees knocked together; his face grew white with fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better get your pistols?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, with a sneer that\r\nfroze Legree\xe2\x80\x99s blood. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time this thing was looked into, you know.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like to have you go up now; _they\xe2\x80\x99re at it_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t go!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, with an oath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? There an\xe2\x80\x99t any such thing as ghosts, you know! Come!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nCassy flitted up the winding stairway, laughing, and looking back after\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you _are_ the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree. \xe2\x80\x9cCome back you hag,\xe2\x80\x94come\r\nback, Cass! You shan\xe2\x80\x99t go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Cassy laughed wildly, and fled on. He heard her open the entry\r\ndoors that led to the garret. A wild gust of wind swept down,\r\nextinguishing the candle he held in his hand, and with it the fearful,\r\nunearthly screams; they seemed to be shrieked in his very ear.\r\n\r\nLegree fled frantically into the parlor, whither, in a few moments, he\r\nwas followed by Cassy, pale, calm, cold as an avenging spirit, and with\r\nthat same fearful light in her eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you are satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlast you, Cass!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy. \xe2\x80\x9cI only went up and shut the doors. _What\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter with that garret_, Simon, do you suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of your business!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, it an\xe2\x80\x99t? Well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, \xe2\x80\x9cat any rate, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep\r\nunder it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnticipating the rising of the wind, that very evening, Cassy had been\r\nup and opened the garret window. Of course, the moment the doors were\r\nopened, the wind had drafted down, and extinguished the light.\r\n\r\nThis may serve as a specimen of the game that Cassy played with Legree,\r\nuntil he would sooner have put his head into a lion\xe2\x80\x99s mouth than to\r\nhave explored that garret. Meanwhile, in the night, when everybody else\r\nwas asleep, Cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock of\r\nprovisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time; she\r\ntransferred, article by article, a greater part of her own and\r\nEmmeline\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe. All things being arranged, they only waited a\r\nfitting opportunity to put their plan in execution.\r\n\r\nBy cajoling Legree, and taking advantage of a good-natured interval,\r\nCassy had got him to take her with him to the neighboring town, which\r\nwas situated directly on the Red River. With a memory sharpened to\r\nalmost preternatural clearness, she remarked every turn in the road,\r\nand formed a mental estimate of the time to be occupied in traversing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAt the time when all was matured for action, our readers may, perhaps,\r\nlike to look behind the scenes, and see the final _coup d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat_.\r\n\r\nIt was now near evening, Legree had been absent, on a ride to a\r\nneighboring farm. For many days Cassy had been unusually gracious and\r\naccommodating in her humors; and Legree and she had been, apparently,\r\non the best of terms. At present, we may behold her and Emmeline in the\r\nroom of the latter, busy in sorting and arranging two small bundles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, these will be large enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy. \xe2\x80\x9cNow put on your\r\nbonnet, and let\xe2\x80\x99s start; it\xe2\x80\x99s just about the right time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they can see us yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean they shall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know that they must\r\nhave their chase after us, at any rate? The way of the thing is to be\r\njust this:\xe2\x80\x94We will steal out of the back door, and run down by the\r\nquarters. Sambo or Quimbo will be sure to see us. They will give chase,\r\nand we will get into the swamp; then, they can\xe2\x80\x99t follow us any further\r\ntill they go up and give the alarm, and turn out the dogs, and so on;\r\nand, while they are blundering round, and tumbling over each other, as\r\nthey always do, you and I will slip along to the creek, that runs back\r\nof the house, and wade along in it, till we get opposite the back door.\r\nThat will put the dogs all at fault; for scent won\xe2\x80\x99t lie in the water.\r\nEvery one will run out of the house to look after us, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwhip in at the back door, and up into the garret, where I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a nice\r\nbed made up in one of the great boxes. We must stay in that garret a\r\ngood while, for, I tell you, he will raise heaven and earth after us.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll muster some of those old overseers on the other plantations, and\r\nhave a great hunt; and they\xe2\x80\x99ll go over every inch of ground in that\r\nswamp. He makes it his boast that nobody ever got away from him. So let\r\nhim hunt at his leisure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCassy, how well you have planned it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline. \xe2\x80\x9cWho ever would\r\nhave thought of it, but you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was neither pleasure nor exultation in Cassy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\xe2\x80\x94only a\r\ndespairing firmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, reaching her hand to Emmeline.\r\n\r\nThe two fugitives glided noiselessly from the house, and flitted,\r\nthrough the gathering shadows of evening, along by the quarters. The\r\ncrescent moon, set like a silver signet in the western sky, delayed a\r\nlittle the approach of night. As Cassy expected, when quite near the\r\nverge of the swamps that encircled the plantation, they heard a voice\r\ncalling to them to stop. It was not Sambo, however, but Legree, who was\r\npursuing them with violent execrations. At the sound, the feebler\r\nspirit of Emmeline gave way; and, laying hold of Cassy\xe2\x80\x99s arm, she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Cassy, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to faint!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, drawing a small, glittering\r\nstiletto, and flashing it before the eyes of the girl.\r\n\r\nThe diversion accomplished the purpose. Emmeline did not faint, and\r\nsucceeded in plunging, with Cassy, into a part of the labyrinth of\r\nswamp, so deep and dark that it was perfectly hopeless for Legree to\r\nthink of following them, without assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, chuckling brutally; \xe2\x80\x9cat any rate, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nthemselves into a trap now\xe2\x80\x94the baggage! They\xe2\x80\x99re safe enough. They shall\r\nsweat for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHulloa, there! Sambo! Quimbo! All hands!\xe2\x80\x9d called Legree, coming to the\r\nquarters, when the men and women were just returning from work.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s two runaways in the swamps. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give five dollars to any\r\nnigger as catches \xe2\x80\x99em. Turn out the dogs! Turn out Tiger, and Fury, and\r\nthe rest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sensation produced by this news was immediate. Many of the men\r\nsprang forward, officiously, to offer their services, either from the\r\nhope of the reward, or from that cringing subserviency which is one of\r\nthe most baleful effects of slavery. Some ran one way, and some\r\nanother. Some were for getting flambeaux of pine-knots. Some were\r\nuncoupling the dogs, whose hoarse, savage bay added not a little to the\r\nanimation of the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r, shall we shoot \xe2\x80\x99em, if can\xe2\x80\x99t cotch \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo, to whom\r\nhis master brought out a rifle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may fire on Cass, if you like; it\xe2\x80\x99s time she was gone to the\r\ndevil, where she belongs; but the gal, not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\r\nboys, be spry and smart. Five dollars for him that gets \xe2\x80\x99em; and a\r\nglass of spirits to every one of you, anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole band, with the glare of blazing torches, and whoop, and\r\nshout, and savage yell, of man and beast, proceeded down to the swamp,\r\nfollowed, at some distance, by every servant in the house. The\r\nestablishment was, of a consequence, wholly deserted, when Cassy and\r\nEmmeline glided into it the back way. The whooping and shouts of their\r\npursuers were still filling the air; and, looking from the sitting-room\r\nwindows, Cassy and Emmeline could see the troop, with their flambeaux,\r\njust dispersing themselves along the edge of the swamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee there!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline, pointing to Cassy; \xe2\x80\x9cthe hunt is begun! Look\r\nhow those lights dance about! Hark! the dogs! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear? If we\r\nwere only _there_, our chances wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be worth a picayune. O, for\r\npity\xe2\x80\x99s sake, do let\xe2\x80\x99s hide ourselves. Quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no occasion for hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, coolly; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are all out\r\nafter the hunt,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the amusement of the evening! We\xe2\x80\x99ll go up\r\nstairs, by and by. Meanwhile,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, deliberately taking a key from\r\nthe pocket of a coat that Legree had thrown down in his hurry,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmeanwhile I shall take something to pay our passage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe unlocked the desk, took from it a roll of bills, which she counted\r\nover rapidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s do that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not? Would you have us starve in the swamps,\r\nor have that that will pay our way to the free states. Money will do\r\nanything, girl.\xe2\x80\x9d And, as she spoke, she put the money in her bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be stealing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline, in a distressed whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStealing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, with a scornful laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cThey who steal body and\r\nsoul needn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to us. Every one of these bills is stolen,\xe2\x80\x94stolen\r\nfrom poor, starving, sweating creatures, who must go to the devil at\r\nlast, for his profit. Let _him_ talk about stealing! But come, we may\r\nas well go up garret; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a stock of candles there, and some books\r\nto pass away the time. You may be pretty sure they won\xe2\x80\x99t come _there_\r\nto inquire after us. If they do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll play ghost for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Emmeline reached the garret, she found an immense box, in which\r\nsome heavy pieces of furniture had once been brought, turned on its\r\nside, so that the opening faced the wall, or rather the eaves. Cassy\r\nlit a small lamp, and creeping round under the eaves, they established\r\nthemselves in it. It was spread with a couple of small mattresses and\r\nsome pillows; a box near by was plentifully stored with candles,\r\nprovisions, and all the clothing necessary to their journey, which\r\nCassy had arranged into bundles of an astonishingly small compass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, as she fixed the lamp into a small hook, which she\r\nhad driven into the side of the box for that purpose; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is to be\r\nour home for the present. How do you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure they won\xe2\x80\x99t come and search the garret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Simon Legree doing that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed; he\r\nwill be too glad to keep away. As to the servants, they would any of\r\nthem stand and be shot, sooner than show their faces here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomewhat reassured, Emmeline settled herself back on her pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you mean, Cassy, by saying you would kill me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nsimply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant to stop your fainting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, \xe2\x80\x9cand I did do it. And now\r\nI tell you, Emmeline, you must make up your mind _not_ to faint, let\r\nwhat will come; there\xe2\x80\x99s no sort of need of it. If I had not stopped\r\nyou, that wretch might have had his hands on you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmmeline shuddered.\r\n\r\nThe two remained some time in silence. Cassy busied herself with a\r\nFrench book; Emmeline, overcome with the exhaustion, fell into a doze,\r\nand slept some time. She was awakened by loud shouts and outcries, the\r\ntramp of horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet, and the baying of dogs. She started up, with a\r\nfaint shriek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the hunt coming back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, coolly; \xe2\x80\x9cnever fear. Look out\r\nof this knot-hole. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see \xe2\x80\x99em all down there? Simon has to give\r\nup, for this night. Look, how muddy his horse is, flouncing about in\r\nthe swamp; the dogs, too, look rather crestfallen. Ah, my good sir,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to try the race again and again,\xe2\x80\x94the game isn\xe2\x80\x99t there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak a word!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat if they should hear you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they do hear anything, it will make them very particular to keep\r\naway,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy. \xe2\x80\x9cNo danger; we may make any noise we please, and it\r\nwill only add to the effect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt length the stillness of midnight settled down over the house.\r\nLegree, cursing his ill luck, and vowing dire vengeance on the morrow,\r\nwent to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\nThe Martyr\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeem not the just by Heaven forgot!\r\n    Though life its common gifts deny,\xe2\x80\x94\r\nThough, with a crushed and bleeding heart,\r\n    And spurned of man, he goes to die!\r\nFor God hath marked each sorrowing day,\r\n    And numbered every bitter tear,\r\nAnd heaven\xe2\x80\x99s long years of bliss shall pay\r\n    For all his children suffer here.\xe2\x80\x9d BRYANT.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] This poem does not appear in the collected works of William Cullen\r\n Bryant, nor in the collected poems of his brother, John Howard Bryant.\r\n It was probably copied from a newspaper or magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe longest way must have its close,\xe2\x80\x94the gloomiest night will wear on\r\nto a morning. An eternal, inexorable lapse of moments is ever hurrying\r\nthe day of the evil to an eternal night, and the night of the just to\r\nan eternal day. We have walked with our humble friend thus far in the\r\nvalley of slavery; first through flowery fields of ease and indulgence,\r\nthen through heart-breaking separations from all that man holds dear.\r\nAgain, we have waited with him in a sunny island, where generous hands\r\nconcealed his chains with flowers; and, lastly, we have followed him\r\nwhen the last ray of earthly hope went out in night, and seen how, in\r\nthe blackness of earthly darkness, the firmament of the unseen has\r\nblazed with stars of new and significant lustre.\r\n\r\nThe morning-star now stands over the tops of the mountains, and gales\r\nand breezes, not of earth, show that the gates of day are unclosing.\r\n\r\nThe escape of Cassy and Emmeline irritated the before surly temper of\r\nLegree to the last degree; and his fury, as was to be expected, fell\r\nupon the defenceless head of Tom. When he hurriedly announced the\r\ntidings among his hands, there was a sudden light in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s eye, a\r\nsudden upraising of his hands, that did not escape him. He saw that he\r\ndid not join the muster of the pursuers. He thought of forcing him to\r\ndo it; but, having had, of old, experience of his inflexibility when\r\ncommanded to take part in any deed of inhumanity, he would not, in his\r\nhurry, stop to enter into any conflict with him.\r\n\r\nTom, therefore, remained behind, with a few who had learned of him to\r\npray, and offered up prayers for the escape of the fugitives.\r\n\r\nWhen Legree returned, baffled and disappointed, all the long-working\r\nhatred of his soul towards his slave began to gather in a deadly and\r\ndesperate form. Had not this man braved him,\xe2\x80\x94steadily, powerfully,\r\nresistlessly,\xe2\x80\x94ever since he bought him? Was there not a spirit in him\r\nwhich, silent as it was, burned on him like the fires of perdition?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _hate_ him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, that night, as he sat up in his bed; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n_hate_ him! And isn\xe2\x80\x99t he MINE? Can\xe2\x80\x99t I do what I like with him? Who\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto hinder, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d And Legree clenched his fist, and shook it, as if\r\nhe had something in his hands that he could rend in pieces.\r\n\r\nBut, then, Tom was a faithful, valuable servant; and, although Legree\r\nhated him the more for that, yet the consideration was still somewhat\r\nof a restraint to him.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, he determined to say nothing, as yet; to assemble a\r\nparty, from some neighboring plantations, with dogs and guns; to\r\nsurround the swamp, and go about the hunt systematically. If it\r\nsucceeded, well and good; if not, he would summon Tom before him,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94his teeth clenched and his blood boiled\xe2\x80\x94_then_ he would break the\r\nfellow down, or\xe2\x80\x94there was a dire inward whisper, to which his soul\r\nassented.\r\n\r\nYe say that the _interest_ of the master is a sufficient safeguard for\r\nthe slave. In the fury of man\xe2\x80\x99s mad will, he will wittingly, and with\r\nopen eye, sell his own soul to the devil to gain his ends; and will he\r\nbe more careful of his neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s body?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, the next day, from the garret, as she reconnoitred\r\nthrough the knot-hole, \xe2\x80\x9cthe hunt\xe2\x80\x99s going to begin again, today!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree or four mounted horsemen were curvetting about, on the space in\r\nfront of the house; and one or two leashes of strange dogs were\r\nstruggling with the negroes who held them, baying and barking at each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe men are, two of them, overseers of plantations in the vicinity; and\r\nothers were some of Legree\xe2\x80\x99s associates at the tavern-bar of a\r\nneighboring city, who had come for the interest of the sport. A more\r\nhard-favored set, perhaps, could not be imagined. Legree was serving\r\nbrandy, profusely, round among them, as also among the negroes, who had\r\nbeen detailed from the various plantations for this service; for it was\r\nan object to make every service of this kind, among the negroes, as\r\nmuch of a holiday as possible.\r\n\r\nCassy placed her ear at the knot-hole; and, as the morning air blew\r\ndirectly towards the house, she could overhear a good deal of the\r\nconversation. A grave sneer overcast the dark, severe gravity of her\r\nface, as she listened, and heard them divide out the ground, discuss\r\nthe rival merits of the dogs, give orders about firing, and the\r\ntreatment of each, in case of capture.\r\n\r\nCassy drew back; and, clasping her hands, looked upward, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cO,\r\ngreat Almighty God! we are _all_ sinners; but what have _we_ done, more\r\nthan all the rest of the world, that we should be treated so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a terrible earnestness in her face and voice, as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for _you_, child,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at Emmeline, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n_go_ out to them; and I\xe2\x80\x99d thank any one of them that _would_ shoot me\r\ndown; for what use will freedom be to me? Can it give me back my\r\nchildren, or make me what I used to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmmeline, in her child-like simplicity, was half afraid of the dark\r\nmoods of Cassy. She looked perplexed, but made no answer. She only took\r\nher hand, with a gentle, caressing movement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, trying to draw it away; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll get me to loving\r\nyou; and I never mean to love anything, again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Cassy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t feel so! If the Lord gives us\r\nliberty, perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99ll give you back your daughter; at any rate, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe like a daughter to you. I know I\xe2\x80\x99ll never see my poor old mother\r\nagain! I shall love you, Cassy, whether you love me or not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentle, child-like spirit conquered. Cassy sat down by her, put her\r\narm round her neck, stroked her soft, brown hair; and Emmeline then\r\nwondered at the beauty of her magnificent eyes, now soft with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Em!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve hungered for my children, and thirsted for\r\nthem, and my eyes fail with longing for them! Here! here!\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nstriking her breast, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all desolate, all empty! If God would give\r\nme back my children, then I could pray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must trust him, Cassy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emmeline; \xe2\x80\x9che is our Father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis wrath is upon us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy; \xe2\x80\x9che has turned away in anger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Cassy! He will be good to us! Let us hope in Him,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEmmeline,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI always have had hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hunt was long, animated, and thorough, but unsuccessful; and, with\r\ngrave, ironic exultation, Cassy looked down on Legree, as, weary and\r\ndispirited, he alighted from his horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Quimbo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, as he stretched himself down in the\r\nsitting-room, \xe2\x80\x9cyou jest go and walk that Tom up here, right away! The\r\nold cuss is at the bottom of this yer whole matter; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have it\r\nout of his old black hide, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll know the reason why!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSambo and Quimbo, both, though hating each other, were joined in one\r\nmind by a no less cordial hatred of Tom. Legree had told them, at\r\nfirst, that he had bought him for a general overseer, in his absence;\r\nand this had begun an ill will, on their part, which had increased, in\r\ntheir debased and servile natures, as they saw him becoming obnoxious\r\nto their master\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure. Quimbo, therefore, departed, with a\r\nwill, to execute his orders.\r\n\r\nTom heard the message with a forewarning heart; for he knew all the\r\nplan of the fugitives\xe2\x80\x99 escape, and the place of their present\r\nconcealment;\xe2\x80\x94he knew the deadly character of the man he had to deal\r\nwith, and his despotic power. But he felt strong in God to meet death,\r\nrather than betray the helpless.\r\n\r\nHe sat his basket down by the row, and, looking up, said, \xe2\x80\x9cInto thy\r\nhands I commend my spirit! Thou hast redeemed me, oh Lord God of\r\ntruth!\xe2\x80\x9d and then quietly yielded himself to the rough, brutal grasp\r\nwith which Quimbo seized him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay!\xe2\x80\x9d said the giant, as he dragged him along; \xe2\x80\x9cye\xe2\x80\x99ll cotch it,\r\nnow! I\xe2\x80\x99ll boun\xe2\x80\x99 Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s back \xe2\x80\x99s up _high!_ No sneaking out, now! Tell\r\nye, ye\xe2\x80\x99ll get it, and no mistake! See how ye\xe2\x80\x99ll look, now, helpin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s niggers to run away! See what ye\xe2\x80\x99ll get!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe savage words none of them reached that ear!\xe2\x80\x94a higher voice there\r\nwas saying, \xe2\x80\x9cFear not them that kill the body, and, after that, have no\r\nmore that they can do.\xe2\x80\x9d Nerve and bone of that poor man\xe2\x80\x99s body vibrated\r\nto those words, as if touched by the finger of God; and he felt the\r\nstrength of a thousand souls in one. As he passed along, the trees and\r\nbushes, the huts of his servitude, the whole scene of his degradation,\r\nseemed to whirl by him as the landscape by the rushing ear. His soul\r\nthrobbed,\xe2\x80\x94his home was in sight,\xe2\x80\x94and the hour of release seemed at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, walking up, and seizing him grimly by the\r\ncollar of his coat, and speaking through his teeth, in a paroxysm of\r\ndetermined rage, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know I\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind to KILL YOU?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very likely, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _have_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, with a grim, terrible calmness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_done\xe2\x80\x94just\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x94thing_, Tom, unless you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me what you know about\r\nthese yer gals!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom stood silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye hear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, stamping, with a roar like that of an\r\nincensed lion. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I han\xe2\x80\x99t got nothing to tell, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with a slow, firm,\r\ndeliberate utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you dare to tell me, ye old black Christian, ye don\xe2\x80\x99t _know_?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLegree.\r\n\r\nTom was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak!\xe2\x80\x9d thundered Legree, striking him furiously. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know\r\nanything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell anything. _I can die!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLegree drew in a long breath; and, suppressing his rage, took Tom by\r\nthe arm, and, approaching his face almost to his, said, in a terrible\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cHark \xe2\x80\x99e, Tom!\xe2\x80\x94ye think, \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99ve let you off before, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean what I say; but, this time, _I\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind_, and counted\r\nthe cost. You\xe2\x80\x99ve always stood it out again\xe2\x80\x99 me: now, _I\xe2\x80\x99ll conquer ye,\r\nor kill ye!_\xe2\x80\x94one or t\xe2\x80\x99 other. I\xe2\x80\x99ll count every drop of blood there is\r\nin you, and take \xe2\x80\x99em, one by one, till ye give up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom looked up to his master, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r, if you was sick, or\r\nin trouble, or dying, and I could save ye, I\xe2\x80\x99d _give_ ye my heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblood; and, if taking every drop of blood in this poor old body would\r\nsave your precious soul, I\xe2\x80\x99d give \xe2\x80\x99em freely, as the Lord gave his for\r\nme. O, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r! don\xe2\x80\x99t bring this great sin on your soul! It will hurt you\r\nmore than \xe2\x80\x99t will me! Do the worst you can, my troubles\xe2\x80\x99ll be over\r\nsoon; but, if ye don\xe2\x80\x99t repent, yours won\xe2\x80\x99t _never_ end!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLike a strange snatch of heavenly music, heard in the lull of a\r\ntempest, this burst of feeling made a moment\xe2\x80\x99s blank pause. Legree\r\nstood aghast, and looked at Tom; and there was such a silence, that the\r\ntick of the old clock could be heard, measuring, with silent touch, the\r\nlast moments of mercy and probation to that hardened heart.\r\n\r\nIt was but a moment. There was one hesitating pause,\xe2\x80\x94one irresolute,\r\nrelenting thrill,\xe2\x80\x94and the spirit of evil came back, with seven-fold\r\nvehemence; and Legree, foaming with rage, smote his victim to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\nScenes of blood and cruelty are shocking to our ear and heart. What man\r\nhas nerve to do, man has not nerve to hear. What brother-man and\r\nbrother-Christian must suffer, cannot be told us, even in our secret\r\nchamber, it so harrows the soul! And yet, oh my country! these things\r\nare done under the shadow of thy laws! O, Christ! thy church sees them,\r\nalmost in silence!\r\n\r\nBut, of old, there was One whose suffering changed an instrument of\r\ntorture, degradation and shame, into a symbol of glory, honor, and\r\nimmortal life; and, where His spirit is, neither degrading stripes, nor\r\nblood, nor insults, can make the Christian\xe2\x80\x99s last struggle less than\r\nglorious.\r\n\r\nWas he alone, that long night, whose brave, loving spirit was bearing\r\nup, in that old shed, against buffeting and brutal stripes?\r\n\r\nNay! There stood by him ONE,\xe2\x80\x94seen by him alone,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clike unto the Son of\r\nGod.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tempter stood by him, too,\xe2\x80\x94blinded by furious, despotic will,\xe2\x80\x94every\r\nmoment pressing him to shun that agony by the betrayal of the innocent.\r\nBut the brave, true heart was firm on the Eternal Rock. Like his\r\nMaster, he knew that, if he saved others, himself he could not save;\r\nnor could utmost extremity wring from him words, save of prayers and\r\nholy trust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s most gone, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo, touched, in spite of himself, by\r\nthe patience of his victim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPay away, till he gives up! Give it to him!\xe2\x80\x94give it to him!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\r\nLegree. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take every drop of blood he has, unless he confesses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom opened his eyes, and looked upon his master. \xe2\x80\x9cYe poor miserable\r\ncritter!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no more ye can do! I forgive ye, with\r\nall my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d and he fainted entirely away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI b\xe2\x80\x99lieve, my soul, he\xe2\x80\x99s done for, finally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, stepping\r\nforward, to look at him. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is! Well, his mouth\xe2\x80\x99s shut up, at\r\nlast,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s one comfort!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, Legree; but who shall shut up that voice in thy soul? that soul,\r\npast repentance, past prayer, past hope, in whom the fire that never\r\nshall be quenched is already burning!\r\n\r\nYet Tom was not quite gone. His wondrous words and pious prayers had\r\nstruck upon the hearts of the imbruted blacks, who had been the\r\ninstruments of cruelty upon him; and, the instant Legree withdrew, they\r\ntook him down, and, in their ignorance, sought to call him back to\r\nlife,\xe2\x80\x94as if _that_ were any favor to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSartin, we \xe2\x80\x99s been doin\xe2\x80\x99 a drefful wicked thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo; \xe2\x80\x9chopes\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99ll have to \xe2\x80\x99count for it, and not we.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey washed his wounds,\xe2\x80\x94they provided a rude bed, of some refuse\r\ncotton, for him to lie down on; and one of them, stealing up to the\r\nhouse, begged a drink of brandy of Legree, pretending that he was\r\ntired, and wanted it for himself. He brought it back, and poured it\r\ndown Tom\xe2\x80\x99s throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d said Quimbo, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99s been awful wicked to ye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgive ye, with all my heart!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Tom! do tell us who is _Jesus_, anyhow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cJesus, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen a standin\xe2\x80\x99 by you so, all this night!\xe2\x80\x94Who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe word roused the failing, fainting spirit. He poured forth a few\r\nenergetic sentences of that wondrous One,\xe2\x80\x94his life, his death, his\r\neverlasting presence, and power to save.\r\n\r\nThey wept,\xe2\x80\x94both the two savage men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t I never hear this before?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sambo; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do believe!\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help it! Lord Jesus, have mercy on us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor critters!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to bar all I have, if it\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nonly bring ye to Christ! O, Lord! give me these two more souls, I\r\npray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat prayer was answered!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\nThe Young Master\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days after, a young man drove a light wagon up through the avenue\r\nof China trees, and, throwing the reins hastily on the horse\xe2\x80\x99s neck,\r\nsprang out and inquired for the owner of the place.\r\n\r\nIt was George Shelby; and, to show how he came to be there, we must go\r\nback in our story.\r\n\r\nThe letter of Miss Ophelia to Mrs. Shelby had, by some unfortunate\r\naccident, been detained, for a month or two, at some remote\r\npost-office, before it reached its destination; and, of course, before\r\nit was received, Tom was already lost to view among the distant swamps\r\nof the Red River.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby read the intelligence with the deepest concern; but any\r\nimmediate action upon it was an impossibility. She was then in\r\nattendance on the sick-bed of her husband, who lay delirious in the\r\ncrisis of a fever. Master George Shelby, who, in the interval, had\r\nchanged from a boy to a tall young man, was her constant and faithful\r\nassistant, and her only reliance in superintending his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffairs. Miss Ophelia had taken the precaution to send them the name of\r\nthe lawyer who did business for the St. Clares; and the most that, in\r\nthe emergency, could be done, was to address a letter of inquiry to\r\nhim. The sudden death of Mr. Shelby, a few days after, brought, of\r\ncourse, an absorbing pressure of other interests, for a season.\r\n\r\nMr. Shelby showed his confidence in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s ability, by appointing\r\nher sole executrix upon his estates; and thus immediately a large and\r\ncomplicated amount of business was brought upon her hands.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby, with characteristic energy, applied herself to the work of\r\nstraightening the entangled web of affairs; and she and George were for\r\nsome time occupied with collecting and examining accounts, selling\r\nproperty and settling debts; for Mrs. Shelby was determined that\r\neverything should be brought into tangible and recognizable shape, let\r\nthe consequences to her prove what they might. In the mean time, they\r\nreceived a letter from the lawyer to whom Miss Ophelia had referred\r\nthem, saying that he knew nothing of the matter; that the man was sold\r\nat a public auction, and that, beyond receiving the money, he knew\r\nnothing of the affair.\r\n\r\nNeither George nor Mrs. Shelby could be easy at this result; and,\r\naccordingly, some six months after, the latter, having business for his\r\nmother, down the river, resolved to visit New Orleans, in person, and\r\npush his inquiries, in hopes of discovering Tom\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts, and\r\nrestoring him.\r\n\r\nAfter some months of unsuccessful search, by the merest accident,\r\nGeorge fell in with a man, in New Orleans, who happened to be possessed\r\nof the desired information; and with his money in his pocket, our hero\r\ntook steamboat for Red River, resolving to find out and re-purchase his\r\nold friend.\r\n\r\nHe was soon introduced into the house, where he found Legree in the\r\nsitting-room.\r\n\r\nLegree received the stranger with a kind of surly hospitality,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you bought, in New Orleans, a\r\nboy, named Tom. He used to be on my father\xe2\x80\x99s place, and I came to see\r\nif I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy him back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLegree\xe2\x80\x99s brow grew dark, and he broke out, passionately: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did\r\nbuy such a fellow,\xe2\x80\x94and a h\xe2\x80\x94l of a bargain I had of it, too! The most\r\nrebellious, saucy, impudent dog! Set up my niggers to run away; got off\r\ntwo gals, worth eight hundred or a thousand apiece. He owned to that,\r\nand, when I bid him tell me where they was, he up and said he knew, but\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell; and stood to it, though I gave him the cussedest\r\nflogging I ever gave nigger yet. I b\xe2\x80\x99lieve he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to die; but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know as he\xe2\x80\x99ll make it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d said George, impetuously. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me see him.\xe2\x80\x9d The cheeks\r\nof the young man were crimson, and his eyes flashed fire; but he\r\nprudently said nothing, as yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in dat ar shed,\xe2\x80\x9d said a little fellow, who stood holding George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nLegree kicked the boy, and swore at him; but George, without saying\r\nanother word, turned and strode to the spot.\r\n\r\nTom had been lying two days since the fatal night, not suffering, for\r\nevery nerve of suffering was blunted and destroyed. He lay, for the\r\nmost part, in a quiet stupor; for the laws of a powerful and well-knit\r\nframe would not at once release the imprisoned spirit. By stealth,\r\nthere had been there, in the darkness of the night, poor desolated\r\ncreatures, who stole from their scanty hours\xe2\x80\x99 rest, that they might\r\nrepay to him some of those ministrations of love in which he had always\r\nbeen so abundant. Truly, those poor disciples had little to give,\xe2\x80\x94only\r\nthe cup of cold water; but it was given with full hearts.\r\n\r\nTears had fallen on that honest, insensible face,\xe2\x80\x94tears of late\r\nrepentance in the poor, ignorant heathen, whom his dying love and\r\npatience had awakened to repentance, and bitter prayers, breathed over\r\nhim to a late-found Saviour, of whom they scarce knew more than the\r\nname, but whom the yearning ignorant heart of man never implores in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nCassy, who had glided out of her place of concealment, and, by\r\noverhearing, learned the sacrifice that had been made for her and\r\nEmmeline, had been there, the night before, defying the danger of\r\ndetection; and, moved by the last few words which the affectionate soul\r\nhad yet strength to breathe, the long winter of despair, the ice of\r\nyears, had given way, and the dark, despairing woman had wept and\r\nprayed.\r\n\r\nWhen George entered the shed, he felt his head giddy and his heart\r\nsick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible,\xe2\x80\x94is it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, kneeling down by him. \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\r\nTom, my poor, poor old friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething in the voice penetrated to the ear of the dying. He moved his\r\nhead gently, smiled, and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJesus can make a dying-bed\r\nFeel soft as down pillows are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nTears which did honor to his manly heart fell from the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes, as he bent over his poor friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, dear Uncle Tom! do wake,\xe2\x80\x94do speak once more! Look up! Here\xe2\x80\x99s Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\r\nGeorge,\xe2\x80\x94your own little Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r George!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, opening his eyes, and speaking in a feeble\r\nvoice; \xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r George!\xe2\x80\x9d He looked bewildered.\r\n\r\nSlowly the idea seemed to fill his soul; and the vacant eye became\r\nfixed and brightened, the whole face lighted up, the hard hands\r\nclasped, and tears ran down the cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless the Lord! it is,\xe2\x80\x94it is,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all I wanted! They haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgot\r\nme. It warms my soul; it does my heart good! Now I shall die content!\r\nBless the Lord, on my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shan\xe2\x80\x99t die! you _mustn\xe2\x80\x99t_ die, nor think of it! I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to buy\r\nyou, and take you home,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, with impetuous vehemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George, ye\xe2\x80\x99re too late. The Lord\xe2\x80\x99s bought me, and is going to\r\ntake me home,\xe2\x80\x94and I long to go. Heaven is better than Kintuck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, don\xe2\x80\x99t die! It\xe2\x80\x99ll kill me!\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99ll break my heart to think what you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nsuffered,\xe2\x80\x94and lying in this old shed, here! Poor, poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t call me poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cI _have_ been poor\r\nfellow; but that\xe2\x80\x99s all past and gone, now. I\xe2\x80\x99m right in the door, going\r\ninto glory! O, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George! _Heaven has come!_ I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the\r\nvictory!\xe2\x80\x94the Lord Jesus has given it to me! Glory be to His name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge was awe-struck at the force, the vehemence, the power, with\r\nwhich these broken sentences were uttered. He sat gazing in silence.\r\n\r\nTom grasped his hand, and continued,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t, now, tell Chloe, poor\r\nsoul! how ye found me;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98t would be so drefful to her. Only tell her ye\r\nfound me going into glory; and that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay for no one. And\r\ntell her the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s stood by me everywhere and al\xe2\x80\x99ays, and made\r\neverything light and easy. And oh, the poor chil\xe2\x80\x99en, and the baby;\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nold heart\xe2\x80\x99s been most broke for \xe2\x80\x99em, time and agin! Tell \xe2\x80\x99em all to\r\nfollow me\xe2\x80\x94follow me! Give my love to Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, and dear good Missis, and\r\neverybody in the place! Ye don\xe2\x80\x99t know! \xe2\x80\x99Pears like I loves \xe2\x80\x99em all! I\r\nloves every creature everywhar!\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing _but_ love! O, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r\r\nGeorge! what a thing \xe2\x80\x99t is to be a Christian!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Legree sauntered up to the door of the shed, looked in,\r\nwith a dogged air of affected carelessness, and turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old Satan!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, in his indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a comfort to\r\nthink the devil will pay _him_ for this, some of these days!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x94oh, ye mustn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, grasping his hand; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s a poor\r\nmis\xe2\x80\x99able critter! it\xe2\x80\x99s awful to think on \xe2\x80\x99t! Oh, if he only could\r\nrepent, the Lord would forgive him now; but I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99feared he never will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said George; \xe2\x80\x9cI never want to see _him_ in heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George!\xe2\x80\x94it worries me! Don\xe2\x80\x99t feel so! He an\xe2\x80\x99t done me no\r\nreal harm,\xe2\x80\x94only opened the gate of the kingdom for me; that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the sudden flush of strength which the joy of meeting\r\nhis young master had infused into the dying man gave way. A sudden\r\nsinking fell upon him; he closed his eyes; and that mysterious and\r\nsublime change passed over his face, that told the approach of other\r\nworlds.\r\n\r\nHe began to draw his breath with long, deep inspirations; and his broad\r\nchest rose and fell, heavily. The expression of his face was that of a\r\nconqueror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho,\xe2\x80\x94who,\xe2\x80\x94who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in\r\na voice that contended with mortal weakness; and, with a smile, he fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nGeorge sat fixed with solemn awe. It seemed to him that the place was\r\nholy; and, as he closed the lifeless eyes, and rose up from the dead,\r\nonly one thought possessed him,\xe2\x80\x94that expressed by his simple old\r\nfriend,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a thing it is to be a Christian!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned: Legree was standing, sullenly, behind him.\r\n\r\nSomething in that dying scene had checked the natural fierceness of\r\nyouthful passion. The presence of the man was simply loathsome to\r\nGeorge; and he felt only an impulse to get away from him, with as few\r\nwords as possible.\r\n\r\nFixing his keen dark eyes on Legree, he simply said, pointing to the\r\ndead, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have got all you ever can of him. What shall I pay you for\r\nthe body? I will take it away, and bury it decently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t sell dead niggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, doggedly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are welcome to\r\nbury him where and when you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoys,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, in an authoritative tone, to two or three negroes,\r\nwho were looking at the body, \xe2\x80\x9chelp me lift him up, and carry him to my\r\nwagon; and get me a spade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of them ran for a spade; the other two assisted George to carry the\r\nbody to the wagon.\r\n\r\nGeorge neither spoke to nor looked at Legree, who did not countermand\r\nhis orders, but stood, whistling, with an air of forced unconcern. He\r\nsulkily followed them to where the wagon stood at the door.\r\n\r\nGeorge spread his cloak in the wagon, and had the body carefully\r\ndisposed of in it,\xe2\x80\x94moving the seat, so as to give it room. Then he\r\nturned, fixed his eyes on Legree, and said, with forced composure,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not, as yet, said to you what I think of this most atrocious\r\naffair;\xe2\x80\x94this is not the time and place. But, sir, this innocent blood\r\nshall have justice. I will proclaim this murder. I will go to the very\r\nfirst magistrate, and expose you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree, snapping his fingers, scornfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see\r\nyou doing it. Where you going to get witnesses?\xe2\x80\x94how you going to prove\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94Come, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge saw, at once, the force of this defiance. There was not a white\r\nperson on the place; and, in all southern courts, the testimony of\r\ncolored blood is nothing. He felt, at that moment, as if he could have\r\nrent the heavens with his heart\xe2\x80\x99s indignant cry for justice; but in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, what a fuss, for a dead nigger!\xe2\x80\x9d said Legree.\r\n\r\nThe word was as a spark to a powder magazine. Prudence was never a\r\ncardinal virtue of the Kentucky boy. George turned, and, with one\r\nindignant blow, knocked Legree flat upon his face; and, as he stood\r\nover him, blazing with wrath and defiance, he would have formed no bad\r\npersonification of his great namesake triumphing over the dragon.\r\n\r\nSome men, however, are decidedly bettered by being knocked down. If a\r\nman lays them fairly flat in the dust, they seem immediately to\r\nconceive a respect for him; and Legree was one of this sort. As he\r\nrose, therefore, and brushed the dust from his clothes, he eyed the\r\nslowly-retreating wagon with some evident consideration; nor did he\r\nopen his mouth till it was out of sight.\r\n\r\nBeyond the boundaries of the plantation, George had noticed a dry,\r\nsandy knoll, shaded by a few trees; there they made the grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we take off the cloak, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r?\xe2\x80\x9d said the negroes, when the grave\r\nwas ready.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x94bury it with him! It\xe2\x80\x99s all I can give you, now, poor Tom, and\r\nyou shall have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laid him in; and the men shovelled away, silently. They banked it\r\nup, and laid green turf over it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may go, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, slipping a quarter into the hand of\r\neach. They lingered about, however.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf young Mas\xe2\x80\x99r would please buy us\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d serve him so faithful!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard times here, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r!\xe2\x80\x9d said the first. \xe2\x80\x9cDo, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r, buy us, please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, with difficulty, motioning them off;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor fellows looked dejected, and walked off in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWitness, eternal God!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, kneeling on the grave of his poor\r\nfriend; \xe2\x80\x9coh, witness, that, from this hour, I will do _what one man\r\ncan_ to drive out this curse of slavery from my land!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is no monument to mark the last resting-place of our friend. He\r\nneeds none! His Lord knows where he lies, and will raise him up,\r\nimmortal, to appear with him when he shall appear in his glory.\r\n\r\nPity him not! Such a life and death is not for pity! Not in the riches\r\nof omnipotence is the chief glory of God; but in self-denying,\r\nsuffering love! And blessed are the men whom he calls to fellowship\r\nwith him, bearing their cross after him with patience. Of such it is\r\nwritten, \xe2\x80\x9cBlessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\nAn Authentic Ghost Story\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some remarkable reason, ghostly legends were uncommonly rife, about\r\nthis time, among the servants on Legree\xe2\x80\x99s place.\r\n\r\nIt was whisperingly asserted that footsteps, in the dead of night, had\r\nbeen heard descending the garret stairs, and patrolling the house. In\r\nvain the doors of the upper entry had been locked; the ghost either\r\ncarried a duplicate key in its pocket, or availed itself of a ghost\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimmemorial privilege of coming through the keyhole, and promenaded as\r\nbefore, with a freedom that was alarming.\r\n\r\nAuthorities were somewhat divided, as to the outward form of the\r\nspirit, owing to a custom quite prevalent among negroes,\xe2\x80\x94and, for aught\r\nwe know, among whites, too,\xe2\x80\x94of invariably shutting the eyes, and\r\ncovering up heads under blankets, petticoats, or whatever else might\r\ncome in use for a shelter, on these occasions. Of course, as everybody\r\nknows, when the bodily eyes are thus out of the lists, the spiritual\r\neyes are uncommonly vivacious and perspicuous; and, therefore, there\r\nwere abundance of full-length portraits of the ghost, abundantly sworn\r\nand testified to, which, as is often the case with portraits, agreed\r\nwith each other in no particular, except the common family peculiarity\r\nof the ghost tribe,\xe2\x80\x94the wearing of a _white sheet_. The poor souls were\r\nnot versed in ancient history, and did not know that Shakspeare had\r\nauthenticated this costume, by telling how\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _sheeted_ dead\r\nDid squeak and gibber in the streets of Rome.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] _Hamlet_, Act I, scene 1, lines 115-116\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, therefore, their all hitting upon this is a striking fact in\r\npneumatology, which we recommend to the attention of spiritual media\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nBe it as it may, we have private reasons for knowing that a tall figure\r\nin a white sheet did walk, at the most approved ghostly hours, around\r\nthe Legree premises,\xe2\x80\x94pass out the doors, glide about the\r\nhouse,\xe2\x80\x94disappear at intervals, and, reappearing, pass up the silent\r\nstairway, into that fatal garret; and that, in the morning, the entry\r\ndoors were all found shut and locked as firm as ever.\r\n\r\nLegree could not help overhearing this whispering; and it was all the\r\nmore exciting to him, from the pains that were taken to conceal it from\r\nhim. He drank more brandy than usual; held up his head briskly, and\r\nswore louder than ever in the daytime; but he had bad dreams, and the\r\nvisions of his head on his bed were anything but agreeable. The night\r\nafter Tom\xe2\x80\x99s body had been carried away, he rode to the next town for a\r\ncarouse, and had a high one. Got home late and tired; locked his door,\r\ntook out the key, and went to bed.\r\n\r\nAfter all, let a man take what pains he may to hush it down, a human\r\nsoul is an awful ghostly, unquiet possession, for a bad man to have.\r\nWho knows the metes and bounds of it? Who knows all its awful\r\nperhapses,\xe2\x80\x94those shudderings and tremblings, which it can no more live\r\ndown than it can outlive its own eternity! What a fool is he who locks\r\nhis door to keep out spirits, who has in his own bosom a spirit he\r\ndares not meet alone,\xe2\x80\x94whose voice, smothered far down, and piled over\r\nwith mountains of earthliness, is yet like the forewarning trumpet of\r\ndoom!\r\n\r\nBut Legree locked his door and set a chair against it; he set a\r\nnight-lamp at the head of his bed; and put his pistols there. He\r\nexamined the catches and fastenings of the windows, and then swore he\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t care for the devil and all his angels,\xe2\x80\x9d and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nWell, he slept, for he was tired,\xe2\x80\x94slept soundly. But, finally, there\r\ncame over his sleep a shadow, a horror, an apprehension of something\r\ndreadful hanging over him. It was his mother\xe2\x80\x99s shroud, he thought; but\r\nCassy had it, holding it up, and showing it to him. He heard a confused\r\nnoise of screams and groanings; and, with it all, he knew he was\r\nasleep, and he struggled to wake himself. He was half awake. He was\r\nsure something was coming into his room. He knew the door was opening,\r\nbut he could not stir hand or foot. At last he turned, with a start;\r\nthe door _was_ open, and he saw a hand putting out his light.\r\n\r\nIt was a cloudy, misty moonlight, and there he saw it!\xe2\x80\x94something white,\r\ngliding in! He heard the still rustle of its ghostly garments. It stood\r\nstill by his bed;\xe2\x80\x94a cold hand touched his; a voice said, three times,\r\nin a low, fearful whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cCome! come! come!\xe2\x80\x9d And, while he lay\r\nsweating with terror, he knew not when or how, the thing was gone. He\r\nsprang out of bed, and pulled at the door. It was shut and locked, and\r\nthe man fell down in a swoon.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Legree became a harder drinker than ever before. He no\r\nlonger drank cautiously, prudently, but imprudently and recklessly.\r\n\r\nThere were reports around the country, soon after that he was sick and\r\ndying. Excess had brought on that frightful disease that seems to throw\r\nthe lurid shadows of a coming retribution back into the present life.\r\nNone could bear the horrors of that sick room, when he raved and\r\nscreamed, and spoke of sights which almost stopped the blood of those\r\nwho heard him; and, at his dying bed, stood a stern, white, inexorable\r\nfigure, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCome! come! come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy a singular coincidence, on the very night that this vision appeared\r\nto Legree, the house-door was found open in the morning, and some of\r\nthe negroes had seen two white figures gliding down the avenue towards\r\nthe high-road.\r\n\r\nIt was near sunrise when Cassy and Emmeline paused, for a moment, in a\r\nlittle knot of trees near the town.\r\n\r\nCassy was dressed after the manner of the Creole Spanish ladies,\xe2\x80\x94wholly\r\nin black. A small black bonnet on her head, covered by a veil thick\r\nwith embroidery, concealed her face. It had been agreed that, in their\r\nescape, she was to personate the character of a Creole lady, and\r\nEmmeline that of her servant.\r\n\r\nBrought up, from early life, in connection with the highest society,\r\nthe language, movements and air of Cassy, were all in agreement with\r\nthis idea; and she had still enough remaining with her, of a once\r\nsplendid wardrobe, and sets of jewels, to enable her to personate the\r\nthing to advantage.\r\n\r\nShe stopped in the outskirts of the town, where she had noticed trunks\r\nfor sale, and purchased a handsome one. This she requested the man to\r\nsend along with her. And, accordingly, thus escorted by a boy wheeling\r\nher trunk, and Emmeline behind her, carrying her carpet-bag and sundry\r\nbundles, she made her appearance at the small tavern, like a lady of\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe first person that struck her, after her arrival, was George Shelby,\r\nwho was staying there, awaiting the next boat.\r\n\r\nCassy had remarked the young man from her loophole in the garret, and\r\nseen him bear away the body of Tom, and observed with secret\r\nexultation, his rencontre with Legree. Subsequently she had gathered,\r\nfrom the conversations she had overheard among the negroes, as she\r\nglided about in her ghostly disguise, after nightfall, who he was, and\r\nin what relation he stood to Tom. She, therefore, felt an immediate\r\naccession of confidence, when she found that he was, like herself,\r\nawaiting the next boat.\r\n\r\nCassy\xe2\x80\x99s air and manner, address, and evident command of money,\r\nprevented any rising disposition to suspicion in the hotel. People\r\nnever inquire too closely into those who are fair on the main point, of\r\npaying well,\xe2\x80\x94a thing which Cassy had foreseen when she provided herself\r\nwith money.\r\n\r\nIn the edge of the evening, a boat was heard coming along, and George\r\nShelby handed Cassy aboard, with the politeness which comes naturally\r\nto every Kentuckian, and exerted himself to provide her with a good\r\nstate-room.\r\n\r\nCassy kept her room and bed, on pretext of illness, during the whole\r\ntime they were on Red River; and was waited on, with obsequious\r\ndevotion, by her attendant.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the Mississippi river, George, having learned that\r\nthe course of the strange lady was upward, like his own, proposed to\r\ntake a state-room for her on the same boat with himself,\xe2\x80\x94good-naturedly\r\ncompassionating her feeble health, and desirous to do what he could to\r\nassist her.\r\n\r\nBehold, therefore, the whole party safely transferred to the good\r\nsteamer Cincinnati, and sweeping up the river under a powerful head of\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\nCassy\xe2\x80\x99s health was much better. She sat upon the guards, came to the\r\ntable, and was remarked upon in the boat as a lady that must have been\r\nvery handsome.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that George got the first glimpse of her face, he was\r\ntroubled with one of those fleeting and indefinite likenesses, which\r\nalmost every body can remember, and has been, at times, perplexed with.\r\nHe could not keep himself from looking at her, and watching her\r\nperpetually. At table, or sitting at her state-room door, still she\r\nwould encounter the young man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fixed on her, and politely\r\nwithdrawn, when she showed, by her countenance, that she was sensible\r\nto the observation.\r\n\r\nCassy became uneasy. She began to think that he suspected something;\r\nand finally resolved to throw herself entirely on his generosity, and\r\nintrusted him with her whole history.\r\n\r\nGeorge was heartily disposed to sympathize with any one who had escaped\r\nfrom Legree\xe2\x80\x99s plantation,\xe2\x80\x94a place that he could not remember or speak\r\nof with patience,\xe2\x80\x94and, with the courageous disregard of consequences\r\nwhich is characteristic of his age and state, he assured her that he\r\nwould do all in his power to protect and bring them through.\r\n\r\nThe next state-room to Cassy\xe2\x80\x99s was occupied by a French lady, named De\r\nThoux, who was accompanied by a fine little daughter, a child of some\r\ntwelve summers.\r\n\r\nThis lady, having gathered, from George\xe2\x80\x99s conversation, that he was\r\nfrom Kentucky, seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his acquaintance;\r\nin which design she was seconded by the graces of her little girl, who\r\nwas about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a\r\nfortnight\xe2\x80\x99s trip on a steamboat.\r\n\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s chair was often placed at her state-room door; and Cassy, as\r\nshe sat upon the guards, could hear their conversation.\r\n\r\nMadame de Thoux was very minute in her inquiries as to Kentucky, where\r\nshe said she had resided in a former period of her life. George\r\ndiscovered, to his surprise, that her former residence must have been\r\nin his own vicinity; and her inquiries showed a knowledge of people and\r\nthings in his vicinity, that was perfectly surprising to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Thoux to him, one day, \xe2\x80\x9cof any man, in\r\nyour neighborhood, of the name of Harris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an old fellow, of that name, lives not far from my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cWe never have had much intercourse with him,\r\nthough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a large slave-owner, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Thoux, with a\r\nmanner which seemed to betray more interest than she was exactly\r\nwilling to show.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, looking rather surprised at her manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever know of his having\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, you may have heard of his\r\nhaving a mulatto boy, named George?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, certainly,\xe2\x80\x94George Harris,\xe2\x80\x94I know him well; he married a servant of\r\nmy mother\xe2\x80\x99s, but has escaped, now, to Canada.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has?\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Thoux, quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge looked a surprised inquiry, but said nothing.\r\n\r\nMadame de Thoux leaned her head on her hand, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is my brother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, with a strong accent of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Thoux, lifting her head, proudly, and wiping her\r\ntears, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Shelby, George Harris is my brother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am perfectly astonished,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, pushing back his chair a pace\r\nor two, and looking at Madame de Thoux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sold to the South when he was a boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI was bought by\r\na good and generous man. He took me with him to the West Indies, set me\r\nfree, and married me. It is but lately that he died; and I was going up\r\nto Kentucky, to see if I could find and redeem my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard him speak of a sister Emily, that was sold South,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed! I am the one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Thoux;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctell me what sort\r\nof a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very fine young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding the curse of\r\nslavery that lay on him. He sustained a first rate character, both for\r\nintelligence and principle. I know, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause he\r\nmarried in our family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a girl?\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Thoux, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA treasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said George; \xe2\x80\x9ca beautiful, intelligent, amiable girl.\r\nVery pious. My mother had brought her up, and trained her as carefully,\r\nalmost, as a daughter. She could read and write, embroider and sew,\r\nbeautifully; and was a beautiful singer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas she born in your house?\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Thoux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Father bought her once, in one of his trips to New Orleans, and\r\nbrought her up as a present to mother. She was about eight or nine\r\nyears old, then. Father would never tell mother what he gave for her;\r\nbut, the other day, in looking over his old papers, we came across the\r\nbill of sale. He paid an extravagant sum for her, to be sure. I\r\nsuppose, on account of her extraordinary beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge sat with his back to Cassy, and did not see the absorbed\r\nexpression of her countenance, as he was giving these details.\r\n\r\nAt this point in the story, she touched his arm, and, with a face\r\nperfectly white with interest, said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the names of the\r\npeople he bought her of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man of the name of Simmons, I think, was the principal in the\r\ntransaction. At least, I think that was the name on the bill of sale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cassy, and fell insensible on the floor of the cabin.\r\n\r\nGeorge was wide awake now, and so was Madame de Thoux. Though neither\r\nof them could conjecture what was the cause of Cassy\xe2\x80\x99s fainting, still\r\nthey made all the tumult which is proper in such cases;\xe2\x80\x94George\r\nupsetting a wash-pitcher, and breaking two tumblers, in the warmth of\r\nhis humanity; and various ladies in the cabin, hearing that somebody\r\nhad fainted, crowded the state-room door, and kept out all the air they\r\npossibly could, so that, on the whole, everything was done that could\r\nbe expected.\r\n\r\nPoor Cassy! when she recovered, turned her face to the wall, and wept\r\nand sobbed like a child,\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, mother, you can tell what she was\r\nthinking of! Perhaps you cannot,\xe2\x80\x94but she felt as sure, in that hour,\r\nthat God had had mercy on her, and that she should see her daughter,\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nshe did, months afterwards,\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x94but we anticipate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\nResults\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rest of our story is soon told. George Shelby, interested, as any\r\nother young man might be, by the romance of the incident, no less than\r\nby feelings of humanity, was at the pains to send to Cassy the bill of\r\nsale of Eliza; whose date and name all corresponded with her own\r\nknowledge of facts, and felt no doubt upon her mind as to the identity\r\nof her child. It remained now only for her to trace out the path of the\r\nfugitives.\r\n\r\nMadame de Thoux and she, thus drawn together by the singular\r\ncoincidence of their fortunes, proceeded immediately to Canada, and\r\nbegan a tour of inquiry among the stations, where the numerous\r\nfugitives from slavery are located. At Amherstberg they found the\r\nmissionary with whom George and Eliza had taken shelter, on their first\r\narrival in Canada; and through him were enabled to trace the family to\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Eliza had now been five years free. George had found\r\nconstant occupation in the shop of a worthy machinist, where he had\r\nbeen earning a competent support for his family, which, in the mean\r\ntime, had been increased by the addition of another daughter.\r\n\r\nLittle Harry\xe2\x80\x94a fine bright boy\xe2\x80\x94had been put to a good school, and was\r\nmaking rapid proficiency in knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe worthy pastor of the station, in Amherstberg, where George had\r\nfirst landed, was so much interested in the statements of Madame de\r\nThoux and Cassy, that he yielded to the solicitations of the former, to\r\naccompany them to Montreal, in their search,\xe2\x80\x94she bearing all the\r\nexpense of the expedition.\r\n\r\nThe scene now changes to a small, neat tenement, in the outskirts of\r\nMontreal; the time, evening. A cheerful fire blazes on the hearth; a\r\ntea-table, covered with a snowy cloth, stands prepared for the evening\r\nmeal. In one corner of the room was a table covered with a green cloth,\r\nwhere was an open writing-desk, pens, paper, and over it a shelf of\r\nwell-selected books.\r\n\r\nThis was George\xe2\x80\x99s study. The same zeal for self-improvement, which led\r\nhim to steal the much coveted arts of reading and writing, amid all the\r\ntoil and discouragements of his early life, still led him to devote all\r\nhis leisure time to self-cultivation.\r\n\r\nAt this present time, he is seated at the table, making notes from a\r\nvolume of the family library he has been reading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, George,\xe2\x80\x9d says Eliza, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been gone all day. Do put down that\r\nbook, and let\xe2\x80\x99s talk, while I\xe2\x80\x99m getting tea,\xe2\x80\x94do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd little Eliza seconds the effort, by toddling up to her father, and\r\ntrying to pull the book out of his hand, and install herself on his\r\nknee as a substitute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, you little witch!\xe2\x80\x9d says George, yielding, as, in such\r\ncircumstances, man always must.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d says Eliza, as she begins to cut a loaf of bread. A\r\nlittle older she looks; her form a little fuller; her air more matronly\r\nthan of yore; but evidently contented and happy as woman need be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry, my boy, how did you come on in that sum, today?\xe2\x80\x9d says George,\r\nas he laid his hand on his son\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\nHarry has lost his long curls; but he can never lose those eyes and\r\neyelashes, and that fine, bold brow, that flushes with triumph, as he\r\nanswers, \xe2\x80\x9cI did it, every bit of it, _myself_, father; and _nobody_\r\nhelped me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d says his father; \xe2\x80\x9cdepend on yourself, my son. You have\r\na better chance than ever your poor father had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, there is a rap at the door; and Eliza goes and opens\r\nit. The delighted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhy! this you?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94calls up her husband; and the good\r\npastor of Amherstberg is welcomed. There are two more women with him,\r\nand Eliza asks them to sit down.\r\n\r\nNow, if the truth must be told, the honest pastor had arranged a little\r\nprogramme, according to which this affair was to develop itself; and,\r\non the way up, all had very cautiously and prudently exhorted each\r\nother not to let things out, except according to previous arrangement.\r\n\r\nWhat was the good man\xe2\x80\x99s consternation, therefore, just as he had\r\nmotioned to the ladies to be seated, and was taking out his\r\npocket-handkerchief to wipe his mouth, so as to proceed to his\r\nintroductory speech in good order, when Madame de Thoux upset the whole\r\nplan, by throwing her arms around George\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and letting all out at\r\nonce, by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cO, George! don\xe2\x80\x99t you know me? I\xe2\x80\x99m your sister Emily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCassy had seated herself more composedly, and would have carried on her\r\npart very well, had not little Eliza suddenly appeared before her in\r\nexact shape and form, every outline and curl, just as her daughter was\r\nwhen she saw her last. The little thing peered up in her face; and\r\nCassy caught her up in her arms, pressed her to her bosom, saying,\r\nwhat, at the moment she really believed, \xe2\x80\x9cDarling, I\xe2\x80\x99m your mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was a troublesome matter to do up exactly in proper order;\r\nbut the good pastor, at last, succeeded in getting everybody quiet, and\r\ndelivering the speech with which he had intended to open the exercises;\r\nand in which, at last, he succeeded so well, that his whole audience\r\nwere sobbing about him in a manner that ought to satisfy any orator,\r\nancient or modern.\r\n\r\nThey knelt together, and the good man prayed,\xe2\x80\x94for there are some\r\nfeelings so agitated and tumultuous, that they can find rest only by\r\nbeing poured into the bosom of Almighty love,\xe2\x80\x94and then, rising up, the\r\nnew-found family embraced each other, with a holy trust in Him, who\r\nfrom such peril and dangers, and by such unknown ways, had brought them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe note-book of a missionary, among the Canadian fugitives, contains\r\ntruth stranger than fiction. How can it be otherwise, when a system\r\nprevails which whirls families and scatters their members, as the wind\r\nwhirls and scatters the leaves of autumn? These shores of refuge, like\r\nthe eternal shore, often unite again, in glad communion, hearts that\r\nfor long years have mourned each other as lost. And affecting beyond\r\nexpression is the earnestness with which every new arrival among them\r\nis met, if, perchance, it may bring tidings of mother, sister, child or\r\nwife, still lost to view in the shadows of slavery.\r\n\r\nDeeds of heroism are wrought here more than those of romance, when\r\ndefying torture, and braving death itself, the fugitive voluntarily\r\nthreads his way back to the terrors and perils of that dark land, that\r\nhe may bring out his sister, or mother, or wife.\r\n\r\nOne young man, of whom a missionary has told us, twice re-captured, and\r\nsuffering shameful stripes for his heroism, had escaped again; and, in\r\na letter which we heard read, tells his friends that he is going back a\r\nthird time, that he may, at last, bring away his sister. My good sir,\r\nis this man a hero, or a criminal? Would not you do as much for your\r\nsister? And can you blame him?\r\n\r\nBut, to return to our friends, whom we left wiping their eyes, and\r\nrecovering themselves from too great and sudden a joy. They are now\r\nseated around the social board, and are getting decidedly\r\ncompanionable; only that Cassy, who keeps little Eliza on her lap,\r\noccasionally squeezes the little thing, in a manner that rather\r\nastonishes her, and obstinately refuses to have her mouth stuffed with\r\ncake to the extent the little one desires,\xe2\x80\x94alleging, what the child\r\nrather wonders at, that she has got something better than cake, and\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t want it.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, in two or three days, such a change has passed over Cassy,\r\nthat our readers would scarcely know her. The despairing, haggard\r\nexpression of her face had given way to one of gentle trust. She seemed\r\nto sink, at once, into the bosom of the family, and take the little\r\nones into her heart, as something for which it long had waited. Indeed,\r\nher love seemed to flow more naturally to the little Eliza than to her\r\nown daughter; for she was the exact image and body of the child whom\r\nshe had lost. The little one was a flowery bond between mother and\r\ndaughter, through whom grew up acquaintanceship and affection. Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsteady, consistent piety, regulated by the constant reading of the\r\nsacred word, made her a proper guide for the shattered and wearied mind\r\nof her mother. Cassy yielded at once, and with her whole soul, to every\r\ngood influence, and became a devout and tender Christian.\r\n\r\nAfter a day or two, Madame de Thoux told her brother more particularly\r\nof her affairs. The death of her husband had left her an ample fortune,\r\nwhich she generously offered to share with the family. When she asked\r\nGeorge what way she could best apply it for him, he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cGive me\r\nan education, Emily; that has always been my heart\xe2\x80\x99s desire. Then, I\r\ncan do all the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn mature deliberation, it was decided that the whole family should go,\r\nfor some years, to France; whither they sailed, carrying Emmeline with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe good looks of the latter won the affection of the first mate of the\r\nvessel; and, shortly after entering the port, she became his wife.\r\n\r\nGeorge remained four years at a French university, and, applying\r\nhimself with an unintermitted zeal, obtained a very thorough education.\r\n\r\nPolitical troubles in France, at last, led the family again to seek an\r\nasylum in this country.\r\n\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s feelings and views, as an educated man, may be best expressed\r\nin a letter to one of his friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel somewhat at a loss, as to my future course. True, as you have\r\nsaid to me, I might mingle in the circles of the whites, in this\r\ncountry, my shade of color is so slight, and that of my wife and family\r\nscarce perceptible. Well, perhaps, on sufferance, I might. But, to tell\r\nyou the truth, I have no wish to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sympathies are not for my father\xe2\x80\x99s race, but for my mother\xe2\x80\x99s. To\r\nhim I was no more than a fine dog or horse: to my poor heart-broken\r\nmother I was a _child_; and, though I never saw her, after the cruel\r\nsale that separated us, till she died, yet I _know_ she always loved me\r\ndearly. I know it by my own heart. When I think of all she suffered, of\r\nmy own early sufferings, of the distresses and struggles of my heroic\r\nwife, of my sister, sold in the New Orleans slave-market,\xe2\x80\x94though I hope\r\nto have no unchristian sentiments, yet I may be excused for saying, I\r\nhave no wish to pass for an American, or to identify myself with them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is with the oppressed, enslaved African race that I cast in my lot;\r\nand, if I wished anything, I would wish myself two shades darker,\r\nrather than one lighter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe desire and yearning of my soul is for an African _nationality_. I\r\nwant a people that shall have a tangible, separate existence of its\r\nown; and where am I to look for it? Not in Hayti; for in Hayti they had\r\nnothing to start with. A stream cannot rise above its fountain. The\r\nrace that formed the character of the Haytiens was a worn-out,\r\neffeminate one; and, of course, the subject race will be centuries in\r\nrising to anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, then, shall I look? On the shores of Africa I see a republic,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nrepublic formed of picked men, who, by energy and self-educating force,\r\nhave, in many cases, individually, raised themselves above a condition\r\nof slavery. Having gone through a preparatory stage of feebleness, this\r\nrepublic has, at last, become an acknowledged nation on the face of the\r\nearth,\xe2\x80\x94acknowledged by both France and England. There it is my wish to\r\ngo, and find myself a people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am aware, now, that I shall have you all against me; but, before you\r\nstrike, hear me. During my stay in France, I have followed up, with\r\nintense interest, the history of my people in America. I have noted the\r\nstruggle between abolitionist and colonizationist, and have received\r\nsome impressions, as a distant spectator, which could never have\r\noccurred to me as a participator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI grant that this Liberia may have subserved all sorts of purposes, by\r\nbeing played off, in the hands of our oppressors, against us. Doubtless\r\nthe scheme may have been used, in unjustifiable ways, as a means of\r\nretarding our emancipation. But the question to me is, Is there not a\r\nGod above all man\xe2\x80\x99s schemes? May He not have over-ruled their designs,\r\nand founded for us a nation by them?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn these days, a nation is born in a day. A nation starts, now, with\r\nall the great problems of republican life and civilization wrought out\r\nto its hand;\xe2\x80\x94it has not to discover, but only to apply. Let us, then,\r\nall take hold together, with all our might, and see what we can do with\r\nthis new enterprise, and the whole splendid continent of Africa opens\r\nbefore us and our children. _Our nation_ shall roll the tide of\r\ncivilization and Christianity along its shores, and plant there mighty\r\nrepublics, that, growing with the rapidity of tropical vegetation,\r\nshall be for all coming ages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you say that I am deserting my enslaved brethren? I think not. If I\r\nforget them one hour, one moment of my life, so may God forget me! But,\r\nwhat can I do for them, here? Can I break their chains? No, not as an\r\nindividual; but, let me go and form part of a nation, which shall have\r\na voice in the councils of nations, and then we can speak. A nation has\r\na right to argue, remonstrate, implore, and present the cause of its\r\nrace,\xe2\x80\x94which an individual has not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Europe ever becomes a grand council of free nations,\xe2\x80\x94as I trust in\r\nGod it will,\xe2\x80\x94if, there, serfdom, and all unjust and oppressive social\r\ninequalities, are done away; and if they, as France and England have\r\ndone, acknowledge our position,\xe2\x80\x94then, in the great congress of nations,\r\nwe will make our appeal, and present the cause of our enslaved and\r\nsuffering race; and it cannot be that free, enlightened America will\r\nnot then desire to wipe from her escutcheon that bar sinister which\r\ndisgraces her among nations, and is as truly a curse to her as to the\r\nenslaved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, you will tell me, our race have equal rights to mingle in the\r\nAmerican republic as the Irishman, the German, the Swede. Granted, they\r\nhave. We _ought_ to be free to meet and mingle,\xe2\x80\x94to rise by our\r\nindividual worth, without any consideration of caste or color; and they\r\nwho deny us this right are false to their own professed principles of\r\nhuman equality. We ought, in particular, to be allowed _here_. We have\r\n_more_ than the rights of common men;\xe2\x80\x94we have the claim of an injured\r\nrace for reparation. But, then, _I do not want it_; I want a country, a\r\nnation, of my own. I think that the African race has peculiarities, yet\r\nto be unfolded in the light of civilization and Christianity, which, if\r\nnot the same with those of the Anglo-Saxon, may prove to be, morally,\r\nof even a higher type.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Anglo-Saxon race has been intrusted the destinies of the world,\r\nduring its pioneer period of struggle and conflict. To that mission its\r\nstern, inflexible, energetic elements, were well adapted; but, as a\r\nChristian, I look for another era to arise. On its borders I trust we\r\nstand; and the throes that now convulse the nations are, to my hope,\r\nbut the birth-pangs of an hour of universal peace and brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust that the development of Africa is to be essentially a\r\nChristian one. If not a dominant and commanding race, they are, at\r\nleast, an affectionate, magnanimous, and forgiving one. Having been\r\ncalled in the furnace of injustice and oppression, they have need to\r\nbind closer to their hearts that sublime doctrine of love and\r\nforgiveness, through which alone they are to conquer, which it is to be\r\ntheir mission to spread over the continent of Africa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn myself, I confess, I am feeble for this,\xe2\x80\x94full half the blood in my\r\nveins is the hot and hasty Saxon; but I have an eloquent preacher of\r\nthe Gospel ever by my side, in the person of my beautiful wife. When I\r\nwander, her gentler spirit ever restores me, and keeps before my eyes\r\nthe Christian calling and mission of our race. As a Christian patriot,\r\nas a teacher of Christianity, I go to _my country_,\xe2\x80\x94my chosen, my\r\nglorious Africa!\xe2\x80\x94and to her, in my heart, I sometimes apply those\r\nsplendid words of prophecy: \xe2\x80\x99Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated,\r\nso that no man went through thee; _I_ will make thee an eternal\r\nexcellence, a joy of many generations!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will call me an enthusiast: you will tell me that I have not well\r\nconsidered what I am undertaking. But I have considered, and counted\r\nthe cost. I go to _Liberia_, not as an Elysium of romance, but as to _a\r\nfield of work_. I expect to work with both hands,\xe2\x80\x94to work _hard_; to\r\nwork against all sorts of difficulties and discouragements; and to work\r\ntill I die. This is what I go for; and in this I am quite sure I shall\r\nnot be disappointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you may think of my determination, do not divorce me from\r\nyour confidence; and think that, in whatever I do, I act with a heart\r\nwholly given to my people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGEORGE HARRIS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge, with his wife, children, sister and mother, embarked for\r\nAfrica, some few weeks after. If we are not mistaken, the world will\r\nyet hear from him there.\r\n\r\nOf our other characters we have nothing very particular to write,\r\nexcept a word relating to Miss Ophelia and Topsy, and a farewell\r\nchapter, which we shall dedicate to George Shelby.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia took Topsy home to Vermont with her, much to the surprise\r\nof the grave deliberative body whom a New Englander recognizes under\r\nthe term \xe2\x80\x9c_Our folks_.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOur folks,\xe2\x80\x9d at first, thought it an odd and\r\nunnecessary addition to their well-trained domestic establishment; but,\r\nso thoroughly efficient was Miss Ophelia in her conscientious endeavor\r\nto do her duty by her _ilhve_, that the child rapidly grew in grace and\r\nin favor with the family and neighborhood. At the age of womanhood, she\r\nwas, by her own request, baptized, and became a member of the Christian\r\nchurch in the place; and showed so much intelligence, activity and\r\nzeal, and desire to do good in the world, that she was at last\r\nrecommended, and approved as a missionary to one of the stations in\r\nAfrica; and we have heard that the same activity and ingenuity which,\r\nwhen a child, made her so multiform and restless in her developments,\r\nis now employed, in a safer and wholesomer manner, in teaching the\r\nchildren of her own country.\r\n\r\nP.S.\xe2\x80\x94It will be a satisfaction to some mother, also, to state, that\r\nsome inquiries, which were set on foot by Madame de Thoux, have\r\nresulted recently in the discovery of Cassy\xe2\x80\x99s son. Being a young man of\r\nenergy, he had escaped, some years before his mother, and been received\r\nand educated by friends of the oppressed in the north. He will soon\r\nfollow his family to Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\nThe Liberator\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Shelby had written to his mother merely a line, stating the day\r\nthat she might expect him home. Of the death scene of his old friend he\r\nhad not the heart to write. He had tried several times, and only\r\nsucceeded in half choking himself; and invariably finished by tearing\r\nup the paper, wiping his eyes, and rushing somewhere to get quiet.\r\n\r\nThere was a pleased bustle all through the Shelby mansion, that day, in\r\nexpectation of the arrival of young Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby was seated in her comfortable parlor, where a cheerful\r\nhickory fire was dispelling the chill of the late autumn evening. A\r\nsupper-table, glittering with plate and cut glass, was set out, on\r\nwhose arrangements our former friend, old Chloe, was presiding.\r\n\r\nArrayed in a new calico dress, with clean, white apron, and high,\r\nwell-starched turban, her black polished face glowing with\r\nsatisfaction, she lingered, with needless punctiliousness, around the\r\narrangements of the table, merely as an excuse for talking a little to\r\nher mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, now! won\xe2\x80\x99t it look natural to him?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThar,\xe2\x80\x94I set his\r\nplate just whar he likes it round by the fire. Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George allers\r\nwants de warm seat. O, go way!\xe2\x80\x94why didn\xe2\x80\x99t Sally get out de _best_\r\ntea-pot,\xe2\x80\x94de little new one, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George got for Missis, Christmas?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have it out! And Missis has heard from Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George?\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\ninquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Chloe; but only a line, just to say he would be home tonight, if\r\nhe could,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99bout my old man, s\xe2\x80\x99pose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Chloe, still\r\nfidgeting with the tea-cups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. He did not speak of anything, Chloe. He said he would\r\ntell all, when he got home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJes like Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George,\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s allers so ferce for tellin\xe2\x80\x99 everything\r\nhisself. I allers minded dat ar in Mas\xe2\x80\x99r George. Don\xe2\x80\x99t see, for my\r\npart, how white people gen\xe2\x80\x99lly can bar to hev to write things much as\r\nthey do, writin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99s such slow, oneasy kind o\xe2\x80\x99 work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 my old man won\xe2\x80\x99t know de boys and de baby. Lor\xe2\x80\x99! she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nde biggest gal, now,\xe2\x80\x94good she is, too, and peart, Polly is. She\xe2\x80\x99s out\r\nto the house, now, watchin\xe2\x80\x99 de hoe-cake. I \xe2\x80\x99s got jist de very pattern\r\nmy old man liked so much, a bakin\xe2\x80\x99. Jist sich as I gin him the mornin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe was took off. Lord bless us! how I felt, dat ar morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby sighed, and felt a heavy weight on her heart, at this\r\nallusion. She had felt uneasy, ever since she received her son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter, lest something should prove to be hidden behind the veil of\r\nsilence which he had drawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissis has got dem bills?\xe2\x80\x9d said Chloe, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Chloe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Cause I wants to show my old man dem very bills de _perfectioner_\r\ngave me. \xe2\x80\x98And,\xe2\x80\x99 say he, \xe2\x80\x98Chloe, I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d stay longer.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\r\nMas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98I would, only my old man\xe2\x80\x99s coming home, and\r\nMissis,\xe2\x80\x94she can\xe2\x80\x99t do without me no longer.\xe2\x80\x99 There\xe2\x80\x99s jist what I telled\r\nhim. Berry nice man, dat Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Jones was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChloe had pertinaciously insisted that the very bills in which her\r\nwages had been paid should be preserved, to show her husband, in\r\nmemorial of her capability. And Mrs. Shelby had readily consented to\r\nhumor her in the request.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t know Polly,\xe2\x80\x94my old man won\xe2\x80\x99t. Laws, it\xe2\x80\x99s five year since they\r\ntuck him! She was a baby den,\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t but jist stand. Remember how\r\ntickled he used to be, cause she would keep a fallin\xe2\x80\x99 over, when she\r\nsot out to walk. Laws a me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rattling of wheels now was heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r George!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Chloe, starting to the window.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby ran to the entry door, and was folded in the arms of her\r\nson. Aunt Chloe stood anxiously straining her eyes out into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, _poor_ Aunt Chloe!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, stopping compassionately, and\r\ntaking her hard, black hand between both his; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have given all my\r\nfortune to have brought him with me, but he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to a better\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a passionate exclamation from Mrs. Shelby, but Aunt Chloe\r\nsaid nothing.\r\n\r\nThe party entered the supper-room. The money, of which Chloe was so\r\nproud, was still lying on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThar,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, gathering it up, and holding it, with a trembling\r\nhand, to her mistress, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t never want to see nor hear on \xe2\x80\x99t again.\r\nJist as I knew \xe2\x80\x99t would be,\xe2\x80\x94sold, and murdered on dem ar\xe2\x80\x99 old\r\nplantations!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChloe turned, and was walking proudly out of the room. Mrs. Shelby\r\nfollowed her softly, and took one of her hands, drew her down into a\r\nchair, and sat down by her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor, good Chloe!\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nChloe leaned her head on her mistress\xe2\x80\x99 shoulder, and sobbed out, \xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nMissis! \xe2\x80\x99scuse me, my heart\xe2\x80\x99s broke,\xe2\x80\x94dat\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Shelby, as her tears fell fast; \xe2\x80\x9cand _I_\r\ncannot heal it, but Jesus can. He healeth the broken hearted, and\r\nbindeth up their wounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence for some time, and all wept together. At last,\r\nGeorge, sitting down beside the mourner, took her hand, and, with\r\nsimple pathos, repeated the triumphant scene of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death,\r\nand his last messages of love.\r\n\r\nAbout a month after this, one morning, all the servants of the Shelby\r\nestate were convened together in the great hall that ran through the\r\nhouse, to hear a few words from their young master.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of all, he appeared among them with a bundle of papers\r\nin his hand, containing a certificate of freedom to every one on the\r\nplace, which he read successively, and presented, amid the sobs and\r\ntears and shouts of all present.\r\n\r\nMany, however, pressed around him, earnestly begging him not to send\r\nthem away; and, with anxious faces, tendering back their free papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be no freer than we are. We\xe2\x80\x99s allers had all we\r\nwanted. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave de ole place, and Mas\xe2\x80\x99r and Missis, and\r\nde rest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, as soon as he could get a silence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be no need for you to leave me. The place wants as many hands\r\nto work it as it did before. We need the same about the house that we\r\ndid before. But, you are now free men and free women. I shall pay you\r\nwages for your work, such as we shall agree on. The advantage is, that\r\nin case of my getting in debt, or dying,\xe2\x80\x94things that might happen,\xe2\x80\x94you\r\ncannot now be taken up and sold. I expect to carry on the estate, and\r\nto teach you what, perhaps, it will take you some time to learn,\xe2\x80\x94how to\r\nuse the rights I give you as free men and women. I expect you to be\r\ngood, and willing to learn; and I trust in God that I shall be\r\nfaithful, and willing to teach. And now, my friends, look up, and thank\r\nGod for the blessing of freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn aged, partriarchal negro, who had grown gray and blind on the\r\nestate, now rose, and, lifting his trembling hand said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us give\r\nthanks unto the Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d As all kneeled by one consent, a more touching\r\nand hearty _Te Deum_ never ascended to heaven, though borne on the peal\r\nof organ, bell and cannon, than came from that honest old heart.\r\n\r\nOn rising, another struck up a Methodist hymn, of which the burden was,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe year of Jubilee is come,\xe2\x80\x94\r\nReturn, ye ransomed sinners, home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing more,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, as he stopped the congratulations of the\r\nthrong; \xe2\x80\x9cyou all remember our good old Uncle Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge here gave a short narration of the scene of his death, and of\r\nhis loving farewell to all on the place, and added,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was on his grave, my friends, that I resolved, before God, that I\r\nwould never own another slave, while it was possible to free him; that\r\nnobody, through me, should ever run the risk of being parted from home\r\nand friends, and dying on a lonely plantation, as he died. So, when you\r\nrejoice in your freedom, think that you owe it to that good old soul,\r\nand pay it back in kindness to his wife and children. Think of your\r\nfreedom, every time you see UNCLE TOM\xe2\x80\x99S CABIN; and let it be a memorial\r\nto put you all in mind to follow in his steps, and be honest and\r\nfaithful and Christian as he was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\nConcluding Remarks\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer has often been inquired of, by correspondents from different\r\nparts of the country, whether this narrative is a true one; and to\r\nthese inquiries she will give one general answer.\r\n\r\nThe separate incidents that compose the narrative are, to a very great\r\nextent, authentic, occurring, many of them, either under her own\r\nobservation, or that of her personal friends. She or her friends have\r\nobserved characters the counterpart of almost all that are here\r\nintroduced; and many of the sayings are word for word as heard herself,\r\nor reported to her.\r\n\r\nThe personal appearance of Eliza, the character ascribed to her, are\r\nsketches drawn from life. The incorruptible fidelity, piety and\r\nhonesty, of Uncle Tom, had more than one development, to her personal\r\nknowledge. Some of the most deeply tragic and romantic, some of the\r\nmost terrible incidents, have also their parallels in reality. The\r\nincident of the mother\xe2\x80\x99s crossing the Ohio river on the ice is a\r\nwell-known fact. The story of \xe2\x80\x9cold Prue,\xe2\x80\x9d in the second volume, was an\r\nincident that fell under the personal observation of a brother of the\r\nwriter, then collecting-clerk to a large mercantile house, in New\r\nOrleans. From the same source was derived the character of the planter\r\nLegree. Of him her brother thus wrote, speaking of visiting his\r\nplantation, on a collecting tour; \xe2\x80\x9cHe actually made me feel of his\r\nfist, which was like a blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s hammer, or a nodule of iron,\r\ntelling me that it was \xe2\x80\x98calloused with knocking down niggers.\xe2\x80\x99 When I\r\nleft the plantation, I drew a long breath, and felt as if I had escaped\r\nfrom an ogre\xe2\x80\x99s den.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat the tragical fate of Tom, also, has too many times had its\r\nparallel, there are living witnesses, all over our land, to testify.\r\nLet it be remembered that in all southern states it is a principle of\r\njurisprudence that no person of colored lineage can testify in a suit\r\nagainst a white, and it will be easy to see that such a case may occur,\r\nwherever there is a man whose passions outweigh his interests, and a\r\nslave who has manhood or principle enough to resist his will. There is,\r\nactually, nothing to protect the slave\xe2\x80\x99s life, but the _character_ of\r\nthe master. Facts too shocking to be contemplated occasionally force\r\ntheir way to the public ear, and the comment that one often hears made\r\non them is more shocking than the thing itself. It is said, \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\nlikely such cases may now and then occur, but they are no sample of\r\ngeneral practice.\xe2\x80\x9d If the laws of New England were so arranged that a\r\nmaster could _now and then_ torture an apprentice to death, would it be\r\nreceived with equal composure? Would it be said, \xe2\x80\x9cThese cases are rare,\r\nand no samples of general practice\xe2\x80\x9d? This injustice is an _inherent_\r\none in the slave system,\xe2\x80\x94it cannot exist without it.\r\n\r\nThe public and shameless sale of beautiful mulatto and quadroon girls\r\nhas acquired a notoriety, from the incidents following the capture of\r\nthe Pearl. We extract the following from the speech of Hon. Horace\r\nMann, one of the legal counsel for the defendants in that case. He\r\nsays: \xe2\x80\x9cIn that company of seventy-six persons, who attempted, in 1848,\r\nto escape from the District of Columbia in the schooner Pearl, and\r\nwhose officers I assisted in defending, there were several young and\r\nhealthy girls, who had those peculiar attractions of form and feature\r\nwhich connoisseurs prize so highly. Elizabeth Russel was one of them.\r\nShe immediately fell into the slave-trader\xe2\x80\x99s fangs, and was doomed for\r\nthe New Orleans market. The hearts of those that saw her were touched\r\nwith pity for her fate. They offered eighteen hundred dollars to redeem\r\nher; and some there were who offered to give, that would not have much\r\nleft after the gift; but the fiend of a slave-trader was inexorable.\r\nShe was despatched to New Orleans; but, when about half way there, God\r\nhad mercy on her, and smote her with death. There were two girls named\r\nEdmundson in the same company. When about to be sent to the same\r\nmarket, an older sister went to the shambles, to plead with the wretch\r\nwho owned them, for the love of God, to spare his victims. He bantered\r\nher, telling what fine dresses and fine furniture they would have.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98that may do very well in this life, but what will\r\nbecome of them in the next?\xe2\x80\x99 They too were sent to New Orleans; but\r\nwere afterwards redeemed, at an enormous ransom, and brought back.\xe2\x80\x9d Is\r\nit not plain, from this, that the histories of Emmeline and Cassy may\r\nhave many counterparts?\r\n\r\nJustice, too, obliges the author to state that the fairness of mind and\r\ngenerosity attributed to St. Clare are not without a parallel, as the\r\nfollowing anecdote will show. A few years since, a young southern\r\ngentleman was in Cincinnati, with a favorite servant, who had been his\r\npersonal attendant from a boy. The young man took advantage of this\r\nopportunity to secure his own freedom, and fled to the protection of a\r\nQuaker, who was quite noted in affairs of this kind. The owner was\r\nexceedingly indignant. He had always treated the slave with such\r\nindulgence, and his confidence in his affection was such, that he\r\nbelieved he must have been practised upon to induce him to revolt from\r\nhim. He visited the Quaker, in high anger; but, being possessed of\r\nuncommon candor and fairness, was soon quieted by his arguments and\r\nrepresentations. It was a side of the subject which he never had\r\nheard,\xe2\x80\x94never had thought on; and he immediately told the Quaker that,\r\nif his slave would, to his own face, say that it was his desire to be\r\nfree, he would liberate him. An interview was forthwith procured, and\r\nNathan was asked by his young master whether he had ever had any reason\r\nto complain of his treatment, in any respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nathan; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve always been good to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, why do you want to leave me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMas\xe2\x80\x99r may die, and then who get me?\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d rather be a free man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter some deliberation, the young master replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNathan, in your\r\nplace, I think I should feel very much so, myself. You are free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe immediately made him out free papers; deposited a sum of money in\r\nthe hands of the Quaker, to be judiciously used in assisting him to\r\nstart in life, and left a very sensible and kind letter of advice to\r\nthe young man. That letter was for some time in the writer\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\nThe author hopes she has done justice to that nobility, generosity, and\r\nhumanity, which in many cases characterize individuals at the South.\r\nSuch instances save us from utter despair of our kind. But, she asks\r\nany person, who knows the world, are such characters _common_,\r\nanywhere?\r\n\r\nFor many years of her life, the author avoided all reading upon or\r\nallusion to the subject of slavery, considering it as too painful to be\r\ninquired into, and one which advancing light and civilization would\r\ncertainly live down. But, since the legislative act of 1850, when she\r\nheard, with perfect surprise and consternation, Christian and humane\r\npeople actually recommending the remanding escaped fugitives into\r\nslavery, as a duty binding on good citizens,\xe2\x80\x94when she heard, on all\r\nhands, from kind, compassionate and estimable people, in the free\r\nstates of the North, deliberations and discussions as to what Christian\r\nduty could be on this head,\xe2\x80\x94she could only think, These men and\r\nChristians cannot know what slavery is; if they did, such a question\r\ncould never be open for discussion. And from this arose a desire to\r\nexhibit it in a _living dramatic reality_. She has endeavored to show\r\nit fairly, in its best and its worst phases. In its _best_ aspect, she\r\nhas, perhaps, been successful; but, oh! who shall say what yet remains\r\nuntold in that valley and shadow of death, that lies the other side?\r\n\r\nTo you, generous, noble-minded men and women, of the South,\xe2\x80\x94you, whose\r\nvirtue, and magnanimity and purity of character, are the greater for\r\nthe severer trial it has encountered,\xe2\x80\x94to you is her appeal. Have you\r\nnot, in your own secret souls, in your own private conversings, felt\r\nthat there are woes and evils, in this accursed system, far beyond what\r\nare here shadowed, or can be shadowed? Can it be otherwise? Is _man_\r\never a creature to be trusted with wholly irresponsible power? And does\r\nnot the slave system, by denying the slave all legal right of\r\ntestimony, make every individual owner an irresponsible despot? Can\r\nanybody fail to make the inference what the practical result will be?\r\nIf there is, as we admit, a public sentiment among you, men of honor,\r\njustice and humanity, is there not also another kind of public\r\nsentiment among the ruffian, the brutal and debased? And cannot the\r\nruffian, the brutal, the debased, by slave law, own just as many slaves\r\nas the best and purest? Are the honorable, the just, the high-minded\r\nand compassionate, the majority anywhere in this world?\r\n\r\nThe slave-trade is now, by American law, considered as piracy. But a\r\nslave-trade, as systematic as ever was carried on on the coast of\r\nAfrica, is an inevitable attendant and result of American slavery. And\r\nits heart-break and its horrors, can they be told?\r\n\r\nThe writer has given only a faint shadow, a dim picture, of the anguish\r\nand despair that are, at this very moment, riving thousands of hearts,\r\nshattering thousands of families, and driving a helpless and sensitive\r\nrace to frenzy and despair. There are those living who know the mothers\r\nwhom this accursed traffic has driven to the murder of their children;\r\nand themselves seeking in death a shelter from woes more dreaded than\r\ndeath. Nothing of tragedy can be written, can be spoken, can be\r\nconceived, that equals the frightful reality of scenes daily and hourly\r\nacting on our shores, beneath the shadow of American law, and the\r\nshadow of the cross of Christ.\r\n\r\nAnd now, men and women of America, is this a thing to be trifled with,\r\napologized for, and passed over in silence? Farmers of Massachusetts,\r\nof New Hampshire, of Vermont, of Connecticut, who read this book by the\r\nblaze of your winter-evening fire,\xe2\x80\x94strong-hearted, generous sailors and\r\nship-owners of Maine,\xe2\x80\x94is this a thing for you to countenance and\r\nencourage? Brave and generous men of New York, farmers of rich and\r\njoyous Ohio, and ye of the wide prairie states,\xe2\x80\x94answer, is this a thing\r\nfor you to protect and countenance? And you, mothers of America,\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nwho have learned, by the cradles of your own children, to love and feel\r\nfor all mankind,\xe2\x80\x94by the sacred love you bear your child; by your joy in\r\nhis beautiful, spotless infancy; by the motherly pity and tenderness\r\nwith which you guide his growing years; by the anxieties of his\r\neducation; by the prayers you breathe for his soul\xe2\x80\x99s eternal good;\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nbeseech you, pity the mother who has all your affections, and not one\r\nlegal right to protect, guide, or educate, the child of her bosom! By\r\nthe sick hour of your child; by those dying eyes, which you can never\r\nforget; by those last cries, that wrung your heart when you could\r\nneither help nor save; by the desolation of that empty cradle, that\r\nsilent nursery,\xe2\x80\x94I beseech you, pity those mothers that are constantly\r\nmade childless by the American slave-trade! And say, mothers of\r\nAmerica, is this a thing to be defended, sympathized with, passed over\r\nin silence?\r\n\r\nDo you say that the people of the free state have nothing to do with\r\nit, and can do nothing? Would to God this were true! But it is not\r\ntrue. The people of the free states have defended, encouraged, and\r\nparticipated; and are more guilty for it, before God, than the South,\r\nin that they have not the apology of education or custom.\r\n\r\nIf the mothers of the free states had all felt as they should, in times\r\npast, the sons of the free states would not have been the holders, and,\r\nproverbially, the hardest masters of slaves; the sons of the free\r\nstates would not have connived at the extension of slavery, in our\r\nnational body; the sons of the free states would not, as they do, trade\r\nthe souls and bodies of men as an equivalent to money, in their\r\nmercantile dealings. There are multitudes of slaves temporarily owned,\r\nand sold again, by merchants in northern cities; and shall the whole\r\nguilt or obloquy of slavery fall only on the South?\r\n\r\nNorthern men, northern mothers, northern Christians, have something\r\nmore to do than denounce their brethren at the South; they have to look\r\nto the evil among themselves.\r\n\r\nBut, what can any individual do? Of that, every individual can judge.\r\nThere is one thing that every individual can do,\xe2\x80\x94they can see to it\r\nthat _they feel right_. An atmosphere of sympathetic influence\r\nencircles every human being; and the man or woman who _feels_ strongly,\r\nhealthily and justly, on the great interests of humanity, is a constant\r\nbenefactor to the human race. See, then, to your sympathies in this\r\nmatter! Are they in harmony with the sympathies of Christ? or are they\r\nswayed and perverted by the sophistries of worldly policy?\r\n\r\nChristian men and women of the North! still further,\xe2\x80\x94you have another\r\npower; you can _pray!_ Do you believe in prayer? or has it become an\r\nindistinct apostolic tradition? You pray for the heathen abroad; pray\r\nalso for the heathen at home. And pray for those distressed Christians\r\nwhose whole chance of religious improvement is an accident of trade and\r\nsale; from whom any adherence to the morals of Christianity is, in many\r\ncases, an impossibility, unless they have given them, from above, the\r\ncourage and grace of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nBut, still more. On the shores of our free states are emerging the\r\npoor, shattered, broken remnants of families,\xe2\x80\x94men and women, escaped,\r\nby miraculous providences from the surges of slavery,\xe2\x80\x94feeble in\r\nknowledge, and, in many cases, infirm in moral constitution, from a\r\nsystem which confounds and confuses every principle of Christianity and\r\nmorality. They come to seek a refuge among you; they come to seek\r\neducation, knowledge, Christianity.\r\n\r\nWhat do you owe to these poor unfortunates, oh Christians? Does not\r\nevery American Christian owe to the African race some effort at\r\nreparation for the wrongs that the American nation has brought upon\r\nthem? Shall the doors of churches and school-houses be shut upon them?\r\nShall states arise and shake them out? Shall the church of Christ hear\r\nin silence the taunt that is thrown at them, and shrink away from the\r\nhelpless hand that they stretch out; and, by her silence, encourage the\r\ncruelty that would chase them from our borders? If it must be so, it\r\nwill be a mournful spectacle. If it must be so, the country will have\r\nreason to tremble, when it remembers that the fate of nations is in the\r\nhands of One who is very pitiful, and of tender compassion.\r\n\r\nDo you say, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want them here; let them go to Africa\xe2\x80\x9d?\r\n\r\nThat the providence of God has provided a refuge in Africa, is, indeed,\r\na great and noticeable fact; but that is no reason why the church of\r\nChrist should throw off that responsibility to this outcast race which\r\nher profession demands of her.\r\n\r\nTo fill up Liberia with an ignorant, inexperienced, half-barbarized\r\nrace, just escaped from the chains of slavery, would be only to\r\nprolong, for ages, the period of struggle and conflict which attends\r\nthe inception of new enterprises. Let the church of the north receive\r\nthese poor sufferers in the spirit of Christ; receive them to the\r\neducating advantages of Christian republican society and schools, until\r\nthey have attained to somewhat of a moral and intellectual maturity,\r\nand then assist them in their passage to those shores, where they may\r\nput in practice the lessons they have learned in America.\r\n\r\nThere is a body of men at the north, comparatively small, who have been\r\ndoing this; and, as the result, this country has already seen examples\r\nof men, formerly slaves, who have rapidly acquired property,\r\nreputation, and education. Talent has been developed, which,\r\nconsidering the circumstances, is certainly remarkable; and, for moral\r\ntraits of honesty, kindness, tenderness of feeling,\xe2\x80\x94for heroic efforts\r\nand self-denials, endured for the ransom of brethren and friends yet in\r\nslavery,\xe2\x80\x94they have been remarkable to a degree that, considering the\r\ninfluence under which they were born, is surprising.\r\n\r\nThe writer has lived, for many years, on the frontier-line of slave\r\nstates, and has had great opportunities of observation among those who\r\nformerly were slaves. They have been in her family as servants; and, in\r\ndefault of any other school to receive them, she has, in many cases,\r\nhad them instructed in a family school, with her own children. She has\r\nalso the testimony of missionaries, among the fugitives in Canada, in\r\ncoincidence with her own experience; and her deductions, with regard to\r\nthe capabilities of the race, are encouraging in the highest degree.\r\n\r\nThe first desire of the emancipated slave, generally, is for\r\n_education_. There is nothing that they are not willing to give or do\r\nto have their children instructed, and, so far as the writer has\r\nobserved herself, or taken the testimony of teachers among them, they\r\nare remarkably intelligent and quick to learn. The results of schools,\r\nfounded for them by benevolent individuals in Cincinnati, fully\r\nestablish this.\r\n\r\nThe author gives the following statement of facts, on the authority of\r\nProfessor C. E. Stowe, then of Lane Seminary, Ohio, with regard to\r\nemancipated slaves, now resident in Cincinnati; given to show the\r\ncapability of the race, even without any very particular assistance or\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nThe initial letters alone are given. They are all residents of\r\nCincinnati.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.

Full black; coal dealer; about thirty years old; worth eighteen\r\nthousand dollars; paid for himself twice, being once defrauded to the\r\namount of sixteen hundred dollars; made all his money by his own\r\nefforts\xe2\x80\x94much of it while a slave, hiring his time of his master, and\r\ndoing business for himself; a fine, gentlemanly fellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.

Three-fourths black; white-washer; from Kentucky; nine years\r\nfree; paid fifteen hundred dollars for self and family; recently died,\r\naged sixty; worth six thousand dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProfessor Stowe says, \xe2\x80\x9cWith all these, except G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, I have been, for\r\nsome years, personally acquainted, and make my statements from my own\r\nknowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe writer well remembers an aged colored woman, who was employed as a\r\nwasherwoman in her father\xe2\x80\x99s family. The daughter of this woman married\r\na slave. She was a remarkably active and capable young woman, and, by\r\nher industry and thrift, and the most persevering self-denial, raised\r\nnine hundred dollars for her husband\xe2\x80\x99s freedom, which she paid, as she\r\nraised it, into the hands of his master. She yet wanted a hundred\r\ndollars of the price, when he died. She never recovered any of the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThese are but few facts, among multitudes which might be adduced, to\r\nshow the self-denial, energy, patience, and honesty, which the slave\r\nhas exhibited in a state of freedom.\r\n\r\nAnd let it be remembered that these individuals have thus bravely\r\nsucceeded in conquering for themselves comparative wealth and social\r\nposition, in the face of every disadvantage and discouragement. The\r\ncolored man, by the law of Ohio, cannot be a voter, and, till within a\r\nfew years, was even denied the right of testimony in legal suits with\r\nthe white. Nor are these instances confined to the State of Ohio. In\r\nall states of the Union we see men, but yesterday burst from the\r\nshackles of slavery, who, by a self-educating force, which cannot be\r\ntoo much admired, have risen to highly respectable stations in society.\r\nPennington, among clergymen, Douglas and Ward, among editors, are well\r\nknown instances.\r\n\r\nIf this persecuted race, with every discouragement and disadvantage,\r\nhave done thus much, how much more they might do if the Christian\r\nchurch would act towards them in the spirit of her Lord!\r\n\r\nThis is an age of the world when nations are trembling and convulsed. A\r\nmighty influence is abroad, surging and heaving the world, as with an\r\nearthquake. And is America safe? Every nation that carries in its bosom\r\ngreat and unredressed injustice has in it the elements of this last\r\nconvulsion.\r\n\r\nFor what is this mighty influence thus rousing in all nations and\r\nlanguages those groanings that cannot be uttered, for man\xe2\x80\x99s freedom and\r\nequality?\r\n\r\nO, Church of Christ, read the signs of the times! Is not this power the\r\nspirit of Him whose kingdom is yet to come, and whose will to be done\r\non earth as it is in heaven?\r\n\r\nBut who may abide the day of his appearing? \xe2\x80\x9cfor that day shall burn as\r\nan oven: and he shall appear as a swift witness against those that\r\noppress the hireling in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, and\r\nthat _turn aside the stranger in his right_: and he shall break in\r\npieces the oppressor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAre not these dread words for a nation bearing in her bosom so mighty\r\nan injustice? Christians! every time that you pray that the kingdom of\r\nChrist may come, can you forget that prophecy associates, in dread\r\nfellowship, the _day of vengeance_ with the year of his redeemed?\r\n\r\nA day of grace is yet held out to us. Both North and South have been\r\nguilty before God; and the _Christian church_ has a heavy account to\r\nanswer. Not by combining together, to protect injustice and cruelty,\r\nand making a common capital of sin, is this Union to be saved,\xe2\x80\x94but by\r\nrepentance, justice and mercy; for, not surer is the eternal law by\r\nwhich the millstone sinks in the ocean, than that stronger law, by\r\nwhich injustice and cruelty shall bring on nations the wrath of\r\nAlmighty God!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Uncle Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Cabin, by Harriet Beecher Stowe\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK UNCLE TOM\xe2\x80\x99S CABIN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 203-0.txt or 203-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/0/203/\r\n\r\nProduced by Judith Boss, An Anonymous Volunteer and David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
