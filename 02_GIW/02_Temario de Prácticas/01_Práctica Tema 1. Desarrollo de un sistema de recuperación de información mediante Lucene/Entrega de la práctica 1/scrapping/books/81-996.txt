W. Clark, illustrated by Gustave Dor\xc3\xa9. Clark in his\r\nedition states that, \xe2\x80\x9cThe English text of \xe2\x80\x98Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99 adopted in this\r\nedition is that of Jarvis, with occasional corrections from Motteaux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSee in the introduction below John Ormsby\xe2\x80\x99s critique of both the Jarvis\r\nand Motteaux translations. It has been elected in the present Project\r\nGutenberg edition to attach the famous engravings of Gustave Dor\xc3\xa9 to\r\nthe Ormsby translation instead of the Jarvis/Motteaux. The detail of\r\nmany of the Dor\xc3\xa9 engravings can be fully appreciated only by utilizing\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cFull Size\xe2\x80\x9d button to expand them to their original dimensions.\r\nOrmsby in his Preface has criticized the fanciful nature of Dor\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nillustrations; others feel these woodcuts and steel engravings well\r\nmatch Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s dreams.

TRANSLATION\r\n\r\nIt was with considerable reluctance that I abandoned in favour of the\r\npresent undertaking what had long been a favourite project: that of a\r\nnew edition of Shelton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d which has now become a somewhat\r\nscarce book. There are some\xe2\x80\x94and I confess myself to be one\xe2\x80\x94for whom\r\nShelton\xe2\x80\x99s racy old version, with all its defects, has a charm that no\r\nmodern translation, however skilful or correct, could possess. Shelton\r\nhad the inestimable advantage of belonging to the same generation as\r\nCervantes; \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d had to him a vitality that only a contemporary\r\ncould feel; it cost him no dramatic effort to see things as Cervantes\r\nsaw them; there is no anachronism in his language; he put the Spanish\r\nof Cervantes into the English of Shakespeare. Shakespeare himself most\r\nlikely knew the book; he may have carried it home with him in his\r\nsaddle-bags to Stratford on one of his last journeys, and under the\r\nmulberry tree at New Place joined hands with a kindred genius in its\r\npages.\r\n\r\nBut it was soon made plain to me that to hope for even a moderate\r\npopularity for Shelton was vain. His fine old crusted English would, no\r\ndoubt, be relished by a minority, but it would be only by a minority.\r\nHis warmest admirers must admit that he is not a satisfactory\r\nrepresentative of Cervantes. His translation of the First Part was very\r\nhastily made and was never revised by him. It has all the freshness and\r\nvigour, but also a full measure of the faults, of a hasty production.\r\nIt is often very literal\xe2\x80\x94barbarously literal frequently\xe2\x80\x94but just as\r\noften very loose. He had evidently a good colloquial knowledge of\r\nSpanish, but apparently not much more. It never seems to occur to him\r\nthat the same translation of a word will not suit in every case.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that we have no satisfactory translation of \xe2\x80\x9cDon\r\nQuixote.\xe2\x80\x9d To those who are familiar with the original, it savours of\r\ntruism or platitude to say so, for in truth there can be no thoroughly\r\nsatisfactory translation of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d into English or any other\r\nlanguage. It is not that the Spanish idioms are so utterly\r\nunmanageable, or that the untranslatable words, numerous enough no\r\ndoubt, are so superabundant, but rather that the sententious terseness\r\nto which the humour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to\r\nSpanish, and can at best be only distantly imitated in any other\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nThe history of our English translations of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\ninstructive. Shelton\xe2\x80\x99s, the first in any language, was made,\r\napparently, about 1608, but not published till 1612. This of course was\r\nonly the First Part. It has been asserted that the Second, published in\r\n1620, is not the work of Shelton, but there is nothing to support the\r\nassertion save the fact that it has less spirit, less of what we\r\ngenerally understand by \xe2\x80\x9cgo,\xe2\x80\x9d about it than the first, which would be\r\nonly natural if the first were the work of a young man writing\r\n_currente calamo_, and the second that of a middle-aged man writing for\r\na bookseller. On the other hand, it is closer and more literal, the\r\nstyle is the same, the very same translations, or mistranslations,\r\noccur in it, and it is extremely unlikely that a new translator would,\r\nby suppressing his name, have allowed Shelton to carry off the credit.\r\n\r\nIn 1687 John Phillips, Milton\xe2\x80\x99s nephew, produced a \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmade\r\nEnglish,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9caccording to the humour of our modern language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHis \xe2\x80\x9cQuixote\xe2\x80\x9d is not so much a translation as a travesty, and a\r\ntravesty that for coarseness, vulgarity, and buffoonery is almost\r\nunexampled even in the literature of that day.\r\n\r\nNed Ward\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLife and Notable Adventures of Don Quixote, merrily\r\ntranslated into Hudibrastic Verse\xe2\x80\x9d (1700), can scarcely be reckoned a\r\ntranslation, but it serves to show the light in which \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nregarded at the time.\r\n\r\nA further illustration may be found in the version published in 1712 by\r\nPeter Motteux, who had then recently combined tea-dealing with\r\nliterature. It is described as \xe2\x80\x9ctranslated from the original by several\r\nhands,\xe2\x80\x9d but if so all Spanish flavour has entirely evaporated under the\r\nmanipulation of the several hands. The flavour that it has, on the\r\nother hand, is distinctly Franco-cockney. Anyone who compares it\r\ncarefully with the original will have little doubt that it is a\r\nconcoction from Shelton and the French of Filleau de Saint Martin, eked\r\nout by borrowings from Phillips, whose mode of treatment it adopts. It\r\nis, to be sure, more decent and decorous, but it treats \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin the same fashion as a comic book that cannot be made too comic.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to improve the humour of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d by an infusion of\r\ncockney flippancy and facetiousness, as Motteux\xe2\x80\x99s operators did, is not\r\nmerely an impertinence like larding a sirloin of prize beef, but an\r\nabsolute falsification of the spirit of the book, and it is a proof of\r\nthe uncritical way in which \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d is generally read that this\r\nworse than worthless translation\xe2\x80\x94worthless as failing to represent,\r\nworse than worthless as misrepresenting\xe2\x80\x94should have been favoured as it\r\nhas been.\r\n\r\nIt had the effect, however, of bringing out a translation undertaken\r\nand executed in a very different spirit, that of Charles Jervas, the\r\nportrait painter, and friend of Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, and Gay. Jervas\r\nhas been allowed little credit for his work, indeed it may be said\r\nnone, for it is known to the world in general as Jarvis\xe2\x80\x99s. It was not\r\npublished until after his death, and the printers gave the name\r\naccording to the current pronunciation of the day. It has been the most\r\nfreely used and the most freely abused of all the translations. It has\r\nseen far more editions than any other, it is admitted on all hands to\r\nbe by far the most faithful, and yet nobody seems to have a good word\r\nto say for it or for its author. Jervas no doubt prejudiced readers\r\nagainst himself in his preface, where among many true words about\r\nShelton, Stevens, and Motteux, he rashly and unjustly charges Shelton\r\nwith having translated not from the Spanish, but from the Italian\r\nversion of Franciosini, which did not appear until ten years after\r\nShelton\xe2\x80\x99s first volume. A suspicion of incompetence, too, seems to have\r\nattached to him because he was by profession a painter and a mediocre\r\none (though he has given us the best portrait we have of Swift), and\r\nthis may have been strengthened by Pope\xe2\x80\x99s remark that he \xe2\x80\x9ctranslated\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99 without understanding Spanish.\xe2\x80\x9d He has been also charged\r\nwith borrowing from Shelton, whom he disparaged. It is true that in a\r\nfew difficult or obscure passages he has followed Shelton, and gone\r\nastray with him; but for one case of this sort, there are fifty where\r\nhe is right and Shelton wrong. As for Pope\xe2\x80\x99s dictum, anyone who\r\nexamines Jervas\xe2\x80\x99s version carefully, side by side with the original,\r\nwill see that he was a sound Spanish scholar, incomparably a better one\r\nthan Shelton, except perhaps in mere colloquial Spanish. He was, in\r\nfact, an honest, faithful, and painstaking translator, and he has left\r\na version which, whatever its shortcomings may be, is singularly free\r\nfrom errors and mistranslations.\r\n\r\nThe charge against it is that it is stiff, dry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwooden\xe2\x80\x9d in a word,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nno one can deny that there is a foundation for it. But it may be\r\npleaded for Jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his\r\nabhorrence of the light, flippant, jocose style of his predecessors. He\r\nwas one of the few, very few, translators that have shown any\r\napprehension of the unsmiling gravity which is the essence of Quixotic\r\nhumour; it seemed to him a crime to bring Cervantes forward smirking\r\nand grinning at his own good things, and to this may be attributed in a\r\ngreat measure the ascetic abstinence from everything savouring of\r\nliveliness which is the characteristic of his translation. In most\r\nmodern editions, it should be observed, his style has been smoothed and\r\nsmartened, but without any reference to the original Spanish, so that\r\nif he has been made to read more agreeably he has also been robbed of\r\nhis chief merit of fidelity.\r\n\r\nSmollett\xe2\x80\x99s version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of\r\nthese. At any rate it is plain that in its construction Jervas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntranslation was very freely drawn upon, and very little or probably no\r\nheed given to the original Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwhich appeared in 1769, \xe2\x80\x9cprinted for the Translator,\xe2\x80\x9d was an impudent\r\nimposture, being nothing more than Motteux\xe2\x80\x99s version with a few of the\r\nwords, here and there, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot\xe2\x80\x99s (1774) was\r\nonly an abridgment like Florian\xe2\x80\x99s, but not so skilfully executed; and\r\nthe version published by Miss Smirke in 1818, to accompany her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s plates, was merely a patchwork production made out of former\r\ntranslations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield\xe2\x80\x99s, it would be in every\r\nsense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not\r\neven seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, and since\r\nthen I may say vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the\r\ntemptation which Mr. Duffield\xe2\x80\x99s reputation and comely volumes hold out\r\nto every lover of Cervantes.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing history of our translations of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d it\r\nwill be seen that there are a good many people who, provided they get\r\nthe mere narrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, and\r\nadventures served up to them in a form that amuses them, care very\r\nlittle whether that form is the one in which Cervantes originally\r\nshaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there are many\r\nwho desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he\r\ntells it, so far at least as differences of idiom and circumstances\r\npermit, and who will give a preference to the conscientious translator,\r\neven though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly.\r\n\r\nBut after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes;\r\nthere is no reason why what pleases the one should not please the\r\nother, or why a translator who makes it his aim to treat \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwith the respect due to a great classic, should not be as acceptable\r\neven to the careless reader as the one who treats it as a famous old\r\njest-book. It is not a question of caviare to the general, or, if it\r\nis, the fault rests with him who makes so. The method by which\r\nCervantes won the ear of the Spanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, to\r\nbe equally effective with the great majority of English readers. At any\r\nrate, even if there are readers to whom it is a matter of indifference,\r\nfidelity to the method is as much a part of the translator\xe2\x80\x99s duty as\r\nfidelity to the matter. If he can please all parties, so much the\r\nbetter; but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful\r\na representation of his author as it is in his power to give them,\r\nfaithful to the letter so long as fidelity is practicable, faithful to\r\nthe spirit so far as he can make it.\r\n\r\nMy purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation, but to\r\nindicate those I have followed, or at least tried to the best of my\r\nability to follow, in the present instance. One which, it seems to me,\r\ncannot be too rigidly followed in translating \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d is to\r\navoid everything that savours of affectation. The book itself is,\r\nindeed, in one sense a protest against it, and no man abhorred it more\r\nthan Cervantes. For this reason, I think, any temptation to use\r\nantiquated or obsolete language should be resisted. It is after all an\r\naffectation, and one for which there is no warrant or excuse. Spanish\r\nhas probably undergone less change since the seventeenth century than\r\nany language in Europe, and by far the greater and certainly the best\r\npart of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d differs but little in language from the\r\ncolloquial Spanish of the present day. Except in the tales and Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s speeches, the translator who uses the simplest and plainest\r\neveryday language will almost always be the one who approaches nearest\r\nto the original.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the story of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d and all its characters and\r\nincidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar\r\nas household words in English mouths, it seems to me that the old\r\nfamiliar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason.\r\nOf course a translator who holds that \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d should receive the\r\ntreatment a great classic deserves, will feel himself bound by the\r\ninjunction laid upon the Morisco in Chap. IX not to omit or add\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII: ABOUT CERVANTES AND DON QUIXOTE\r\n\r\nFour generations had laughed over \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d before it occurred to\r\nanyone to ask, who and what manner of man was this Miguel de Cervantes\r\nSaavedra whose name is on the title-page; and it was too late for a\r\nsatisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a life\r\nof the author to the London edition published at Lord Carteret\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstance in 1738. All traces of the personality of Cervantes had by\r\nthat time disappeared. Any floating traditions that may once have\r\nexisted, transmitted from men who had known him, had long since died\r\nout, and of other record there was none; for the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries were incurious as to \xe2\x80\x9cthe men of the time,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nreproach against which the nineteenth has, at any rate, secured itself,\r\nif it has produced no Shakespeare or Cervantes. All that Mayans y\r\nSiscar, to whom the task was entrusted, or any of those who followed\r\nhim, Rios, Pellicer, or Navarrete, could do was to eke out the few\r\nallusions Cervantes makes to himself in his various prefaces with such\r\npieces of documentary evidence bearing upon his life as they could\r\nfind.\r\n\r\nThis, however, has been done by the last-named biographer to such good\r\npurpose that he has superseded all predecessors. Thoroughness is the\r\nchief characteristic of Navarrete\xe2\x80\x99s work. Besides sifting, testing, and\r\nmethodising with rare patience and judgment what had been previously\r\nbrought to light, he left, as the saying is, no stone unturned under\r\nwhich anything to illustrate his subject might possibly be found.\r\nNavarrete has done all that industry and acumen could do, and it is no\r\nfault of his if he has not given us what we want. What Hallam says of\r\nShakespeare may be applied to the almost parallel case of Cervantes:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the register of his baptism, or the draft of his will, or\r\nthe orthography of his name that we seek; no letter of his writing, no\r\nrecord of his conversation, no character of him drawn ... by a\r\ncontemporary has been produced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is only natural, therefore, that the biographers of Cervantes,\r\nforced to make brick without straw, should have recourse largely to\r\nconjecture, and that conjecture should in some instances come by\r\ndegrees to take the place of established fact. All that I propose to do\r\nhere is to separate what is matter of fact from what is matter of\r\nconjecture, and leave it to the reader\xe2\x80\x99s judgment to decide whether the\r\ndata justify the inference or not.\r\n\r\nThe men whose names by common consent stand in the front rank of\r\nSpanish literature, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Calderon,\r\nGarcilaso de la Vega, the Mendozas, Gongora, were all men of ancient\r\nfamilies, and, curiously, all, except the last, of families that traced\r\ntheir origin to the same mountain district in the North of Spain. The\r\nfamily of Cervantes is commonly said to have been of Galician origin,\r\nand unquestionably it was in possession of lands in Galicia at a very\r\nearly date; but I think the balance of the evidence tends to show that\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9csolar,\xe2\x80\x9d the original site of the family, was at Cervatos in the\r\nnorth-west corner of Old Castile, close to the junction of Castile,\r\nLeon, and the Asturias. As it happens, there is a complete history of\r\nthe Cervantes family from the tenth century down to the seventeenth\r\nextant under the title of \xe2\x80\x9cIllustrious Ancestry, Glorious Deeds, and\r\nNoble Posterity of the Famous Nuno Alfonso, Alcaide of Toledo,\xe2\x80\x9d written\r\nin 1648 by the industrious genealogist Rodrigo Mendez Silva, who\r\navailed himself of a manuscript genealogy by Juan de Mena, the poet\r\nlaureate and historiographer of John II.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name Cervantes is curious. Nuno Alfonso was almost as\r\ndistinguished in the struggle against the Moors in the reign of Alfonso\r\nVII as the Cid had been half a century before in that of Alfonso VI,\r\nand was rewarded by divers grants of land in the neighbourhood of\r\nToledo. On one of his acquisitions, about two leagues from the city, he\r\nbuilt himself a castle which he called Cervatos, because \xe2\x80\x9che was lord\r\nof the solar of Cervatos in the Montana,\xe2\x80\x9d as the mountain region\r\nextending from the Basque Provinces to Leon was always called. At his\r\ndeath in battle in 1143, the castle passed by his will to his son\r\nAlfonso Munio, who, as territorial or local surnames were then coming\r\ninto vogue in place of the simple patronymic, took the additional name\r\nof Cervatos. His eldest son Pedro succeeded him in the possession of\r\nthe castle, and followed his example in adopting the name, an\r\nassumption at which the younger son, Gonzalo, seems to have taken\r\numbrage.\r\n\r\nEveryone who has paid even a flying visit to Toledo will remember the\r\nruined castle that crowns the hill above the spot where the bridge of\r\nAlc\xc3\xa1ntara spans the gorge of the Tagus, and with its broken outline and\r\ncrumbling walls makes such an admirable pendant to the square solid\r\nAlcazar towering over the city roofs on the opposite side. It was\r\nbuilt, or as some say restored, by Alfonso VI shortly after his\r\noccupation of Toledo in 1085, and called by him San Servando after a\r\nSpanish martyr, a name subsequently modified into San Servan (in which\r\nform it appears in the \xe2\x80\x9cPoem of the Cid\xe2\x80\x9d), San Servantes, and San\r\nCervantes: with regard to which last the \xe2\x80\x9cHandbook for Spain\xe2\x80\x9d warns its\r\nreaders against the supposition that it has anything to do with the\r\nauthor of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote.\xe2\x80\x9d Ford, as all know who have taken him for a\r\ncompanion and counsellor on the roads of Spain, is seldom wrong in\r\nmatters of literature or history. In this instance, however, he is in\r\nerror. It has everything to do with the author of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d for it\r\nis in fact these old walls that have given to Spain the name she is\r\nproudest of to-day. Gonzalo, above mentioned, it may be readily\r\nconceived, did not relish the appropriation by his brother of a name to\r\nwhich he himself had an equal right, for though nominally taken from\r\nthe castle, it was in reality derived from the ancient territorial\r\npossession of the family, and as a set-off, and to distinguish himself\r\n(diferenciarse) from his brother, he took as a surname the name of the\r\ncastle on the bank of the Tagus, in the building of which, according to\r\na family tradition, his great-grandfather had a share.\r\n\r\nBoth brothers founded families. The Cervantes branch had more tenacity;\r\nit sent offshoots in various directions, Andalusia, Estremadura,\r\nGalicia, and Portugal, and produced a goodly line of men distinguished\r\nin the service of Church and State. Gonzalo himself, and apparently a\r\nson of his, followed Ferdinand III in the great campaign of 1236-48\r\nthat gave Cordova and Seville to Christian Spain and penned up the\r\nMoors in the kingdom of Granada, and his descendants intermarried with\r\nsome of the noblest families of the Peninsula and numbered among them\r\nsoldiers, magistrates, and Church dignitaries, including at least two\r\ncardinal-archbishops.\r\n\r\nOf the line that settled in Andalusia, Deigo de Cervantes, Commander of\r\nthe Order of Santiago, married Juana Avellaneda, daughter of Juan Arias\r\nde Saavedra, and had several sons, of whom one was Gonzalo Gomez,\r\nCorregidor of Jerez and ancestor of the Mexican and Columbian branches\r\nof the family; and another, Juan, whose son Rodrigo married Do\xc3\xb1a Leonor\r\nde Cortinas, and by her had four children, Rodrigo, Andrea, Luisa, and\r\nMiguel, our author.\r\n\r\nThe pedigree of Cervantes is not without its bearing on \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nA man who could look back upon an ancestry of genuine knights-errant\r\nextending from well-nigh the time of Pelayo to the siege of Granada was\r\nlikely to have a strong feeling on the subject of the sham chivalry of\r\nthe romances. It gives a point, too, to what he says in more than one\r\nplace about families that have once been great and have tapered away\r\nuntil they have come to nothing, like a pyramid. It was the case of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nHe was born at Alcal\xc3\xa1 de Henares and baptised in the church of Santa\r\nMaria Mayor on the 9th of October, 1547. Of his boyhood and youth we\r\nknow nothing, unless it be from the glimpse he gives us in the preface\r\nto his \xe2\x80\x9cComedies\xe2\x80\x9d of himself as a boy looking on with delight while\r\nLope de Rueda and his company set up their rude plank stage in the\r\nplaza and acted the rustic farces which he himself afterwards took as\r\nthe model of his interludes. This first glimpse, however, is a\r\nsignificant one, for it shows the early development of that love of the\r\ndrama which exercised such an influence on his life and seems to have\r\ngrown stronger as he grew older, and of which this very preface,\r\nwritten only a few months before his death, is such a striking proof.\r\nHe gives us to understand, too, that he was a great reader in his\r\nyouth; but of this no assurance was needed, for the First Part of \xe2\x80\x9cDon\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x9d alone proves a vast amount of miscellaneous reading, romances\r\nof chivalry, ballads, popular poetry, chronicles, for which he had no\r\ntime or opportunity except in the first twenty years of his life; and\r\nhis misquotations and mistakes in matters of detail are always, it may\r\nbe noticed, those of a man recalling the reading of his boyhood.\r\n\r\nOther things besides the drama were in their infancy when Cervantes was\r\na boy. The period of his boyhood was in every way a transition period\r\nfor Spain. The old chivalrous Spain had passed away. The new Spain was\r\nthe mightiest power the world had seen since the Roman Empire and it\r\nhad not yet been called upon to pay the price of its greatness. By the\r\npolicy of Ferdinand and Ximenez the sovereign had been made absolute,\r\nand the Church and Inquisition adroitly adjusted to keep him so. The\r\nnobles, who had always resisted absolutism as strenuously as they had\r\nfought the Moors, had been divested of all political power, a like fate\r\nhad befallen the cities, the free constitutions of Castile and Aragon\r\nhad been swept away, and the only function that remained to the Cort\xc3\xa9s\r\nwas that of granting money at the King\xe2\x80\x99s dictation.\r\n\r\nThe transition extended to literature. Men who, like Garcilaso de la\r\nVega and Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, followed the Italian wars, had\r\nbrought back from Italy the products of the post-Renaissance\r\nliterature, which took root and flourished and even threatened to\r\nextinguish the native growths. Damon and Thyrsis, Phyllis and Chloe had\r\nbeen fairly naturalised in Spain, together with all the devices of\r\npastoral poetry for investing with an air of novelty the idea of a\r\ndispairing shepherd and inflexible shepherdess. As a set-off against\r\nthis, the old historical and traditional ballads, and the true\r\npastorals, the songs and ballads of peasant life, were being collected\r\nassiduously and printed in the cancioneros that succeeded one another\r\nwith increasing rapidity. But the most notable consequence, perhaps, of\r\nthe spread of printing was the flood of romances of chivalry that had\r\ncontinued to pour from the press ever since Garci Ordo\xc3\xb1ez de Montalvo\r\nhad resuscitated \xe2\x80\x9cAmadis of Gaul\xe2\x80\x9d at the beginning of the century.\r\n\r\nFor a youth fond of reading, solid or light, there could have been no\r\nbetter spot in Spain than Alcal\xc3\xa1 de Henares in the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century. It was then a busy, populous university town,\r\nsomething more than the enterprising rival of Salamanca, and altogether\r\na very different place from the melancholy, silent, deserted Alcal\xc3\xa1 the\r\ntraveller sees now as he goes from Madrid to Saragossa. Theology and\r\nmedicine may have been the strong points of the university, but the\r\ntown itself seems to have inclined rather to the humanities and light\r\nliterature, and as a producer of books Alcal\xc3\xa1 was already beginning to\r\ncompete with the older presses of Toledo, Burgos, Salamanca and\r\nSeville.\r\n\r\nA pendant to the picture Cervantes has given us of his first playgoings\r\nmight, no doubt, have been often seen in the streets of Alcal\xc3\xa1 at that\r\ntime; a bright, eager, tawny-haired boy peering into a book-shop where\r\nthe latest volumes lay open to tempt the public, wondering, it may be,\r\nwhat that little book with the woodcut of the blind beggar and his boy,\r\nthat called itself \xe2\x80\x9cVida de Lazarillo de Tormes, segunda impresion,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncould be about; or with eyes brimming over with merriment gazing at one\r\nof those preposterous portraits of a knight-errant in outrageous\r\npanoply and plumes with which the publishers of chivalry romances loved\r\nto embellish the title-pages of their folios. If the boy was the father\r\nof the man, the sense of the incongruous that was strong at fifty was\r\nlively at ten, and some such reflections as these may have been the\r\ntrue genesis of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor his more solid education, we are told, he went to Salamanca. But\r\nwhy Rodrigo de Cervantes, who was very poor, should have sent his son\r\nto a university a hundred and fifty miles away when he had one at his\r\nown door, would be a puzzle, if we had any reason for supposing that he\r\ndid so. The only evidence is a vague statement by Professor Tomas\r\nGonzalez, that he once saw an old entry of the matriculation of a\r\nMiguel de Cervantes. This does not appear to have been ever seen again;\r\nbut even if it had, and if the date corresponded, it would prove\r\nnothing, as there were at least two other Miguels born about the middle\r\nof the century; one of them, moreover, a Cervantes Saavedra, a cousin,\r\nno doubt, who was a source of great embarrassment to the biographers.\r\n\r\nThat he was a student neither at Salamanca nor at Alcal\xc3\xa1 is best proved\r\nby his own works. No man drew more largely upon experience than he did,\r\nand he has nowhere left a single reminiscence of student life\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTia Fingida,\xe2\x80\x9d if it be his, is not one\xe2\x80\x94nothing, not even \xe2\x80\x9ca college\r\njoke,\xe2\x80\x9d to show that he remembered days that most men remember best. All\r\nthat we know positively about his education is that Juan Lopez de\r\nHoyos, a professor of humanities and belles-lettres of some eminence,\r\ncalls him his \xe2\x80\x9cdear and beloved pupil.\xe2\x80\x9d This was in a little collection\r\nof verses by different hands on the death of Isabel de Valois, second\r\nqueen of Philip II., published by the professor in 1569, to which\r\nCervantes contributed four pieces, including an elegy, and an epitaph\r\nin the form of a sonnet. It is only by a rare chance that a \xe2\x80\x9cLycidas\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfinds its way into a volume of this sort, and Cervantes was no Milton.\r\nHis verses are no worse than such things usually are; so much, at\r\nleast, may be said for them.\r\n\r\nBy the time the book appeared he had left Spain, and, as fate ordered\r\nit, for twelve years, the most eventful ones of his life. Giulio,\r\nafterwards Cardinal, Acquaviva had been sent at the end of 1568 to\r\nPhilip II. by the Pope on a mission, partly of condolence, partly\r\npolitical, and on his return to Rome, which was somewhat brusquely\r\nexpedited by the King, he took Cervantes with him as his camarero\r\n(chamberlain), the office he himself held in the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s household. The\r\npost would no doubt have led to advancement at the Papal Court had\r\nCervantes retained it, but in the summer of 1570 he resigned it and\r\nenlisted as a private soldier in Captain Diego Urbina\xe2\x80\x99s company,\r\nbelonging to Don Miguel de Moncada\xe2\x80\x99s regiment, but at that time forming\r\na part of the command of Marc Antony Colonna. What impelled him to this\r\nstep we know not, whether it was distaste for the career before him, or\r\npurely military enthusiasm. It may well have been the latter, for it\r\nwas a stirring time; the events, however, which led to the alliance\r\nbetween Spain, Venice, and the Pope, against the common enemy, the\r\nPorte, and to the victory of the combined fleets at Lepanto, belong\r\nrather to the history of Europe than to the life of Cervantes. He was\r\none of those that sailed from Messina, in September 1571, under the\r\ncommand of Don John of Austria; but on the morning of the 7th of\r\nOctober, when the Turkish fleet was sighted, he was lying below ill\r\nwith fever. At the news that the enemy was in sight he rose, and, in\r\nspite of the remonstrances of his comrades and superiors, insisted on\r\ntaking his post, saying he preferred death in the service of God and\r\nthe King to health. His galley, the _Marquesa_, was in the thick of the\r\nfight, and before it was over he had received three gunshot wounds, two\r\nin the breast and one in the left hand or arm. On the morning after the\r\nbattle, according to Navarrete, he had an interview with the\r\ncommander-in-chief, Don John, who was making a personal inspection of\r\nthe wounded, one result of which was an addition of three crowns to his\r\npay, and another, apparently, the friendship of his general.\r\n\r\nHow severely Cervantes was wounded may be inferred from the fact, that\r\nwith youth, a vigorous frame, and as cheerful and buoyant a temperament\r\nas ever invalid had, he was seven months in hospital at Messina before\r\nhe was discharged. He came out with his left hand permanently disabled;\r\nhe had lost the use of it, as Mercury told him in the \xe2\x80\x9cViaje del\r\nParnaso\xe2\x80\x9d for the greater glory of the right. This, however, did not\r\nabsolutely unfit him for service, and in April 1572 he joined Manuel\r\nPonce de Leon\xe2\x80\x99s company of Lope de Figueroa\xe2\x80\x99s regiment, in which, it\r\nseems probable, his brother Rodrigo was serving, and shared in the\r\noperations of the next three years, including the capture of the\r\nGoletta and Tunis. Taking advantage of the lull which followed the\r\nrecapture of these places by the Turks, he obtained leave to return to\r\nSpain, and sailed from Naples in September 1575 on board the _Sun_\r\ngalley, in company with his brother Rodrigo, Pedro Carrillo de Quesada,\r\nlate Governor of the Goletta, and some others, and furnished with\r\nletters from Don John of Austria and the Duke of Sesa, the Viceroy of\r\nSicily, recommending him to the King for the command of a company, on\r\naccount of his services; a _dono infelice_ as events proved. On the\r\n26th they fell in with a squadron of Algerine galleys, and after a\r\nstout resistance were overpowered and carried into Algiers.\r\n\r\nBy means of a ransomed fellow-captive the brothers contrived to inform\r\ntheir family of their condition, and the poor people at Alcal\xc3\xa1 at once\r\nstrove to raise the ransom money, the father disposing of all he\r\npossessed, and the two sisters giving up their marriage portions. But\r\nDali Mami had found on Cervantes the letters addressed to the King by\r\nDon John and the Duke of Sesa, and, concluding that his prize must be a\r\nperson of great consequence, when the money came he refused it\r\nscornfully as being altogether insufficient. The owner of Rodrigo,\r\nhowever, was more easily satisfied; ransom was accepted in his case,\r\nand it was arranged between the brothers that he should return to Spain\r\nand procure a vessel in which he was to come back to Algiers and take\r\noff Miguel and as many of their comrades as possible. This was not the\r\nfirst attempt to escape that Cervantes had made. Soon after the\r\ncommencement of his captivity he induced several of his companions to\r\njoin him in trying to reach Oran, then a Spanish post, on foot; but\r\nafter the first day\xe2\x80\x99s journey, the Moor who had agreed to act as their\r\nguide deserted them, and they had no choice but to return. The second\r\nattempt was more disastrous. In a garden outside the city on the\r\nsea-shore, he constructed, with the help of the gardener, a Spaniard, a\r\nhiding-place, to which he brought, one by one, fourteen of his\r\nfellow-captives, keeping them there in secrecy for several months, and\r\nsupplying them with food through a renegade known as El Dorador, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nGilder.\xe2\x80\x9d How he, a captive himself, contrived to do all this, is one of\r\nthe mysteries of the story. Wild as the project may appear, it was very\r\nnearly successful. The vessel procured by Rodrigo made its appearance\r\noff the coast, and under cover of night was proceeding to take off the\r\nrefugees, when the crew were alarmed by a passing fishing boat, and\r\nbeat a hasty retreat. On renewing the attempt shortly afterwards, they,\r\nor a portion of them at least, were taken prisoners, and just as the\r\npoor fellows in the garden were exulting in the thought that in a few\r\nmoments more freedom would be within their grasp, they found themselves\r\nsurrounded by Turkish troops, horse and foot. The Dorador had revealed\r\nthe whole scheme to the Dey Hassan.\r\n\r\nWhen Cervantes saw what had befallen them, he charged his companions to\r\nlay all the blame upon him, and as they were being bound he declared\r\naloud that the whole plot was of his contriving, and that nobody else\r\nhad any share in it. Brought before the Dey, he said the same. He was\r\nthreatened with impalement and with torture; and as cutting off ears\r\nand noses were playful freaks with the Algerines, it may be conceived\r\nwhat their tortures were like; but nothing could make him swerve from\r\nhis original statement that he and he alone was responsible. The upshot\r\nwas that the unhappy gardener was hanged by his master, and the\r\nprisoners taken possession of by the Dey, who, however, afterwards\r\nrestored most of them to their masters, but kept Cervantes, paying Dali\r\nMami 500 crowns for him. He felt, no doubt, that a man of such\r\nresource, energy, and daring, was too dangerous a piece of property to\r\nbe left in private hands; and he had him heavily ironed and lodged in\r\nhis own prison. If he thought that by these means he could break the\r\nspirit or shake the resolution of his prisoner, he was soon undeceived,\r\nfor Cervantes contrived before long to despatch a letter to the\r\nGovernor of Oran, entreating him to send him someone that could be\r\ntrusted, to enable him and three other gentlemen, fellow-captives of\r\nhis, to make their escape; intending evidently to renew his first\r\nattempt with a more trustworthy guide. Unfortunately the Moor who\r\ncarried the letter was stopped just outside Oran, and the letter being\r\nfound upon him, he was sent back to Algiers, where by the order of the\r\nDey he was promptly impaled as a warning to others, while Cervantes was\r\ncondemned to receive two thousand blows of the stick, a number which\r\nmost likely would have deprived the world of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d had not\r\nsome persons, who they were we know not, interceded on his behalf.\r\n\r\nAfter this he seems to have been kept in still closer confinement than\r\nbefore, for nearly two years passed before he made another attempt.\r\nThis time his plan was to purchase, by the aid of a Spanish renegade\r\nand two Valencian merchants resident in Algiers, an armed vessel in\r\nwhich he and about sixty of the leading captives were to make their\r\nescape; but just as they were about to put it into execution one Doctor\r\nJuan Blanco de Paz, an ecclesiastic and a compatriot, informed the Dey\r\nof the plot. Cervantes by force of character, by his self-devotion, by\r\nhis untiring energy and his exertions to lighten the lot of his\r\ncompanions in misery, had endeared himself to all, and become the\r\nleading spirit in the captive colony, and, incredible as it may seem,\r\njealousy of his influence and the esteem in which he was held, moved\r\nthis man to compass his destruction by a cruel death. The merchants\r\nfinding that the Dey knew all, and fearing that Cervantes under torture\r\nmight make disclosures that would imperil their own lives, tried to\r\npersuade him to slip away on board a vessel that was on the point of\r\nsailing for Spain; but he told them they had nothing to fear, for no\r\ntortures would make him compromise anybody, and he went at once and\r\ngave himself up to the Dey.\r\n\r\nAs before, the Dey tried to force him to name his accomplices.\r\nEverything was made ready for his immediate execution; the halter was\r\nput round his neck and his hands tied behind him, but all that could be\r\ngot from him was that he himself, with the help of four gentlemen who\r\nhad since left Algiers, had arranged the whole, and that the sixty who\r\nwere to accompany him were not to know anything of it until the last\r\nmoment. Finding he could make nothing of him, the Dey sent him back to\r\nprison more heavily ironed than before.\r\n\r\nThe poverty-stricken Cervantes family had been all this time trying\r\nonce more to raise the ransom money, and at last a sum of three hundred\r\nducats was got together and entrusted to the Redemptorist Father Juan\r\nGil, who was about to sail for Algiers. The Dey, however, demanded more\r\nthan double the sum offered, and as his term of office had expired and\r\nhe was about to sail for Constantinople, taking all his slaves with\r\nhim, the case of Cervantes was critical. He was already on board\r\nheavily ironed, when the Dey at length agreed to reduce his demand by\r\none-half, and Father Gil by borrowing was able to make up the amount,\r\nand on September 19, 1580, after a captivity of five years all but a\r\nweek, Cervantes was at last set free. Before long he discovered that\r\nBlanco de Paz, who claimed to be an officer of the Inquisition, was now\r\nconcocting on false evidence a charge of misconduct to be brought\r\nagainst him on his return to Spain. To checkmate him Cervantes drew up\r\na series of twenty-five questions, covering the whole period of his\r\ncaptivity, upon which he requested Father Gil to take the depositions\r\nof credible witnesses before a notary. Eleven witnesses taken from\r\namong the principal captives in Algiers deposed to all the facts above\r\nstated and to a great deal more besides. There is something touching in\r\nthe admiration, love, and gratitude we see struggling to find\r\nexpression in the formal language of the notary, as they testify one\r\nafter another to the good deeds of Cervantes, how he comforted and\r\nhelped the weak-hearted, how he kept up their drooping courage, how he\r\nshared his poor purse with this deponent, and how \xe2\x80\x9cin him this deponent\r\nfound father and mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn his return to Spain he found his old regiment about to march for\r\nPortugal to support Philip\xe2\x80\x99s claim to the crown, and utterly penniless\r\nnow, had no choice but to rejoin it. He was in the expeditions to the\r\nAzores in 1582 and the following year, and on the conclusion of the war\r\nreturned to Spain in the autumn of 1583, bringing with him the\r\nmanuscript of his pastoral romance, the \xe2\x80\x9cGalatea,\xe2\x80\x9d and probably also,\r\nto judge by internal evidence, that of the first portion of \xe2\x80\x9cPersiles\r\nand Sigismunda.\xe2\x80\x9d He also brought back with him, his biographers assert,\r\nan infant daughter, the offspring of an amour, as some of them with\r\ngreat circumstantiality inform us, with a Lisbon lady of noble birth,\r\nwhose name, however, as well as that of the street she lived in, they\r\nomit to mention. The sole foundation for all this is that in 1605 there\r\ncertainly was living in the family of Cervantes a Do\xc3\xb1a Isabel de\r\nSaavedra, who is described in an official document as his natural\r\ndaughter, and then twenty years of age.\r\n\r\nWith his crippled left hand promotion in the army was hopeless, now\r\nthat Don John was dead and he had no one to press his claims and\r\nservices, and for a man drawing on to forty life in the ranks was a\r\ndismal prospect; he had already a certain reputation as a poet; he made\r\nup his mind, therefore, to cast his lot with literature, and for a\r\nfirst venture committed his \xe2\x80\x9cGalatea\xe2\x80\x9d to the press. It was published,\r\nas Salva y Mallen shows conclusively, at Alcal\xc3\xa1, his own birth-place,\r\nin 1585 and no doubt helped to make his name more widely known, but\r\ncertainly did not do him much good in any other way.\r\n\r\nWhile it was going through the press, he married Do\xc3\xb1a Catalina de\r\nPalacios Salazar y Vozmediano, a lady of Esquivias near Madrid, and\r\napparently a friend of the family, who brought him a fortune which may\r\npossibly have served to keep the wolf from the door, but if so, that\r\nwas all. The drama had by this time outgrown market-place stages and\r\nstrolling companies, and with his old love for it he naturally turned\r\nto it for a congenial employment. In about three years he wrote twenty\r\nor thirty plays, which he tells us were performed without any throwing\r\nof cucumbers or other missiles, and ran their course without any\r\nhisses, outcries, or disturbance. In other words, his plays were not\r\nbad enough to be hissed off the stage, but not good enough to hold\r\ntheir own upon it. Only two of them have been preserved, but as they\r\nhappen to be two of the seven or eight he mentions with complacency, we\r\nmay assume they are favourable specimens, and no one who reads the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNumancia\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cTrato de Argel\xe2\x80\x9d will feel any surprise that they\r\nfailed as acting dramas. Whatever merits they may have, whatever\r\noccasional they may show, they are, as regards construction, incurably\r\nclumsy. How completely they failed is manifest from the fact that with\r\nall his sanguine temperament and indomitable perseverance he was unable\r\nto maintain the struggle to gain a livelihood as a dramatist for more\r\nthan three years; nor was the rising popularity of Lope the cause, as\r\nis often said, notwithstanding his own words to the contrary. When Lope\r\nbegan to write for the stage is uncertain, but it was certainly after\r\nCervantes went to Seville.\r\n\r\nAmong the \xe2\x80\x9cNuevos Documentos\xe2\x80\x9d printed by Se\xc3\xb1or Asensio y Toledo is one\r\ndated 1592, and curiously characteristic of Cervantes. It is an\r\nagreement with one Rodrigo Osorio, a manager, who was to accept six\r\ncomedies at fifty ducats (about 6l.) apiece, not to be paid in any case\r\nunless it appeared on representation that the said comedy was one of\r\nthe best that had ever been represented in Spain. The test does not\r\nseem to have been ever applied; perhaps it was sufficiently apparent to\r\nRodrigo Osorio that the comedies were not among the best that had ever\r\nbeen represented. Among the correspondence of Cervantes there might\r\nhave been found, no doubt, more than one letter like that we see in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRake\xe2\x80\x99s Progress,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSir, I have read your play, and it will not doo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was more successful in a literary contest at Saragossa in 1595 in\r\nhonour of the canonisation of St. Jacinto, when his composition won the\r\nfirst prize, three silver spoons. The year before this he had been\r\nappointed a collector of revenues for the kingdom of Granada. In order\r\nto remit the money he had collected more conveniently to the treasury,\r\nhe entrusted it to a merchant, who failed and absconded; and as the\r\nbankrupt\xe2\x80\x99s assets were insufficient to cover the whole, he was sent to\r\nprison at Seville in September 1597. The balance against him, however,\r\nwas a small one, about 26l., and on giving security for it he was\r\nreleased at the end of the year.\r\n\r\nIt was as he journeyed from town to town collecting the king\xe2\x80\x99s taxes,\r\nthat he noted down those bits of inn and wayside life and character\r\nthat abound in the pages of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote:\xe2\x80\x9d the Benedictine monks with\r\nspectacles and sunshades, mounted on their tall mules; the strollers in\r\ncostume bound for the next village; the barber with his basin on his\r\nhead, on his way to bleed a patient; the recruit with his breeches in\r\nhis bundle, tramping along the road singing; the reapers gathered in\r\nthe venta gateway listening to \xe2\x80\x9cFelixmarte of Hircania\xe2\x80\x9d read out to\r\nthem; and those little Hogarthian touches that he so well knew how to\r\nbring in, the ox-tail hanging up with the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s comb stuck in it,\r\nthe wine-skins at the bed-head, and those notable examples of hostelry\r\nart, Helen going off in high spirits on Paris\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and Dido on the\r\ntower dropping tears as big as walnuts. Nay, it may well be that on\r\nthose journeys into remote regions he came across now and then a\r\nspecimen of the pauper gentleman, with his lean hack and his greyhound\r\nand his books of chivalry, dreaming away his life in happy ignorance\r\nthat the world had changed since his great-grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s old helmet was\r\nnew. But it was in Seville that he found out his true vocation, though\r\nhe himself would not by any means have admitted it to be so. It was\r\nthere, in Triana, that he was first tempted to try his hand at drawing\r\nfrom life, and first brought his humour into play in the exquisite\r\nlittle sketch of \xe2\x80\x9cRinconete y Cortadillo,\xe2\x80\x9d the germ, in more ways than\r\none, of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhere and when that was written, we cannot tell. After his imprisonment\r\nall trace of Cervantes in his official capacity disappears, from which\r\nit may be inferred that he was not reinstated. That he was still in\r\nSeville in November 1598 appears from a satirical sonnet of his on the\r\nelaborate catafalque erected to testify the grief of the city at the\r\ndeath of Philip II, but from this up to 1603 we have no clue to his\r\nmovements. The words in the preface to the First Part of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nare generally held to be conclusive that he conceived the idea of the\r\nbook, and wrote the beginning of it at least, in a prison, and that he\r\nmay have done so is extremely likely.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that Cervantes read some portions of his work to a\r\nselect audience at the Duke of Bejar\xe2\x80\x99s, which may have helped to make\r\nthe book known; but the obvious conclusion is that the First Part of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d lay on his hands some time before he could find a\r\npublisher bold enough to undertake a venture of so novel a character;\r\nand so little faith in it had Francisco Robles of Madrid, to whom at\r\nlast he sold it, that he did not care to incur the expense of securing\r\nthe copyright for Aragon or Portugal, contenting himself with that for\r\nCastile. The printing was finished in December, and the book came out\r\nwith the new year, 1605. It is often said that \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d was at\r\nfirst received coldly. The facts show just the contrary. No sooner was\r\nit in the hands of the public than preparations were made to issue\r\npirated editions at Lisbon and Valencia, and to bring out a second\r\nedition with the additional copyrights for Aragon and Portugal, which\r\nhe secured in February.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it was received with something more than coldness by certain\r\nsections of the community. Men of wit, taste, and discrimination among\r\nthe aristocracy gave it a hearty welcome, but the aristocracy in\r\ngeneral were not likely to relish a book that turned their favourite\r\nreading into ridicule and laughed at so many of their favourite ideas.\r\nThe dramatists who gathered round Lope as their leader regarded\r\nCervantes as their common enemy, and it is plain that he was equally\r\nobnoxious to the other clique, the culto poets who had Gongora for\r\ntheir chief. Navarrete, who knew nothing of the letter above mentioned,\r\ntries hard to show that the relations between Cervantes and Lope were\r\nof a very friendly sort, as indeed they were until \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nwritten. Cervantes, indeed, to the last generously and manfully\r\ndeclared his admiration of Lope\xe2\x80\x99s powers, his unfailing invention, and\r\nhis marvellous fertility; but in the preface of the First Part of \xe2\x80\x9cDon\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x9d and in the verses of \xe2\x80\x9cUrganda the Unknown,\xe2\x80\x9d and one or two\r\nother places, there are, if we read between the lines, sly hits at\r\nLope\xe2\x80\x99s vanities and affectations that argue no personal good-will; and\r\nLope openly sneers at \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d and Cervantes, and fourteen years\r\nafter his death gives him only a few lines of cold commonplace in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaurel de Apolo,\xe2\x80\x9d that seem all the colder for the eulogies of a host\r\nof nonentities whose names are found nowhere else.\r\n\r\nIn 1601 Valladolid was made the seat of the Court, and at the beginning\r\nof 1603 Cervantes had been summoned thither in connection with the\r\nbalance due by him to the Treasury, which was still outstanding. He\r\nremained at Valladolid, apparently supporting himself by agencies and\r\nscrivener\xe2\x80\x99s work of some sort; probably drafting petitions and drawing\r\nup statements of claims to be presented to the Council, and the like.\r\nSo, at least, we gather from the depositions taken on the occasion of\r\nthe death of a gentleman, the victim of a street brawl, who had been\r\ncarried into the house in which he lived. In these he himself is\r\ndescribed as a man who wrote and transacted business, and it appears\r\nthat his household then consisted of his wife, the natural daughter\r\nIsabel de Saavedra already mentioned, his sister Andrea, now a widow,\r\nher daughter Constanza, a mysterious Magdalena de Sotomayor calling\r\nherself his sister, for whom his biographers cannot account, and a\r\nservant-maid.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d had been growing in favour, and its author\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname was now known beyond the Pyrenees. In 1607 an edition was printed\r\nat Brussels. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet\r\nthe demand by a third edition, the seventh in all, in 1608. The\r\npopularity of the book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller was\r\nled to bring out an edition in 1610; and another was called for in\r\nBrussels in 1611. It might naturally have been expected that, with such\r\nproofs before him that he had hit the taste of the public, Cervantes\r\nwould have at once set about redeeming his rather vague promise of a\r\nsecond volume.\r\n\r\nBut, to all appearance, nothing was farther from his thoughts. He had\r\nstill by him one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he had\r\ninserted in \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d and instead of continuing the adventures of\r\nDon Quixote, he set to work to write more of these \xe2\x80\x9cNovelas Exemplares\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas he afterwards called them, with a view to making a book of them.\r\n\r\nThe novels were published in the summer of 1613, with a dedication to\r\nthe Conde de Lemos, the Maecenas of the day, and with one of those\r\nchatty confidential prefaces Cervantes was so fond of. In this, eight\r\nyears and a half after the First Part of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d had appeared, we\r\nget the first hint of a forthcoming Second Part. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see\r\nshortly,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cthe further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of\r\nSancho Panza.\xe2\x80\x9d His idea of \xe2\x80\x9cshortly\xe2\x80\x9d was a somewhat elastic one, for,\r\nas we know by the date to Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s letter, he had barely one-half of\r\nthe book completed that time twelvemonth.\r\n\r\nBut more than poems, or pastorals, or novels, it was his dramatic\r\nambition that engrossed his thoughts. The same indomitable spirit that\r\nkept him from despair in the bagnios of Algiers, and prompted him to\r\nattempt the escape of himself and his comrades again and again, made\r\nhim persevere in spite of failure and discouragement in his efforts to\r\nwin the ear of the public as a dramatist. The temperament of Cervantes\r\nwas essentially sanguine. The portrait he draws in the preface to the\r\nnovels, with the aquiline features, chestnut hair, smooth untroubled\r\nforehead, and bright cheerful eyes, is the very portrait of a sanguine\r\nman. Nothing that the managers might say could persuade him that the\r\nmerits of his plays would not be recognised at last if they were only\r\ngiven a fair chance. The old soldier of the Spanish Salamis was bent on\r\nbeing the Aeschylus of Spain. He was to found a great national drama,\r\nbased on the true principles of art, that was to be the envy of all\r\nnations; he was to drive from the stage the silly, childish plays, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmirrors of nonsense and models of folly\xe2\x80\x9d that were in vogue through\r\nthe cupidity of the managers and shortsightedness of the authors; he\r\nwas to correct and educate the public taste until it was ripe for\r\ntragedies on the model of the Greek drama\xe2\x80\x94like the \xe2\x80\x9cNumancia\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\ninstance\xe2\x80\x94and comedies that would not only amuse but improve and\r\ninstruct. All this he was to do, could he once get a hearing: there was\r\nthe initial difficulty.\r\n\r\nHe shows plainly enough, too, that \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d and the demolition of\r\nthe chivalry romances was not the work that lay next his heart. He was,\r\nindeed, as he says himself in his preface, more a stepfather than a\r\nfather to \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote.\xe2\x80\x9d Never was great work so neglected by its\r\nauthor. That it was written carelessly, hastily, and by fits and\r\nstarts, was not always his fault, but it seems clear he never read what\r\nhe sent to the press. He knew how the printers had blundered, but he\r\nnever took the trouble to correct them when the third edition was in\r\nprogress, as a man who really cared for the child of his brain would\r\nhave done. He appears to have regarded the book as little more than a\r\nmere libro de entretenimiento, an amusing book, a thing, as he says in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cViaje,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto divert the melancholy moody heart at any time or\r\nseason.\xe2\x80\x9d No doubt he had an affection for his hero, and was very proud\r\nof Sancho Panza. It would have been strange indeed if he had not been\r\nproud of the most humorous creation in all fiction. He was proud, too,\r\nof the popularity and success of the book, and beyond measure\r\ndelightful is the naivete with which he shows his pride in a dozen\r\npassages in the Second Part. But it was not the success he coveted. In\r\nall probability he would have given all the success of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nnay, would have seen every copy of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d burned in the Plaza\r\nMayor, for one such success as Lope de Vega was enjoying on an average\r\nonce a week.\r\n\r\nAnd so he went on, dawdling over \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d adding a chapter now\r\nand again, and putting it aside to turn to \xe2\x80\x9cPersiles and\r\nSigismunda\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which, as we know, was to be the most entertaining book in\r\nthe language, and the rival of \xe2\x80\x9cTheagenes and Chariclea\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or finishing\r\noff one of his darling comedies; and if Robles asked when \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwould be ready, the answer no doubt was: En breve\xe2\x80\x94shortly, there was\r\ntime enough for that. At sixty-eight he was as full of life and hope\r\nand plans for the future as a boy of eighteen.\r\n\r\nNemesis was coming, however. He had got as far as Chapter LIX, which at\r\nhis leisurely pace he could hardly have reached before October or\r\nNovember 1614, when there was put into his hand a small octave lately\r\nprinted at Tarragona, and calling itself \xe2\x80\x9cSecond Volume of the\r\nIngenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licentiate Alonso\r\nFernandez de Avellaneda of Tordesillas.\xe2\x80\x9d The last half of Chapter LIX\r\nand most of the following chapters of the Second Part give us some idea\r\nof the effect produced upon him, and his irritation was not likely to\r\nbe lessened by the reflection that he had no one to blame but himself.\r\nHad Avellaneda, in fact, been content with merely bringing out a\r\ncontinuation to \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d Cervantes would have had no reasonable\r\ngrievance. His own intentions were expressed in the very vaguest\r\nlanguage at the end of the book; nay, in his last words, \xe2\x80\x9cforse altro\r\ncantera con miglior plettro,\xe2\x80\x9d he seems actually to invite someone else\r\nto continue the work, and he made no sign until eight years and a half\r\nhad gone by; by which time Avellaneda\xe2\x80\x99s volume was no doubt written.\r\n\r\nIn fact Cervantes had no case, or a very bad one, as far as the mere\r\ncontinuation was concerned. But Avellaneda chose to write a preface to\r\nit, full of such coarse personal abuse as only an ill-conditioned man\r\ncould pour out. He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having lost\r\nhis hand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with being\r\nfriendless, accuses him of envy of Lope\xe2\x80\x99s success, of petulance and\r\nquerulousness, and so on; and it was in this that the sting lay.\r\nAvellaneda\xe2\x80\x99s reason for this personal attack is obvious enough. Whoever\r\nhe may have been, it is clear that he was one of the dramatists of\r\nLope\xe2\x80\x99s school, for he has the impudence to charge Cervantes with\r\nattacking him as well as Lope in his criticism on the drama. His\r\nidentification has exercised the best critics and baffled all the\r\ningenuity and research that has been brought to bear on it. Navarrete\r\nand Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantes knew who he was;\r\nbut I must say I think the anger he shows suggests an invisible\r\nassailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a mosquito in\r\nthe dark. Cervantes from certain solecisms of language pronounces him\r\nto be an Aragonese, and Pellicer, an Aragonese himself, supports this\r\nview and believes him, moreover, to have been an ecclesiastic, a\r\nDominican probably.\r\n\r\nAny merit Avellaneda has is reflected from Cervantes, and he is too\r\ndull to reflect much. \xe2\x80\x9cDull and dirty\xe2\x80\x9d will always be, I imagine, the\r\nverdict of the vast majority of unprejudiced readers. He is, at best, a\r\npoor plagiarist; all he can do is to follow slavishly the lead given\r\nhim by Cervantes; his only humour lies in making Don Quixote take inns\r\nfor castles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage,\r\nand Sancho mistake words, invert proverbs, and display his gluttony;\r\nall through he shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt, and he has\r\ncontrived to introduce two tales filthier than anything by the\r\nsixteenth century novellieri and without their sprightliness.\r\n\r\nBut whatever Avellaneda and his book may be, we must not forget the\r\ndebt we owe them. But for them, there can be no doubt, \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwould have come to us a mere torso instead of a complete work. Even if\r\nCervantes had finished the volume he had in hand, most assuredly he\r\nwould have left off with a promise of a Third Part, giving the further\r\nadventures of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza as shepherds. It\r\nis plain that he had at one time an intention of dealing with the\r\npastoral romances as he had dealt with the books of chivalry, and but\r\nfor Avellaneda he would have tried to carry it out. But it is more\r\nlikely that, with his plans, and projects, and hopefulness, the volume\r\nwould have remained unfinished till his death, and that we should have\r\nnever made the acquaintance of the Duke and Duchess, or gone with\r\nSancho to Barataria.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the book came into his hands he seems to have been\r\nhaunted by the fear that there might be more Avellanedas in the field,\r\nand putting everything else aside, he set himself to finish off his\r\ntask and protect Don Quixote in the only way he could, by killing him.\r\nThe conclusion is no doubt a hasty and in some places clumsy piece of\r\nwork and the frequent repetition of the scolding administered to\r\nAvellaneda becomes in the end rather wearisome; but it is, at any rate,\r\na conclusion and for that we must thank Avellaneda.\r\n\r\nThe new volume was ready for the press in February, but was not printed\r\ntill the very end of 1615, and during the interval Cervantes put\r\ntogether the comedies and interludes he had written within the last few\r\nyears, and, as he adds plaintively, found no demand for among the\r\nmanagers, and published them with a preface, worth the book it\r\nintroduces tenfold, in which he gives an account of the early Spanish\r\nstage, and of his own attempts as a dramatist. It is needless to say\r\nthey were put forward by Cervantes in all good faith and full\r\nconfidence in their merits. The reader, however, was not to suppose\r\nthey were his last word or final effort in the drama, for he had in\r\nhand a comedy called \xe2\x80\x9cEngano a los ojos,\xe2\x80\x9d about which, if he mistook\r\nnot, there would be no question.\r\n\r\nOf this dramatic masterpiece the world has no opportunity of judging;\r\nhis health had been failing for some time, and he died, apparently of\r\ndropsy, on the 23rd of April, 1616, the day on which England lost\r\nShakespeare, nominally at least, for the English calendar had not yet\r\nbeen reformed. He died as he had lived, accepting his lot bravely and\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\nWas it an unhappy life, that of Cervantes? His biographers all tell us\r\nthat it was; but I must say I doubt it. It was a hard life, a life of\r\npoverty, of incessant struggle, of toil ill paid, of disappointment,\r\nbut Cervantes carried within himself the antidote to all these evils.\r\nHis was not one of those light natures that rise above adversity merely\r\nby virtue of their own buoyancy; it was in the fortitude of a high\r\nspirit that he was proof against it. It is impossible to conceive\r\nCervantes giving way to despondency or prostrated by dejection. As for\r\npoverty, it was with him a thing to be laughed over, and the only sigh\r\nhe ever allows to escape him is when he says, \xe2\x80\x9cHappy he to whom Heaven\r\nhas given a piece of bread for which he is not bound to give thanks to\r\nany but Heaven itself.\xe2\x80\x9d Add to all this his vital energy and mental\r\nactivity, his restless invention and his sanguine temperament, and\r\nthere will be reason enough to doubt whether his could have been a very\r\nunhappy life. He who could take Cervantes\xe2\x80\x99 distresses together with his\r\napparatus for enduring them would not make so bad a bargain, perhaps,\r\nas far as happiness in life is concerned.\r\n\r\nOf his burial-place nothing is known except that he was buried, in\r\naccordance with his will, in the neighbouring convent of Trinitarian\r\nnuns, of which it is supposed his daughter, Isabel de Saavedra, was an\r\ninmate, and that a few years afterwards the nuns removed to another\r\nconvent, carrying their dead with them. But whether the remains of\r\nCervantes were included in the removal or not no one knows, and the\r\nclue to their resting-place is now lost beyond all hope. This furnishes\r\nperhaps the least defensible of the items in the charge of neglect\r\nbrought against his contemporaries. In some of the others there is a\r\ngood deal of exaggeration. To listen to most of his biographers one\r\nwould suppose that all Spain was in league not only against the man but\r\nagainst his memory, or at least that it was insensible to his merits,\r\nand left him to live in misery and die of want. To talk of his hard\r\nlife and unworthy employments in Andalusia is absurd. What had he done\r\nto distinguish him from thousands of other struggling men earning a\r\nprecarious livelihood? True, he was a gallant soldier, who had been\r\nwounded and had undergone captivity and suffering in his country\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncause, but there were hundreds of others in the same case. He had\r\nwritten a mediocre specimen of an insipid class of romance, and some\r\nplays which manifestly did not comply with the primary condition of\r\npleasing: were the playgoers to patronise plays that did not amuse\r\nthem, because the author was to produce \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d twenty years\r\nafterwards?\r\n\r\nThe scramble for copies which, as we have seen, followed immediately on\r\nthe appearance of the book, does not look like general insensibility to\r\nits merits. No doubt it was received coldly by some, but if a man\r\nwrites a book in ridicule of periwigs he must make his account with\r\nbeing coldly received by the periwig wearers and hated by the whole\r\ntribe of wigmakers. If Cervantes had the chivalry-romance readers, the\r\nsentimentalists, the dramatists, and the poets of the period all\r\nagainst him, it was because \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d was what it was; and if the\r\ngeneral public did not come forward to make him comfortable for the\r\nrest of his days, it is no more to be charged with neglect and\r\ningratitude than the English-speaking public that did not pay off\r\nScott\xe2\x80\x99s liabilities. It did the best it could; it read his book and\r\nliked it and bought it, and encouraged the bookseller to pay him well\r\nfor others.\r\n\r\nIt has been also made a reproach to Spain that she has erected no\r\nmonument to the man she is proudest of; no monument, that is to say, of\r\nhim; for the bronze statue in the little garden of the Plaza de las\r\nCort\xc3\xa9s, a fair work of art no doubt, and unexceptionable had it been\r\nset up to the local poet in the market-place of some provincial town,\r\nis not worthy of Cervantes or of Madrid. But what need has Cervantes of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csuch weak witness of his name;\xe2\x80\x9d or what could a monument do in his\r\ncase except testify to the self-glorification of those who had put it\r\nup? Si monumentum quoeris, circumspice. The nearest bookseller\xe2\x80\x99s shop\r\nwill show what bathos there would be in a monument to the author of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNine editions of the First Part of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d had already appeared\r\nbefore Cervantes died, thirty thousand copies in all, according to his\r\nown estimate, and a tenth was printed at Barcelona the year after his\r\ndeath. So large a number naturally supplied the demand for some time,\r\nbut by 1634 it appears to have been exhausted; and from that time down\r\nto the present day the stream of editions has continued to flow rapidly\r\nand regularly. The translations show still more clearly in what request\r\nthe book has been from the very outset. In seven years from the\r\ncompletion of the work it had been translated into the four leading\r\nlanguages of Europe. Except the Bible, in fact, no book has been so\r\nwidely diffused as \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cImitatio Christi\xe2\x80\x9d may have been\r\ntranslated into as many different languages, and perhaps \xe2\x80\x9cRobinson\r\nCrusoe\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cVicar of Wakefield\xe2\x80\x9d into nearly as many, but in\r\nmultiplicity of translations and editions \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d leaves them all\r\nfar behind.\r\n\r\nStill more remarkable is the character of this wide diffusion. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x9d has been thoroughly naturalised among people whose ideas about\r\nknight-errantry, if they had any at all, were of the vaguest, who had\r\nnever seen or heard of a book of chivalry, who could not possibly feel\r\nthe humour of the burlesque or sympathise with the author\xe2\x80\x99s purpose.\r\nAnother curious fact is that this, the most cosmopolitan book in the\r\nworld, is one of the most intensely national. \xe2\x80\x9cManon Lescaut\xe2\x80\x9d is not\r\nmore thoroughly French, \xe2\x80\x9cTom Jones\xe2\x80\x9d not more English, \xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy\xe2\x80\x9d not\r\nmore Scotch, than \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d is Spanish, in character, in ideas, in\r\nsentiment, in local colour, in everything. What, then, is the secret of\r\nthis unparalleled popularity, increasing year by year for well-nigh\r\nthree centuries? One explanation, no doubt, is that of all the books in\r\nthe world, \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d is the most catholic. There is something in it\r\nfor every sort of reader, young or old, sage or simple, high or low. As\r\nCervantes himself says with a touch of pride, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is thumbed and read\r\nand got by heart by people of all sorts; the children turn its leaves,\r\nthe young people read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk\r\npraise it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it would be idle to deny that the ingredient which, more than its\r\nhumour, or its wisdom, or the fertility of invention or knowledge of\r\nhuman nature it displays, has insured its success with the multitude,\r\nis the vein of farce that runs through it. It was the attack upon the\r\nsheep, the battle with the wine-skins, Mambrino\xe2\x80\x99s helmet, the balsam of\r\nFierabras, Don Quixote knocked over by the sails of the windmill,\r\nSancho tossed in the blanket, the mishaps and misadventures of master\r\nand man, that were originally the great attraction, and perhaps are so\r\nstill to some extent with the majority of readers. It is plain that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d was generally regarded at first, and indeed in Spain for\r\na long time, as little more than a queer droll book, full of laughable\r\nincidents and absurd situations, very amusing, but not entitled to much\r\nconsideration or care. All the editions printed in Spain from 1637 to\r\n1771, when the famous printer Ibarra took it up, were mere trade\r\neditions, badly and carelessly printed on vile paper and got up in the\r\nstyle of chap-books intended only for popular use, with, in most\r\ninstances, uncouth illustrations and clap-trap additions by the\r\npublisher.\r\n\r\nTo England belongs the credit of having been the first country to\r\nrecognise the right of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d to better treatment than this. The\r\nLondon edition of 1738, commonly called Lord Carteret\xe2\x80\x99s from having\r\nbeen suggested by him, was not a mere _\xc3\xa9dition de luxe_. It produced\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d in becoming form as regards paper and type, and\r\nembellished with plates which, if not particularly happy as\r\nillustrations, were at least well intentioned and well executed, but it\r\nalso aimed at correctness of text, a matter to which nobody except the\r\neditors of the Valencia and Brussels editions had given even a passing\r\nthought; and for a first attempt it was fairly successful, for though\r\nsome of its emendations are inadmissible, a good many of them have been\r\nadopted by all subsequent editors.\r\n\r\nThe zeal of publishers, editors, and annotators brought about a\r\nremarkable change of sentiment with regard to \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote.\xe2\x80\x9d A vast\r\nnumber of its admirers began to grow ashamed of laughing over it. It\r\nbecame almost a crime to treat it as a humorous book. The humour was\r\nnot entirely denied, but, according to the new view, it was rated as an\r\naltogether secondary quality, a mere accessory, nothing more than the\r\nstalking-horse under the presentation of which Cervantes shot his\r\nphilosophy or his satire, or whatever it was he meant to shoot; for on\r\nthis point opinions varied. All were agreed, however, that the object\r\nhe aimed at was not the books of chivalry. He said emphatically in the\r\npreface to the First Part and in the last sentence of the Second, that\r\nhe had no other object in view than to discredit these books, and this,\r\nto advanced criticism, made it clear that his object must have been\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\nOne theory was that the book was a kind of allegory, setting forth the\r\neternal struggle between the ideal and the real, between the spirit of\r\npoetry and the spirit of prose; and perhaps German philosophy never\r\nevolved a more ungainly or unlikely camel out of the depths of its\r\ninner consciousness. Something of the antagonism, no doubt, is to be\r\nfound in \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d because it is to be found everywhere in life,\r\nand Cervantes drew from life. It is difficult to imagine a community in\r\nwhich the never-ceasing game of cross-purposes between Sancho Panza and\r\nDon Quixote would not be recognised as true to nature. In the stone\r\nage, among the lake dwellers, among the cave men, there were Don\r\nQuixotes and Sancho Panzas; there must have been the troglodyte who\r\nnever could see the facts before his eyes, and the troglodyte who could\r\nsee nothing else. But to suppose Cervantes deliberately setting himself\r\nto expound any such idea in two stout quarto volumes is to suppose\r\nsomething not only very unlike the age in which he lived, but\r\naltogether unlike Cervantes himself, who would have been the first to\r\nlaugh at an attempt of the sort made by anyone else.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary influence of the romances of chivalry in his day is\r\nquite enough to account for the genesis of the book. Some idea of the\r\nprodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenth\r\ncentury may be obtained from the scrutiny of Chapter VII, if the reader\r\nbears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by far\r\nthe largest group are enumerated. As to its effect upon the nation,\r\nthere is abundant evidence. From the time when the Amadises and\r\nPalmerins began to grow popular down to the very end of the century,\r\nthere is a steady stream of invective, from men whose character and\r\nposition lend weight to their words, against the romances of chivalry\r\nand the infatuation of their readers. Ridicule was the only besom to\r\nsweep away that dust.\r\n\r\nThat this was the task Cervantes set himself, and that he had ample\r\nprovocation to urge him to it, will be sufficiently clear to those who\r\nlook into the evidence; as it will be also that it was not chivalry\r\nitself that he attacked and swept away. Of all the absurdities that,\r\nthanks to poetry, will be repeated to the end of time, there is no\r\ngreater one than saying that \xe2\x80\x9cCervantes smiled Spain\xe2\x80\x99s chivalry away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nIn the first place there was no chivalry for him to smile away. Spain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchivalry had been dead for more than a century. Its work was done when\r\nGranada fell, and as chivalry was essentially republican in its nature,\r\nit could not live under the rule that Ferdinand substituted for the\r\nfree institutions of mediaeval Spain. What he did smile away was not\r\nchivalry but a degrading mockery of it.\r\n\r\nThe true nature of the \xe2\x80\x9cright arm\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cbright array,\xe2\x80\x9d before\r\nwhich, according to the poet, \xe2\x80\x9cthe world gave ground,\xe2\x80\x9d and which\r\nCervantes\xe2\x80\x99 single laugh demolished, may be gathered from the words of\r\none of his own countrymen, Don Felix Pacheco, as reported by Captain\r\nGeorge Carleton, in his \xe2\x80\x9cMilitary Memoirs from 1672 to 1713.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBefore\r\nthe appearance in the world of that labour of Cervantes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nwas next to an impossibility for a man to walk the streets with any\r\ndelight or without danger. There were seen so many cavaliers prancing\r\nand curvetting before the windows of their mistresses, that a stranger\r\nwould have imagined the whole nation to have been nothing less than a\r\nrace of knight-errants. But after the world became a little acquainted\r\nwith that notable history, the man that was seen in that once\r\ncelebrated drapery was pointed at as a Don Quixote, and found himself\r\nthe jest of high and low. And I verily believe that to this, and this\r\nonly, we owe that dampness and poverty of spirit which has run through\r\nall our councils for a century past, so little agreeable to those\r\nnobler actions of our famous ancestors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo call \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d a sad book, preaching a pessimist view of life,\r\nargues a total misconception of its drift. It would be so if its moral\r\nwere that, in this world, true enthusiasm naturally leads to ridicule\r\nand discomfiture. But it preaches nothing of the sort; its moral, so\r\nfar as it can be said to have one, is that the spurious enthusiasm that\r\nis born of vanity and self-conceit, that is made an end in itself, not\r\na means to an end, that acts on mere impulse, regardless of\r\ncircumstances and consequences, is mischievous to its owner, and a very\r\nconsiderable nuisance to the community at large. To those who cannot\r\ndistinguish between the one kind and the other, no doubt \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nis a sad book; no doubt to some minds it is very sad that a man who had\r\njust uttered so beautiful a sentiment as that \xe2\x80\x9cit is a hard case to\r\nmake slaves of those whom God and Nature made free,\xe2\x80\x9d should be\r\nungratefully pelted by the scoundrels his crazy philanthropy had let\r\nloose on society; but to others of a more judicial cast it will be a\r\nmatter of regret that reckless self-sufficient enthusiasm is not\r\noftener requited in some such way for all the mischief it does in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nA very slight examination of the structure of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d will\r\nsuffice to show that Cervantes had no deep design or elaborate plan in\r\nhis mind when he began the book. When he wrote those lines in which\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwith a few strokes of a great master he sets before us the pauper\r\ngentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d he had no idea of the goal to which his imagination was\r\nleading him. There can be little doubt that all he contemplated was a\r\nshort tale to range with those he had already written, a tale setting\r\nforth the ludicrous results that might be expected to follow the\r\nattempt of a crazy gentleman to act the part of a knight-errant in\r\nmodern life.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, for one thing, that Sancho Panza did not enter into the\r\noriginal scheme, for had Cervantes thought of him he certainly would\r\nnot have omitted him in his hero\xe2\x80\x99s outfit, which he obviously meant to\r\nbe complete. Him we owe to the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s chance remark in Chapter III\r\nthat knights seldom travelled without squires. To try to think of a Don\r\nQuixote without Sancho Panza is like trying to think of a one-bladed\r\npair of scissors.\r\n\r\nThe story was written at first, like the others, without any division\r\nand without the intervention of Cid Hamete Benengeli; and it seems not\r\nunlikely that Cervantes had some intention of bringing Dulcinea, or\r\nAldonza Lorenzo, on the scene in person. It was probably the ransacking\r\nof the Don\xe2\x80\x99s library and the discussion on the books of chivalry that\r\nfirst suggested it to him that his idea was capable of development.\r\nWhat, if instead of a mere string of farcical misadventures, he were to\r\nmake his tale a burlesque of one of these books, caricaturing their\r\nstyle, incidents, and spirit?\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this change of plan, he hastily and somewhat clumsily\r\ndivided what he had written into chapters on the model of \xe2\x80\x9cAmadis,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninvented the fable of a mysterious Arabic manuscript, and set up Cid\r\nHamete Benengeli in imitation of the almost invariable practice of the\r\nchivalry-romance authors, who were fond of tracing their books to some\r\nrecondite source. In working out the new ideas, he soon found the value\r\nof Sancho Panza. Indeed, the keynote, not only to Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s part, but to\r\nthe whole book, is struck in the first words Sancho utters when he\r\nannounces his intention of taking his ass with him. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout the ass,\xe2\x80\x9d we\r\nare told, \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he could call\r\nto mind any knight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on\r\nass-back; but no instance occurred to his memory.\xe2\x80\x9d We can see the whole\r\nscene at a glance, the stolid unconsciousness of Sancho and the\r\nperplexity of his master, upon whose perception the incongruity has\r\njust forced itself. This is Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s mission throughout the book; he is\r\nan unconscious Mephistopheles, always unwittingly making mockery of his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s aspirations, always exposing the fallacy of his ideas by some\r\nunintentional ad absurdum, always bringing him back to the world of\r\nfact and commonplace by force of sheer stolidity.\r\n\r\nBy the time Cervantes had got his volume of novels off his hands, and\r\nsummoned up resolution enough to set about the Second Part in earnest,\r\nthe case was very much altered. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had not\r\nmerely found favour, but had already become, what they have never since\r\nceased to be, veritable entities to the popular imagination. There was\r\nno occasion for him now to interpolate extraneous matter; nay, his\r\nreaders told him plainly that what they wanted of him was more Don\r\nQuixote and more Sancho Panza, and not novels, tales, or digressions.\r\nTo himself, too, his creations had become realities, and he had become\r\nproud of them, especially of Sancho. He began the Second Part,\r\ntherefore, under very different conditions, and the difference makes\r\nitself manifest at once. Even in translation the style will be seen to\r\nbe far easier, more flowing, more natural, and more like that of a man\r\nsure of himself and of his audience. Don Quixote and Sancho undergo a\r\nchange also. In the First Part, Don Quixote has no character or\r\nindividuality whatever. He is nothing more than a crazy representative\r\nof the sentiments of the chivalry romances. In all that he says and\r\ndoes he is simply repeating the lesson he has learned from his books;\r\nand therefore, it is absurd to speak of him in the gushing strain of\r\nthe sentimental critics when they dilate upon his nobleness,\r\ndisinterestedness, dauntless courage, and so forth. It was the business\r\nof a knight-errant to right wrongs, redress injuries, and succour the\r\ndistressed, and this, as a matter of course, he makes his business when\r\nhe takes up the part; a knight-errant was bound to be intrepid, and so\r\nhe feels bound to cast fear aside. Of all Byron\xe2\x80\x99s melodious nonsense\r\nabout Don Quixote, the most nonsensical statement is that \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis his\r\nvirtue makes him mad!\xe2\x80\x9d The exact opposite is the truth; it is his\r\nmadness makes him virtuous.\r\n\r\nIn the Second Part, Cervantes repeatedly reminds the reader, as if it\r\nwas a point upon which he was anxious there should be no mistake, that\r\nhis hero\xe2\x80\x99s madness is strictly confined to delusions on the subject of\r\nchivalry, and that on every other subject he is discreto, one, in fact,\r\nwhose faculty of discernment is in perfect order. The advantage of this\r\nis that he is enabled to make use of Don Quixote as a mouthpiece for\r\nhis own reflections, and so, without seeming to digress, allow himself\r\nthe relief of digression when he requires it, as freely as in a\r\ncommonplace book.\r\n\r\nIt is true the amount of individuality bestowed upon Don Quixote is not\r\nvery great. There are some natural touches of character about him, such\r\nas his mixture of irascibility and placability, and his curious\r\naffection for Sancho together with his impatience of the squire\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloquacity and impertinence; but in the main, apart from his craze, he\r\nis little more than a thoughtful, cultured gentleman, with instinctive\r\ngood taste and a great deal of shrewdness and originality of mind.\r\n\r\nAs to Sancho, it is plain, from the concluding words of the preface to\r\nthe First Part, that he was a favourite with his creator even before he\r\nhad been taken into favour by the public. An inferior genius, taking\r\nhim in hand a second time, would very likely have tried to improve him\r\nby making him more comical, clever, amiable, or virtuous. But Cervantes\r\nwas too true an artist to spoil his work in this way. Sancho, when he\r\nreappears, is the old Sancho with the old familiar features; but with a\r\ndifference; they have been brought out more distinctly, but at the same\r\ntime with a careful avoidance of anything like caricature; the outline\r\nhas been filled in where filling in was necessary, and, vivified by a\r\nfew touches of a master\xe2\x80\x99s hand, Sancho stands before us as he might in\r\na character portrait by Velazquez. He is a much more important and\r\nprominent figure in the Second Part than in the First; indeed, it is\r\nhis matchless mendacity about Dulcinea that to a great extent supplies\r\nthe action of the story.\r\n\r\nHis development in this respect is as remarkable as in any other. In\r\nthe First Part he displays a great natural gift of lying. His lies are\r\nnot of the highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonly\r\nindulge in; like Falstaff\xe2\x80\x99s, they resemble the father that begets them;\r\nthey are simple, homely, plump lies; plain working lies, in short. But\r\nin the service of such a master as Don Quixote he develops rapidly, as\r\nwe see when he comes to palm off the three country wenches as Dulcinea\r\nand her ladies in waiting. It is worth noticing how, flushed by his\r\nsuccess in this instance, he is tempted afterwards to try a flight\r\nbeyond his powers in his account of the journey on Clavile\xc3\xb1o.\r\n\r\nIn the Second Part it is the spirit rather than the incidents of the\r\nchivalry romances that is the subject of the burlesque. Enchantments of\r\nthe sort travestied in those of Dulcinea and the Trifaldi and the cave\r\nof Montesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances,\r\nand another distinguishing feature is caricatured in Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblind adoration of Dulcinea. In the romances of chivalry love is either\r\na mere animalism or a fantastic idolatry. Only a coarse-minded man\r\nwould care to make merry with the former, but to one of Cervantes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhumour the latter was naturally an attractive subject for ridicule.\r\nLike everything else in these romances, it is a gross exaggeration of\r\nthe real sentiment of chivalry, but its peculiar extravagance is\r\nprobably due to the influence of those masters of hyperbole, the\r\nProvencal poets. When a troubadour professed his readiness to obey his\r\nlady in all things, he made it incumbent upon the next comer, if he\r\nwished to avoid the imputation of tameness and commonplace, to declare\r\nhimself the slave of her will, which the next was compelled to cap by\r\nsome still stronger declaration; and so expressions of devotion went on\r\nrising one above the other like biddings at an auction, and a\r\nconventional language of gallantry and theory of love came into being\r\nthat in time permeated the literature of Southern Europe, and bore\r\nfruit, in one direction in the transcendental worship of Beatrice and\r\nLaura, and in another in the grotesque idolatry which found exponents\r\nin writers like Feliciano de Silva. This is what Cervantes deals with\r\nin Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s passion for Dulcinea, and in no instance has he\r\ncarried out the burlesque more happily. By keeping Dulcinea in the\r\nbackground, and making her a vague shadowy being of whose very\r\nexistence we are left in doubt, he invests Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s worship of her\r\nvirtues and charms with an additional extravagance, and gives still\r\nmore point to the caricature of the sentiment and language of the\r\nromances.\r\n\r\nOne of the great merits of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d and one of the qualities that\r\nhave secured its acceptance by all classes of readers and made it the\r\nmost cosmopolitan of books, is its simplicity. There are, of course,\r\npoints obvious enough to a Spanish seventeenth century audience which\r\ndo not immediately strike a reader now-a-days, and Cervantes often\r\ntakes it for granted that an allusion will be generally understood\r\nwhich is only intelligible to a few. For example, on many of his\r\nreaders in Spain, and most of his readers out of it, the significance\r\nof his choice of a country for his hero is completely lost. It would be\r\ngoing too far to say that no one can thoroughly comprehend \xe2\x80\x9cDon\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x9d without having seen La Mancha, but undoubtedly even a glimpse\r\nof La Mancha will give an insight into the meaning of Cervantes such as\r\nno commentator can give. Of all the regions of Spain it is the last\r\nthat would suggest the idea of romance. Of all the dull central plateau\r\nof the Peninsula it is the dullest tract. There is something impressive\r\nabout the grim solitudes of Estremadura; and if the plains of Leon and\r\nOld Castile are bald and dreary, they are studded with old cities\r\nrenowned in history and rich in relics of the past. But there is no\r\nredeeming feature in the Manchegan landscape; it has all the sameness\r\nof the desert without its dignity; the few towns and villages that\r\nbreak its monotony are mean and commonplace, there is nothing venerable\r\nabout them, they have not even the picturesqueness of poverty; indeed,\r\nDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s own village, Argamasilla, has a sort of oppressive\r\nrespectability in the prim regularity of its streets and houses;\r\neverything is ignoble; the very windmills are the ugliest and shabbiest\r\nof the windmill kind.\r\n\r\nTo anyone who knew the country well, the mere style and title of \xe2\x80\x9cDon\r\nQuixote of La Mancha\xe2\x80\x9d gave the key to the author\xe2\x80\x99s meaning at once. La\r\nMancha as the knight\xe2\x80\x99s country and scene of his chivalries is of a\r\npiece with the pasteboard helmet, the farm-labourer on ass-back for a\r\nsquire, knighthood conferred by a rascally ventero, convicts taken for\r\nvictims of oppression, and the rest of the incongruities between Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s world and the world he lived in, between things as he saw\r\nthem and things as they were.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that this element of incongruity, underlying the whole\r\nhumour and purpose of the book, should have been so little heeded by\r\nthe majority of those who have undertaken to interpret \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nIt has been completely overlooked, for example, by the illustrators. To\r\nbe sure, the great majority of the artists who illustrated \xe2\x80\x9cDon\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x9d knew nothing whatever of Spain. To them a venta conveyed no\r\nidea but the abstract one of a roadside inn, and they could not\r\ntherefore do full justice to the humour of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s misconception\r\nin taking it for a castle, or perceive the remoteness of all its\r\nrealities from his ideal. But even when better informed they seem to\r\nhave no apprehension of the full force of the discrepancy. Take, for\r\ninstance, Gustave Dor\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s drawing of Don Quixote watching his armour in\r\nthe inn-yard. Whether or not the Venta de Quesada on the Seville road\r\nis, as tradition maintains, the inn described in \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d beyond\r\nall question it was just such an inn-yard as the one behind it that\r\nCervantes had in his mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and it was on just such a rude stone\r\ntrough as that beside the primitive draw-well in the corner that he\r\nmeant Don Quixote to deposit his armour. Gustave Dor\xc3\xa9 makes it an\r\nelaborate fountain such as no arriero ever watered his mules at in the\r\ncorral of any venta in Spain, and thereby entirely misses the point\r\naimed at by Cervantes. It is the mean, prosaic, commonplace character\r\nof all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance to\r\nDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s vigil and the ceremony that follows.\r\n\r\nCervantes\xe2\x80\x99 humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler\r\nsort, the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous.\r\nIt is the incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with\r\nthe ideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful\r\nvitality and truth to nature of the character, that makes him the most\r\nhumorous creation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity\r\nof which Cervantes was the first great master, \xe2\x80\x9cCervantes\xe2\x80\x99 serious\r\nair,\xe2\x80\x9d which sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later\r\nhumourists, is essential to this kind of humour, and here again\r\nCervantes has suffered at the hands of his interpreters. Nothing,\r\nunless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips, could be more out of\r\nplace in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a flippant, would-be\r\nfacetious style, like that of Motteux\xe2\x80\x99s version for example, or the\r\nsprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt. It is the\r\ngrave matter-of-factness of the narrative, and the apparent\r\nunconsciousness of the author that he is saying anything ludicrous,\r\nanything but the merest commonplace, that give its peculiar flavour to\r\nthe humour of Cervantes. His, in fact, is the exact opposite of the\r\nhumour of Sterne and the self-conscious humourists. Even when Uncle\r\nToby is at his best, you are always aware of \xe2\x80\x9cthe man Sterne\xe2\x80\x9d behind\r\nhim, watching you over his shoulder to see what effect he is producing.\r\nCervantes always leaves you alone with Don Quixote and Sancho. He and\r\nSwift and the great humourists always keep themselves out of sight, or,\r\nmore properly speaking, never think about themselves at all, unlike our\r\nlatter-day school of humourists, who seem to have revived the old\r\nhorse-collar method, and try to raise a laugh by some grotesque\r\nassumption of ignorance, imbecility, or bad taste.\r\n\r\nIt is true that to do full justice to Spanish humour in any other\r\nlanguage is well-nigh an impossibility. There is a natural gravity and\r\na sonorous stateliness about Spanish, be it ever so colloquial, that\r\nmake an absurdity doubly absurd, and give plausibility to the most\r\npreposterous statement. This is what makes Sancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s drollery the\r\ndespair of the conscientious translator. Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s curt comments can\r\nnever fall flat, but they lose half their flavour when transferred from\r\ntheir native Castilian into any other medium. But if foreigners have\r\nfailed to do justice to the humour of Cervantes, they are no worse than\r\nhis own countrymen. Indeed, were it not for the Spanish peasant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrelish of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d one might be tempted to think that the great\r\nhumourist was not looked upon as a humourist at all in his own country.\r\n\r\nThe craze of Don Quixote seems, in some instances, to have communicated\r\nitself to his critics, making them see things that are not in the book\r\nand run full tilt at phantoms that have no existence save in their own\r\nimaginations. Like a good many critics now-a-days, they forget that\r\nscreams are not criticism, and that it is only vulgar tastes that are\r\ninfluenced by strings of superlatives, three-piled hyperboles, and\r\npompous epithets. But what strikes one as particularly strange is that\r\nwhile they deal in extravagant eulogies, and ascribe all manner of\r\nimaginary ideas and qualities to Cervantes, they show no perception of\r\nthe quality that ninety-nine out of a hundred of his readers would rate\r\nhighest in him, and hold to be the one that raises him above all\r\nrivalry.\r\n\r\nTo speak of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d as if it were merely a humorous book would be\r\na manifest misdescription. Cervantes at times makes it a kind of\r\ncommonplace book for occasional essays and criticisms, or for the\r\nobservations and reflections and gathered wisdom of a long and stirring\r\nlife. It is a mine of shrewd observation on mankind and human nature.\r\nAmong modern novels there may be, here and there, more elaborate\r\nstudies of character, but there is no book richer in individualised\r\ncharacter. What Coleridge said of Shakespeare in minimis is true of\r\nCervantes; he never, even for the most temporary purpose, puts forward\r\na lay figure. There is life and individuality in all his characters,\r\nhowever little they may have to do, or however short a time they may be\r\nbefore the reader. Samson Carrasco, the curate, Teresa Panza,\r\nAltisidora, even the two students met on the road to the cave of\r\nMontesinos, all live and move and have their being; and it is\r\ncharacteristic of the broad humanity of Cervantes that there is not a\r\nhateful one among them all. Even poor Maritornes, with her deplorable\r\nmorals, has a kind heart of her own and \xe2\x80\x9csome faint and distant\r\nresemblance to a Christian about her;\xe2\x80\x9d and as for Sancho, though on\r\ndissection we fail to find a lovable trait in him, unless it be a sort\r\nof dog-like affection for his master, who is there that in his heart\r\ndoes not love him?\r\n\r\nBut it is, after all, the humour of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d that distinguishes it\r\nfrom all other books of the romance kind. It is this that makes it, as\r\none of the most judicial-minded of modern critics calls it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe best\r\nnovel in the world beyond all comparison.\xe2\x80\x9d It is its varied humour,\r\nranging from broad farce to comedy as subtle as Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s or\r\nMoli\xc3\xa8re\xe2\x80\x99s that has naturalised it in every country where there are\r\nreaders, and made it a classic in every language that has a literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR\xe2\x80\x99S PREFACE\r\n\r\nIdle reader: thou mayest believe me without any oath that I would this\r\nbook, as it is the child of my brain, were the fairest, gayest, and\r\ncleverest that could be imagined. But I could not counteract Nature\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlaw that everything shall beget its like; and what, then, could this\r\nsterile, illtilled wit of mine beget but the story of a dry,\r\nshrivelled, whimsical offspring, full of thoughts of all sorts and such\r\nas never came into any other imagination\xe2\x80\x94just what might be begotten in\r\na prison, where every misery is lodged and every doleful sound makes\r\nits dwelling? Tranquillity, a cheerful retreat, pleasant fields, bright\r\nskies, murmuring brooks, peace of mind, these are the things that go\r\nfar to make even the most barren muses fertile, and bring into the\r\nworld births that fill it with wonder and delight. Sometimes when a\r\nfather has an ugly, loutish son, the love he bears him so blindfolds\r\nhis eyes that he does not see his defects, or, rather, takes them for\r\ngifts and charms of mind and body, and talks of them to his friends as\r\nwit and grace. I, however\xe2\x80\x94for though I pass for the father, I am but\r\nthe stepfather to \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94have no desire to go with the current\r\nof custom, or to implore thee, dearest reader, almost with tears in my\r\neyes, as others do, to pardon or excuse the defects thou wilt perceive\r\nin this child of mine. Thou art neither its kinsman nor its friend, thy\r\nsoul is thine own and thy will as free as any man\xe2\x80\x99s, whate\xe2\x80\x99er he be,\r\nthou art in thine own house and master of it as much as the king of his\r\ntaxes and thou knowest the common saying, \xe2\x80\x9cUnder my cloak I kill the\r\nking;\xe2\x80\x9d all which exempts and frees thee from every consideration and\r\nobligation, and thou canst say what thou wilt of the story without fear\r\nof being abused for any ill or rewarded for any good thou mayest say of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMy wish would be simply to present it to thee plain and unadorned,\r\nwithout any embellishment of preface or uncountable muster of customary\r\nsonnets, epigrams, and eulogies, such as are commonly put at the\r\nbeginning of books. For I can tell thee, though composing it cost me\r\nsome labour, I found none greater than the making of this Preface thou\r\nart now reading. Many times did I take up my pen to write it, and many\r\ndid I lay it down again, not knowing what to write. One of these times,\r\nas I was pondering with the paper before me, a pen in my ear, my elbow\r\non the desk, and my cheek in my hand, thinking of what I should say,\r\nthere came in unexpectedly a certain lively, clever friend of mine,\r\nwho, seeing me so deep in thought, asked the reason; to which I, making\r\nno mystery of it, answered that I was thinking of the Preface I had to\r\nmake for the story of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d which so troubled me that I had a\r\nmind not to make any at all, nor even publish the achievements of so\r\nnoble a knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor, how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what that\r\nancient lawgiver they call the Public will say when it sees me, after\r\nslumbering so many years in the silence of oblivion, coming out now\r\nwith all my years upon my back, and with a book as dry as a rush,\r\ndevoid of invention, meagre in style, poor in thoughts, wholly wanting\r\nin learning and wisdom, without quotations in the margin or annotations\r\nat the end, after the fashion of other books I see, which, though all\r\nfables and profanity, are so full of maxims from Aristotle, and Plato,\r\nand the whole herd of philosophers, that they fill the readers with\r\namazement and convince them that the authors are men of learning,\r\nerudition, and eloquence. And then, when they quote the Holy\r\nScriptures!\xe2\x80\x94anyone would say they are St. Thomases or other doctors of\r\nthe Church, observing as they do a decorum so ingenious that in one\r\nsentence they describe a distracted lover and in the next deliver a\r\ndevout little sermon that it is a pleasure and a treat to hear and\r\nread. Of all this there will be nothing in my book, for I have nothing\r\nto quote in the margin or to note at the end, and still less do I know\r\nwhat authors I follow in it, to place them at the beginning, as all do,\r\nunder the letters A, B, C, beginning with Aristotle and ending with\r\nXenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis, though one was a slanderer and the\r\nother a painter. Also my book must do without sonnets at the beginning,\r\nat least sonnets whose authors are dukes, marquises, counts, bishops,\r\nladies, or famous poets. Though if I were to ask two or three obliging\r\nfriends, I know they would give me them, and such as the productions of\r\nthose that have the highest reputation in our Spain could not equal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI am determined that Se\xc3\xb1or Don\r\nQuixote shall remain buried in the archives of his own La Mancha until\r\nHeaven provide someone to garnish him with all those things he stands\r\nin need of; because I find myself, through my shallowness and want of\r\nlearning, unequal to supplying them, and because I am by nature shy and\r\ncareless about hunting for authors to say what I myself can say without\r\nthem. Hence the cogitation and abstraction you found me in, and reason\r\nenough, what you have heard from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing this, my friend, giving himself a slap on the forehead and\r\nbreaking into a hearty laugh, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cBefore God, Brother, now am I\r\ndisabused of an error in which I have been living all this long time I\r\nhave known you, all through which I have taken you to be shrewd and\r\nsensible in all you do; but now I see you are as far from that as the\r\nheaven is from the earth. It is possible that things of so little\r\nmoment and so easy to set right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit like\r\nyours, fit to break through and crush far greater obstacles? By my\r\nfaith, this comes, not of any want of ability, but of too much\r\nindolence and too little knowledge of life. Do you want to know if I am\r\ntelling the truth? Well, then, attend to me, and you will see how, in\r\nthe opening and shutting of an eye, I sweep away all your difficulties,\r\nand supply all those deficiencies which you say check and discourage\r\nyou from bringing before the world the story of your famous Don\r\nQuixote, the light and mirror of all knight-errantry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay on,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, listening to his talk; \xe2\x80\x9chow do you propose to make up\r\nfor my diffidence, and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity I am\r\nin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which he made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cYour first difficulty about the sonnets,\r\nepigrams, or complimentary verses which you want for the beginning, and\r\nwhich ought to be by persons of importance and rank, can be removed if\r\nyou yourself take a little trouble to make them; you can afterwards\r\nbaptise them, and put any name you like to them, fathering them on\r\nPrester John of the Indies or the Emperor of Trebizond, who, to my\r\nknowledge, were said to have been famous poets: and even if they were\r\nnot, and any pedants or bachelors should attack you and question the\r\nfact, never care two maravedis for that, for even if they prove a lie\r\nagainst you they cannot cut off the hand you wrote it with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to references in the margin to the books and authors from whom you\r\ntake the aphorisms and sayings you put into your story, it is only\r\ncontriving to fit in nicely any sentences or scraps of Latin you may\r\nhappen to have by heart, or at any rate that will not give you much\r\ntrouble to look up; so as, when you speak of freedom and captivity, to\r\ninsert\r\n\r\n_Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro;_\r\n\r\n\r\nand then refer in the margin to Horace, or whoever said it; or, if you\r\nallude to the power of death, to come in with\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n_Pallida mors \xc3\xa6quo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas,\r\nRegumque turres._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it be friendship and the love God bids us bear to our enemy, go at\r\nonce to the Holy Scriptures, which you can do with a very small amount\r\nof research, and quote no less than the words of God himself: _Ego\r\nautem dico vobis: diligite inimicos vestros._ If you speak of evil\r\nthoughts, turn to the Gospel: _De corde exeunt cogitationes mal\xc3\xa6._ If\r\nof the fickleness of friends, there is Cato, who will give you his\r\ndistich:\r\n\r\n_Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos,\r\nTempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith these and such like bits of Latin they will take you for a\r\ngrammarian at all events, and that now-a-days is no small honour and\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith regard to adding annotations at the end of the book, you may\r\nsafely do it in this way. If you mention any giant in your book\r\ncontrive that it shall be the giant Goliath, and with this alone, which\r\nwill cost you almost nothing, you have a grand note, for you can\r\nput\xe2\x80\x94_The giant Golias or Goliath was a Philistine whom the shepherd\r\nDavid slew by a mighty stone-cast in the Terebinth valley, as is\r\nrelated in the Book of Kings_\xe2\x80\x94in the chapter where you find it written.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext, to prove yourself a man of erudition in polite literature and\r\ncosmography, manage that the river Tagus shall be named in your story,\r\nand there you are at once with another famous annotation, setting\r\nforth\xe2\x80\x94_The river Tagus was so called after a King of Spain: it has its\r\nsource in such and such a place and falls into the ocean, kissing the\r\nwalls of the famous city of Lisbon, and it is a common belief that it\r\nhas golden sands_, etc. If you should have anything to do with robbers,\r\nI will give you the story of Cacus, for I have it by heart; if with\r\nloose women, there is the Bishop of Mondonedo, who will give you the\r\nloan of Lamia, Laida, and Flora, any reference to whom will bring you\r\ngreat credit; if with hard-hearted ones, Ovid will furnish you with\r\nMedea; if with witches or enchantresses, Homer has Calypso, and Virgil\r\nCirce; if with valiant captains, Julius C\xc3\xa6sar himself will lend you\r\nhimself in his own \xe2\x80\x98Commentaries,\xe2\x80\x99 and Plutarch will give you a\r\nthousand Alexanders. If you should deal with love, with two ounces you\r\nmay know of Tuscan you can go to Leon the Hebrew, who will supply you\r\nto your heart\xe2\x80\x99s content; or if you should not care to go to foreign\r\ncountries you have at home Fonseca\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Of the Love of God,\xe2\x80\x99 in which is\r\ncondensed all that you or the most imaginative mind can want on the\r\nsubject. In short, all you have to do is to manage to quote these\r\nnames, or refer to these stories I have mentioned, and leave it to me\r\nto insert the annotations and quotations, and I swear by all that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood to fill your margins and use up four sheets at the end of the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let us come to those references to authors which other books have,\r\nand you want for yours. The remedy for this is very simple: You have\r\nonly to look out for some book that quotes them all, from A to Z as you\r\nsay yourself, and then insert the very same alphabet in your book, and\r\nthough the imposition may be plain to see, because you have so little\r\nneed to borrow from them, that is no matter; there will probably be\r\nsome simple enough to believe that you have made use of them all in\r\nthis plain, artless story of yours. At any rate, if it answers no other\r\npurpose, this long catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprising\r\nlook of authority to your book. Besides, no one will trouble himself to\r\nverify whether you have followed them or whether you have not, being no\r\nway concerned in it; especially as, if I mistake not, this book of\r\nyours has no need of any one of those things you say it wants, for it\r\nis, from beginning to end, an attack upon the books of chivalry, of\r\nwhich Aristotle never dreamt, nor St. Basil said a word, nor Cicero had\r\nany knowledge; nor do the niceties of truth nor the observations of\r\nastrology come within the range of its fanciful vagaries; nor have\r\ngeometrical measurements or refutations of the arguments used in\r\nrhetoric anything to do with it; nor does it mean to preach to anybody,\r\nmixing up things human and divine, a sort of motley in which no\r\nChristian understanding should dress itself. It has only to avail\r\nitself of truth to nature in its composition, and the more perfect the\r\nimitation the better the work will be. And as this piece of yours aims\r\nat nothing more than to destroy the authority and influence which books\r\nof chivalry have in the world and with the public, there is no need for\r\nyou to go a-begging for aphorisms from philosophers, precepts from Holy\r\nScripture, fables from poets, speeches from orators, or miracles from\r\nsaints; but merely to take care that your style and diction run\r\nmusically, pleasantly, and plainly, with clear, proper, and well-placed\r\nwords, setting forth your purpose to the best of your power, and\r\nputting your ideas intelligibly, without confusion or obscurity.\r\nStrive, too, that in reading your story the melancholy may be moved to\r\nlaughter, and the merry made merrier still; that the simple shall not\r\nbe wearied, that the judicious shall admire the invention, that the\r\ngrave shall not despise it, nor the wise fail to praise it. Finally,\r\nkeep your aim fixed on the destruction of that ill-founded edifice of\r\nthe books of chivalry, hated by some and praised by many more; for if\r\nyou succeed in this you will have achieved no small success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn profound silence I listened to what my friend said, and his\r\nobservations made such an impression on me that, without attempting to\r\nquestion them, I admitted their soundness, and out of them I determined\r\nto make this Preface; wherein, gentle reader, thou wilt perceive my\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s good sense, my good fortune in finding such an adviser in such\r\na time of need, and what thou hast gained in receiving, without\r\naddition or alteration, the story of the famous Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha, who is held by all the inhabitants of the district of the Campo\r\nde Montiel to have been the chastest lover and the bravest knight that\r\nhas for many years been seen in that neighbourhood. I have no desire to\r\nmagnify the service I render thee in making thee acquainted with so\r\nrenowned and honoured a knight, but I do desire thy thanks for the\r\nacquaintance thou wilt make with the famous Sancho Panza, his squire,\r\nin whom, to my thinking, I have given thee condensed all the squirely\r\ndrolleries that are scattered through the swarm of the vain books of\r\nchivalry. And so\xe2\x80\x94may God give thee health, and not forget me.

An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most\r\nnights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so\r\nextra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest\r\nof it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to\r\nmatch for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his\r\nbest homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece\r\nunder twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to\r\nsaddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this\r\ngentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit,\r\nspare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman. They\r\nwill have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for here there is some\r\ndifference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject),\r\nalthough from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was called\r\nQuexana. This, however, is of but little importance to our tale; it\r\nwill be enough not to stray a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth from the truth in the\r\ntelling of it.\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at\r\nleisure (which was mostly all the year round) gave himself up to\r\nreading books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost\r\nentirely neglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the\r\nmanagement of his property; and to such a pitch did his eagerness and\r\ninfatuation go that he sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of\r\nchivalry to read, and brought home as many of them as he could get. But\r\nof all there were none he liked so well as those of the famous\r\nFeliciano de Silva\xe2\x80\x99s composition, for their lucidity of style and\r\ncomplicated conceits were as pearls in his sight, particularly when in\r\nhis reading he came upon courtships and cartels, where he often found\r\npassages like \xe2\x80\x9c_the reason of the unreason with which my reason is\r\nafflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at your\r\nbeauty;\xe2\x80\x9d or again, \xe2\x80\x9cthe high heavens, that of your divinity divinely\r\nfortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert your\r\ngreatness deserves_.\xe2\x80\x9d Over conceits of this sort the poor gentleman\r\nlost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand them and\r\nworm the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not have\r\nmade out or extracted had he come to life again for that special\r\npurpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis\r\ngave and took, because it seemed to him that, great as were the\r\nsurgeons who had cured him, he must have had his face and body covered\r\nall over with seams and scars. He commended, however, the author\xe2\x80\x99s way\r\nof ending his book with the promise of that interminable adventure, and\r\nmany a time was he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly as\r\nis there proposed, which no doubt he would have done, and made a\r\nsuccessful piece of work of it too, had not greater and more absorbing\r\nthoughts prevented him.\r\n\r\nMany an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learned\r\nman, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which had been the better\r\nknight, Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the\r\nvillage barber, however, used to say that neither of them came up to\r\nthe Knight of Ph\xc5\x93bus, and that if there was any that could compare with\r\n_him_ it was Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had\r\na spirit that was equal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight,\r\nnor lachrymose like his brother, while in the matter of valour he was\r\nnot a whit behind him. In short, he became so absorbed in his books\r\nthat he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn\r\nto dark, poring over them; and what with little sleep and much reading\r\nhis brains got so dry that he lost his wits. His fancy grew full of\r\nwhat he used to read about in his books, enchantments, quarrels,\r\nbattles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves, agonies, and all sorts of\r\nimpossible nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabric\r\nof invention and fancy he read of was true, that to him no history in\r\nthe world had more reality in it. He used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz was a\r\nvery good knight, but that he was not to be compared with the Knight of\r\nthe Burning Sword who with one back-stroke cut in half two fierce and\r\nmonstrous giants. He thought more of Bernardo del Carpio because at\r\nRoncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments, availing himself\r\nof the artifice of Hercules when he strangled Ant\xc3\xa6us the son of Terra\r\nin his arms. He approved highly of the giant Morgante, because,\r\nalthough of the giant breed which is always arrogant and\r\nill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But above all he\r\nadmired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he saw him sallying\r\nforth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when beyond the\r\nseas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history says, was\r\nentirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of a\r\nGanelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into the\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nIn short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion\r\nthat ever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he fancied\r\nit was right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour\r\nas for the service of his country, that he should make a knight-errant\r\nof himself, roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in\r\nquest of adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had\r\nread of as being the usual practices of knights-errant; righting every\r\nkind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in\r\nthe issue, he was to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man\r\nsaw himself crowned by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond at\r\nleast; and so, led away by the intense enjoyment he found in these\r\npleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith to put his scheme into\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to\r\nhis great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in a\r\ncorner eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished\r\nit as best he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that it\r\nhad no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency,\r\nhowever, his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet\r\nof pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one.\r\nIt is true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a\r\ncut, he drew his sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of\r\nwhich undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. The ease\r\nwith which he had knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and\r\nto guard against that danger he set to work again, fixing bars of iron\r\non the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, not\r\ncaring to try any more experiments with it, he passed it and adopted it\r\nas a helmet of the most perfect construction.\r\n\r\nHe next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a\r\nreal and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that \xe2\x80\x9c_tantum pellis\r\net ossa fuit_,\xe2\x80\x9d surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or\r\nthe Babieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name to\r\ngive him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse\r\nbelonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own,\r\nshould be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so\r\nas to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant,\r\nand what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master\r\ntaking a new character, he should take a new name, and that it should\r\nbe a distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and\r\ncalling he was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struck\r\nout, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of\r\nhis memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to\r\nhis thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a\r\nhack before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all\r\nthe hacks in the world.\r\n\r\nHaving got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to\r\nget one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this\r\npoint, till at last he made up his mind to call himself \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious history\r\nhave inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, and\r\nnot Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that the\r\nvaliant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis and\r\nnothing more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it\r\nfamous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight,\r\nresolved to add on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote of\r\nLa Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described accurately his origin\r\nand country, and did honour to it in taking his surname from it.\r\n\r\nSo then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet,\r\nhis hack christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to the\r\nconclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady\r\nto be in love with; for a knight-errant without love was like a tree\r\nwithout leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul. As he said to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cIf, for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across some\r\ngiant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant, and\r\noverthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the waist, or,\r\nin short, vanquish and subdue him, will it not be well to have someone\r\nI may send him to as a present, that he may come in and fall on his\r\nknees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nam the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania,\r\nvanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently extolled knight\r\nDon Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to present myself before\r\nyour Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Oh,\r\nhow our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especially\r\nwhen he had thought of someone to call his Lady! There was, so the\r\nstory goes, in a village near his own a very good-looking farm-girl\r\nwith whom he had been at one time in love, though, so far as is known,\r\nshe never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name was\r\nAldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of\r\nLady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which should not\r\nbe out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that of\r\na princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del\r\nToboso\xe2\x80\x94she being of El Toboso\xe2\x80\x94a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon,\r\nand significant, like all those he had already bestowed upon himself\r\nand the things belonging to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np007b.jpg (61K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF THE FIRST SALLY THE INGENIOUS DON QUIXOTE MADE FROM\r\nHOME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np007c.jpg (97K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any longer the\r\nexecution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of all the world\r\nwas losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right,\r\ngrievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, and\r\nduties to discharge. So, without giving notice of his intention to\r\nanyone, and without anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning\r\nof the day (which was one of the hottest of the month of July) he\r\ndonned his suit of armour, mounted Rocinante with his patched-up helmet\r\non, braced his buckler, took his lance, and by the back door of the\r\nyard sallied forth upon the plain in the highest contentment and\r\nsatisfaction at seeing with what ease he had made a beginning with his\r\ngrand purpose. But scarcely did he find himself upon the open plain,\r\nwhen a terrible thought struck him, one all but enough to make him\r\nabandon the enterprise at the very outset. It occurred to him that he\r\nhad not been dubbed a knight, and that according to the law of chivalry\r\nhe neither could nor ought to bear arms against any knight; and that\r\neven if he had been, still he ought, as a novice knight, to wear white\r\narmour, without a device upon the shield until by his prowess he had\r\nearned one. These reflections made him waver in his purpose, but his\r\ncraze being stronger than any reasoning, he made up his mind to have\r\nhimself dubbed a knight by the first one he came across, following the\r\nexample of others in the same case, as he had read in the books that\r\nbrought him to this pass. As for white armour, he resolved, on the\r\nfirst opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than an ermine; and\r\nso comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that which his horse\r\nchose, for in this he believed lay the essence of adventures.\r\n\r\nThus setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking to\r\nhimself and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWho knows but that in time to come, when the\r\nveracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who writes\r\nit, when he has to set forth my first sally in the early morning, will\r\ndo it after this fashion? \xe2\x80\x98Scarce had the rubicund Apollo spread o\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nthe face of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his bright\r\nhair, scarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned their\r\nnotes to hail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of the\r\nrosy Dawn, that, deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, was\r\nappearing to mortals at the gates and balconies of the Manchegan\r\nhorizon, when the renowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, quitting\r\nthe lazy down, mounted his celebrated steed Rocinante and began to\r\ntraverse the ancient and famous Campo de Montiel;\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d which in fact he\r\nwas actually traversing. \xe2\x80\x9cHappy the age, happy the time,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cin which shall be made known my deeds of fame, worthy to be moulded in\r\nbrass, carved in marble, limned in pictures, for a memorial for ever.\r\nAnd thou, O sage magician, whoever thou art, to whom it shall fall to\r\nbe the chronicler of this wondrous history, forget not, I entreat thee,\r\nmy good Rocinante, the constant companion of my ways and wanderings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPresently he broke out again, as if he were love-stricken in earnest,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Princess Dulcinea, lady of this captive heart, a grievous wrong hast\r\nthou done me to drive me forth with scorn, and with inexorable obduracy\r\nbanish me from the presence of thy beauty. O lady, deign to hold in\r\nremembrance this heart, thy vassal, that thus in anguish pines for love\r\nof thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he went on stringing together these and other absurdities, all in\r\nthe style of those his books had taught him, imitating their language\r\nas well as he could; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sun\r\nmounted so rapidly and with such fervour that it was enough to melt his\r\nbrains if he had any. Nearly all day he travelled without anything\r\nremarkable happening to him, at which he was in despair, for he was\r\nanxious to encounter someone at once upon whom to try the might of his\r\nstrong arm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np008.jpg (289K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWriters there are who say the first adventure he met with was that of\r\nPuerto Lapice; others say it was that of the windmills; but what I have\r\nascertained on this point, and what I have found written in the annals\r\nof La Mancha, is that he was on the road all day, and towards nightfall\r\nhis hack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry, when, looking\r\nall around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s shanty\r\nwhere he might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants, he perceived\r\nnot far out of his road an inn, which was as welcome as a star guiding\r\nhim to the portals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; and\r\nquickening his pace he reached it just as night was setting in. At the\r\ndoor were standing two young women, girls of the district as they call\r\nthem, on their way to Seville with some carriers who had chanced to\r\nhalt that night at the inn; and as, happen what might to our\r\nadventurer, everything he saw or imagined seemed to him to be and to\r\nhappen after the fashion of what he read of, the moment he saw the inn\r\nhe pictured it to himself as a castle with its four turrets and\r\npinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting the drawbridge and moat and\r\nall the belongings usually ascribed to castles of the sort. To this\r\ninn, which to him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at a short distance\r\nfrom it he checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf would show himself\r\nupon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give notice that a knight\r\nwas approaching the castle. But seeing that they were slow about it,\r\nand that Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the stable, he made for the\r\ninn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who were standing there,\r\nand who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or lovely ladies taking\r\ntheir ease at the castle gate.\r\n\r\nAt this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through\r\nthe stubbles collecting a drove of pigs (for, without any apology, that\r\nis what they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring them\r\ntogether, and forthwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he was\r\nexpecting, the signal of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so with\r\nprodigious satisfaction he rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who,\r\nseeing a man of this sort approaching in full armour and with lance and\r\nbuckler, were turning in dismay into the inn, when Don Quixote,\r\nguessing their fear by their flight, raising his pasteboard visor,\r\ndisclosed his dry dusty visage, and with courteous bearing and gentle\r\nvoice addressed them, \xe2\x80\x9cYour ladyships need not fly or fear any\r\nrudeness, for that it belongs not to the order of knighthood which I\r\nprofess to offer to anyone, much less to highborn maidens as your\r\nappearance proclaims you to be.\xe2\x80\x9d The girls were looking at him and\r\nstraining their eyes to make out the features which the clumsy visor\r\nobscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens, a thing so\r\nmuch out of their line, they could not restrain their laughter, which\r\nmade Don Quixote wax indignant, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cModesty becomes the fair, and\r\nmoreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness; this,\r\nhowever, I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none other\r\nthan to serve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalier\r\nonly increased the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 laughter, and that increased his irritation,\r\nand matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had\r\nnot come out, who, being a very fat man, was a very peaceful one. He,\r\nseeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more\r\nthan his saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at all\r\nindisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement;\r\nbut, in truth, standing in awe of such a complicated armament, he\r\nthought it best to speak him fairly, so he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or Caballero, if\r\nyour worship wants lodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in the\r\ninn) there is plenty of everything else here.\xe2\x80\x9d Don Quixote, observing\r\nthe respectful bearing of the Alcaide of the fortress (for so innkeeper\r\nand inn seemed in his eyes), made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cSir Castellan, for me\r\nanything will suffice, for\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My armour is my only wear,\r\nMy only rest the fray.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe host fancied he called him Castellan because he took him for a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cworthy of Castile,\xe2\x80\x9d though he was in fact an Andalusian, and one from\r\nthe strand of San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full of\r\ntricks as a student or a page. \xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Your bed is on the flinty rock,\r\nYour sleep to watch alway;\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nand if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of\r\nsleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say for a\r\nsingle night.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for Don\r\nQuixote, who got down with great difficulty and exertion (for he had\r\nnot broken his fast all day), and then charged the host to take great\r\ncare of his horse, as he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread\r\nin this world. The landlord eyed him over but did not find him as good\r\nas Don Quixote said, nor even half as good; and putting him up in the\r\nstable, he returned to see what might be wanted by his guest, whom the\r\ndamsels, who had by this time made their peace with him, were now\r\nrelieving of his armour. They had taken off his breastplate and\r\nbackpiece, but they neither knew nor saw how to open his gorget or\r\nremove his make-shift helmet, for he had fastened it with green\r\nribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots, required to be cut.\r\nThis, however, he would not by any means consent to, so he remained all\r\nthe evening with his helmet on, the drollest and oddest figure that can\r\nbe imagined; and while they were removing his armour, taking the\r\nbaggages who were about it for ladies of high degree belonging to the\r\ncastle, he said to them with great sprightliness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never, surely, was there knight\r\nSo served by hand of dame,\r\nAs served was he, Don Quixote hight,\r\nWhen from his town he came;\r\nWith maidens waiting on himself,\r\nPrincesses on his hack\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94or Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse\xe2\x80\x99s name, and Don\r\nQuixote of La Mancha is my own; for though I had no intention of\r\ndeclaring myself until my achievements in your service and honour had\r\nmade me known, the necessity of adapting that old ballad of Lancelot to\r\nthe present occasion has given you the knowledge of my name altogether\r\nprematurely. A time, however, will come for your ladyships to command\r\nand me to obey, and then the might of my arm will show my desire to\r\nserve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, had\r\nnothing to say in reply; they only asked him if he wanted anything to\r\neat. \xe2\x80\x9cI would gladly eat a bit of something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\r\nfeel it would come very seasonably.\xe2\x80\x9d The day happened to be a Friday,\r\nand in the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish they\r\ncall in Castile \xe2\x80\x9cabadejo,\xe2\x80\x9d in Andalusia \xe2\x80\x9cbacallao,\xe2\x80\x9d and in some places\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccuradillo,\xe2\x80\x9d and in others \xe2\x80\x9ctroutlet;\xe2\x80\x9d so they asked him if he thought\r\nhe could eat troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nthere be troutlets enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will be the same\r\nthing as a trout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eight\r\nreals in small change or a piece of eight; moreover, it may be that\r\nthese troutlets are like veal, which is better than beef, or kid, which\r\nis better than goat. But whatever it be let it come quickly, for the\r\nburden and pressure of arms cannot be borne without support to the\r\ninside.\xe2\x80\x9d They laid a table for him at the door of the inn for the sake\r\nof the air, and the host brought him a portion of ill-soaked and worse\r\ncooked stockfish, and a piece of bread as black and mouldy as his own\r\narmour; but a laughable sight it was to see him eating, for having his\r\nhelmet on and the beaver up, he could not with his own hands put\r\nanything into his mouth unless someone else placed it there, and this\r\nservice one of the ladies rendered him. But to give him anything to\r\ndrink was impossible, or would have been so had not the landlord bored\r\na reed, and putting one end in his mouth poured the wine into him\r\nthrough the other; all which he bore with patience rather than sever\r\nthe ribbons of his helmet.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, as\r\nhe approached, sounded his reed pipe four or five times, and thereby\r\ncompletely convinced Don Quixote that he was in some famous castle, and\r\nthat they were regaling him with music, and that the stockfish was\r\ntrout, the bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and the landlord the\r\ncastellan of the castle; and consequently he held that his enterprise\r\nand sally had been to some purpose. But still it distressed him to\r\nthink he had not been dubbed a knight, for it was plain to him he could\r\nnot lawfully engage in any adventure without receiving the order of\r\nknighthood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ne02.jpg (39K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE DROLL WAY IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE HAD HIMSELF\r\nDUBBED A KNIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np009.jpg (164K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarassed by this reflection, he made haste with his scanty pothouse\r\nsupper, and having finished it called the landlord, and shutting\r\nhimself into the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom this spot I rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy grants\r\nme the boon I seek, one that will redound to your praise and the\r\nbenefit of the human race.\xe2\x80\x9d The landlord, seeing his guest at his feet\r\nand hearing a speech of this kind, stood staring at him in\r\nbewilderment, not knowing what to do or say, and entreating him to\r\nrise, but all to no purpose until he had agreed to grant the boon\r\ndemanded of him. \xe2\x80\x9cI looked for no less, my lord, from your High\r\nMagnificence,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have to tell you that the\r\nboon I have asked and your liberality has granted is that you shall dub\r\nme knight to-morrow morning, and that to-night I shall watch my arms in\r\nthe chapel of this your castle; thus to-morrow, as I have said, will be\r\naccomplished what I so much desire, enabling me lawfully to roam\r\nthrough all the four quarters of the world seeking adventures on behalf\r\nof those in distress, as is the duty of chivalry and of knights-errant\r\nlike myself, whose ambition is directed to such deeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord, who, as has been mentioned, was something of a wag, and\r\nhad already some suspicion of his guest\xe2\x80\x99s want of wits, was quite\r\nconvinced of it on hearing talk of this kind from him, and to make\r\nsport for the night he determined to fall in with his humour. So he\r\ntold him he was quite right in pursuing the object he had in view, and\r\nthat such a motive was natural and becoming in cavaliers as\r\ndistinguished as he seemed and his gallant bearing showed him to be;\r\nand that he himself in his younger days had followed the same\r\nhonourable calling, roaming in quest of adventures in various parts of\r\nthe world, among others the Curing-grounds of Malaga, the Isles of\r\nRiaran, the Precinct of Seville, the Little Market of Segovia, the\r\nOlivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the Strand of San Lucar,\r\nthe Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and divers other quarters,\r\nwhere he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and the lightness of his\r\nfingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows, ruining maids and\r\nswindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under the notice of\r\nalmost every tribunal and court of justice in Spain; until at last he\r\nhad retired to this castle of his, where he was living upon his\r\nproperty and upon that of others; and where he received all\r\nknights-errant of whatever rank or condition they might be, all for the\r\ngreat love he bore them and that they might share their substance with\r\nhim in return for his benevolence. He told him, moreover, that in this\r\ncastle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour,\r\nas it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, but that in a case\r\nof necessity it might, he knew, be watched anywhere, and he might watch\r\nit that night in a courtyard of the castle, and in the morning, God\r\nwilling, the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have him\r\ndubbed a knight, and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so.\r\nHe asked if he had any money with him, to which Don Quixote replied\r\nthat he had not a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant he\r\nhad never read of any of them carrying any. On this point the landlord\r\ntold him he was mistaken; for, though not recorded in the histories,\r\nbecause in the author\xe2\x80\x99s opinion there was no need to mention anything\r\nso obvious and necessary as money and clean shirts, it was not to be\r\nsupposed therefore that they did not carry them, and he might regard it\r\nas certain and established that all knights-errant (about whom there\r\nwere so many full and unimpeachable books) carried well-furnished\r\npurses in case of emergency, and likewise carried shirts and a little\r\nbox of ointment to cure the wounds they received. For in those plains\r\nand deserts where they engaged in combat and came out wounded, it was\r\nnot always that there was someone to cure them, unless indeed they had\r\nfor a friend some sage magician to succour them at once by fetching\r\nthrough the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water\r\nof such virtue that by tasting one drop of it they were cured of their\r\nhurts and wounds in an instant and left as sound as if they had not\r\nreceived any damage whatever. But in case this should not occur, the\r\nknights of old took care to see that their squires were provided with\r\nmoney and other requisites, such as lint and ointments for healing\r\npurposes; and when it happened that knights had no squires (which was\r\nrarely and seldom the case) they themselves carried everything in\r\ncunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse\xe2\x80\x99s croup, as if\r\nit were something else of more importance, because, unless for some\r\nsuch reason, carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably regarded\r\namong knights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as his godson so\r\nsoon to be, he might even command him) never from that time forth to\r\ntravel without money and the usual requirements, and he would find the\r\nadvantage of them when he least expected it.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it was\r\narranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard at\r\none side of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placed\r\nit on a trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing his\r\nbuckler on his arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to\r\nmarch up and down in front of the trough, and as he began his march\r\nnight began to fall.\r\n\r\nThe landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze of\r\nhis guest, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing ceremony he\r\ncontemplated. Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, they\r\nflocked to see it from a distance, and observed with what composure he\r\nsometimes paced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on his lance, gazed\r\non his armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and as\r\nthe night closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it\r\nmight vie with his that lent it, everything the novice knight did was\r\nplainly seen by all.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water\r\nhis team, and it was necessary to remove Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s armour as it lay\r\non the trough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loud\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cO thou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay hands\r\non the armour of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword, have\r\na care what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy\r\nlife as the penalty of thy rashness.\xe2\x80\x9d The carrier gave no heed to these\r\nwords (and he would have done better to heed them if he had been\r\nheedful of his health), but seizing it by the straps flung the armour\r\nsome distance from him. Seeing this, Don Quixote raised his eyes to\r\nheaven, and fixing his thoughts, apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea,\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cAid me, lady mine, in this the first encounter that\r\npresents itself to this breast which thou holdest in subjection; let\r\nnot thy favour and protection fail me in this first jeopardy;\xe2\x80\x9d and,\r\nwith these words and others to the same purpose, dropping his buckler\r\nhe lifted his lance with both hands and with it smote such a blow on\r\nthe carrier\xe2\x80\x99s head that he stretched him on the ground, so stunned that\r\nhad he followed it up with a second there would have been no need of a\r\nsurgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up his armour and returned to\r\nhis beat with the same serenity as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np010.jpg (261K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for the\r\ncarrier still lay senseless), came with the same object of giving water\r\nto his mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear\r\nthe trough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid\r\nfrom anyone, once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted his\r\nlance, and without actually breaking the second carrier\xe2\x80\x99s head into\r\npieces, made more than three of it, for he laid it open in four. At the\r\nnoise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among them the\r\nlandlord. Seeing this, Don Quixote braced his buckler on his arm, and\r\nwith his hand on his sword exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cO Lady of Beauty, strength and\r\nsupport of my faint heart, it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy\r\ngreatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an\r\nadventure.\xe2\x80\x9d By this he felt himself so inspired that he would not have\r\nflinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him. The\r\ncomrades of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a\r\ndistance to shower stones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as best\r\nhe could with his buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave his\r\narmour unprotected. The landlord shouted to them to leave him alone,\r\nfor he had already told them that he was mad, and as a madman he would\r\nnot be accountable even if he killed them all. Still louder shouted Don\r\nQuixote, calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle,\r\nwho allowed knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain and\r\na low-born knight whom, had he received the order of knighthood, he\r\nwould call to account for his treachery. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cbase\r\nand vile rabble, I make no account; fling, strike, come on, do all ye\r\ncan against me, ye shall see what the reward of your folly and\r\ninsolence will be.\xe2\x80\x9d This he uttered with so much spirit and boldness\r\nthat he filled his assailants with a terrible fear, and as much for\r\nthis reason as at the persuasion of the landlord they left off stoning\r\nhim, and he allowed them to carry off the wounded, and with the same\r\ncalmness and composure as before resumed the watch over his armour.\r\n\r\nBut these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the\r\nlandlord, so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him at\r\nonce the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure\r\ncould occur; so, going up to him, he apologised for the rudeness which,\r\nwithout his knowledge, had been offered to him by these low people,\r\nwho, however, had been well punished for their audacity. As he had\r\nalready told him, he said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was\r\nit needed for what remained to be done, for, as he understood the\r\nceremonial of the order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay\r\nin the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder, and that could be\r\nadministered in the middle of a field; and that he had now done all\r\nthat was needful as to watching the armour, for all requirements were\r\nsatisfied by a watch of two hours only, while he had been more than\r\nfour about it. Don Quixote believed it all, and told him he stood there\r\nready to obey him, and to make an end of it with as much despatch as\r\npossible; for, if he were again attacked, and felt himself to be dubbed\r\nknight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul alive in the castle,\r\nexcept such as out of respect he might spare at his bidding.\r\n\r\nThus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in\r\nwhich he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the\r\ncarriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels\r\nalready mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him\r\nkneel down. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeating\r\nsome devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand\r\nand gave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a\r\nsmart slap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth\r\nas if he was saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one of\r\nthe ladies to gird on his sword, which she did with great\r\nself-possession and gravity, and not a little was required to prevent a\r\nburst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony; but what they had\r\nalready seen of the novice knight\xe2\x80\x99s prowess kept their laughter within\r\nbounds. On girding him with the sword the worthy lady said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cMay\r\nGod make your worship a very fortunate knight, and grant you success in\r\nbattle.\xe2\x80\x9d Don Quixote asked her name in order that he might from that\r\ntime forward know to whom he was beholden for the favour he had\r\nreceived, as he meant to confer upon her some portion of the honour he\r\nacquired by the might of his arm. She answered with great humility that\r\nshe was called La Tolosa, and that she was the daughter of a cobbler of\r\nToledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya, and that wherever she\r\nmight be she would serve and esteem him as her lord. Don Quixote said\r\nin reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforward she assumed\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x9d and called herself Do\xc3\xb1a Tolosa. She promised she would, and\r\nthen the other buckled on his spur, and with her followed almost the\r\nsame conversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked her name, and\r\nshe said it was La Molinera, and that she was the daughter of a\r\nrespectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don Quixote\r\nrequested that she would adopt the \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x9d and call herself Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nMolinera, making offers to her further services and favours.\r\n\r\nHaving thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these\r\nnever-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he saw\r\nhimself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and\r\nsaddling Rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he\r\nreturned thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in\r\nlanguage so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it\r\nor report it. The landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no\r\nless rhetoric though with shorter words, and without calling upon him\r\nto pay the reckoning let him go with a Godspeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np017.jpg (54K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nOF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KNIGHT WHEN HE LEFT THE INN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np018.jpg (94K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDay was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, so\r\nexhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight, that his joy was\r\nlike to burst his horse-girths. However, recalling the advice of his\r\nhost as to the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that\r\nreferring to money and shirts, he determined to go home and provide\r\nhimself with all, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing\r\na farm-labourer, a neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but very\r\nwell qualified for the office of squire to a knight. With this object\r\nhe turned his horse\xe2\x80\x99s head towards his village, and Rocinante, thus\r\nreminded of his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardly\r\nseemed to tread the earth.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to\r\ncome feeble cries as of someone in distress, and the instant he heard\r\nthem he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me,\r\nthat it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I\r\nhave undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition. These cries,\r\nno doubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing my\r\naid and protection;\xe2\x80\x9d and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the direction\r\nwhence the cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces into\r\nthe wood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and\r\nstripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age,\r\nfrom whom the cries came. Nor were they without cause, for a lusty\r\nfarmer was flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with\r\nscoldings and commands, repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cYour mouth shut and your eyes\r\nopen!\xe2\x80\x9d while the youth made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t do it again, master mine;\r\nby God\xe2\x80\x99s passion I won\xe2\x80\x99t do it again, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take more care of the\r\nflock another time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiscourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot\r\ndefend himself; mount your steed and take your lance\xe2\x80\x9d (for there was a\r\nlance leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), \xe2\x80\x9cand I will\r\nmake you know that you are behaving as a coward.\xe2\x80\x9d The farmer, seeing\r\nbefore him this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his\r\nhead, gave himself up for dead, and made answer meekly, \xe2\x80\x9cSir Knight,\r\nthis youth that I am chastising is my servant, employed by me to watch\r\na flock of sheep that I have hard by, and he is so careless that I lose\r\none every day, and when I punish him for his carelessness and knavery\r\nhe says I do it out of niggardliness, to escape paying him the wages I\r\nowe him, and before God, and on my soul, he lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLies before me, base clown!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the sun that shines\r\non us I have a mind to run you through with this lance. Pay him at once\r\nwithout another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make an\r\nend of you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np019.jpg (339K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, of\r\nwhom Don Quixote asked how much his master owed him.\r\n\r\nHe replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it\r\nup, found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to pay\r\nit down immediately, if he did not want to die for it.\r\n\r\nThe trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had\r\nsworn (though he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there were\r\nto be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given\r\nhim, and a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that is very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut let the shoes and the\r\nblood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him\r\nwithout any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid\r\nfor, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood\r\nfrom him when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on\r\nthat score he owes you nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andres\r\ncome home with me, and I will pay him all, real by real.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go with him!\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth. \xe2\x80\x9cNay, God forbid! No, se\xc3\xb1or, not for\r\nthe world; for once alone with me, he would ray me like a Saint\r\nBartholomew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will do nothing of the kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cI have only to\r\ncommand, and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order of\r\nknighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee the\r\npayment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider what you are saying, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth; \xe2\x80\x9cthis master of\r\nmine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; for\r\nhe is Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat matters little,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthere may be Haldudos\r\nknights; moreover, everyone is the son of his works.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andres; \xe2\x80\x9cbut this master of mine\xe2\x80\x94of what works is\r\nhe the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not refuse, brother Andres,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer, \xe2\x80\x9cbe good enough to\r\ncome along with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood there\r\nare in the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and\r\nperfumed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the perfumery I excuse you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cgive it to him in\r\nreals, and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn;\r\nif not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and\r\npunish you; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than a\r\nlizard. And if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you,\r\nthat you be more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous\r\nDon Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so,\r\nGod be with you, and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn\r\nunder those penalties that have been already declared to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. The\r\nfarmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared\r\nthe wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cCome here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that\r\nundoer of wrongs has commanded me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy oath on it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andres, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship will be well advised to\r\nobey the command of that good knight\xe2\x80\x94may he live a thousand years\xe2\x80\x94for,\r\nas he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he\r\nwill come back and do as he said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy oath on it, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as I have a strong\r\naffection for you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to the\r\npayment;\xe2\x80\x9d and seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave\r\nhim such a flogging that he left him for dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Master Andres,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer, \xe2\x80\x9ccall on the undoer of wrongs;\r\nyou will find he won\xe2\x80\x99t undo that, though I am not sure that I have\r\nquite done with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.\xe2\x80\x9d But at\r\nlast he untied him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in\r\norder to put the sentence pronounced into execution.\r\n\r\nAndres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look\r\nfor the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what had\r\nhappened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for\r\nall that, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.\r\n\r\nThus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughly\r\nsatisfied with what had taken place, as he considered he had made a\r\nvery happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the road\r\ntowards his village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell mayest thou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth, O\r\nDulcinea del Toboso, fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thy\r\nlot to hold subject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure a\r\nknight so renowned as is and will be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, as\r\nall the world knows, yesterday received the order of knighthood, and\r\nhath to-day righted the greatest wrong and grievance that ever\r\ninjustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath to-day plucked\r\nthe rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing\r\nthat tender child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he\r\nwas reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to\r\nconsider which road they should take. In imitation of them he halted\r\nfor a while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante\r\nhis head, submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed out\r\nhis first intention, which was to make straight for his own stable.\r\nAfter he had gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large party\r\nof people, who, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, on\r\ntheir way to buy silk at Murcia. There were six of them coming along\r\nunder their sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers\r\non foot. Scarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy\r\npossessed him that this must be some new adventure; and to help him to\r\nimitate as far as he could those passages he had read of in his books,\r\nhere seemed to come one made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt.\r\nSo with a lofty bearing and determination he fixed himself firmly in\r\nhis stirrups, got his lance ready, brought his buckler before his\r\nbreast, and planting himself in the middle of the road, stood waiting\r\nthe approach of these knights-errant, for such he now considered and\r\nheld them to be; and when they had come near enough to see and hear, he\r\nexclaimed with a haughty gesture, \xe2\x80\x9cAll the world stand, unless all the\r\nworld confess that in all the world there is no maiden fairer than the\r\nEmpress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of the\r\nstrange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and language at\r\nonce guessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn\r\nquietly what was the object of this confession that was demanded of\r\nthem, and one of them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very\r\nsharp-witted, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cSir Knight, we do not know who this good\r\nlady is that you speak of; show her to us, for, if she be of such\r\nbeauty as you suggest, with all our hearts and without any pressure we\r\nwill confess the truth that is on your part required of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to show her to you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat merit would\r\nyou have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is that\r\nwithout seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend\r\nit; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant\r\nrabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order of\r\nknighthood requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of\r\nyour breed, here do I bide and await you relying on the justice of the\r\ncause I maintain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the trader, \xe2\x80\x9cI entreat your worship in the name\r\nof this present company of princes, that, to save us from charging our\r\nconsciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard\r\nof, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and\r\nQueens of the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to\r\nshow us some portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain\r\nof wheat; for by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we\r\nshall be satisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay,\r\nI believe we are already so far agreed with you that even though her\r\nportrait should show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and\r\nsulphur from the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship,\r\nsay all in her favour that you desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\nburning with rage, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing of the kind, I say, only ambergris and\r\ncivet in cotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than\r\na Guadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered\r\nagainst beauty like that of my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had\r\nspoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrived\r\nthat Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone\r\nhard with the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went his\r\nmaster, rolling along the ground for some distance; and when he tried\r\nto rise he was unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs,\r\nhelmet, and the weight of his old armour; and all the while he was\r\nstruggling to get up he kept saying, \xe2\x80\x9cFly not, cowards and caitiffs!\r\nstay, for not by my fault, but my horse\xe2\x80\x99s, am I stretched here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np020.jpg (352K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much good\r\nnature in him, hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in this style,\r\nwas unable to refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and coming\r\nup to him he seized his lance, and having broken it in pieces, with one\r\nof them he began so to belabour our Don Quixote that, notwithstanding\r\nand in spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure of wheat. His\r\nmasters called out not to lay on so hard and to leave him alone, but\r\nthe muleteers blood was up, and he did not care to drop the game until\r\nhe had vented the rest of his wrath, and gathering up the remaining\r\nfragments of the lance he finished with a discharge upon the unhappy\r\nvictim, who all through the storm of sticks that rained on him never\r\nceased threatening heaven, and earth, and the brigands, for such they\r\nseemed to him. At last the muleteer was tired, and the traders\r\ncontinued their journey, taking with them matter for talk about the\r\npoor fellow who had been cudgelled. He when he found himself alone made\r\nanother effort to rise; but if he was unable when whole and sound, how\r\nwas he to rise after having been thrashed and well-nigh knocked to\r\npieces? And yet he esteemed himself fortunate, as it seemed to him that\r\nthis was a regular knight-errant\xe2\x80\x99s mishap, and entirely, he considered,\r\nthe fault of his horse. However, battered in body as he was, to rise\r\nwas beyond his power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ne04.jpg (28K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nIN WHICH THE NARRATIVE OF OUR KNIGHT\xe2\x80\x99S MISHAP IS CONTINUED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np022.jpg (123K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought himself of\r\nhaving recourse to his usual remedy, which was to think of some passage\r\nin his books, and his craze brought to his mind that about Baldwin and\r\nthe Marquis of Mantua, when Carloto left him wounded on the\r\nmountainside, a story known by heart by the children, not forgotten by\r\nthe young men, and lauded and even believed by the old folk; and for\r\nall that not a whit truer than the miracles of Mahomet. This seemed to\r\nhim to fit exactly the case in which he found himself, so, making a\r\nshow of severe suffering, he began to roll on the ground and with\r\nfeeble breath repeat the very words which the wounded knight of the\r\nwood is said to have uttered:\r\n\r\nWhere art thou, lady mine, that thou\r\nMy sorrow dost not rue?\r\nThou canst not know it, lady mine,\r\nOr else thou art untrue.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:\r\n\r\nO noble Marquis of Mantua,\r\nMy Uncle and liege lord!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np026.jpg (316K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to\r\ncome by a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who had\r\nbeen with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched\r\nthere, came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter\r\nwith him that he complained so dolefully.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua,\r\nhis uncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in\r\nwhich he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the\r\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x99s son and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.\r\n\r\nThe peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him of\r\nthe visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face,\r\nwhich was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he\r\nrecognised him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or Quixada\xe2\x80\x9d (for so he appears to have\r\nbeen called when he was in his senses and had not yet changed from a\r\nquiet country gentleman into a knight-errant), \xe2\x80\x9cwho has brought your\r\nworship to this pass?\xe2\x80\x9d But to all questions the other only went on with\r\nhis ballad.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate\r\nand backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no\r\nblood nor any mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from the\r\nground, and with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which\r\nseemed to him to be the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms,\r\neven to the splinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, and\r\nleading him by the bridle and the ass by the halter he took the road\r\nfor the village, very sad to hear what absurd stuff Don Quixote was\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np029.jpg (285K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could\r\nnot sit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs to\r\nheaven, so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him.\r\nAnd it could have been only the devil himself that put into his head\r\ntales to match his own adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, he\r\nbethought himself of the Moor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide of\r\nAntequera, Rodrigo de Narvaez, took him prisoner and carried him away\r\nto his castle; so that when the peasant again asked him how he was and\r\nwhat ailed him, he gave him for reply the same words and phrases that\r\nthe captive Abindarraez gave to Rodrigo de Narvaez, just as he had read\r\nthe story in the \xe2\x80\x9cDiana\xe2\x80\x9d of Jorge de Montemayor where it is written,\r\napplying it to his own case so aptly that the peasant went along\r\ncursing his fate that he had to listen to such a lot of nonsense; from\r\nwhich, however, he came to the conclusion that his neighbour was mad,\r\nand so made all haste to reach the village to escape the wearisomeness\r\nof this harangue of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s; who, at the end of it, said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or\r\nDon Rodrigo de Narvaez, your worship must know that this fair Xarifa I\r\nhave mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, for whom I have\r\ndone, am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry that in\r\nthis world have been seen, are to be seen, or ever shall be seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this the peasant answered, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or\xe2\x80\x94sinner that I am!\xe2\x80\x94cannot your\r\nworship see that I am not Don Rodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis of\r\nMantua, but Pedro Alonso your neighbour, and that your worship is\r\nneither Baldwin nor Abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nQuixada?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know who I am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know that I may be not\r\nonly those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and even\r\nall the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have\r\ndone all together and each of them on his own account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just\r\nas night was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was a\r\nlittle later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in\r\nsuch a miserable trim. When it was what seemed to him the proper time\r\nhe entered the village and went to Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s house, which he found\r\nall in confusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, who\r\nwere great friends of Don Quixote, and his housekeeper was saying to\r\nthem in a loud voice, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does your worship think can have befallen\r\nmy master, Se\xc3\xb1or Licentiate Pero Perez?\xe2\x80\x9d for so the curate was called;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit is three days now since anything has been seen of him, or the hack,\r\nor the buckler, lance, or armour. Miserable me! I am certain of it, and\r\nit is as true as that I was born to die, that these accursed books of\r\nchivalry he has, and has got into the way of reading so constantly,\r\nhave upset his reason; for now I remember having often heard him saying\r\nto himself that he would turn knight-errant and go all over the world\r\nin quest of adventures. To the devil and Barabbas with such books, that\r\nhave brought to ruin in this way the finest understanding there was in\r\nall La Mancha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe niece said the same, and, more: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must know, Master\r\nNicholas\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for that was the name of the barber\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit was often my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nway to stay two days and nights together poring over these unholy books\r\nof misventures, after which he would fling the book away and snatch up\r\nhis sword and fall to slashing the walls; and when he was tired out he\r\nwould say he had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweat\r\nthat flowed from him when he was weary he said was the blood of the\r\nwounds he had received in battle; and then he would drink a great jug\r\nof cold water and become calm and quiet, saying that this water was a\r\nmost precious potion which the sage Esquife, a great magician and\r\nfriend of his, had brought him. But I take all the blame upon myself\r\nfor never having told your worships of my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s vagaries, that you\r\nmight put a stop to them before things had come to this pass, and burn\r\nall these accursed books\xe2\x80\x94for he has a great number\xe2\x80\x94that richly deserve\r\nto be burned like heretics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo say I too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cand by my faith to-morrow shall not\r\npass without public judgment upon them, and may they be condemned to\r\nthe flames lest they lead those that read to behave as my good friend\r\nseems to have behaved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what was\r\nthe matter with his neighbour, so he began calling aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cOpen, your\r\nworships, to Se\xc3\xb1or Baldwin and to Se\xc3\xb1or the Marquis of Mantua, who\r\ncomes badly wounded, and to Se\xc3\xb1or Abindarraez, the Moor, whom the\r\nvaliant Rodrigo de Narvaez, the Alcaide of Antequera, brings captive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words they all hurried out, and when they recognised their\r\nfriend, master, and uncle, who had not yet dismounted from the ass\r\nbecause he could not, they ran to embrace him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am badly wounded through my horse\xe2\x80\x99s fault;\r\ncarry me to bed, and if possible send for the wise Urganda to cure and\r\nsee to my wounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee there! plague on it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the housekeeper at this: \xe2\x80\x9cdid not my\r\nheart tell the truth as to which foot my master went lame of? To bed\r\nwith your worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you here\r\nwithout fetching that Hurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundred\r\ntimes more, on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship\r\nto such a pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds\r\ncould find none, but he said they were all bruises from having had a\r\nsevere fall with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants,\r\nthe biggest and the boldest to be found on earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, so!\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9care there giants in the dance? By the sign\r\nof the Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to all\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that was\r\nwhat he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant\r\nat great length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and\r\nthe nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which\r\nmade the licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day,\r\nwhich was to summon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with\r\nhim to Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np031.jpg (31K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nOF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBER\r\nMADE IN THE LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc06a.jpg (92K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of\r\nthe room where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, and\r\nright willingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper with\r\nthem, and found more than a hundred volumes of big books very well\r\nbound, and some other small ones. The moment the housekeeper saw them\r\nshe turned about and ran out of the room, and came back immediately\r\nwith a saucer of holy water and a sprinkler, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, your\r\nworship, se\xc3\xb1or licentiate, sprinkle this room; don\xe2\x80\x99t leave any magician\r\nof the many there are in these books to bewitch us in revenge for our\r\ndesign of banishing them from the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh, and he\r\ndirected the barber to give him the books one by one to see what they\r\nwere about, as there might be some to be found among them that did not\r\ndeserve the penalty of fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the niece, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no reason for showing mercy to any of\r\nthem; they have every one of them done mischief; better fling them out\r\nof the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to\r\nthem; or else carry them into the yard, and there a bonfire can be made\r\nwithout the smoke giving any annoyance.\xe2\x80\x9d The housekeeper said the same,\r\nso eager were they both for the slaughter of those innocents, but the\r\ncurate would not agree to it without first reading at any rate the\r\ntitles.\r\n\r\nThe first that Master Nicholas put into his hand was \xe2\x80\x9cThe four books of\r\nAmadis of Gaul.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis seems a mysterious thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor, as I have heard say, this was the first book of chivalry printed\r\nin Spain, and from this all the others derive their birth and origin;\r\nso it seems to me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the flames\r\nas the founder of so vile a sect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cI too, have heard say that this is the\r\nbest of all the books of this kind that have been written, and so, as\r\nsomething singular in its line, it ought to be pardoned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cand for that reason let its life be spared\r\nfor the present. Let us see that other which is next to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98Sergas de Esplandian,\xe2\x80\x99 the lawful son\r\nof Amadis of Gaul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen verily,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cthe merit of the father must not be\r\nput down to the account of the son. Take it, mistress housekeeper; open\r\nthe window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the\r\npile for the bonfire we are to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, and the worthy\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEsplandian\xe2\x80\x9d went flying into the yard to await with all patience the\r\nfire that was in store for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProceed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis that comes next,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cis \xe2\x80\x98Amadis of Greece,\xe2\x80\x99 and,\r\nindeed, I believe all those on this side are of the same Amadis\r\nlineage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen to the yard with the whole of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cfor to\r\nhave the burning of Queen Pintiquiniestra, and the shepherd Darinel and\r\nhis eclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author,\r\nI would burn with them the father who begot me if he were going about\r\nin the guise of a knight-errant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am of the same mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so am I,\xe2\x80\x9d added the niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said the housekeeper, \xe2\x80\x9chere, into the yard with them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were handed to her, and as there were many of them, she spared\r\nherself the staircase, and flung them down out of the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that tub there?\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cis \xe2\x80\x98Don Olivante de Laura.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe author of that book,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cwas the same that wrote\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Garden of Flowers,\xe2\x80\x99 and truly there is no deciding which of the\r\ntwo books is the more truthful, or, to put it better, the less lying;\r\nall I can say is, send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis that follows is \xe2\x80\x98Florismarte of Hircania,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or Florismarte here?\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cthen by my faith he must\r\ntake up his quarters in the yard, in spite of his marvellous birth and\r\nvisionary adventures, for the stiffness and dryness of his style\r\ndeserve nothing else; into the yard with him and the other, mistress\r\nhousekeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, and executed the order with great\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cis \xe2\x80\x98The Knight Platir.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn old book that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I find no reason for clemency\r\nin it; send it after the others without appeal;\xe2\x80\x9d which was done.\r\n\r\nAnother book was opened, and they saw it was entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Knight of\r\nthe Cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the sake of the holy name this book has,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cits\r\nignorance might be excused; but then, they say, \xe2\x80\x98behind the cross\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s the devil;\xe2\x80\x99 to the fire with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTaking down another book, the barber said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is \xe2\x80\x98The Mirror of\r\nChivalry.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know his worship,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is where Se\xc3\xb1or Reinaldos\r\nof Montalvan figures with his friends and comrades, greater thieves\r\nthan Cacus, and the Twelve Peers of France with the veracious historian\r\nTurpin; however, I am not for condemning them to more than perpetual\r\nbanishment, because, at any rate, they have some share in the invention\r\nof the famous Matteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet Ludovico\r\nAriosto wove his web, to whom, if I find him here, and speaking any\r\nlanguage but his own, I shall show no respect whatever; but if he\r\nspeaks his own tongue I will put him upon my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have him in Italian,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not\r\nunderstand him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor would it be well that you should understand him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand on that score we might have excused the Captain if he had not\r\nbrought him into Spain and turned him into Castilian. He robbed him of\r\na great deal of his natural force, and so do all those who try to turn\r\nbooks written in verse into another language, for, with all the pains\r\nthey take and all the cleverness they show, they never can reach the\r\nlevel of the originals as they were first produced. In short, I say\r\nthat this book, and all that may be found treating of those French\r\naffairs, should be thrown into or deposited in some dry well, until\r\nafter more consideration it is settled what is to be done with them;\r\nexcepting always one \xe2\x80\x98Bernardo del Carpio\xe2\x80\x99 that is going about, and\r\nanother called \xe2\x80\x98Roncesvalles;\xe2\x80\x99 for these, if they come into my hands,\r\nshall pass at once into those of the housekeeper, and from hers into\r\nthe fire without any reprieve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo all this the barber gave his assent, and looked upon it as right and\r\nproper, being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the Faith and\r\nloyal to the Truth that he would not for the world say anything opposed\r\nto them. Opening another book he saw it was \xe2\x80\x9cPalmerin de Oliva,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nbeside it was another called \xe2\x80\x9cPalmerin of England,\xe2\x80\x9d seeing which the\r\nlicentiate said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet the Olive be made firewood of at once and burned\r\nuntil no ashes even are left; and let that Palm of England be kept and\r\npreserved as a thing that stands alone, and let such another case be\r\nmade for it as that which Alexander found among the spoils of Darius\r\nand set aside for the safe keeping of the works of the poet Homer. This\r\nbook, gossip, is of authority for two reasons, first because it is very\r\ngood, and secondly because it is said to have been written by a wise\r\nand witty king of Portugal. All the adventures at the Castle of\r\nMiraguarda are excellent and of admirable contrivance, and the language\r\nis polished and clear, studying and observing the style befitting the\r\nspeaker with propriety and judgment. So then, provided it seems good to\r\nyou, Master Nicholas, I say let this and \xe2\x80\x98Amadis of Gaul\xe2\x80\x99 be remitted\r\nthe penalty of fire, and as for all the rest, let them perish without\r\nfurther question or query.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, gossip,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cfor this that I have here is the\r\nfamous \xe2\x80\x98Don Belianis.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cthat and the second, third, and fourth parts\r\nall stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile,\r\nand they must be cleared of all that stuff about the Castle of Fame and\r\nother greater affectations, to which end let them be allowed the\r\nover-seas term, and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or justice\r\nbe meted out to them; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them in\r\nyour house and let no one read them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber; and not caring to tire himself\r\nwith reading more books of chivalry, he told the housekeeper to take\r\nall the big ones and throw them into the yard. It was not said to one\r\ndull or deaf, but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the\r\nbroadest and finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at a\r\ntime, she flung them out of the window.\r\n\r\nIn carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the\r\nbarber, who took it up, curious to know whose it was, and found it\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cHistory of the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate with a shout, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tirante el Blanco\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhere! Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have found a treasury\r\nof enjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison of\r\nMontalvan, a valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, and\r\nthe knight Fonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with the\r\nmastiff, and the witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the loves\r\nand wiles of the widow Reposada, and the empress in love with the\r\nsquire Hipolito\xe2\x80\x94in truth, gossip, by right of its style it is the best\r\nbook in the world. Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds,\r\nand make their wills before dying, and a great deal more of which there\r\nis nothing in all the other books. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it,\r\nfor deliberately composing such fooleries, deserves to be sent to the\r\ngalleys for life. Take it home with you and read it, and you will see\r\nthat what I have said is true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you will,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what are we to do with these\r\nlittle books that are left?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese must be, not chivalry, but poetry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; and opening\r\none he saw it was the \xe2\x80\x9cDiana\xe2\x80\x9d of Jorge de Montemayor, and, supposing\r\nall the others to be of the same sort, \xe2\x80\x9cthese,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not\r\ndeserve to be burned like the others, for they neither do nor can do\r\nthe mischief the books of chivalry have done, being books of\r\nentertainment that can hurt no one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, se\xc3\xb1or!\xe2\x80\x9d said the niece, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship had better order these to be\r\nburned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if, after being\r\ncured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a\r\nfancy to turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and\r\npiping; or, what would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say is\r\nan incurable and infectious malady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe damsel is right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cand it will be well to put\r\nthis stumbling-block and temptation out of our friend\xe2\x80\x99s way. To begin,\r\nthen, with the \xe2\x80\x98Diana\xe2\x80\x99 of Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not be\r\nburned, but that it should be cleared of all that about the sage\r\nFelicia and the magic water, and of almost all the longer pieces of\r\nverse: let it keep, and welcome, its prose and the honour of being the\r\nfirst of books of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis that comes next,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cis the \xe2\x80\x98Diana,\xe2\x80\x99 entitled the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Second Part, by the Salamancan,\xe2\x80\x99 and this other has the same title,\r\nand its author is Gil Polo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for that of the Salamancan,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the curate, \xe2\x80\x9clet it go to\r\nswell the number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo\xe2\x80\x99s be\r\npreserved as if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, and\r\nmake haste, for it is growing late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis book,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, opening another, \xe2\x80\x9cis the ten books of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fortune of Love,\xe2\x80\x99 written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the orders I have received,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9csince Apollo has\r\nbeen Apollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets,\r\nso droll and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its\r\nway it is the best and the most singular of all of this species that\r\nhave as yet appeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he has\r\nnever read what is delightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make more\r\naccount of having found it than if they had given me a cassock of\r\nFlorence stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese that come next are \xe2\x80\x98The Shepherd of Iberia,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Nymphs of\r\nHenares,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98The Enlightenment of Jealousy.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen all we have to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cis to hand them over to the\r\nsecular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall never\r\nhave done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis next is the \xe2\x80\x98Pastor de F\xc3\xadlida.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo Pastor that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a highly polished courtier; let\r\nit be preserved as a precious jewel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis large one here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cis called \xe2\x80\x98The Treasury of\r\nvarious Poems.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there were not so many of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cthey would be\r\nmore relished: this book must be weeded and cleansed of certain\r\nvulgarities which it has with its excellences; let it be preserved\r\nbecause the author is a friend of mine, and out of respect for other\r\nmore heroic and loftier works that he has written.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cis the \xe2\x80\x98Cancionero\xe2\x80\x99 of Lopez de\r\nMaldonado.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe author of that book, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cis a great friend of\r\nmine, and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all who\r\nhear them, for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when\r\nhe chants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what is\r\ngood was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have been\r\nset apart. But what book is that next it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Galatea\xe2\x80\x99 of Miguel de Cervantes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to\r\nmy knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. His\r\nbook has some good invention in it, it presents us with something but\r\nbrings nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it\r\npromises: perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full\r\nmeasure of grace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you,\r\nse\xc3\xb1or gossip, keep it shut up in your own quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber; \xe2\x80\x9cand here come three together, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Araucana\xe2\x80\x99 of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the \xe2\x80\x98Austriada\xe2\x80\x99 of Juan Rufo,\r\nJustice of Cordova, and the \xe2\x80\x98Montserrate\xe2\x80\x99 of Christobal de Viru\xc3\xa9s, the\r\nValencian poet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese three books,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9care the best that have been\r\nwritten in Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with the\r\nmost famous of Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures of\r\npoetry that Spain possesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe curate was tired and would not look into any more books, and so he\r\ndecided that, \xe2\x80\x9ccontents uncertified,\xe2\x80\x9d all the rest should be burned;\r\nbut just then the barber held open one, called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Tears of Angelica.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have shed tears myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate when he heard the\r\ntitle, \xe2\x80\x9chad I ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one of\r\nthe famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happy\r\nin the translation of some of Ovid\xe2\x80\x99s fables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc06e.jpg (30K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nOF THE SECOND SALLY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc07a.jpg (151K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this instant Don Quixote began shouting out, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, here, valiant\r\nknights! here is need for you to put forth the might of your strong\r\narms, for they of the Court are gaining the mastery in the tourney!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nCalled away by this noise and outcry, they proceeded no farther with\r\nthe scrutiny of the remaining books, and so it is thought that \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nCarolea,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lion of Spain,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Deeds of the Emperor,\xe2\x80\x9d written\r\nby Don Luis de \xc3\x81vila, went to the fire unseen and unheard; for no doubt\r\nthey were among those that remained, and perhaps if the curate had seen\r\nthem they would not have undergone so severe a sentence.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Don Quixote he was already out of bed, and was still\r\nshouting and raving, and slashing and cutting all round, as wide awake\r\nas if he had never slept.\r\n\r\nThey closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he had\r\nbecome a little calm, addressing the curate, he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cOf a\r\ntruth, Se\xc3\xb1or Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call\r\nourselves the Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the\r\nCourt to gain the victory in this tourney, we the adventurers having\r\ncarried off the honour on the three former days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, gossip,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cplease God, the luck may turn, and\r\nwhat is lost to-day may be won to-morrow; for the present let your\r\nworship have a care of your health, for it seems to me that you are\r\nover-fatigued, if not badly wounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWounded no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut bruised and battered no doubt, for\r\nthat bastard Don Roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree,\r\nand all for envy, because he sees that I alone rival him in his\r\nachievements. But I should not call myself Reinaldos of Montalvan did\r\nhe not pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as I rise\r\nfrom this bed. For the present let them bring me something to eat, for\r\nthat, I feel, is what will be more to my purpose, and leave it to me to\r\navenge myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did as he wished; they gave him something to eat, and once more he\r\nfell asleep, leaving them marvelling at his madness.\r\n\r\nThat night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were in\r\nthe yard and in the whole house; and some must have been consumed that\r\ndeserved preservation in everlasting archives, but their fate and the\r\nlaziness of the examiner did not permit it, and so in them was verified\r\nthe proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty.\r\n\r\nOne of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied\r\nto their friend\xe2\x80\x99s disorder was to wall up and plaster the room where\r\nthe books were, so that when he got up he should not find them\r\n(possibly the cause being removed the effect might cease), and they\r\nmight say that a magician had carried them off, room and all; and this\r\nwas done with all despatch. Two days later Don Quixote got up, and the\r\nfirst thing he did was to go and look at his books, and not finding the\r\nroom where he had left it, he wandered from side to side looking for\r\nit. He came to the place where the door used to be, and tried it with\r\nhis hands, and turned and twisted his eyes in every direction without\r\nsaying a word; but after a good while he asked his housekeeper\r\nwhereabouts was the room that held his books.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she was\r\nto answer, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat room or what nothing is it that your worship is\r\nlooking for? There are neither room nor books in this house now, for\r\nthe devil himself has carried all away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said the niece, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a magician who came on a\r\ncloud one night after the day your worship left this, and dismounting\r\nfrom a serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did there\r\nI know not, but after a little while he made off, flying through the\r\nroof, and left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he\r\nhad done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the\r\nhousekeeper and I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud\r\nvoice that, for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the\r\nroom, he had done mischief in that house that would be discovered\r\nby-and-by: he said too that his name was the Sage Mu\xc3\xb1aton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have said Friston,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he called himself Friston or Friton,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nhousekeeper, \xe2\x80\x9cI only know that his name ended with \xe2\x80\x98ton.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand he is a sage magician, a great\r\nenemy of mine, who has a spite against me because he knows by his arts\r\nand lore that in process of time I am to engage in single combat with a\r\nknight whom he befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will be\r\nunable to prevent it; and for this reason he endeavours to do me all\r\nthe ill turns that he can; but I promise him it will be hard for him to\r\noppose or avoid what is decreed by Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho doubts that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the niece; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, uncle, who mixes you up in\r\nthese quarrels? Would it not be better to remain at peace in your own\r\nhouse instead of roaming the world looking for better bread than ever\r\ncame of wheat, never reflecting that many go for wool and come back\r\nshorn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, niece of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9chow much astray art thou in\r\nthy reckoning: ere they shear me I shall have plucked away and stripped\r\noff the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that his\r\nanger was kindling.\r\n\r\nIn short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without\r\nshowing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions, and\r\nduring this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, the\r\ncurate and the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errant\r\nwere what the world stood most in need of, and that in him was to be\r\naccomplished the revival of knight-errantry. The curate sometimes\r\ncontradicted him, sometimes agreed with him, for if he had not observed\r\nthis precaution he would have been unable to bring him to reason.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Don Quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his,\r\nan honest man (if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor),\r\nbut with very little wit in his pate. In a word, he so talked him over,\r\nand with such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his\r\nmind to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. Don Quixote,\r\namong other things, told him he ought to be ready to go with him\r\ngladly, because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an\r\nisland in the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it. On\r\nthese and the like promises Sancho Panza (for so the labourer was\r\ncalled) left wife and children, and engaged himself as esquire to his\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc07b.jpg (322K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing\r\nand pawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he got\r\ntogether a fair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which he\r\nbegged as a loan from a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as\r\nbest he could, he warned his squire Sancho of the day and hour he meant\r\nto set out, that he might provide himself with what he thought most\r\nneedful. Above all, he charged him to take alforjas with him. The other\r\nsaid he would, and that he meant to take also a very good ass he had,\r\nas he was not much given to going on foot. About the ass, Don Quixote\r\nhesitated a little, trying whether he could call to mind any\r\nknight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back, but no\r\ninstance occurred to his memory. For all that, however, he determined\r\nto take him, intending to furnish him with a more honourable mount when\r\na chance of it presented itself, by appropriating the horse of the\r\nfirst discourteous knight he encountered. Himself he provided with\r\nshirts and such other things as he could, according to the advice the\r\nhost had given him; all which being done, without taking leave, Sancho\r\nPanza of his wife and children, or Don Quixote of his housekeeper and\r\nniece, they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night,\r\nand made such good way in the course of it that by daylight they held\r\nthemselves safe from discovery, even should search be made for them.\r\n\r\nSancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota,\r\nand longing to see himself soon governor of the island his master had\r\npromised him. Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and road\r\nhe had taken on his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel,\r\nwhich he travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for,\r\nas it was early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely,\r\nthe heat did not distress them.\r\n\r\nAnd now said Sancho Panza to his master, \xe2\x80\x9cYour worship will take care,\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised\r\nme, for be it ever so big I\xe2\x80\x99ll be equal to governing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThou must know, friend Sancho Panza,\r\nthat it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of\r\nold to make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they\r\nwon, and I am determined that there shall be no failure on my part in\r\nso liberal a custom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon it, for\r\nthey sometimes, and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires\r\nwere old, and then when they had had enough of service and hard days\r\nand worse nights, they gave them some title or other, of count, or at\r\nthe most marquis, of some valley or province more or less; but if thou\r\nlivest and I live, it may well be that before six days are over, I may\r\nhave won some kingdom that has others dependent upon it, which will be\r\njust the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of them. Nor\r\nneedst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to the\r\nlot of such knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that I might\r\neasily give thee even more than I promise thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho Panza, \xe2\x80\x9cif I should become a king by one of\r\nthose miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old\r\nwoman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, who doubts it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho Panza, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause for my part I am persuaded\r\nthat though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them\r\nwould fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, se\xc3\xb1or, she is\r\nnot worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and\r\nthat only with God\xe2\x80\x99s help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it to God, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he will give her\r\nwhat suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come\r\nto be content with anything less than being governor of a province.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cspecially as I have a man of\r\nsuch quality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me\r\nall that will be suitable for me and that I can bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc07e.jpg (70K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nOF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLE\r\nAND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES\r\nWORTHY TO BE FITLY RECORDED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc08a.jpg (142K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills that\r\nthere are on that plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said to\r\nhis squire, \xe2\x80\x9cFortune is arranging matters for us better than we could\r\nhave shaped our desires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza,\r\nwhere thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom I\r\nmean to engage in battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin\r\nto make our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat giants?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho Panza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose thou seest there,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his master, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the long arms, and\r\nsome have them nearly two leagues long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat we see there are not giants\r\nbut windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned\r\nby the wind make the millstone go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is easy to see,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat thou art not used to\r\nthis business of adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid,\r\naway with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage\r\nthem in fierce and unequal combat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the\r\ncries his squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly\r\nthey were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however,\r\nwas so positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of\r\nSancho, nor perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at them\r\nshouting, \xe2\x80\x9cFly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight\r\nattacks you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to\r\nmove, seeing which Don Quixote exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThough ye flourish more arms\r\nthan the giant Briareus, ye have to reckon with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady\r\nDulcinea, imploring her to support him in such a peril, with lance in\r\nrest and covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s fullest\r\ngallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but as\r\nhe drove his lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with\r\nsuch force that it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horse\r\nand rider, who went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition.\r\nSancho hastened to his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and when\r\nhe came up found him unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinante\r\nfallen with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc08b.jpg (358K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cdid I not tell your worship to mind what\r\nyou were about, for they were only windmills? and no one could have\r\nmade any mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in\r\nhis head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, friend Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fortunes of war more\r\nthan any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover I\r\nthink, and it is the truth, that that same sage Friston who carried off\r\nmy study and books, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob\r\nme of the glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me;\r\nbut in the end his wicked arts will avail but little against my good\r\nsword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc08c.jpg (301K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod order it as he may,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho Panza, and helping him to rise\r\ngot him up again on Rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then,\r\ndiscussing the late adventure, they followed the road to Puerto Lapice,\r\nfor there, said Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in\r\nabundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare. For all that, he\r\nwas much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire,\r\nhe added, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember having read how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez de\r\nVargas by name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak a\r\nponderous bough or branch, and with it did such things that day, and\r\npounded so many Moors, that he got the surname of Machuca, and he and\r\nhis descendants from that day forth were called Vargas y Machuca. I\r\nmention this because from the first oak I see I mean to rend such\r\nanother branch, large and stout like that, with which I am determined\r\nand resolved to do such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very\r\nfortunate in being found worthy to come and see them, and be an\r\neyewitness of things that will with difficulty be believed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe that as God will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe it all as your worship\r\nsays it; but straighten yourself a little, for you seem all on one\r\nside, may be from the shaking of the fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand if I make no complaint of\r\nthe pain it is because knights-errant are not permitted to complain of\r\nany wound, even though their bowels be coming out through it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to say; but God knows I would\r\nrather your worship complained when anything ailed you. For my part, I\r\nconfess I must complain however small the ache may be; unless this rule\r\nabout not complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote could not help laughing at his squire\xe2\x80\x99s simplicity, and he\r\nassured him he might complain whenever and however he chose, just as he\r\nliked, for, so far, he had never read of anything to the contrary in\r\nthe order of knighthood.\r\n\r\nSancho bade him remember it was dinner-time, to which his master\r\nanswered that he wanted nothing himself just then, but that _he_ might\r\neat when he had a mind. With this permission Sancho settled himself as\r\ncomfortably as he could on his beast, and taking out of the alforjas\r\nwhat he had stowed away in them, he jogged along behind his master\r\nmunching deliberately, and from time to time taking a pull at the bota\r\nwith a relish that the thirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied;\r\nand while he went on in this way, gulping down draught after draught,\r\nhe never gave a thought to any of the promises his master had made him,\r\nnor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going in quest\r\nof adventures, however dangerous they might be. Finally they passed the\r\nnight among some trees, from one of which Don Quixote plucked a dry\r\nbranch to serve him after a fashion as a lance, and fixed on it the\r\nhead he had removed from the broken one. All that night Don Quixote lay\r\nawake thinking of his lady Dulcinea, in order to conform to what he had\r\nread in his books, how many a night in the forests and deserts knights\r\nused to lie sleepless supported by the memory of their mistresses. Not\r\nso did Sancho Panza spend it, for having his stomach full of something\r\nstronger than chicory water he made but one sleep of it, and, if his\r\nmaster had not called him, neither the rays of the sun beating on his\r\nface nor all the cheery notes of the birds welcoming the approach of\r\nday would have had power to waken him. On getting up he tried the bota\r\nand found it somewhat less full than the night before, which grieved\r\nhis heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy the\r\ndeficiency readily. Don Quixote did not care to break his fast, for, as\r\nhas been already said, he confined himself to savoury recollections for\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\nThey returned to the road they had set out with, leading to Puerto\r\nLapice, and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\r\nbrother Sancho Panza,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote when he saw it, \xe2\x80\x9cwe may plunge\r\nour hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe,\r\neven shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thou\r\nmust not put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thou\r\nperceivest that those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for in\r\nthat case thou mayest very properly aid me; but if they be knights it\r\nis on no account permitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to\r\nhelp me until thou hast been dubbed a knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost certainly, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship shall be fully\r\nobeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and no\r\nfriend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the\r\ndefence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, for\r\nlaws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any\r\nassailant whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I grant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut in this matter of aiding me\r\nagainst knights thou must put a restraint upon thy natural\r\nimpetuosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do so, I promise you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand will keep this\r\nprecept as carefully as Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of\r\nthe order of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not less\r\ntall were the two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectacles\r\nand carried sunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or\r\nfive persons on horseback and two muleteers on foot. In the coach there\r\nwas, as afterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, where\r\nher husband was about to take passage for the Indies with an\r\nappointment of high honour. The friars, though going the same road,\r\nwere not in her company; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he\r\nsaid to his squire, \xe2\x80\x9cEither I am mistaken, or this is going to be the\r\nmost famous adventure that has ever been seen, for those black bodies\r\nwe see there must be, and doubtless are, magicians who are carrying off\r\nsome stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must undo\r\nthis wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will be worse than the windmills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, se\xc3\xb1or;\r\nthose are friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to some\r\ntravellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nthe devil mislead you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told thee already, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat on the\r\nsubject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, as\r\nthou shalt see presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road\r\nalong which the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they had\r\ncome near enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cDevilish and\r\nunnatural beings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you\r\nare carrying off by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedy\r\ndeath as the just punishment of your evil deeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don\r\nQuixote as well as at his words, to which they replied, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or\r\nCaballero, we are not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St.\r\nBenedict following our road, nor do we know whether or not there are\r\nany captive princesses coming in this coach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote, and without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and with\r\nlevelled lance charged the first friar with such fury and\r\ndetermination, that, if the friar had not flung himself off the mule,\r\nhe would have brought him to the ground against his will, and sore\r\nwounded, if not killed outright. The second brother, seeing how his\r\ncomrade was treated, drove his heels into his castle of a mule and made\r\noff across the country faster than the wind.\r\n\r\nSancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly\r\nfrom his ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. At\r\nthat instant the friars muleteers came up and asked what he was\r\nstripping him for. Sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully\r\nas spoil of the battle which his lord Don Quixote had won. The\r\nmuleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all this\r\nabout battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was some distance off\r\ntalking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked him\r\ndown, and leaving hardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks\r\nand left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; and\r\nwithout any more delay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling,\r\nterrified, and pale, as soon as he found himself in the saddle, spurred\r\nafter his companion, who was standing at a distance looking on,\r\nwatching the result of the onslaught; then, not caring to wait for the\r\nend of the affair just begun, they pursued their journey making more\r\ncrosses than if they had the devil after them.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour beauty, lady mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cmay now dispose of your person as\r\nmay be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your\r\nravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine;\r\nand lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know\r\nthat I am called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and\r\nadventurer, and captive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del\r\nToboso: and in return for the service you have received of me I ask no\r\nmore than that you should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf present\r\nyourself before that lady and tell her what I have done to set you\r\nfree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was\r\nlistening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would\r\nnot allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to\r\nEl Toboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad\r\nCastilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, \xe2\x80\x9cBegone, caballero, and\r\nill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach,\r\nslayest thee as art here a Biscayan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have already\r\nchastised thy folly and rashness, miserable creature.\xe2\x80\x9d To which the\r\nBiscayan returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI no gentleman!\xe2\x80\x94I swear to God thou liest as I am\r\nChristian: if thou droppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thou\r\nsee thou art carrying water to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo at\r\nsea, hidalgo at the devil, and look, if thou sayest otherwise thou\r\nliest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see presently,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agrajes,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; and\r\nthrowing his lance on the ground he drew his sword, braced his buckler\r\non his arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his life.\r\n\r\nThe Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismount\r\nfrom his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for\r\nhire, he had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was\r\nlucky for him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he was\r\nable to snatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went at\r\none another as if they had been two mortal enemies. The others strove\r\nto make peace between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in\r\nhis disjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he\r\nwould kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. The\r\nlady in the coach, amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered the\r\ncoachman to draw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severe\r\nstruggle, in the course of which the Biscayan smote Don Quixote a\r\nmighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler, which, given\r\nto one without armour, would have cleft him to the waist. Don Quixote,\r\nfeeling the weight of this prodigious blow, cried aloud, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nlady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the aid of this\r\nyour knight, who, in fulfilling his obligations to your beauty, finds\r\nhimself in this extreme peril.\xe2\x80\x9d To say this, to lift his sword, to\r\nshelter himself well behind his buckler, and to assail the Biscayan was\r\nthe work of an instant, determined as he was to venture all upon a\r\nsingle blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on in this way, was\r\nconvinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and resolved to\r\nfollow his example, so he waited for him keeping well under cover of\r\nhis cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his\r\nmule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, could\r\nnot stir a step.\r\n\r\nOn, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan,\r\nwith uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half,\r\nwhile on his side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and under\r\nthe protection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting\r\nin suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and the\r\nlady in the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand\r\nvows and offerings to all the images and shrines of Spain, that God\r\nmight deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril in which\r\nthey found themselves. But it spoils all, that at this point and crisis\r\nthe author of the history leaves this battle impending, giving as\r\nexcuse that he could find nothing more written about these achievements\r\nof Don Quixote than what has been already set forth. It is true the\r\nsecond author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history so\r\ncurious could have been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion,\r\nor that the wits of La Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to\r\npreserve in their archives or registries some documents referring to\r\nthis famous knight; and this being his persuasion, he did not despair\r\nof finding the conclusion of this pleasant history, which, heaven\r\nfavouring him, he did find in a way that shall be related in the Second\r\nPart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc08e.jpg (54K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nIN WHICH IS CONCLUDED AND FINISHED THE TERRIFIC BATTLE BETWEEN THE\r\nGALLANT BISCAYAN AND THE VALIANT MANCHEGAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc09a.jpg (142K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and the\r\nrenowned Don Quixote with drawn swords uplifted, ready to deliver two\r\nsuch furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they\r\nwould at least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and\r\nlaid them open like a pomegranate; and at this so critical point the\r\ndelightful history came to a stop and stood cut short without any\r\nintimation from the author where what was missing was to be found.\r\n\r\nThis distressed me greatly, because the pleasure derived from having\r\nread such a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poor\r\nchance that presented itself of finding the large part that, so it\r\nseemed to me, was missing of such an interesting tale. It appeared to\r\nme to be a thing impossible and contrary to all precedent that so good\r\na knight should have been without some sage to undertake the task of\r\nwriting his marvellous achievements; a thing that was never wanting to\r\nany of those knights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; for\r\nevery one of them had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who not\r\nonly recorded their deeds but described their most trifling thoughts\r\nand follies, however secret they might be; and such a good knight could\r\nnot have been so unfortunate as not to have what Platir and others like\r\nhim had in abundance. And so I could not bring myself to believe that\r\nsuch a gallant tale had been left maimed and mutilated, and I laid the\r\nblame on Time, the devourer and destroyer of all things, that had\r\neither concealed or consumed it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books there\r\nhad been found such modern ones as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Enlightenment of Jealousy\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cNymphs and Shepherds of Henares,\xe2\x80\x9d his story must likewise be\r\nmodern, and that though it might not be written, it might exist in the\r\nmemory of the people of his village and of those in the neighbourhood.\r\nThis reflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly\r\nthe whole life and wondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard, Don Quixote\r\nof La Mancha, light and mirror of Manchegan chivalry, and the first\r\nthat in our age and in these so evil days devoted himself to the labour\r\nand exercise of the arms of knight-errantry, righting wrongs,\r\nsuccouring widows, and protecting damsels of that sort that used to\r\nride about, whip in hand, on their palfreys, with all their virginity\r\nabout them, from mountain to mountain and valley to valley\xe2\x80\x94for, if it\r\nwere not for some ruffian, or boor with a hood and hatchet, or\r\nmonstrous giant, that forced them, there were in days of yore damsels\r\nthat at the end of eighty years, in all which time they had never slept\r\na day under a roof, went to their graves as much maids as the mothers\r\nthat bore them. I say, then, that in these and other respects our\r\ngallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and notable praise, nor\r\nshould it be withheld even from me for the labour and pains spent in\r\nsearching for the conclusion of this delightful history; though I know\r\nwell that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped me, the\r\nworld would have remained deprived of an entertainment and pleasure\r\nthat for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall read it\r\nattentively. The discovery of it occurred in this way.\r\n\r\nOne day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell some\r\npamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, and, as I am fond of reading\r\neven the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bent\r\nof mine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and saw\r\nthat it was in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I was\r\nunable to read them though I could recognise them, I looked about to\r\nsee if there were any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for\r\nme; nor was there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter,\r\nfor even had I sought one for an older and better language I should\r\nhave found him. In short, chance provided me with one, who when I told\r\nhim what I wanted and put the book into his hands, opened it in the\r\nmiddle and after reading a little in it began to laugh. I asked him\r\nwhat he was laughing at, and he replied that it was at something the\r\nbook had written in the margin by way of a note. I bade him tell it to\r\nme; and he still laughing said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the margin, as I told you, this is\r\nwritten: \xe2\x80\x98_This Dulcinea del Toboso so often mentioned in this history,\r\nhad, they say, the best hand of any woman in all La Mancha for salting\r\npigs_.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise and\r\namazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained\r\nthe history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read the\r\nbeginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, he\r\ntold me it meant, \xe2\x80\x9c_History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cid\r\nHamete Benengeli, an Arab historian_.\xe2\x80\x9d It required great caution to\r\nhide the joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and\r\nsnatching it from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers and\r\npamphlets from the boy for half a real; and if he had had his wits\r\nabout him and had known how eager I was for them, he might have safely\r\ncalculated on making more than six reals by the bargain. I withdrew at\r\nonce with the Morisco into the cloister of the cathedral, and begged\r\nhim to turn all these pamphlets that related to Don Quixote into the\r\nCastilian tongue, without omitting or adding anything to them, offering\r\nhim whatever payment he pleased. He was satisfied with two arrobas of\r\nraisins and two bushels of wheat, and promised to translate them\r\nfaithfully and with all despatch; but to make the matter easier, and\r\nnot to let such a precious find out of my hands, I took him to my\r\nhouse, where in little more than a month and a half he translated the\r\nwhole just as it is set down here.\r\n\r\nIn the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan\r\nwas drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the\r\nhistory describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his\r\nbuckler, the other by his cushion, and the Biscayan\xe2\x80\x99s mule so true to\r\nnature that it could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. The\r\nBiscayan had an inscription under his feet which said, \xe2\x80\x9c_Don Sancho de\r\nAzpeitia_,\xe2\x80\x9d which no doubt must have been his name; and at the feet of\r\nRocinante was another that said, \xe2\x80\x9c_Don Quixote_.\xe2\x80\x9d Rocinante was\r\nmarvellously portrayed, so long and thin, so lank and lean, with so\r\nmuch backbone and so far gone in consumption, that he showed plainly\r\nwith what judgment and propriety the name of Rocinante had been\r\nbestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panza holding the halter of his\r\nass, at whose feet was another label that said, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho Zancas,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\naccording to the picture, he must have had a big belly, a short body,\r\nand long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the names of Panza and\r\nZancas were given him, for by these two surnames the history several\r\ntimes calls him. Some other trifling particulars might be mentioned,\r\nbut they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do with the\r\ntrue relation of the history; and no history can be bad so long as it\r\nis true.\r\n\r\nIf against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its\r\ntruth, it can only be that its author was an Arab, as lying is a very\r\ncommon propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are such\r\nenemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions rather\r\nthan additions made in the course of it. And this is my own opinion;\r\nfor, where he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so\r\nworthy a knight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in\r\nsilence; which is ill done and worse contrived, for it is the business\r\nand duty of historians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free from\r\npassion, and neither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make\r\nthem swerve from the path of truth, whose mother is history, rival of\r\ntime, storehouse of deeds, witness for the past, example and counsel\r\nfor the present, and warning for the future. In this I know will be\r\nfound all that can be desired in the pleasantest, and if it be wanting\r\nin any good quality, I maintain it is the fault of its hound of an\r\nauthor and not the fault of the subject. To be brief, its Second Part,\r\naccording to the translation, began in this way:\r\n\r\nWith trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as though\r\nthe two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, and\r\nearth, and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bear\r\nthemselves. The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which\r\nwas delivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in\r\nits course, that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the\r\nbitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight; but that good\r\nfortune which reserved him for greater things, turned aside the sword\r\nof his adversary, so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder,\r\nit did him no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour,\r\ncarrying away a great part of his helmet with half of his ear, all\r\nwhich with fearful ruin fell to the ground, leaving him in a sorry\r\nplight.\r\n\r\nGood God! Who is there that could properly describe the rage that\r\nfilled the heart of our Manchegan when he saw himself dealt with in\r\nthis fashion? All that can be said is, it was such that he again raised\r\nhimself in his stirrups, and, grasping his sword more firmly with both\r\nhands, he came down on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him full\r\nover the cushion and over the head, that\xe2\x80\x94even so good a shield proving\r\nuseless\xe2\x80\x94as if a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed from\r\nnose, mouth, and ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from his\r\nmule, as no doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms about\r\nits neck; at the same time, however, he slipped his feet out of the\r\nstirrups and then unclasped his arms, and the mule, taking fright at\r\nthe terrible blow, made off across the plain, and with a few plunges\r\nflung its master to the ground. Don Quixote stood looking on very\r\ncalmly, and, when he saw him fall, leaped from his horse and with great\r\nbriskness ran to him, and, presenting the point of his sword to his\r\neyes, bade him surrender, or he would cut his head off. The Biscayan\r\nwas so bewildered that he was unable to answer a word, and it would\r\nhave gone hard with him, so blind was Don Quixote, had not the ladies\r\nin the coach, who had hitherto been watching the combat in great\r\nterror, hastened to where he stood and implored him with earnest\r\nentreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing their\r\nsquire\xe2\x80\x99s life; to which Don Quixote replied with much gravity and\r\ndignity, \xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what ye ask of\r\nme; but it must be on one condition and understanding, which is that\r\nthis knight promise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on my\r\nbehalf present himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she deal\r\nwith him as shall be most pleasing to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndemand or asking who Dulcinea might be, promised that their squire\r\nshould do all that had been commanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, on the faith of that promise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall do him\r\nno further harm, though he well deserves it of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc09e.jpg (61K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nOF THE PLEASANT DISCOURSE THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS\r\nSQUIRE SANCHO PANZA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc10a.jpg (91K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow by this time Sancho had risen, rather the worse for the handling of\r\nthe friars\xe2\x80\x99 muleteers, and stood watching the battle of his master, Don\r\nQuixote, and praying to God in his heart that it might be his will to\r\ngrant him the victory, and that he might thereby win some island to\r\nmake him governor of, as he had promised. Seeing, therefore, that the\r\nstruggle was now over, and that his master was returning to mount\r\nRocinante, he approached to hold the stirrup for him, and, before he\r\ncould mount, he went on his knees before him, and taking his hand,\r\nkissed it saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMay it please your worship, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, to\r\ngive me the government of that island which has been won in this hard\r\nfight, for be it ever so big I feel myself in sufficient force to be\r\nable to govern it as much and as well as anyone in the world who has\r\never governed islands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThou must take notice, brother Sancho,\r\nthat this adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands,\r\nbut of cross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or an\r\near the less: have patience, for adventures will present themselves\r\nfrom which I may make you, not only a governor, but something more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho gave him many thanks, and again kissing his hand and the skirt\r\nof his hauberk, helped him to mount Rocinante, and mounting his ass\r\nhimself, proceeded to follow his master, who at a brisk pace, without\r\ntaking leave, or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the\r\ncoach, turned into a wood that was hard by. Sancho followed him at his\r\nass\xe2\x80\x99s best trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left\r\nbehind, he was forced to call to his master to wait for him. Don\r\nQuixote did so, reining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up,\r\nwho on reaching him said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me, se\xc3\xb1or, it would be prudent\r\nin us to go and take refuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled he\r\nwith whom you fought has been left, it will be no wonder if they give\r\ninformation of the affair to the Holy Brotherhood and arrest us, and,\r\nfaith, if they do, before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere hast thou ever seen or heard that a\r\nknight-errant has been arraigned before a court of justice, however\r\nmany homicides he may have committed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about omecils,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cnor in my life have\r\nhad anything to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhood\r\nlooks after those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter I\r\ndo not meddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor I will deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much more\r\nout of those of the Brotherhood. But tell me, as thou livest, hast thou\r\nseen a more valiant knight than I in all the known world; hast thou\r\nread in history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack, more\r\nspirit in maintaining it, more dexterity in wounding or skill in\r\noverthrowing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have never read any history,\r\nfor I can neither read nor write, but what I will venture to bet is\r\nthat a more daring master than your worship I have never served in all\r\nthe days of my life, and God grant that this daring be not paid for\r\nwhere I have said; what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound,\r\nfor a great deal of blood flows from that ear, and I have here some\r\nlint and a little white ointment in the alforjas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that might be well dispensed with,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif I had\r\nremembered to make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras, for time and\r\nmedicine are saved by one single drop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat vial and what balsam is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho Panza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a balsam,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe receipt of which I have in\r\nmy memory, with which one need have no fear of death, or dread dying of\r\nany wound; and so when I make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing\r\nto do when in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through\r\nthe middle of the body\xe2\x80\x94as is wont to happen frequently\xe2\x80\x94but neatly and\r\nwith great nicety, ere the blood congeal, to place that portion of the\r\nbody which shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half which\r\nremains in the saddle, taking care to fit it on evenly and exactly.\r\nThen thou shalt give me to drink but two drops of the balsam I have\r\nmentioned, and thou shalt see me become sounder than an apple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Panza, \xe2\x80\x9cI renounce henceforth the government of\r\nthe promised island, and desire nothing more in payment of my many and\r\nfaithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of this\r\nsupreme liquor, for I am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals\r\nan ounce anywhere, and I want no more to pass the rest of my life in\r\nease and honour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to make\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith less than three reals, six quarts of it may be made,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSinner that I am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthen why does your worship put off\r\nmaking it and teaching it to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cgreater secrets I mean to teach\r\nthee and greater favours to bestow upon thee; and for the present let\r\nus see to the dressing, for my ear pains me more than I could wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas; but when Don\r\nQuixote came to see his helmet shattered, he was like to lose his\r\nsenses, and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to\r\nheaven, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI swear by the Creator of all things and the four\r\nGospels in their fullest extent, to do as the great Marquis of Mantua\r\ndid when he swore to avenge the death of his nephew Baldwin (and that\r\nwas not to eat bread from a table-cloth, nor embrace his wife, and\r\nother points which, though I cannot now call them to mind, I here grant\r\nas expressed) until I take complete vengeance upon him who has\r\ncommitted such an offence against me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing this, Sancho said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cYour worship should bear in mind,\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, that if the knight has done what was commanded him\r\nin going to present himself before my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he will\r\nhave done all that he was bound to do, and does not deserve further\r\npunishment unless he commits some new offence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast said well and hit the point,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote; and so I\r\nrecall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him,\r\nbut I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I have said until such\r\ntime as I take by force from some knight another helmet such as this\r\nand as good; and think not, Sancho, that I am raising smoke with straw\r\nin doing so, for I have one to imitate in the matter, since the very\r\nsame thing to a hair happened in the case of Mambrino\xe2\x80\x99s helmet, which\r\ncost Sacripante so dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9clet your worship send all such oaths to the\r\ndevil, for they are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to the\r\nconscience; just tell me now, if for several days to come we fall in\r\nwith no man armed with a helmet, what are we to do? Is the oath to be\r\nobserved in spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be to\r\nsleep in your clothes, and not to sleep in a house, and a thousand\r\nother mortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the Marquis\r\nof Mantua, which your worship is now wanting to revive? Let your\r\nworship observe that there are no men in armour travelling on any of\r\nthese roads, nothing but carriers and carters, who not only do not wear\r\nhelmets, but perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art wrong there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we shall not have been\r\nabove two hours among these cross-roads before we see more men in\r\narmour than came to Albraca to win the fair Angelica.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cso be it then, and God grant us success, and\r\nthat the time for winning that island which is costing me so dear may\r\nsoon come, and then let me die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already told thee, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to give\r\nthyself any uneasiness on that score; for if an island should fail,\r\nthere is the kingdom of Denmark, or of Sobradisa, which will fit thee\r\nas a ring fits the finger, and all the more that, being on _terra\r\nfirma_, thou wilt all the better enjoy thyself. But let us leave that\r\nto its own time; see if thou hast anything for us to eat in those\r\nalforjas, because we must presently go in quest of some castle where we\r\nmay lodge to-night and make the balsam I told thee of, for I swear to\r\nthee by God, this ear is giving me great pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight like\r\nyour worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow little thou knowest about it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cI would have\r\nthee to know, Sancho, that it is the glory of knights-errant to go\r\nwithout eating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it should\r\nbe of what comes first to hand; and this would have been clear to thee\r\nhadst thou read as many histories as I have, for, though they are very\r\nmany, among them all I have found no mention made of knights-errant\r\neating, unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for\r\nthem, and the rest of the time they passed in dalliance. And though it\r\nis plain they could not do without eating and performing all the other\r\nnatural functions, because, in fact, they were men like ourselves, it\r\nis plain too that, wandering as they did the most part of their lives\r\nthrough woods and wilds and without a cook, their most usual fare would\r\nbe rustic viands such as those thou now offer me; so that, friend\r\nSancho, let not that distress thee which pleases me, and do not seek to\r\nmake a new world or pervert knight-errantry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor, as I cannot read or\r\nwrite, as I said just now, I neither know nor comprehend the rules of\r\nthe profession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the alforjas with\r\nevery kind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and for\r\nmyself, as I am not one, I will furnish them with poultry and other\r\nthings more substantial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not say, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it is imperative on\r\nknights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest\r\nof; only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs\r\nthey found in the fields which they knew and I know too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good thing it is,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cto know those herbs, for to my\r\nthinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into\r\npractice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made their\r\nrepast peaceably and sociably. But anxious to find quarters for the\r\nnight, they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare,\r\nmounted at once, and made haste to reach some habitation before night\r\nset in; but daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed\r\nthem close by the huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass\r\nthe night there, and it was as much to Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s discontent not to have\r\nreached a house, as it was to his master\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction to sleep under\r\nthe open heaven, for he fancied that each time this happened to him he\r\nperformed an act of ownership that helped to prove his chivalry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc10e.jpg (57K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nWHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH CERTAIN GOATHERDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc11a.jpg (173K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and Sancho, having as best\r\nhe could put up Rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance that\r\ncame from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire;\r\nand though he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be\r\ntransferred from the pot to the stomach, he refrained from doing so as\r\nthe goatherds removed them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on the\r\nground, quickly spread their rude table, and with signs of hearty\r\ngood-will invited them both to share what they had. Round the skins six\r\nof the men belonging to the fold seated themselves, having first with\r\nrough politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a seat upon a trough which\r\nthey placed for him upside down. Don Quixote seated himself, and Sancho\r\nremained standing to serve the cup, which was made of horn. Seeing him\r\nstanding, his master said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat thou mayest see, Sancho, the good that knight-errantry contains\r\nin itself, and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road\r\nto be speedily honoured and esteemed by the world, I desire that thou\r\nseat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people,\r\nand that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, and\r\nthat thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; for\r\nthe same may be said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levels\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I may tell your worship that provided\r\nI have enough to eat, I can eat it as well, or better, standing, and by\r\nmyself, than seated alongside of an emperor. And indeed, if the truth\r\nis to be told, what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has much\r\nmore relish for me, even though it be bread and onions, than the\r\nturkeys of those other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drink\r\nlittle, wipe my mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if I\r\nwant or do other things that are the privileges of liberty and\r\nsolitude. So, se\xc3\xb1or, as for these honours which your worship would put\r\nupon me as a servant and follower of knight-errantry, exchange them for\r\nother things which may be of more use and advantage to me; for these,\r\nthough I fully acknowledge them as received, I renounce from this\r\nmoment to the end of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthou must seat thyself, because him\r\nwho humbleth himself God exalteth;\xe2\x80\x9d and seizing him by the arm he\r\nforced him to sit down beside himself.\r\n\r\nThe goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and\r\nknights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at\r\ntheir guests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away\r\npieces as big as one\xe2\x80\x99s fist. The course of meat finished, they spread\r\nupon the sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns, and with them they\r\nput down a half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar. All\r\nthis while the horn was not idle, for it went round so constantly, now\r\nfull, now empty, like the bucket of a water-wheel, that it soon drained\r\none of the two wine-skins that were in sight. When Don Quixote had\r\nquite appeased his appetite he took up a handful of the acorns, and\r\ncontemplating them attentively delivered himself somewhat in this\r\nfashion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name of\r\ngolden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this\r\nour iron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in it\r\nknew not the two words \xe2\x80\x9c_mine_\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c_thine_\xe2\x80\x9d! In that blessed age all\r\nthings were in common; to win the daily food no labour was required of\r\nany save to stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks\r\nthat stood generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. The\r\nclear streams and running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in\r\nnoble abundance. The busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in\r\nthe clefts of the rocks and hollows of the trees, offering without\r\nusance the plenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand. The\r\nmighty cork trees, unenforced save of their own courtesy, shed the\r\nbroad light bark that served at first to roof the houses supported by\r\nrude stakes, a protection against the inclemency of heaven alone. Then\r\nall was peace, all friendship, all concord; as yet the dull share of\r\nthe crooked plough had not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowels\r\nof our first mother that without compulsion yielded from every portion\r\nof her broad fertile bosom all that could satisfy, sustain, and delight\r\nthe children that then possessed her. Then was it that the innocent and\r\nfair young shepherdess roamed from vale to vale and hill to hill, with\r\nflowing locks, and no more garments than were needful modestly to cover\r\nwhat modesty seeks and ever sought to hide. Nor were their ornaments\r\nlike those in use to-day, set off by Tyrian purple, and silk tortured\r\nin endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy,\r\nwherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked as our Court dames\r\nwith all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idle curiosity has\r\ntaught them. Then the love-thoughts of the heart clothed themselves\r\nsimply and naturally as the heart conceived them, nor sought to commend\r\nthemselves by forced and rambling verbiage. Fraud, deceit, or malice\r\nhad then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity. Justice held her\r\nground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and of\r\ninterest, that now so much impair, pervert, and beset her. Arbitrary\r\nlaw had not yet established itself in the mind of the judge, for then\r\nthere was no cause to judge and no one to be judged. Maidens and\r\nmodesty, as I have said, wandered at will alone and unattended, without\r\nfear of insult from lawlessness or libertine assault, and if they were\r\nundone it was of their own will and pleasure. But now in this hateful\r\nage of ours not one is safe, not though some new labyrinth like that of\r\nCrete conceal and surround her; even there the pestilence of gallantry\r\nwill make its way to them through chinks or on the air by the zeal of\r\nits accursed importunity, and, despite of all seclusion, lead them to\r\nruin. In defence of these, as time advanced and wickedness increased,\r\nthe order of knights-errant was instituted, to defend maidens, to\r\nprotect widows and to succour the orphans and the needy. To this order\r\nI belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks for the\r\nhospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for though by\r\nnatural law all living are bound to show favour to knights-errant, yet,\r\nseeing that without knowing this obligation ye have welcomed and\r\nfeasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my power I\r\nshould thank you for yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc11b.jpg (349K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our\r\nknight delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the\r\ngolden age; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary\r\nargument to the goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement\r\nwithout saying a word in reply. Sancho likewise held his peace and ate\r\nacorns, and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin, which they\r\nhad hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at the\r\nend of which one of the goatherds said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat your worship, se\xc3\xb1or\r\nknight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality\r\nwith ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by making\r\none of our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a very\r\nintelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read and\r\nwrite and play on the rebeck to perfection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeck\r\nreached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a very\r\ngood-looking young man of about two-and-twenty. His comrades asked him\r\nif he had supped, and on his replying that he had, he who had already\r\nmade the offer said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, Antonio, thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of\r\nsinging a little, that the gentleman, our guest, may see that even in\r\nthe mountains and woods there are musicians: we have told him of thy\r\naccomplishments, and we want thee to show them and prove that we say\r\ntrue; so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy\r\nlove that thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so much\r\nliked in the town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, and without waiting for more\r\npressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak, and tuning his\r\nrebeck, presently began to sing to these words.\r\n\r\nANTONIO\xe2\x80\x99S BALLAD\r\n\r\nThou dost love me well, Olalla;\r\nWell I know it, even though\r\nLove\xe2\x80\x99s mute tongues, thine eyes, have never\r\nBy their glances told me so.\r\n\r\nFor I know my love thou knowest,\r\nTherefore thine to claim I dare:\r\nOnce it ceases to be secret,\r\nLove need never feel despair.\r\n\r\nTrue it is, Olalla, sometimes\r\nThou hast all too plainly shown\r\nThat thy heart is brass in hardness,\r\nAnd thy snowy bosom stone.\r\n\r\nYet for all that, in thy coyness,\r\nAnd thy fickle fits between,\r\nHope is there\xe2\x80\x94at least the border\r\nOf her garment may be seen.\r\n\r\nLures to faith are they, those glimpses,\r\nAnd to faith in thee I hold;\r\nKindness cannot make it stronger,\r\nColdness cannot make it cold.\r\n\r\nIf it be that love is gentle,\r\nIn thy gentleness I see\r\nSomething holding out assurance\r\nTo the hope of winning thee.\r\n\r\nIf it be that in devotion\r\nLies a power hearts to move,\r\nThat which every day I show thee,\r\nHelpful to my suit should prove.\r\n\r\nMany a time thou must have noticed\xe2\x80\x94\r\nIf to notice thou dost care\xe2\x80\x94\r\nHow I go about on Monday\r\nDressed in all my Sunday wear.\r\n\r\nLove\xe2\x80\x99s eyes love to look on brightness;\r\nLove loves what is gaily drest;\r\nSunday, Monday, all I care is\r\nThou shouldst see me in my best.\r\n\r\nNo account I make of dances,\r\nOr of strains that pleased thee so,\r\nKeeping thee awake from midnight\r\nTill the cocks began to crow;\r\n\r\nOr of how I roundly swore it\r\nThat there\xe2\x80\x99s none so fair as thou;\r\nTrue it is, but as I said it,\r\nBy the girls I\xe2\x80\x99m hated now.\r\n\r\nFor Teresa of the hillside\r\nAt my praise of thee was sore;\r\nSaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYou think you love an angel;\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a monkey you adore;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaught by all her glittering trinkets,\r\nAnd her borrowed braids of hair,\r\nAnd a host of made-up beauties\r\nThat would Love himself ensnare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas a lie, and so I told her,\r\nAnd her cousin at the word\r\nGave me his defiance for it;\r\nAnd what followed thou hast heard.\r\n\r\nMine is no high-flown affection,\r\nMine no passion _par amours_\xe2\x80\x94\r\nAs they call it\xe2\x80\x94what I offer\r\nIs an honest love, and pure.\r\n\r\nCunning cords the holy Church has,\r\nCords of softest silk they be;\r\nPut thy neck beneath the yoke, dear;\r\nMine will follow, thou wilt see.\r\n\r\nElse\xe2\x80\x94and once for all I swear it\r\nBy the saint of most renown\xe2\x80\x94\r\nIf I ever quit the mountains,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twill be in a friar\xe2\x80\x99s gown.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though Don Quixote\r\nentreated him to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being more\r\ninclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to his\r\nmaster, \xe2\x80\x9cYour worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to\r\npass the night, for the labour these good men are at all day does not\r\nallow them to spend the night in singing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand thee, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cI perceive clearly\r\nthat those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather\r\nthan in music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s sweet to us all, blessed be God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not deny it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut settle thyself where thou\r\nwilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than\r\nin sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear\r\nfor me again, for it is giving me more pain than it need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound,\r\ntold him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which it\r\nwould be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which\r\nthere was a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with a\r\nlittle salt, and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a\r\nbandage, assuring him that no other treatment would be required, and so\r\nit proved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc11e.jpg (37K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nOF WHAT A GOATHERD RELATED TO THOSE WITH DON QUIXOTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc12a.jpg (143K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust then another young man, one of those who fetched their provisions\r\nfrom the village, came up and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what is going on in\r\nthe village, comrades?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could we know it?\xe2\x80\x9d replied one of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you must know,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cthis morning\r\nthat famous student-shepherd called Chrysostom died, and it is rumoured\r\nthat he died of love for that devil of a village girl the daughter of\r\nGuillermo the Rich, she that wanders about the wolds here in the dress\r\nof a shepherdess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean Marcela?\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the goatherd; \xe2\x80\x9cand the best of it is, he has\r\ndirected in his will that he is to be buried in the fields like a Moor,\r\nand at the foot of the rock where the Cork-tree spring is, because, as\r\nthe story goes (and they say he himself said so), that was the place\r\nwhere he first saw her. And he has also left other directions which the\r\nclergy of the village say should not and must not be obeyed because\r\nthey savour of paganism. To all which his great friend Ambrosio the\r\nstudent, he who, like him, also went dressed as a shepherd, replies\r\nthat everything must be done without any omission according to the\r\ndirections left by Chrysostom, and about this the village is all in\r\ncommotion; however, report says that, after all, what Ambrosio and all\r\nthe shepherds his friends desire will be done, and to-morrow they are\r\ncoming to bury him with great ceremony where I said. I am sure it will\r\nbe something worth seeing; at least I will not fail to go and see it\r\neven if I knew I should not return to the village to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will do the same,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the goatherds, \xe2\x80\x9cand cast lots to see\r\nwho must stay to mind the goats of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou sayest well, Pedro,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, \xe2\x80\x9cthough there will be no need of\r\ntaking that trouble, for I will stay behind for all; and don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose\r\nit is virtue or want of curiosity in me; it is that the splinter that\r\nran into my foot the other day will not let me walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that, we thank thee,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pedro.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote asked Pedro to tell him who the dead man was and who the\r\nshepherdess, to which Pedro replied that all he knew was that the dead\r\nman was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains,\r\nwho had been a student at Salamanca for many years, at the end of which\r\nhe returned to his village with the reputation of being very learned\r\nand deeply read. \xe2\x80\x9cAbove all, they said, he was learned in the science\r\nof the stars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun and\r\nthe moon, for he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those two\r\nluminaries,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself with\r\ntrifles, went on with his story, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAlso he foretold when the\r\nyear was going to be one of abundance or estility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSterility, you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSterility or estility,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pedro, \xe2\x80\x9cit is all the same in the\r\nend. And I can tell you that by this his father and friends who\r\nbelieved him grew very rich because they did as he advised them,\r\nbidding them \xe2\x80\x98sow barley this year, not wheat; this year you may sow\r\npulse and not barley; the next there will be a full oil crop, and the\r\nthree following not a drop will be got.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat science is called astrology,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know what it is called,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pedro, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know that he\r\nknew all this and more besides. But, to make an end, not many months\r\nhad passed after he returned from Salamanca, when one day he appeared\r\ndressed as a shepherd with his crook and sheepskin, having put off the\r\nlong gown he wore as a scholar; and at the same time his great friend,\r\nAmbrosio by name, who had been his companion in his studies, took to\r\nthe shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s dress with him. I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who is\r\ndead, was a great man for writing verses, so much so that he made\r\ncarols for Christmas Eve, and plays for Corpus Christi, which the young\r\nmen of our village acted, and all said they were excellent. When the\r\nvillagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndress, they were lost in wonder, and could not guess what had led them\r\nto make so extraordinary a change. About this time the father of our\r\nChrysostom died, and he was left heir to a large amount of property in\r\nchattels as well as in land, no small number of cattle and sheep, and a\r\nlarge sum of money, of all of which the young man was left dissolute\r\nowner, and indeed he was deserving of it all, for he was a very good\r\ncomrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of worthy folk, and had a\r\ncountenance like a benediction. Presently it came to be known that he\r\nhad changed his dress with no other object than to wander about these\r\nwastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago,\r\nwith whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love. And I must tell\r\nyou now, for it is well you should know it, who this girl is; perhaps,\r\nand even without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like it\r\nall the days of your life, though you should live more years than\r\nsarna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay Sarra,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfusion of words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sarna lives long enough,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pedro; \xe2\x80\x9cand if, se\xc3\xb1or, you must\r\ngo finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end of\r\nit this twelvemonth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, as there is such a\r\ndifference between sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; however, you have\r\nanswered very rightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: so continue\r\nyour story, and I will not object any more to anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say then, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the goatherd, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in our village\r\nthere was a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who was\r\nnamed Guillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over and above great\r\nwealth, a daughter at whose birth her mother died, the most respected\r\nwoman there was in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her now with\r\nthat countenance which had the sun on one side and the moon on the\r\nother; and moreover active, and kind to the poor, for which I trust\r\nthat at the present moment her soul is in bliss with God in the other\r\nworld. Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a\r\nwife, leaving his daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of an\r\nuncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village. The girl grew up\r\nwith such beauty that it reminded us of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s, which was very\r\ngreat, and yet it was thought that the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s would exceed it; and\r\nso when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld\r\nher but blessed God that had made her so beautiful, and the greater\r\nnumber were in love with her past redemption. Her uncle kept her in\r\ngreat seclusion and retirement, but for all that the fame of her great\r\nbeauty spread so that, as well for it as for her great wealth, her\r\nuncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, to give her in marriage not\r\nonly by those of our town but of those many leagues round, and by the\r\npersons of highest quality in them. But he, being a good Christian man,\r\nthough he desired to give her in marriage at once, seeing her to be old\r\nenough, was unwilling to do so without her consent, not that he had any\r\neye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s property\r\nbrought him while he put off her marriage; and, faith, this was said in\r\npraise of the good priest in more than one set in the town. For I would\r\nhave you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything is\r\ntalked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am,\r\nthat the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners\r\nto speak well of him, especially in villages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut go on, for the story is\r\nvery good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay that of the Lord not be wanting to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedro; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the\r\none to have. To proceed; you must know that though the uncle put before\r\nhis niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular\r\nof the many who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry and\r\nmake a choice according to her own taste, she never gave any other\r\nanswer than that she had no desire to marry just yet, and that being so\r\nyoung she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. At\r\nthese, to all appearance, reasonable excuses that she made, her uncle\r\nceased to urge her, and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in\r\nage and could mate herself to her own liking. For, said he\xe2\x80\x94and he said\r\nquite right\xe2\x80\x94parents are not to settle children in life against their\r\nwill. But when one least looked for it, lo and behold! one day the\r\ndemure Marcela makes her appearance turned shepherdess; and, in spite\r\nof her uncle and all those of the town that strove to dissuade her,\r\ntook to going a-field with the other shepherd-lasses of the village,\r\nand tending her own flock. And so, since she appeared in public, and\r\nher beauty came to be seen openly, I could not well tell you how many\r\nrich youths, gentlemen and peasants, have adopted the costume of\r\nChrysostom, and go about these fields making love to her. One of these,\r\nas has been already said, was our deceased friend, of whom they say\r\nthat he did not love but adore her. But you must not suppose, because\r\nMarcela chose a life of such liberty and independence, and of so little\r\nor rather no retirement, that she has given any occasion, or even the\r\nsemblance of one, for disparagement of her purity and modesty; on the\r\ncontrary, such and so great is the vigilance with which she watches\r\nover her honour, that of all those that court and woo her not one has\r\nboasted, or can with truth boast, that she has given him any hope\r\nhowever small of obtaining his desire. For although she does not avoid\r\nor shun the society and conversation of the shepherds, and treats them\r\ncourteously and kindly, should any one of them come to declare his\r\nintention to her, though it be one as proper and holy as that of\r\nmatrimony, she flings him from her like a catapult. And with this kind\r\nof disposition she does more harm in this country than if the plague\r\nhad got into it, for her affability and her beauty draw on the hearts\r\nof those that associate with her to love her and to court her, but her\r\nscorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair; and so they\r\nknow not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hard-hearted,\r\nand other names of the same sort which well describe the nature of her\r\ncharacter; and if you should remain here any time, se\xc3\xb1or, you would\r\nhear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the\r\nrejected ones who pursue her. Not far from this there is a spot where\r\nthere are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and there is not one of\r\nthem but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela,\r\nand above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover\r\nwould say more plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human\r\nbeauty. Here one shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; there\r\nlove songs are heard, here despairing elegies. One will pass all the\r\nhours of the night seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there,\r\nwithout having closed his weeping eyes, the sun finds him in the\r\nmorning bemused and bereft of sense; and another without relief or\r\nrespite to his sighs, stretched on the burning sand in the full heat of\r\nthe sultry summer noontide, makes his appeal to the compassionate\r\nheavens, and over one and the other, over these and all, the beautiful\r\nMarcela triumphs free and careless. And all of us that know her are\r\nwaiting to see what her pride will come to, and who is to be the happy\r\nman that will succeed in taming a nature so formidable and gaining\r\npossession of a beauty so supreme. All that I have told you being such\r\nwell-established truth, I am persuaded that what they say of the cause\r\nof Chrysostom\xe2\x80\x99s death, as our lad told us, is the same. And so I advise\r\nyou, se\xc3\xb1or, fail not to be present to-morrow at his burial, which will\r\nbe well worth seeing, for Chrysostom had many friends, and it is not\r\nhalf a league from this place to where he directed he should be\r\nburied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will make a point of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand I thank you for the\r\npleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the goatherd, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know even the half of what has\r\nhappened to the lovers of Marcela, but perhaps to-morrow we may fall in\r\nwith some shepherd on the road who can tell us; and now it will be well\r\nfor you to go and sleep under cover, for the night air may hurt your\r\nwound, though with the remedy I have applied to you there is no fear of\r\nan untoward result.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho Panza, who was wishing the goatherd\xe2\x80\x99s loquacity at the devil, on\r\nhis part begged his master to go into Pedro\xe2\x80\x99s hut to sleep. He did so,\r\nand passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his lady Dulcinea,\r\nin imitation of the lovers of Marcela. Sancho Panza settled himself\r\nbetween Rocinante and his ass, and slept, not like a lover who had been\r\ndiscarded, but like a man who had been soundly kicked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc12e.jpg (42K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nIN WHICH IS ENDED THE STORY OF THE SHEPHERDESS MARCELA, WITH OTHER\r\nINCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc13a.jpg (181K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of the\r\neast, when five of the six goatherds came to rouse Don Quixote and tell\r\nhim that if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of\r\nChrysostom they would bear him company. Don Quixote, who desired\r\nnothing better, rose and ordered Sancho to saddle and pannel at once,\r\nwhich he did with all despatch, and with the same they all set out\r\nforthwith. They had not gone a quarter of a league when at the meeting\r\nof two paths they saw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed in\r\nblack sheepskins and with their heads crowned with garlands of cypress\r\nand bitter oleander. Each of them carried a stout holly staff in his\r\nhand, and along with them there came two men of quality on horseback in\r\nhandsome travelling dress, with three servants on foot accompanying\r\nthem. Courteous salutations were exchanged on meeting, and inquiring\r\none of the other which way each party was going, they learned that all\r\nwere bound for the scene of the burial, so they went on all together.\r\n\r\nOne of those on horseback addressing his companion said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nseems to me, Se\xc3\xb1or Vivaldo, that we may reckon as well spent the delay\r\nwe shall incur in seeing this remarkable funeral, for remarkable it\r\ncannot but be judging by the strange things these shepherds have told\r\nus, of both the dead shepherd and homicide shepherdess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I think too,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Vivaldo, \xe2\x80\x9cand I would delay not to say a day,\r\nbut four, for the sake of seeing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote asked them what it was they had heard of Marcela and\r\nChrysostom. The traveller answered that the same morning they had met\r\nthese shepherds, and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion they\r\nhad asked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise; which one\r\nof them gave, describing the strange behaviour and beauty of a\r\nshepherdess called Marcela, and the loves of many who courted her,\r\ntogether with the death of that Chrysostom to whose burial they were\r\ngoing. In short, he repeated all that Pedro had related to Don Quixote.\r\n\r\nThis conversation dropped, and another was commenced by him who was\r\ncalled Vivaldo asking Don Quixote what was the reason that led him to\r\ngo armed in that fashion in a country so peaceful. To which Don Quixote\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cThe pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to go\r\nin any other fashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were invented\r\nfor soft courtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and made\r\nfor those alone whom the world calls knights-errant, of whom I, though\r\nunworthy, am the least of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe instant they heard this all set him down as mad, and the better to\r\nsettle the point and discover what kind of madness his was, Vivaldo\r\nproceeded to ask him what knights-errant meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave not your worships,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cread the annals and\r\nhistories of England, in which are recorded the famous deeds of King\r\nArthur, whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus,\r\nwith regard to whom it is an ancient tradition, and commonly received\r\nall over that kingdom of Great Britain, that this king did not die, but\r\nwas changed by magic art into a raven, and that in process of time he\r\nis to return to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre; for which\r\nreason it cannot be proved that from that time to this any Englishman\r\never killed a raven? Well, then, in the time of this good king that\r\nfamous order of chivalry of the Knights of the Round Table was\r\ninstituted, and the amour of Don Lancelot of the Lake with the Queen\r\nGuinevere occurred, precisely as is there related, the go-between and\r\nconfidante therein being the highly honourable dame Quinta\xc3\xb1ona, whence\r\ncame that ballad so well known and widely spread in our Spain\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nO never surely was there knight\r\nSo served by hand of dame,\r\nAs served was he Sir Lancelot hight\r\nWhen he from Britain came\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nwith all the sweet and delectable course of his achievements in love\r\nand war. Handed down from that time, then, this order of chivalry went\r\non extending and spreading itself over many and various parts of the\r\nworld; and in it, famous and renowned for their deeds, were the mighty\r\nAmadis of Gaul with all his sons and descendants to the fifth\r\ngeneration, and the valiant Felixmarte of Hircania, and the never\r\nsufficiently praised Tirante el Blanco, and in our own days almost we\r\nhave seen and heard and talked with the invincible knight Don Belianis\r\nof Greece. This, then, sirs, is to be a knight-errant, and what I have\r\nspoken of is the order of his chivalry, of which, as I have already\r\nsaid, I, though a sinner, have made profession, and what the aforesaid\r\nknights professed that same do I profess, and so I go through these\r\nsolitudes and wilds seeking adventures, resolved in soul to oppose my\r\narm and person to the most perilous that fortune may offer me in aid of\r\nthe weak and needy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy these words of his the travellers were able to satisfy themselves of\r\nDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s being out of his senses and of the form of madness that\r\novermastered him, at which they felt the same astonishment that all\r\nfelt on first becoming acquainted with it; and Vivaldo, who was a\r\nperson of great shrewdness and of a lively temperament, in order to\r\nbeguile the short journey which they said was required to reach the\r\nmountain, the scene of the burial, sought to give him an opportunity of\r\ngoing on with his absurdities. So he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me,\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Knight-errant, that your worship has made choice of one of the\r\nmost austere professions in the world, and I imagine even that of the\r\nCarthusian monks is not so austere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs austere it may perhaps be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied our Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut so\r\nnecessary for the world I am very much inclined to doubt. For, if the\r\ntruth is to be told, the soldier who executes what his captain orders\r\ndoes no less than the captain himself who gives the order. My meaning,\r\nis, that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare of\r\nthe world, but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray\r\nfor, defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of our\r\nswords, not under shelter but in the open air, a target for the\r\nintolerable rays of the sun in summer and the piercing frosts of\r\nwinter. Thus are we God\xe2\x80\x99s ministers on earth and the arms by which his\r\njustice is done therein. And as the business of war and all that\r\nrelates and belongs to it cannot be conducted without exceeding great\r\nsweat, toil, and exertion, it follows that those who make it their\r\nprofession have undoubtedly more labour than those who in tranquil\r\npeace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to help the weak. I do\r\nnot mean to say, nor does it enter into my thoughts, that the\r\nknight-errant\xe2\x80\x99s calling is as good as that of the monk in his cell; I\r\nwould merely infer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a doubt\r\na more laborious and a more belaboured one, a hungrier and thirstier, a\r\nwretcheder, raggeder, and lousier; for there is no reason to doubt that\r\nthe knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course of their\r\nlives. And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to be\r\nemperors, in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat;\r\nand if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and sages\r\nto help them they would have been completely baulked in their ambition\r\nand disappointed in their hopes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my own opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the traveller; \xe2\x80\x9cbut one thing among\r\nmany others seems to me very wrong in knights-errant, and that is that\r\nwhen they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilous\r\nadventure in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives, they\r\nnever at the moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves to\r\nGod, as is the duty of every good Christian in like peril; instead of\r\nwhich they commend themselves to their ladies with as much devotion as\r\nif these were their gods, a thing which seems to me to savour somewhat\r\nof heathenism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat cannot be on any account omitted,\r\nand the knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise: for it is\r\nusual and customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant, who on\r\nengaging in any great feat of arms has his lady before him, should turn\r\nhis eyes towards her softly and lovingly, as though with them\r\nentreating her to favour and protect him in the hazardous venture he is\r\nabout to undertake, and even though no one hear him, he is bound to say\r\ncertain words between his teeth, commending himself to her with all his\r\nheart, and of this we have innumerable instances in the histories. Nor\r\nis it to be supposed from this that they are to omit commending\r\nthemselves to God, for there will be time and opportunity for doing so\r\nwhile they are engaged in their task.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the traveller, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel some doubt still,\r\nbecause often I have read how words will arise between two\r\nknights-errant, and from one thing to another it comes about that their\r\nanger kindles and they wheel their horses round and take a good stretch\r\nof field, and then without any more ado at the top of their speed they\r\ncome to the charge, and in mid-career they are wont to commend\r\nthemselves to their ladies; and what commonly comes of the encounter is\r\nthat one falls over the haunches of his horse pierced through and\r\nthrough by his antagonist\xe2\x80\x99s lance, and as for the other, it is only by\r\nholding on to the mane of his horse that he can help falling to the\r\nground; but I know not how the dead man had time to commend himself to\r\nGod in the course of such rapid work as this; it would have been better\r\nif those words which he spent in commending himself to his lady in the\r\nmidst of his career had been devoted to his duty and obligation as a\r\nChristian. Moreover, it is my belief that all knights-errant have not\r\nladies to commend themselves to, for they are not all in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote: \xe2\x80\x9cI say it is impossible that\r\nthere could be a knight-errant without a lady, because to such it is as\r\nnatural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: most\r\ncertainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a\r\nknight-errant without an amour, and for the simple reason that without\r\none he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one who\r\nhad gained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood, not by\r\nthe door, but over the wall like a thief and a robber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller, \xe2\x80\x9cif I remember rightly, I think I\r\nhave read that Don Galaor, the brother of the valiant Amadis of Gaul,\r\nnever had any special lady to whom he might commend himself, and yet he\r\nwas not the less esteemed, and was a very stout and famous knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which our Don Quixote made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cSir, one solitary swallow does\r\nnot make summer; moreover, I know that knight was in secret very deeply\r\nin love; besides which, that way of falling in love with all that took\r\nhis fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control. But, in\r\nshort, it is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made mistress\r\nof his will, to whom he commended himself very frequently and very\r\nsecretly, for he prided himself on being a reticent knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen if it be essential that every knight-errant should be in love,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the traveller, \xe2\x80\x9cit may be fairly supposed that your worship is so,\r\nas you are of the order; and if you do not pride yourself on being as\r\nreticent as Don Galaor, I entreat you as earnestly as I can, in the\r\nname of all this company and in my own, to inform us of the name,\r\ncountry, rank, and beauty of your lady, for she will esteem herself\r\nfortunate if all the world knows that she is loved and served by such a\r\nknight as your worship seems to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Don Quixote heaved a deep sigh and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say\r\npositively whether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world\r\nshould know I serve her; I can only say in answer to what has been so\r\ncourteously asked of me, that her name is Dulcinea, her country El\r\nToboso, a village of La Mancha, her rank must be at least that of a\r\nprincess, since she is my queen and lady, and her beauty superhuman,\r\nsince all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which the\r\npoets apply to their ladies are verified in her; for her hairs are\r\ngold, her forehead Elysian fields, her eyebrows rainbows, her eyes\r\nsuns, her cheeks roses, her lips coral, her teeth pearls, her neck\r\nalabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, her fairness snow, and\r\nwhat modesty conceals from sight such, I think and imagine, as rational\r\nreflection can only extol, not compare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should like to know her lineage, race, and ancestry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vivaldo.\r\n\r\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is not of the ancient Roman Curtii,\r\nCaii, or Scipios, nor of the modern Colonnas or Orsini, nor of the\r\nMoncadas or Requesenes of Catalonia, nor yet of the Rebellas or\r\nVillanovas of Valencia; Palafoxes, Nuzas, Rocabertis, Corellas, Lunas,\r\nAlagones, Urreas, Foces, or Gurreas of Aragon; Cerdas, Manriques,\r\nMendozas, or Guzmans of Castile; Alencastros, Pallas, or Meneses of\r\nPortugal; but she is of those of El Toboso of La Mancha, a lineage that\r\nthough modern, may furnish a source of gentle blood for the most\r\nillustrious families of the ages that are to come, and this let none\r\ndispute with me save on the condition that Zerbino placed at the foot\r\nof the trophy of Orlando\xe2\x80\x99s arms, saying,\r\n\r\nThese let none move\r\nWho dareth not his might with Roland prove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough mine is of the Cachopins of Laredo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill not venture to compare it with that of El Toboso of La Mancha,\r\nthough, to tell the truth, no such surname has until now ever reached\r\nmy ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9chas that never reached them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the party went along listening with great attention to the\r\nconversation of the pair, and even the very goatherds and shepherds\r\nperceived how exceedingly out of his wits our Don Quixote was. Sancho\r\nPanza alone thought that what his master said was the truth, knowing\r\nwho he was and having known him from his birth; and all that he felt\r\nany difficulty in believing was that about the fair Dulcinea del\r\nToboso, because neither any such name nor any such princess had ever\r\ncome to his knowledge though he lived so close to El Toboso. They were\r\ngoing along conversing in this way, when they saw descending a gap\r\nbetween two high mountains some twenty shepherds, all clad in\r\nsheepskins of black wool, and crowned with garlands which, as\r\nafterwards appeared, were, some of them of yew, some of cypress. Six of\r\nthe number were carrying a bier covered with a great variety of flowers\r\nand branches, on seeing which one of the goatherds said, \xe2\x80\x9cThose who\r\ncome there are the bearers of Chrysostom\xe2\x80\x99s body, and the foot of that\r\nmountain is the place where he ordered them to bury him.\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\ntherefore made haste to reach the spot, and did so by the time those\r\nwho came had laid the bier upon the ground, and four of them with sharp\r\npickaxes were digging a grave by the side of a hard rock. They greeted\r\neach other courteously, and then Don Quixote and those who accompanied\r\nhim turned to examine the bier, and on it, covered with flowers, they\r\nsaw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd, to all appearance of one\r\nthirty years of age, and showing even in death that in life he had been\r\nof comely features and gallant bearing. Around him on the bier itself\r\nwere laid some books, and several papers open and folded; and those who\r\nwere looking on as well as those who were opening the grave and all the\r\nothers who were there preserved a strange silence, until one of those\r\nwho had borne the body said to another, \xe2\x80\x9cObserve carefully, Ambrosia if\r\nthis is the place Chrysostom spoke of, since you are anxious that what\r\nhe directed in his will should be so strictly complied with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the place,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ambrosia \xe2\x80\x9cfor in it many a time did my\r\npoor friend tell me the story of his hard fortune. Here it was, he told\r\nme, that he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race,\r\nand here, too, for the first time he declared to her his passion, as\r\nhonourable as it was devoted, and here it was that at last Marcela\r\nended by scorning and rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of his\r\nwretched life to a close; here, in memory of misfortunes so great, he\r\ndesired to be laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning to\r\nDon Quixote and the travellers he went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThat body, sirs, on\r\nwhich you are looking with compassionate eyes, was the abode of a soul\r\non which Heaven bestowed a vast share of its riches. That is the body\r\nof Chrysostom, who was unrivalled in wit, unequalled in courtesy,\r\nunapproached in gentle bearing, a ph\xc5\x93nix in friendship, generous\r\nwithout limit, grave without arrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, in\r\nshort, first in all that constitutes goodness and second to none in all\r\nthat makes up misfortune. He loved deeply, he was hated; he adored, he\r\nwas scorned; he wooed a wild beast, he pleaded with marble, he pursued\r\nthe wind, he cried to the wilderness, he served ingratitude, and for\r\nreward was made the prey of death in the mid-course of life, cut short\r\nby a shepherdess whom he sought to immortalise in the memory of man, as\r\nthese papers which you see could fully prove, had he not commanded me\r\nto consign them to the fire after having consigned his body to the\r\nearth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their owner\r\nhimself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vivaldo, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is neither right nor proper to do the\r\nwill of one who enjoins what is wholly unreasonable; it would not have\r\nbeen reasonable in Augustus C\xc3\xa6sar had he permitted the directions left\r\nby the divine Mantuan in his will to be carried into effect. So that,\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Ambrosia while you consign your friend\xe2\x80\x99s body to the earth, you\r\nshould not consign his writings to oblivion, for if he gave the order\r\nin bitterness of heart, it is not right that you should irrationally\r\nobey it. On the contrary, by granting life to those papers, let the\r\ncruelty of Marcela live for ever, to serve as a warning in ages to come\r\nto all men to shun and avoid falling into like danger; or I and all of\r\nus who have come here know already the story of this your love-stricken\r\nand heart-broken friend, and we know, too, your friendship, and the\r\ncause of his death, and the directions he gave at the close of his\r\nlife; from which sad story may be gathered how great was the cruelty of\r\nMarcela, the love of Chrysostom, and the loyalty of your friendship,\r\ntogether with the end awaiting those who pursue rashly the path that\r\ninsane passion opens to their eyes. Last night we learned the death of\r\nChrysostom and that he was to be buried here, and out of curiosity and\r\npity we left our direct road and resolved to come and see with our eyes\r\nthat which when heard of had so moved our compassion, and in\r\nconsideration of that compassion and our desire to prove it if we might\r\nby condolence, we beg of you, excellent Ambrosia, or at least I on my\r\nown account entreat you, that instead of burning those papers you allow\r\nme to carry away some of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd without waiting for the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s answer, he stretched out his\r\nhand and took up some of those that were nearest to him; seeing which\r\nAmbrosio said, \xe2\x80\x9cOut of courtesy, se\xc3\xb1or, I will grant your request as to\r\nthose you have taken, but it is idle to expect me to abstain from\r\nburning the remainder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVivaldo, who was eager to see what the papers contained, opened one of\r\nthem at once, and saw that its title was \xe2\x80\x9cLay of Despair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmbrosio hearing it said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the last paper the unhappy man\r\nwrote; and that you may see, se\xc3\xb1or, to what an end his misfortunes\r\nbrought him, read it so that you may be heard, for you will have time\r\nenough for that while we are waiting for the grave to be dug.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do so very willingly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vivaldo; and as all the bystanders\r\nwere equally eager they gathered round him, and he, reading in a loud\r\nvoice, found that it ran as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc13e.jpg (15K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nWHEREIN ARE INSERTED THE DESPAIRING VERSES OF THE DEAD SHEPHERD,\r\nTOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS NOT LOOKED FOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc14a.jpg (172K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAY OF CHRYSOSTOM\r\n\r\nSince thou dost in thy cruelty desire\r\nThe ruthless rigour of thy tyranny\r\nFrom tongue to tongue, from land to land proclaimed,\r\nThe very Hell will I constrain to lend\r\nThis stricken breast of mine deep notes of woe\r\nTo serve my need of fitting utterance.\r\nAnd as I strive to body forth the tale\r\nOf all I suffer, all that thou hast done,\r\nForth shall the dread voice roll, and bear along\r\nShreds from my vitals torn for greater pain.\r\nThen listen, not to dulcet harmony,\r\nBut to a discord wrung by mad despair\r\nOut of this bosom\xe2\x80\x99s depths of bitterness,\r\nTo ease my heart and plant a sting in thine.\r\n\r\nThe lion\xe2\x80\x99s roar, the fierce wolf\xe2\x80\x99s savage howl,\r\nThe horrid hissing of the scaly snake,\r\nThe awesome cries of monsters yet unnamed,\r\nThe crow\xe2\x80\x99s ill-boding croak, the hollow moan\r\nOf wild winds wrestling with the restless sea,\r\nThe wrathful bellow of the vanquished bull,\r\nThe plaintive sobbing of the widowed dove,\r\nThe envied owl\xe2\x80\x99s sad note, the wail of woe\r\nThat rises from the dreary choir of Hell,\r\nCommingled in one sound, confusing sense,\r\nLet all these come to aid my soul\xe2\x80\x99s complaint,\r\nFor pain like mine demands new modes of song.\r\n\r\nNo echoes of that discord shall be heard\r\nWhere Father Tagus rolls, or on the banks\r\nOf olive-bordered Betis; to the rocks\r\nOr in deep caverns shall my plaint be told,\r\nAnd by a lifeless tongue in living words;\r\nOr in dark valleys or on lonely shores,\r\nWhere neither foot of man nor sunbeam falls;\r\nOr in among the poison-breathing swarms\r\nOf monsters nourished by the sluggish Nile.\r\nFor, though it be to solitudes remote\r\nThe hoarse vague echoes of my sorrows sound\r\nThy matchless cruelty, my dismal fate\r\nShall carry them to all the spacious world.\r\n\r\nDisdain hath power to kill, and patience dies\r\nSlain by suspicion, be it false or true;\r\nAnd deadly is the force of jealousy;\r\nLong absence makes of life a dreary void;\r\nNo hope of happiness can give repose\r\nTo him that ever fears to be forgot;\r\nAnd death, inevitable, waits in hall.\r\nBut I, by some strange miracle, live on\r\nA prey to absence, jealousy, disdain;\r\nRacked by suspicion as by certainty;\r\nForgotten, left to feed my flame alone.\r\nAnd while I suffer thus, there comes no ray\r\nOf hope to gladden me athwart the gloom;\r\nNor do I look for it in my despair;\r\nBut rather clinging to a cureless woe,\r\nAll hope do I abjure for evermore.\r\n\r\nCan there be hope where fear is? Were it well,\r\nWhen far more certain are the grounds of fear?\r\nOught I to shut mine eyes to jealousy,\r\nIf through a thousand heart-wounds it appears?\r\nWho would not give free access to distrust,\r\nSeeing disdain unveiled, and\xe2\x80\x94bitter change!\xe2\x80\x94\r\nAll his suspicions turned to certainties,\r\nAnd the fair truth transformed into a lie?\r\nOh, thou fierce tyrant of the realms of love,\r\nOh, Jealousy! put chains upon these hands,\r\nAnd bind me with thy strongest cord, Disdain.\r\nBut, woe is me! triumphant over all,\r\nMy sufferings drown the memory of you.\r\n\r\nAnd now I die, and since there is no hope\r\nOf happiness for me in life or death,\r\nStill to my fantasy I\xe2\x80\x99ll fondly cling.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll say that he is wise who loveth well,\r\nAnd that the soul most free is that most bound\r\nIn thraldom to the ancient tyrant Love.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll say that she who is mine enemy\r\nIn that fair body hath as fair a mind,\r\nAnd that her coldness is but my desert,\r\nAnd that by virtue of the pain he sends\r\nLove rules his kingdom with a gentle sway.\r\nThus, self-deluding, and in bondage sore,\r\nAnd wearing out the wretched shred of life\r\nTo which I am reduced by her disdain,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll give this soul and body to the winds,\r\nAll hopeless of a crown of bliss in store.\r\n\r\nThou whose injustice hath supplied the cause\r\nThat makes me quit the weary life I loathe,\r\nAs by this wounded bosom thou canst see\r\nHow willingly thy victim I become,\r\nLet not my death, if haply worth a tear,\r\nCloud the clear heaven that dwells in thy bright eyes;\r\nI would not have thee expiate in aught\r\nThe crime of having made my heart thy prey;\r\nBut rather let thy laughter gaily ring\r\nAnd prove my death to be thy festival.\r\nFool that I am to bid thee! well I know\r\nThy glory gains by my untimely end.\r\n\r\nAnd now it is the time; from Hell\xe2\x80\x99s abyss\r\nCome thirsting Tantalus, come Sisyphus\r\nHeaving the cruel stone, come Tityus\r\nWith vulture, and with wheel Ixion come,\r\nAnd come the sisters of the ceaseless toil;\r\nAnd all into this breast transfer their pains,\r\nAnd (if such tribute to despair be due)\r\nChant in their deepest tones a doleful dirge\r\nOver a corse unworthy of a shroud.\r\nLet the three-headed guardian of the gate,\r\nAnd all the monstrous progeny of hell,\r\nThe doleful concert join: a lover dead\r\nMethinks can have no fitter obsequies.\r\n\r\nLay of despair, grieve not when thou art gone\r\nForth from this sorrowing heart: my misery\r\nBrings fortune to the cause that gave thee birth;\r\nThen banish sadness even in the tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cLay of Chrysostom\xe2\x80\x9d met with the approbation of the listeners,\r\nthough the reader said it did not seem to him to agree with what he had\r\nheard of Marcela\xe2\x80\x99s reserve and propriety, for Chrysostom complained in\r\nit of jealousy, suspicion, and absence, all to the prejudice of the\r\ngood name and fame of Marcela; to which Ambrosio replied as one who\r\nknew well his friend\xe2\x80\x99s most secret thoughts, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, to remove that\r\ndoubt I should tell you that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he was\r\naway from Marcela, from whom he had voluntarily separated himself, to\r\ntry if absence would act with him as it is wont; and as everything\r\ndistresses and every fear haunts the banished lover, so imaginary\r\njealousies and suspicions, dreaded as if they were true, tormented\r\nChrysostom; and thus the truth of what report declares of the virtue of\r\nMarcela remains unshaken, and with her envy itself should not and\r\ncannot find any fault save that of being cruel, somewhat haughty, and\r\nvery scornful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vivaldo; and as he was about to read another paper\r\nof those he had preserved from the fire, he was stopped by a marvellous\r\nvision (for such it seemed) that unexpectedly presented itself to their\r\neyes; for on the summit of the rock where they were digging the grave\r\nthere appeared the shepherdess Marcela, so beautiful that her beauty\r\nexceeded its reputation. Those who had never till then beheld her gazed\r\nupon her in wonder and silence, and those who were accustomed to see\r\nher were not less amazed than those who had never seen her before. But\r\nthe instant Ambrosio saw her he addressed her, with manifest\r\nindignation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt thou come, by chance, cruel basilisk of these mountains, to see if\r\nin thy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched being\r\nthy cruelty has robbed of life; or is it to exult over the cruel work\r\nof thy humours that thou art come; or like another pitiless Nero to\r\nlook down from that height upon the ruin of his Rome in embers; or in\r\nthy arrogance to trample on this ill-fated corpse, as the ungrateful\r\ndaughter trampled on her father Tarquin\xe2\x80\x99s? Tell us quickly for what\r\nthou art come, or what it is thou wouldst have, for, as I know the\r\nthoughts of Chrysostom never failed to obey thee in life, I will make\r\nall these who call themselves his friends obey thee, though he be\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come not, Ambrosia for any of the purposes thou hast named,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nMarcela, \xe2\x80\x9cbut to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are all\r\nthose who blame me for their sorrow and for Chrysostom\xe2\x80\x99s death; and\r\ntherefore I ask all of you that are here to give me your attention, for\r\nit will not take much time or many words to bring the truth home to\r\npersons of sense. Heaven has made me, so you say, beautiful, and so\r\nmuch so that in spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me; and\r\nfor the love you show me you say, and even urge, that I am bound to\r\nlove you. By that natural understanding which God has given me I know\r\nthat everything beautiful attracts love, but I cannot see how, by\r\nreason of being loved, that which is loved for its beauty is bound to\r\nlove that which loves it; besides, it may happen that the lover of that\r\nwhich is beautiful may be ugly, and ugliness being detestable, it is\r\nvery absurd to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI love thee because thou art beautiful, thou must\r\nlove me though I be ugly.\xe2\x80\x9d But supposing the beauty equal on both\r\nsides, it does not follow that the inclinations must be therefore\r\nalike, for it is not every beauty that excites love, some but pleasing\r\nthe eye without winning the affection; and if every sort of beauty\r\nexcited love and won the heart, the will would wander vaguely to and\r\nfro unable to make choice of any; for as there is an infinity of\r\nbeautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations, and true\r\nlove, I have heard it said, is indivisible, and must be voluntary and\r\nnot compelled. If this be so, as I believe it to be, why do you desire\r\nme to bend my will by force, for no other reason but that you say you\r\nlove me? Nay\xe2\x80\x94tell me\xe2\x80\x94had Heaven made me ugly, as it has made me\r\nbeautiful, could I with justice complain of you for not loving me?\r\nMoreover, you must remember that the beauty I possess was no choice of\r\nmine, for, be it what it may, Heaven of its bounty gave it me without\r\nmy asking or choosing it; and as the viper, though it kills with it,\r\ndoes not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries, as it is a\r\ngift of nature, neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful; for\r\nbeauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword;\r\nthe one does not burn, the other does not cut, those who do not come\r\ntoo near. Honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind, without\r\nwhich the body, though it be so, has no right to pass for beautiful;\r\nbut if modesty is one of the virtues that specially lend a grace and\r\ncharm to mind and body, why should she who is loved for her beauty part\r\nwith it to gratify one who for his pleasure alone strives with all his\r\nmight and energy to rob her of it? I was born free, and that I might\r\nlive in freedom I chose the solitude of the fields; in the trees of the\r\nmountains I find society, the clear waters of the brooks are my\r\nmirrors, and to the trees and waters I make known my thoughts and\r\ncharms. I am a fire afar off, a sword laid aside. Those whom I have\r\ninspired with love by letting them see me, I have by words undeceived,\r\nand if their longings live on hope\xe2\x80\x94and I have given none to Chrysostom\r\nor to any other\xe2\x80\x94it cannot justly be said that the death of any is my\r\ndoing, for it was rather his own obstinacy than my cruelty that killed\r\nhim; and if it be made a charge against me that his wishes were\r\nhonourable, and that therefore I was bound to yield to them, I answer\r\nthat when on this very spot where now his grave is made he declared to\r\nme his purity of purpose, I told him that mine was to live in perpetual\r\nsolitude, and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits of my\r\nretirement and the spoils of my beauty; and if, after this open avowal,\r\nhe chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind, what\r\nwonder is it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation? If I\r\nhad encouraged him, I should be false; if I had gratified him, I should\r\nhave acted against my own better resolution and purpose. He was\r\npersistent in spite of warning, he despaired without being hated.\r\nBethink you now if it be reasonable that his suffering should be laid\r\nto my charge. Let him who has been deceived complain, let him give way\r\nto despair whose encouraged hopes have proved vain, let him flatter\r\nhimself whom I shall entice, let him boast whom I shall receive; but\r\nlet not him call me cruel or homicide to whom I make no promise, upon\r\nwhom I practise no deception, whom I neither entice nor receive. It has\r\nnot been so far the will of Heaven that I should love by fate, and to\r\nexpect me to love by choice is idle. Let this general declaration serve\r\nfor each of my suitors on his own account, and let it be understood\r\nfrom this time forth that if anyone dies for me it is not of jealousy\r\nor misery he dies, for she who loves no one can give no cause for\r\njealousy to any, and candour is not to be confounded with scorn. Let\r\nhim who calls me wild beast and basilisk, leave me alone as something\r\nnoxious and evil; let him who calls me ungrateful, withhold his\r\nservice; who calls me wayward, seek not my acquaintance; who calls me\r\ncruel, pursue me not; for this wild beast, this basilisk, this\r\nungrateful, cruel, wayward being has no kind of desire to seek, serve,\r\nknow, or follow them. If Chrysostom\xe2\x80\x99s impatience and violent passion\r\nkilled him, why should my modest behaviour and circumspection be\r\nblamed? If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees, why should\r\nhe who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it? I\r\nhave, as you know, wealth of my own, and I covet not that of others; my\r\ntaste is for freedom, and I have no relish for constraint; I neither\r\nlove nor hate anyone; I do not deceive this one or court that, or\r\ntrifle with one or play with another. The modest converse of the\r\nshepherd girls of these hamlets and the care of my goats are my\r\nrecreations; my desires are bounded by these mountains, and if they\r\never wander hence it is to contemplate the beauty of the heavens, steps\r\nby which the soul travels to its primeval abode.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, and not waiting to hear a reply, she turned and\r\npassed into the thickest part of a wood that was hard by, leaving all\r\nwho were there lost in admiration as much of her good sense as of her\r\nbeauty. Some\xe2\x80\x94those wounded by the irresistible shafts launched by her\r\nbright eyes\xe2\x80\x94made as though they would follow her, heedless of the frank\r\ndeclaration they had heard; seeing which, and deeming this a fitting\r\noccasion for the exercise of his chivalry in aid of distressed damsels,\r\nDon Quixote, laying his hand on the hilt of his sword, exclaimed in a\r\nloud and distinct voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet no one, whatever his rank or condition, dare to follow the\r\nbeautiful Marcela, under pain of incurring my fierce indignation. She\r\nhas shown by clear and satisfactory arguments that little or no fault\r\nis to be found with her for the death of Chrysostom, and also how far\r\nshe is from yielding to the wishes of any of her lovers, for which\r\nreason, instead of being followed and persecuted, she should in justice\r\nbe honoured and esteemed by all the good people of the world, for she\r\nshows that she is the only woman in it that holds to such a virtuous\r\nresolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether it was because of the threats of Don Quixote, or because\r\nAmbrosio told them to fulfil their duty to their good friend, none of\r\nthe shepherds moved or stirred from the spot until, having finished the\r\ngrave and burned Chrysostom\xe2\x80\x99s papers, they laid his body in it, not\r\nwithout many tears from those who stood by. They closed the grave with\r\na heavy stone until a slab was ready which Ambrosio said he meant to\r\nhave prepared, with an epitaph which was to be to this effect:\r\n\r\nBeneath the stone before your eyes\r\nThe body of a lover lies;\r\nIn life he was a shepherd swain,\r\nIn death a victim to disdain.\r\nUngrateful, cruel, coy, and fair,\r\nWas she that drove him to despair,\r\nAnd Love hath made her his ally\r\nFor spreading wide his tyranny.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey then strewed upon the grave a profusion of flowers and branches,\r\nand all expressing their condolence with his friend Ambrosio, took\r\ntheir leave. Vivaldo and his companion did the same; and Don Quixote\r\nbade farewell to his hosts and to the travellers, who pressed him to\r\ncome with them to Seville, as being such a convenient place for finding\r\nadventures, for they presented themselves in every street and round\r\nevery corner oftener than anywhere else. Don Quixote thanked them for\r\ntheir advice and for the disposition they showed to do him a favour,\r\nand said that for the present he would not, and must not go to Seville\r\nuntil he had cleared all these mountains of highwaymen and robbers, of\r\nwhom report said they were full. Seeing his good intention, the\r\ntravellers were unwilling to press him further, and once more bidding\r\nhim farewell, they left him and pursued their journey, in the course of\r\nwhich they did not fail to discuss the story of Marcela and Chrysostom\r\nas well as the madness of Don Quixote. He, on his part, resolved to go\r\nin quest of the shepherdess Marcela, and make offer to her of all the\r\nservice he could render her; but things did not fall out with him as he\r\nexpected, according to what is related in the course of this veracious\r\nhistory, of which the Second Part ends here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc14e.jpg (31K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nIN WHICH IS RELATED THE UNFORTUNATE ADVENTURE THAT DON QUIXOTE FELL IN\r\nWITH WHEN HE FELL OUT WITH CERTAIN HEARTLESS YANGUESANS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc15a.jpg (81K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sage Cid Hamete Benengeli relates that as soon as Don Quixote took\r\nleave of his hosts and all who had been present at the burial of\r\nChrysostom, he and his squire passed into the same wood which they had\r\nseen the shepherdess Marcela enter, and after having wandered for more\r\nthan two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her,\r\nthey came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside which\r\nran a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass\r\nthere the hours of the noontide heat, which by this time was beginning\r\nto come on oppressively. Don Quixote and Sancho dismounted, and turning\r\nRocinante and the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in\r\nabundance, they ransacked the alforjas, and without any ceremony very\r\npeacefully and sociably master and man made their repast on what they\r\nfound in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc15b.jpg (376K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSancho had not thought it worth while to hobble Rocinante, feeling\r\nsure, from what he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence,\r\nthat all the mares in the Cordova pastures would not lead him into an\r\nimpropriety. Chance, however, and the devil, who is not always asleep,\r\nso ordained it that feeding in this valley there was a drove of\r\nGalician ponies belonging to certain Yanguesan carriers, whose way it\r\nis to take their midday rest with their teams in places and spots where\r\ngrass and water abound; and that where Don Quixote chanced to be suited\r\nthe Yanguesans\xe2\x80\x99 purpose very well. It so happened, then, that Rocinante\r\ntook a fancy to disport himself with their ladyships the ponies, and\r\nabandoning his usual gait and demeanour as he scented them, he, without\r\nasking leave of his master, got up a briskish little trot and hastened\r\nto make known his wishes to them; they, however, it seemed, preferred\r\ntheir pasture to him, and received him with their heels and teeth to\r\nsuch effect that they soon broke his girths and left him naked without\r\na saddle to cover him; but what must have been worse to him was that\r\nthe carriers, seeing the violence he was offering to their mares, came\r\nrunning up armed with stakes, and so belaboured him that they brought\r\nhim sorely battered to the ground.\r\n\r\nBy this time Don Quixote and Sancho, who had witnessed the drubbing of\r\nRocinante, came up panting, and said Don Quixote to Sancho:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far as I can see, friend Sancho, these are not knights but base\r\nfolk of low birth: I mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in\r\ntaking due vengeance for the insult offered to Rocinante before our\r\neyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil vengeance can we take,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif they are\r\nmore than twenty, and we no more than two, or, indeed, perhaps not more\r\nthan one and a half?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI count for a hundred,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, and without more words he\r\ndrew his sword and attacked the Yanguesans and excited and impelled by\r\nthe example of his master, Sancho did the same; and to begin with, Don\r\nQuixote delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather\r\njerkin he wore, together with a great portion of his shoulder. The\r\nYanguesans, seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were\r\nso many, betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into\r\nthe middle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at\r\nthe second blow they brought Sancho to the ground, and Don Quixote\r\nfared the same way, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing,\r\nand fate willed it that he should fall at the feet of Rocinante, who\r\nhad not yet risen; whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can\r\npound in angry boorish hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc15c.jpg (362K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all the\r\nhaste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving\r\nthe two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.\r\n\r\nSancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his\r\nmaster he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or Don\r\nQuixote, ah, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat wouldst thou, brother Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote in the same\r\nfeeble suffering tone as Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would like, if it were possible,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho Panza, \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nworship to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas,\r\nif it be that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for\r\nbroken bones as well as for wounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of a\r\nknight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise,\r\nI mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its\r\ncunning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our\r\nfeet?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho Panza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor myself I must say I cannot guess how many,\xe2\x80\x9d said the battered\r\nknight Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I take all the blame upon myself, for I had no\r\nbusiness to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights\r\nlike myself, and so I believe that in punishment for having\r\ntransgressed the laws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted this\r\nchastisement to be administered to me; for which reason, brother\r\nSancho, it is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which I\r\nam now about to mention to thee, for it is of much importance to the\r\nwelfare of both of us. It is at when thou shalt see rabble of this sort\r\noffering us insult thou art not to wait till I draw sword against them,\r\nfor I shall not do so at all; but do thou draw sword and chastise them\r\nto thy heart\xe2\x80\x99s content, and if any knights come to their aid and\r\ndefence I will take care to defend thee and assail them with all my\r\nmight; and thou hast already seen by a thousand signs and proofs what\r\nthe might of this strong arm of mine is equal to\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94so uplifted had the\r\npoor gentleman become through the victory over the stout Biscayan.\r\n\r\nBut Sancho did not so fully approve of his master\xe2\x80\x99s admonition as to\r\nlet it pass without saying in reply, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, I am a man of peace, meek\r\nand quiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife and\r\nchildren to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to your\r\nworship, as it cannot be a mandate, that on no account will I draw\r\nsword either against clown or against knight, and that here before God\r\nI forgive the insults that have been offered me, whether they have\r\nbeen, are, or shall be offered me by high or low, rich or poor, noble\r\nor commoner, not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo all which his master said in reply, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had breath enough to\r\nspeak somewhat easily, and that the pain I feel on this side would\r\nabate so as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the mistake thou makest.\r\nCome now, sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto so adverse,\r\nshould turn in our favour, filling the sails of our desires so that\r\nsafely and without impediment we put into port in some one of those\r\nislands I have promised thee, how would it be with thee if on winning\r\nit I made thee lord of it? Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible\r\nthrough not being a knight nor having any desire to be one, nor\r\npossessing the courage nor the will to avenge insults or defend thy\r\nlordship; for thou must know that in newly conquered kingdoms and\r\nprovinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so quiet nor so well\r\ndisposed to the new lord that there is no fear of their making some\r\nmove to change matters once more, and try, as they say, what chance may\r\ndo for them; so it is essential that the new possessor should have good\r\nsense to enable him to govern, and valour to attack and defend himself,\r\nwhatever may befall him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what has now befallen us,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have been well\r\npleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of,\r\nbut I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters than\r\nfor arguments. See if your worship can get up, and let us help\r\nRocinante, though he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause of\r\nall this thrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him to\r\nbe a virtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say right\r\nthat it takes a long time to come to know people, and that there is\r\nnothing sure in this life. Who would have said that, after such mighty\r\nslashes as your worship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was\r\ncoming, travelling post and at the very heels of them, such a great\r\nstorm of sticks as has fallen upon our shoulders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet thine, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cought to be used to such\r\nsqualls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plain\r\nthey must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were not\r\nthat I imagine\xe2\x80\x94why do I say imagine?\xe2\x80\x94know of a certainty that all these\r\nannoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms, I\r\nwould lay me down here to die of pure vexation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this the squire replied, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, as these mishaps are what one reaps\r\nof chivalry, tell me if they happen very often, or if they have their\r\nown fixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that after\r\ntwo harvests we shall be no good for the third, unless God in his\r\ninfinite mercy helps us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow, friend Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the life of\r\nknights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, and\r\nneither more nor less is it within immediate possibility for\r\nknights-errant to become kings and emperors, as experience has shown in\r\nthe case of many different knights with whose histories I am thoroughly\r\nacquainted; and I could tell thee now, if the pain would let me, of\r\nsome who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have\r\nmentioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers\r\nmisfortunes and miseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself\r\nin the power of his mortal enemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is\r\npositively asserted, holding him captive, gave him more than two\r\nhundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied to one of the\r\npillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of\r\nno small authority who says that the Knight of Ph\xc5\x93bus, being caught in\r\na certain pitfall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on\r\nfalling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground,\r\nwhere they administered to him one of those things they call clysters,\r\nof sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him; and if he had not\r\nbeen succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend of his,\r\nit would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I may well suffer\r\nin company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignities\r\nwhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have\r\nthee know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen\r\nby chance to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in\r\nthe law of the duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobbler\r\nstrikes another with the last which he has in his hand, though it be in\r\nfact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he whom he\r\nstruck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst\r\nimagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have\r\ntherefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried, with\r\nwhich they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not one\r\nof them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey gave me no time to see that much,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor hardly\r\nhad I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders\r\nwith their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes\r\nand the strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and\r\nwhere thinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or\r\nnot gives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they\r\nwill remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthere is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain\r\nwhich death does not remove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what greater misfortune can there be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Panza, \xe2\x80\x9cthan the\r\none that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If\r\nour mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters,\r\nit would not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all the\r\nplasters in a hospital almost won\xe2\x80\x99t be enough to put us right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to\r\ndo,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand let us see how Rocinante is, for it\r\nseems to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the\r\nlot of the poor beast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing wonderful in that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9csince he is a\r\nknight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come\r\noff scot-free where we come out scotched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring\r\nrelief to it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cI say so because this little beast\r\nmay now supply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle\r\nwhere I may be cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any\r\ndishonour to be so mounted, for I remember having read how the good old\r\nSilenus, the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he\r\nentered the city of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on\r\na handsome ass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be true that he went mounted as your worship says,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nSancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there is a great difference between going mounted and\r\ngoing slung like a sack of manure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWounds received in battle confer honour\r\ninstead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I\r\ntold thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy\r\nbeast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere\r\nnight come on and surprise us in these wilds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I have heard your worship say,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Panza, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it is\r\nvery meet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that\r\nthey esteem it very good fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen they cannot help it, or when they\r\nare in love; and so true is this that there have been knights who have\r\nremained two years on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the\r\ninclemencies of heaven, without their ladies knowing anything of it;\r\nand one of these was Amadis, when, under the name of Beltenebros, he\r\ntook up his abode on the Pe\xc3\xb1a Pobre for\xe2\x80\x94I know not if it was eight\r\nyears or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; at any\r\nrate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the\r\nPrincess Oriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and\r\nmake haste before a mishap like Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s befalls the ass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very devil would be in it in that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; and letting\r\noff thirty \xe2\x80\x9cohs,\xe2\x80\x9d and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty\r\nmaledictions and execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him\r\nthere, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow\r\nwithout power to bring himself upright, but with all his pains he\r\nsaddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to the\r\nexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for\r\nhim, had he possessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither\r\nSancho nor his master would have been behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc15d.jpg (329K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinante\r\nwith a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he proceeded\r\nmore or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high road\r\nmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from\r\ngood to better, he had not gone a short league when the road came in\r\nsight, and on it he perceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the\r\ndelight of Don Quixote must needs be a castle. Sancho insisted that it\r\nwas an inn, and his master that it was not one, but a castle, and the\r\ndispute lasted so long that before the point was settled they had time\r\nto reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without any\r\nfurther controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc15e.jpg (31K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO\r\nBE A CASTLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc16a.jpg (129K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho\r\nwhat was amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that\r\nhe had fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The\r\ninnkeeper had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her\r\ncalling commonly have, for she was by nature kind-hearted and felt for\r\nthe sufferings of her neighbours, so she at once set about tending Don\r\nQuixote, and made her young daughter, a very comely girl, help her in\r\ntaking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, as servant, an\r\nAsturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of one\r\neye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be\r\nsure, made up for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from\r\nhead to foot, and her shoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made\r\nher contemplate the ground more than she liked. This graceful lass,\r\nthen, helped the young girl, and the two made up a very bad bed for Don\r\nQuixote in a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly served\r\nfor many years as a straw-loft, in which there was also quartered a\r\ncarrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s, and,\r\nthough only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much\r\nthe advantage of it, as Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s consisted simply of four rough\r\nboards on two not very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness\r\nmight have passed for a quilt, full of pellets which, were they not\r\nseen through the rents to be wool, would to the touch have seemed\r\npebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and a coverlet\r\nthe threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without\r\nmissing one in the reckoning.\r\n\r\nOn this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and\r\nher daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while\r\nMaritornes\xe2\x80\x94for that was the name of the Asturian\xe2\x80\x94held the light for\r\nthem, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how full of\r\nwheals Don Quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more the\r\nlook of blows than of a fall.\r\n\r\nIt was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and\r\nprojections, and that each of them had left its mark. \xe2\x80\x9cPray, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, \xe2\x80\x9cmanage to save some tow, as there will be no want of someone\r\nto use it, for my loins too are rather sore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must have fallen too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hostess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not fall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho Panza, \xe2\x80\x9cbut from the shock I got at\r\nseeing my master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a\r\nthousand thwacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may well be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young girl, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it has many a time\r\nhappened to me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never\r\ncoming to the ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as\r\nweak and shaken as if I had really fallen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the point, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho Panza, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I without\r\ndreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with\r\nscarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is the gentleman called?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Maritornes the Asturian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote of La Mancha,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho Panza, \xe2\x80\x9cand he is a\r\nknight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen\r\nin the world this long time past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a knight-adventurer?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you so new in the world as not to know?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho Panza.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing\r\nthat in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most\r\nmiserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two or\r\nthree crowns of kingdoms to give his squire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how is it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hostess, \xe2\x80\x9cthat belonging to so good a master\r\nas this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a\r\ncounty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too soon yet,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we have only been a month\r\ngoing in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that\r\ncan be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for\r\nanother thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of\r\nthis wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would not\r\nchange my hopes for the best title in Spain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively,\r\nand sitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by\r\nthe hand he said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, fair lady, you may call yourself\r\nfortunate in having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, which\r\nis such that if I do not myself praise it, it is because of what is\r\ncommonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you\r\nwho I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on\r\nmy memory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my\r\ngratitude while life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me\r\nnot so enthralled and subject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair\r\ningrate whom I name between my teeth, but that those of this lovely\r\ndamsel might be the masters of my liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in\r\nbewilderment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood\r\nabout as much of them as if he had been talking Greek, though they\r\ncould perceive they were all meant for expressions of good-will and\r\nblandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind of language, they\r\nstared at him and wondered to themselves, for he seemed to them a man\r\nof a different sort from those they were used to, and thanking him in\r\npothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gave\r\nher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.\r\n\r\nThe carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night,\r\nand she had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the\r\nfamily asleep she would come in search of him and meet his wishes\r\nunreservedly. And it is said of this good lass that she never made\r\npromises of the kind without fulfilling them, even though she made them\r\nin a forest and without any witness present, for she plumed herself\r\ngreatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an\r\nemployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and\r\nill-luck had brought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched,\r\nrickety bed of Don Quixote stood first in the middle of this star-lit\r\nstable, and close beside it Sancho made his, which merely consisted of\r\na rush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas\r\nrather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that of the carrier,\r\nmade up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings of\r\nthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek,\r\nplump, and in prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of\r\nAr\xc3\xa9valo, according to the author of this history, who particularly\r\nmentions this carrier because he knew him very well, and they even say\r\nwas in some degree a relation of his; besides which Cid Hamete\r\nBenengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in all things,\r\nas is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that\r\nhave been already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they\r\nmight be, an example that might be followed by those grave historians\r\nwho relate transactions so curtly and briefly that we hardly get a\r\ntaste of them, all the substance of the work being left in the inkstand\r\nfrom carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thousand blessings on\r\nthe author of \xe2\x80\x9cTablante de Ricamonte\xe2\x80\x9d and that of the other book in\r\nwhich the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what\r\nminuteness they describe everything!\r\n\r\nTo proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them\r\ntheir second feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles\r\nand lay waiting for his conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this\r\ntime plastered and had lain down, and though he strove to sleep the\r\npain of his ribs would not let him, while Don Quixote with the pain of\r\nhis had his eyes as wide open as a hare\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc16b.jpg (333K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inn was all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light\r\nexcept that given by a lantern that hung burning in the middle of the\r\ngateway. This strange stillness, and the thoughts, always present to\r\nour knight\xe2\x80\x99s mind, of the incidents described at every turn in the\r\nbooks that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to his\r\nimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which\r\nwas that he fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as\r\nhas been said, all the inns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and\r\nthat the daughter of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the\r\ncastle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing, had fallen in love\r\nwith him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while that night\r\nwithout the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that\r\nhe had constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to\r\nconsider the perilous risk which his virtue was about to encounter, and\r\nhe resolved in his heart to commit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del\r\nToboso, even though the queen Guinevere herself and the dame Quinta\xc3\xb1ona\r\nshould present themselves before him.\r\n\r\nWhile he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x94an unlucky one for him\xe2\x80\x94arrived for the Asturian to come, who in\r\nher smock, with bare feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif,\r\nwith noiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the three\r\nwere quartered, in quest of the carrier; but scarcely had she gained\r\nthe door when Don Quixote perceived her, and sitting up in his bed in\r\nspite of his plasters and the pain of his ribs, he stretched out his\r\narms to receive his beauteous damsel. The Asturian, who went all\r\ndoubled up and in silence with her hands before her feeling for her\r\nlover, encountered the arms of Don Quixote, who grasped her tightly by\r\nthe wrist, and drawing her towards him, while she dared not utter a\r\nword, made her sit down on the bed. He then felt her smock, and\r\nalthough it was of sackcloth it appeared to him to be of the finest and\r\nsoftest silk: on her wrists she wore some glass beads, but to him they\r\nhad the sheen of precious Orient pearls: her hair, which in some\r\nmeasure resembled a horse\xe2\x80\x99s mane, he rated as threads of the brightest\r\ngold of Araby, whose refulgence dimmed the sun himself: her breath,\r\nwhich no doubt smelt of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s stale salad, seemed to him to\r\ndiffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her mouth; and, in short, he\r\ndrew her portrait in his imagination with the same features and in the\r\nsame style as that which he had seen in his books of the other\r\nprincesses who, smitten by love, came with all the adornments that are\r\nhere set down, to see the sorely wounded knight; and so great was the\r\npoor gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s blindness that neither touch, nor smell, nor anything\r\nelse about the good lass that would have made any but a carrier vomit,\r\nwere enough to undeceive him; on the contrary, he was persuaded he had\r\nthe goddess of beauty in his arms, and holding her firmly in his grasp\r\nhe went on to say in low, tender voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould that found myself, lovely and exalted lady, in a position to\r\nrepay such a favour as that which you, by the sight of your great\r\nbeauty, have granted me; but fortune, which is never weary of\r\npersecuting the good, has chosen to place me upon this bed, where I lie\r\nso bruised and broken that though my inclination would gladly comply\r\nwith yours it is impossible; besides, to this impossibility another yet\r\ngreater is to be added, which is the faith that I have pledged to the\r\npeerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole lady of my most secret thoughts; and\r\nwere it not that this stood in the way I should not be so insensible a\r\nknight as to miss the happy opportunity which your great goodness has\r\noffered me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held so fast by\r\nDon Quixote, and not understanding or heeding the words he addressed to\r\nher, she strove without speaking to free herself. The worthy carrier,\r\nwhose unholy thoughts kept him awake, was aware of his doxy the moment\r\nshe entered the door, and was listening attentively to all Don Quixote\r\nsaid; and jealous that the Asturian should have broken her word with\r\nhim for another, drew nearer to Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s bed and stood still to\r\nsee what would come of this talk which he could not understand; but\r\nwhen he perceived the wench struggling to get free and Don Quixote\r\nstriving to hold her, not relishing the joke he raised his arm and\r\ndelivered such a terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knight\r\nthat he bathed all his mouth in blood, and not content with this he\r\nmounted on his ribs and with his feet tramped all over them at a pace\r\nrather smarter than a trot. The bed which was somewhat crazy and not\r\nvery firm on its feet, unable to support the additional weight of the\r\ncarrier, came to the ground, and at the mighty crash of this the\r\ninnkeeper awoke and at once concluded that it must be some brawl of\r\nMaritornes\xe2\x80\x99, because after calling loudly to her he got no answer. With\r\nthis suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp hastened to the quarter\r\nwhere he had heard the disturbance. The wench, seeing that her master\r\nwas coming and knowing that his temper was terrible, frightened and\r\npanic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept, and\r\ncrouching upon it made a ball of herself.\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper came in exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere art thou, strumpet? Of course\r\nthis is some of thy work.\xe2\x80\x9d At this Sancho awoke, and feeling this mass\r\nalmost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began to\r\ndistribute fisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell upon\r\nMaritornes, who, irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paid\r\nback so many in return to Sancho that she woke him up in spite of\r\nhimself. He then, finding himself so handled, by whom he knew not,\r\nraising himself up as well as he could, grappled with Maritornes, and\r\nhe and she between them began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in\r\nthe world. The carrier, however, perceiving by the light of the\r\ninnkeeper candle how it fared with his ladylove, quitting Don Quixote,\r\nran to bring her the help she needed; and the innkeeper did the same\r\nbut with a different intention, for his was to chastise the lass, as he\r\nbelieved that beyond a doubt she alone was the cause of all the\r\nharmony. And so, as the saying is, cat to rat, rat to rope, rope to\r\nstick, the carrier pounded Sancho, Sancho the lass, she him, and the\r\ninnkeeper her, and all worked away so briskly that they did not give\r\nthemselves a moment\xe2\x80\x99s rest; and the best of it was that the innkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlamp went out, and as they were left in the dark they all laid on one\r\nupon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a sound\r\nspot left where a hand could light.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn a\r\ncaudrillero of what they call the Old Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who,\r\nalso hearing the extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staff\r\nand the tin case with his warrants, and made his way in the dark into\r\nthe room crying: \xe2\x80\x9cHold! in the name of the Jurisdiction! Hold! in the\r\nname of the Holy Brotherhood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first that he came upon was the pummelled Don Quixote, who lay\r\nstretched senseless on his back upon his broken-down bed, and, his hand\r\nfalling on the beard as he felt about, he continued to cry, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp for\r\nthe Jurisdiction!\xe2\x80\x9d but perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of did\r\nnot move or stir, he concluded that he was dead and that those in the\r\nroom were his murderers, and with this suspicion he raised his voice\r\nstill higher, calling out, \xe2\x80\x9cShut the inn gate; see that no one goes\r\nout; they have killed a man here!\xe2\x80\x9d This cry startled them all, and each\r\ndropped the contest at the point at which the voice reached him. The\r\ninnkeeper retreated to his room, the carrier to his pack-saddles, the\r\nlass to her crib; the unlucky Don Quixote and Sancho alone were unable\r\nto move from where they were. The cuadrillero on this let go Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s beard, and went out to look for a light to search for and\r\napprehend the culprits; but not finding one, as the innkeeper had\r\npurposely extinguished the lantern on retreating to his room, he was\r\ncompelled to have recourse to the hearth, where after much time and\r\ntrouble he lit another lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc16e.jpg (32K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nIN WHICH ARE CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DON\r\nQUIXOTE AND HIS GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA ENDURED IN THE INN, WHICH TO\r\nHIS MISFORTUNE HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc17a.jpg (87K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time Don Quixote had recovered from his swoon; and in the same\r\ntone of voice in which he had called to his squire the day before when\r\nhe lay stretched \xe2\x80\x9cin the vale of the stakes,\xe2\x80\x9d he began calling to him\r\nnow, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho, my friend, art thou asleep? sleepest thou, friend\r\nSancho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I sleep, curses on it!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho discontentedly and\r\nbitterly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it is plain that all the devils have been at me this\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou mayest well believe that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause, either\r\nI know little, or this castle is enchanted, for thou must know\xe2\x80\x94but this\r\nthat I am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until\r\nafter my death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say so,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I hate taking away anyone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I swear to hold my tongue about it till\r\nthe end of your worship\xe2\x80\x99s days, and God grant I may be able to let it\r\nout to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I do thee such injuries, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat thou\r\nwouldst see me dead so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not for that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut because I hate keeping\r\nthings long, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to grow rotten with me from\r\nover-keeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI have more confidence in thy\r\naffection and good nature; and so I would have thee know that this\r\nnight there befell me one of the strangest adventures that I could\r\ndescribe, and to relate it to thee briefly thou must know that a little\r\nwhile ago the daughter of the lord of this castle came to me, and that\r\nshe is the most elegant and beautiful damsel that could be found in the\r\nwide world. What I could tell thee of the charms of her person! of her\r\nlively wit! of other secret matters which, to preserve the fealty I owe\r\nto my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, I shall pass over unnoticed and in\r\nsilence! I will only tell thee that, either fate being envious of so\r\ngreat a boon placed in my hands by good fortune, or perhaps (and this\r\nis more probable) this castle being, as I have already said, enchanted,\r\nat the time when I was engaged in the sweetest and most amorous\r\ndiscourse with her, there came, without my seeing or knowing whence it\r\ncame, a hand attached to some arm of some huge giant, that planted such\r\na cuff on my jaws that I have them all bathed in blood, and then\r\npummelled me in such a way that I am in a worse plight than yesterday\r\nwhen the carriers, on account of Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s misbehaviour, inflicted on\r\nus the injury thou knowest of; whence conjecture that there must be\r\nsome enchanted Moor guarding the treasure of this damsel\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, and\r\nthat it is not for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for me either,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor more than four hundred Moors\r\nhave so thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes and\r\nfancy-bread to it. But tell me, se\xc3\xb1or, what do you call this excellent\r\nand rare adventure that has left us as we are left now? Though your\r\nworship was not so badly off, having in your arms that incomparable\r\nbeauty you spoke of; but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacks\r\nI think I had in all my life? Unlucky me and the mother that bore me!\r\nfor I am not a knight-errant and never expect to be one, and of all the\r\nmishaps, the greater part falls to my share.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen thou hast been thrashed too?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I say so? worse luck to my line!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe not distressed, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I will now make the\r\nprecious balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of\r\nan eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and\r\ncame in to see the man that he thought had been killed; and as Sancho\r\ncaught sight of him at the door, seeing him coming in his shirt, with a\r\ncloth on his head, and a lamp in his hand, and a very forbidding\r\ncountenance, he said to his master, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, can it be that this is the\r\nenchanted Moor coming back to give us more castigation if there be\r\nanything still left in the ink-bottle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be the Moor,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor those under\r\nenchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they don\xe2\x80\x99t let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cif not, let my shoulders speak to the point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine could speak too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is not a sufficient\r\nreason for believing that what we see is the enchanted Moor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer came up, and finding them engaged in such a peaceful\r\nconversation, stood amazed; though Don Quixote, to be sure, still lay\r\non his back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters. The\r\nofficer turned to him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how goes it, good man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would speak more politely if I were you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nit the way of this country to address knights-errant in that style, you\r\nbooby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a\r\nsorry-looking individual, lost his temper, and raising the lamp full of\r\noil, smote Don Quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave him\r\na badly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, and\r\nSancho Panza said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat is certainly the enchanted Moor, Se\xc3\xb1or, and he\r\nkeeps the treasure for others, and for us only the cuffs and\r\nlamp-whacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand there is no use in\r\ntroubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or\r\nvexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no\r\none on whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thou\r\ncanst, and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him to give me a\r\nlittle oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam,\r\nfor indeed I believe I have great need of it now, because I am losing\r\nmuch blood from the wound that phantom gave me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho got up with pain enough in his bones, and went after the\r\ninnkeeper in the dark, and meeting the officer, who was looking to see\r\nwhat had become of his enemy, he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, whoever you are,\r\ndo us the favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt,\r\nand wine, for it is wanted to cure one of the best knights-errant on\r\nearth, who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted\r\nMoor that is in this inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a man out\r\nof his senses, and as day was now beginning to break, he opened the inn\r\ngate, and calling the host, he told him what this good man wanted. The\r\nhost furnished him with what he required, and Sancho brought it to Don\r\nQuixote, who, with his hand to his head, was bewailing the pain of the\r\nblow of the lamp, which had done him no more harm than raising a couple\r\nof rather large lumps, and what he fancied blood was only the sweat\r\nthat flowed from him in his sufferings during the late storm. To be\r\nbrief, he took the materials, of which he made a compound, mixing them\r\nall and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had come\r\nto perfection. He then asked for some vial to pour it into, and as\r\nthere was not one in the inn, he decided on putting it into a tin\r\noil-bottle or flask of which the host made him a free gift; and over\r\nthe flask he repeated more than eighty paternosters and as many more\r\nave-marias, salves, and credos, accompanying each word with a cross by\r\nway of benediction, at all which there were present Sancho, the\r\ninnkeeper, and the cuadrillero; for the carrier was now peacefully\r\nengaged in attending to the comfort of his mules.\r\n\r\nThis being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial himself, on the\r\nspot, of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he considered it, and\r\nso he drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and\r\nremained in the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely had\r\nhe done drinking when he began to vomit in such a way that nothing was\r\nleft in his stomach, and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he broke\r\ninto a profuse sweat, on account of which he bade them cover him up and\r\nleave him alone. They did so, and he lay sleeping more than three\r\nhours, at the end of which he awoke and felt very great bodily relief\r\nand so much ease from his bruises that he thought himself quite cured,\r\nand verily believed he had hit upon the balsam of Fierabras; and that\r\nwith this remedy he might thenceforward, without any fear, face any\r\nkind of destruction, battle, or combat, however perilous it might be.\r\n\r\nSancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as\r\nmiraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which\r\nwas no small quantity. Don Quixote consented, and he, taking it with\r\nboth hands, in good faith and with a better will, gulped down and\r\ndrained off very little less than his master. But the fact is, that the\r\nstomach of poor Sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of his\r\nmaster, and so, before vomiting, he was seized with such gripings and\r\nretchings, and such sweats and faintness, that verily and truly he\r\nbelieved his last hour had come, and finding himself so racked and\r\ntormented he cursed the balsam and the thief that had given it to him.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote seeing him in this state said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my belief, Sancho,\r\nthat this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I am\r\npersuaded this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your worship knew that,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwoe betide me and all my\r\nkindred!\xe2\x80\x94why did you let me taste it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began to\r\ndischarge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had\r\nthrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit for\r\nnothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and\r\nconvulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his end\r\nhad come. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the\r\nend of which he was left, not like his master, but so weak and\r\nexhausted that he could not stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as has\r\nbeen said, felt himself relieved and well, was eager to take his\r\ndeparture at once in quest of adventures, as it seemed to him that all\r\nthe time he loitered there was a fraud upon the world and those in it\r\nwho stood in need of his help and protection, all the more when he had\r\nthe security and confidence his balsam afforded him; and so, urged by\r\nthis impulse, he saddled Rocinante himself and put the pack-saddle on\r\nhis squire\xe2\x80\x99s beast, whom likewise he helped to dress and mount the ass;\r\nafter which he mounted his horse and turning to a corner of the inn he\r\nlaid hold of a pike that stood there, to serve him by way of a lance.\r\nAll that were in the inn, who were more than twenty persons, stood\r\nwatching him; the innkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was likewise observing him, and\r\nhe too never took his eyes off her, and from time to time fetched a\r\nsigh that he seemed to pluck up from the depths of his bowels; but they\r\nall thought it must be from the pain he felt in his ribs; at any rate\r\nthey who had seen him plastered the night before thought so.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called to\r\nthe host and said in a very grave and measured voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMany and great\r\nare the favours, Se\xc3\xb1or Alcaide, that I have received in this castle of\r\nyours, and I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you\r\nfor them all the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging you\r\nof any arrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling is\r\nno other than to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and to\r\nchastise perfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of this\r\nkind you need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of\r\nknighthood which I have received to procure you satisfaction and\r\nreparation to the utmost of your desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness, \xe2\x80\x9cSir Knight, I do not\r\nwant your worship to avenge me of any wrong, because when any is done\r\nme I can take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing I want is\r\nthat you pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night,\r\nas well for the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for supper and\r\nbeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc16c.jpg (326K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen this is an inn?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a very respectable one,\xe2\x80\x9d said the innkeeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been under a mistake all this time,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nin truth I thought it was a castle, and not a bad one; but since it\r\nappears that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now is\r\nthat you should excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule of\r\nknights-errant, of whom I know as a fact (and up to the present I have\r\nread nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging or\r\nanything else in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality that\r\nmight be offered them is their due by law and right in return for the\r\ninsufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by\r\nday, in summer and in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and\r\nthirst, cold and heat, exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and\r\nall the hardships of earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have little to do with that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the innkeeper; \xe2\x80\x9cpay me what\r\nyou owe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all I care\r\nabout is to get my money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, and putting\r\nspurs to Rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out of\r\nthe inn before anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distance\r\nwithout looking to see if his squire was following him.\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get payment\r\nof Sancho, who said that as his master would not pay neither would he,\r\nbecause, being as he was squire to a knight-errant, the same rule and\r\nreason held good for him as for his master with regard to not paying\r\nanything in inns and hostelries. At this the innkeeper waxed very\r\nwroth, and threatened if he did not pay to compel him in a way that he\r\nwould not like. To which Sancho made answer that by the law of chivalry\r\nhis master had received he would not pay a rap, though it cost him his\r\nlife; for the excellent and ancient usage of knights-errant was not\r\ngoing to be violated by him, nor should the squires of such as were yet\r\nto come into the world ever complain of him or reproach him with\r\nbreaking so just a privilege.\r\n\r\nThe ill-luck of the unfortunate Sancho so ordered it that among the\r\ncompany in the inn there were four woolcarders from Segovia, three\r\nneedle-makers from the Colt of Cordova, and two lodgers from the Fair\r\nof Seville, lively fellows, tender-hearted, fond of a joke, and\r\nplayful, who, almost as if instigated and moved by a common impulse,\r\nmade up to Sancho and dismounted him from his ass, while one of them\r\nwent in for the blanket of the host\xe2\x80\x99s bed; but on flinging him into it\r\nthey looked up, and seeing that the ceiling was somewhat lower than\r\nwhat they required for their work, they decided upon going out into the\r\nyard, which was bounded by the sky, and there, putting Sancho in the\r\nmiddle of the blanket, they began to raise him high, making sport with\r\nhim as they would with a dog at Shrovetide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc16d.jpg (285K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached\r\nthe ears of his master, who, halting to listen attentively, was\r\npersuaded that some new adventure was coming, until he clearly\r\nperceived that it was his squire who uttered them. Wheeling about he\r\ncame up to the inn with a laborious gallop, and finding it shut went\r\nround it to see if he could find some way of getting in; but as soon as\r\nhe came to the wall of the yard, which was not very high, he discovered\r\nthe game that was being played with his squire. He saw him rising and\r\nfalling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that, had his rage\r\nallowed him, it is my belief he would have laughed. He tried to climb\r\nfrom his horse on to the top of the wall, but he was so bruised and\r\nbattered that he could not even dismount; and so from the back of his\r\nhorse he began to utter such maledictions and objurgations against\r\nthose who were blanketing Sancho as it would be impossible to write\r\ndown accurately: they, however, did not stay their laughter or their\r\nwork for this, nor did the flying Sancho cease his lamentations,\r\nmingled now with threats, now with entreaties but all to little\r\npurpose, or none at all, until from pure weariness they left off. They\r\nthen brought him his ass, and mounting him on top of it they put his\r\njacket round him; and the compassionate Maritornes, seeing him so\r\nexhausted, thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water, and that it\r\nmight be all the cooler she fetched it from the well. Sancho took it,\r\nand as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of\r\nhis master exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho, my son, drink not water; drink it not,\r\nmy son, for it will kill thee; see, here I have the blessed balsam (and\r\nhe held up the flask of liquor), and with drinking two drops of it thou\r\nwilt certainly be restored.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words Sancho turned his eyes asquint, and in a still louder\r\nvoice said, \xe2\x80\x9cCan it be your worship has forgotten that I am not a\r\nknight, or do you want me to end by vomiting up what bowels I have left\r\nafter last night? Keep your liquor in the name of all the devils, and\r\nleave me to myself!\xe2\x80\x9d and at one and the same instant he left off\r\ntalking and began drinking; but as at the first sup he perceived it was\r\nwater he did not care to go on with it, and begged Maritornes to fetch\r\nhim some wine, which she did with right good will, and paid for it with\r\nher own money; for indeed they say of her that, though she was in that\r\nline of life, there was some faint and distant resemblance to a\r\nChristian about her. When Sancho had done drinking he dug his heels\r\ninto his ass, and the gate of the inn being thrown open he passed out\r\nvery well pleased at having paid nothing and carried his point, though\r\nit had been at the expense of his usual sureties, his shoulders. It is\r\ntrue that the innkeeper detained his alforjas in payment of what was\r\nowing to him, but Sancho took his departure in such a flurry that he\r\nnever missed them. The innkeeper, as soon as he saw him off, wanted to\r\nbar the gate close, but the blanketers would not agree to it, for they\r\nwere fellows who would not have cared two farthings for Don Quixote,\r\neven had he been really one of the knights-errant of the Round Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc17e.jpg (47K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nIN WHICH IS RELATED THE DISCOURSE SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS MASTER,\r\nDON QUIXOTE, AND OTHER ADVENTURES WORTH RELATING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc18a.jpg (79K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSancho reached his master so limp and faint that he could not urge on\r\nhis beast. When Don Quixote saw the state he was in he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nnow come to the conclusion, good Sancho, that this castle or inn is\r\nbeyond a doubt enchanted, because those who have so atrociously\r\ndiverted themselves with thee, what can they be but phantoms or beings\r\nof another world? and I hold this confirmed by having noticed that when\r\nI was by the wall of the yard witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy,\r\nit was out of my power to mount upon it, nor could I even dismount from\r\nRocinante, because they no doubt had me enchanted; for I swear to thee\r\nby the faith of what I am that if I had been able to climb up or\r\ndismount, I would have avenged thee in such a way that those braggart\r\nthieves would have remembered their freak for ever, even though in so\r\ndoing I knew that I contravened the laws of chivalry, which, as I have\r\noften told thee, do not permit a knight to lay hands on him who is not\r\none, save in case of urgent and great necessity in defence of his own\r\nlife and person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have avenged myself too if I could,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether I\r\nhad been dubbed knight or not, but I could not; though for my part I am\r\npersuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms or\r\nenchanted men, as your worship says, but men of flesh and bone like\r\nourselves; and they all had their names, for I heard them name them\r\nwhen they were tossing me, and one was called Pedro Martinez, and\r\nanother Tenorio Hernandez, and the innkeeper, I heard, was called Juan\r\nPalomeque the Left-handed; so that, se\xc3\xb1or, your not being able to leap\r\nover the wall of the yard or dismount from your horse came of something\r\nelse besides enchantments; and what I make out clearly from all this\r\nis, that these adventures we go seeking will in the end lead us into\r\nsuch misadventures that we shall not know which is our right foot; and\r\nthat the best and wisest thing, according to my small wits, would be\r\nfor us to return home, now that it is harvest-time, and attend to our\r\nbusiness, and give over wandering from Zeca to Mecca and from pail to\r\nbucket, as the saying is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow little thou knowest about chivalry, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chold thy peace and have patience; the day will come when thou shalt\r\nsee with thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in the\r\npursuit of this calling; nay, tell me, what greater pleasure can there\r\nbe in the world, or what delight can equal that of winning a battle,\r\nand triumphing over one\xe2\x80\x99s enemy? None, beyond all doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I do not know it; all I know is\r\nthat since we have been knights-errant, or since your worship has been\r\none (for I have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable a\r\nnumber) we have never won any battle except the one with the Biscayan,\r\nand even out of that your worship came with half an ear and half a\r\nhelmet the less; and from that till now it has been all cudgellings and\r\nmore cudgellings, cuffs and more cuffs, I getting the blanketing over\r\nand above, and falling in with enchanted persons on whom I cannot\r\navenge myself so as to know what the delight, as your worship calls it,\r\nof conquering an enemy is like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what vexes me, and what ought to vex thee, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nDon Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut henceforward I will endeavour to have at hand some\r\nsword made by such craft that no kind of enchantments can take effect\r\nupon him who carries it, and it is even possible that fortune may\r\nprocure for me that which belonged to Amadis when he was called \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nKnight of the Burning Sword,\xe2\x80\x99 which was one of the best swords that\r\never knight in the world possessed, for, besides having the said\r\nvirtue, it cut like a razor, and there was no armour, however strong\r\nand enchanted it might be, that could resist it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch is my luck,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat even if that happened and your\r\nworship found some such sword, it would, like the balsam, turn out\r\nserviceable and good for dubbed knights only, and as for the squires,\r\nthey might sup sorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFear not that, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote: \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven will deal better by\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus talking, Don Quixote and his squire were going along, when, on the\r\nroad they were following, Don Quixote perceived approaching them a\r\nlarge and thick cloud of dust, on seeing which he turned to Sancho and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the day, Sancho, on which will be seen the boon my fortune is\r\nreserving for me; this, I say, is the day on which as much as on any\r\nother shall be displayed the might of my arm, and on which I shall do\r\ndeeds that shall remain written in the book of fame for all ages to\r\ncome. Seest thou that cloud of dust which rises yonder? Well, then, all\r\nthat is churned up by a vast army composed of various and countless\r\nnations that comes marching there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to that there must be two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor on this\r\nopposite side also there rises just such another cloud of dust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote turned to look and found that it was true, and rejoicing\r\nexceedingly, he concluded that they were two armies about to engage and\r\nencounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at all times and\r\nseasons his fancy was full of the battles, enchantments, adventures,\r\ncrazy feats, loves, and defiances that are recorded in the books of\r\nchivalry, and everything he said, thought, or did had reference to such\r\nthings. Now the cloud of dust he had seen was raised by two great\r\ndroves of sheep coming along the same road in opposite directions,\r\nwhich, because of the dust, did not become visible until they drew\r\nnear, but Don Quixote asserted so positively that they were armies that\r\nSancho was led to believe it and say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what are we to do,\r\nse\xc3\xb1or?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc17b.jpg (339K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote: \xe2\x80\x9cgive aid and assistance to the weak and\r\nthose who need it; and thou must know, Sancho, that this which comes\r\nopposite to us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor Alifanfaron,\r\nlord of the great isle of Trapobana; this other that marches behind me\r\nis that of his enemy the king of the Garamantas, Pentapolin of the Bare\r\nArm, for he always goes into battle with his right arm bare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why are these two lords such enemies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are at enmity,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause this Alifanfaron is\r\na furious pagan and is in love with the daughter of Pentapolin, who is\r\na very beautiful and moreover gracious lady, and a Christian, and her\r\nfather is unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first\r\nabandons the religion of his false prophet Mahomet, and adopts his\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my beard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut Pentapolin does quite right, and I\r\nwill help him as much as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that thou wilt do what is thy duty, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nto engage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbed\r\nknight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I can well understand,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut where shall we put\r\nthis ass where we may be sure to find him after the fray is over? for I\r\nbelieve it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast\r\nof this kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand what you had best do with him is\r\nto leave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not, for the\r\nhorses we shall have when we come out victors will be so many that even\r\nRocinante will run a risk of being changed for another. But attend to\r\nme and observe, for I wish to give thee some account of the chief\r\nknights who accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the better\r\nsee and mark, let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder,\r\nwhence both armies may be seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did so, and placed themselves on a rising ground from which the\r\ntwo droves that Don Quixote made armies of might have been plainly seen\r\nif the clouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded the\r\nsight; nevertheless, seeing in his imagination what he did not see and\r\nwhat did not exist, he began thus in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears upon\r\nhis shield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is the\r\nvaliant Laurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in armour with\r\nflowers of gold, who bears on his shield three crowns argent on an\r\nazure field, is the dreaded Micocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; that\r\nother of gigantic frame, on his right hand, is the ever dauntless\r\nBrandabarbaran de Boliche, lord of the three Arabias, who for armour\r\nwears that serpent skin, and has for shield a gate which, according to\r\ntradition, is one of those of the temple that Samson brought to the\r\nground when by his death he revenged himself upon his enemies. But turn\r\nthine eyes to the other side, and thou shalt see in front and in the\r\nvan of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquished Timonel\r\nof Carcajona, prince of New Biscay, who comes in armour with arms\r\nquartered azure, vert, white, and yellow, and bears on his shield a cat\r\nor on a field tawny with a motto which says _Miau_, which is the\r\nbeginning of the name of his lady, who according to report is the\r\npeerless Miaulina, daughter of the duke Alfeniquen of the Algarve; the\r\nother, who burdens and presses the loins of that powerful charger and\r\nbears arms white as snow and a shield blank and without any device, is\r\na novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by name, lord of\r\nthe baronies of Utrique; that other, who with iron-shod heels strikes\r\nthe flanks of that nimble parti-coloured zebra, and for arms bears\r\nazure vair, is the mighty duke of Nerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque,\r\nwho bears for device on his shield an asparagus plant with a motto in\r\nCastilian that says, _\xe2\x80\x98Rastrea mi suerte\xe2\x80\x99_.\xe2\x80\x9d And so he went on naming a\r\nnumber of knights of one squadron or the other out of his imagination,\r\nand to all he assigned off-hand their arms, colours, devices, and\r\nmottoes, carried away by the illusions of his unheard-of craze; and\r\nwithout a pause, he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople of divers nations compose this\r\nsquadron in front; here are those that drink of the sweet waters of the\r\nfamous Xanthus, those that scour the woody Massilian plains, those that\r\nsift the pure fine gold of Arabia Felix, those that enjoy the famed\r\ncool banks of the crystal Thermodon, those that in many and various\r\nways divert the streams of the golden Pactolus, the Numidians,\r\nfaithless in their promises, the Persians renowned in archery, the\r\nParthians and the Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that ever\r\nshift their dwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, the\r\nEthiopians with pierced lips, and an infinity of other nations whose\r\nfeatures I recognise and descry, though I cannot recall their names. In\r\nthis other squadron there come those that drink of the crystal streams\r\nof the olive-bearing Betis, those that make smooth their countenances\r\nwith the water of the ever rich and golden Tagus, those that rejoice in\r\nthe fertilising flow of the divine Genil, those that roam the Tartesian\r\nplains abounding in pasture, those that take their pleasure in the\r\nElysian meadows of Jerez, the rich Manchegans crowned with ruddy ears\r\nof corn, the wearers of iron, old relics of the Gothic race, those that\r\nbathe in the Pisuerga renowned for its gentle current, those that feed\r\ntheir herds along the spreading pastures of the winding Guadiana famed\r\nfor its hidden course, those that tremble with the cold of the pineclad\r\nPyrenees or the dazzling snows of the lofty Apennine; in a word, as\r\nmany as all Europe includes and contains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGood God! what a number of countries and nations he named! giving to\r\neach its proper attributes with marvellous readiness; brimful and\r\nsaturated with what he had read in his lying books! Sancho Panza hung\r\nupon his words without speaking, and from time to time turned to try if\r\nhe could see the knights and giants his master was describing, and as\r\nhe could not make out one of them he said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, devil take it if there\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of any man you talk of, knight\r\nor giant, in the whole thing; maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s all enchantment, like the\r\nphantoms last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow canst thou say that!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cdost thou not hear\r\nthe neighing of the steeds, the braying of the trumpets, the roll of\r\nthe drums?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho;\r\nwhich was true, for by this time the two flocks had come close.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fear thou art in, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cprevents thee from\r\nseeing or hearing correctly, for one of the effects of fear is to\r\nderange the senses and make things appear different from what they are;\r\nif thou art in such fear, withdraw to one side and leave me to myself,\r\nfor alone I suffice to bring victory to that side to which I shall give\r\nmy aid;\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and putting the\r\nlance in rest, shot down the slope like a thunderbolt. Sancho shouted\r\nafter him, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cCome back, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote; I vow to God they are\r\nsheep and ewes you are charging! Come back! Unlucky the father that\r\nbegot me! what madness is this! Look, there is no giant, nor knight,\r\nnor cats, nor arms, nor shields quartered or whole, nor vair azure or\r\nbedevilled. What are you about? Sinner that I am before God!\xe2\x80\x9d But not\r\nfor all these entreaties did Don Quixote turn back; on the contrary he\r\nwent on shouting out, \xe2\x80\x9cHo, knights, ye who follow and fight under the\r\nbanners of the valiant emperor Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, follow me\r\nall; ye shall see how easily I shall give him his revenge over his\r\nenemy Alifanfaron of the Trapobana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes, and began\r\nspearing them with as much spirit and intrepidity as if he were\r\ntransfixing mortal enemies in earnest. The shepherds and drovers\r\naccompanying the flock shouted to him to desist; seeing it was no use,\r\nthey ungirt their slings and began to salute his ears with stones as\r\nbig as one\xe2\x80\x99s fist. Don Quixote gave no heed to the stones, but, letting\r\ndrive right and left kept saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere art thou, proud Alifanfaron? Come before me; I am a single\r\nknight who would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand, and make thee\r\nyield thy life a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiant\r\nPentapolin Garamanta.\xe2\x80\x9d Here came a sugar-plum from the brook that\r\nstruck him on the side and buried a couple of ribs in his body. Feeling\r\nhimself so smitten, he imagined himself slain or badly wounded for\r\ncertain, and recollecting his liquor he drew out his flask, and putting\r\nit to his mouth began to pour the contents into his stomach; but ere he\r\nhad succeeded in swallowing what seemed to him enough, there came\r\nanother almond which struck him on the hand and on the flask so fairly\r\nthat it smashed it to pieces, knocking three or four teeth and grinders\r\nout of his mouth in its course, and sorely crushing two fingers of his\r\nhand. Such was the force of the first blow and of the second, that the\r\npoor knight in spite of himself came down backwards off his horse. The\r\nshepherds came up, and felt sure they had killed him; so in all haste\r\nthey collected their flock together, took up the dead beasts, of which\r\nthere were more than seven, and made off without waiting to ascertain\r\nanything further.\r\n\r\nAll this time Sancho stood on the hill watching the crazy feats his\r\nmaster was performing, and tearing his beard and cursing the hour and\r\nthe occasion when fortune had made him acquainted with him. Seeing him,\r\nthen, brought to the ground, and that the shepherds had taken\r\nthemselves off, he ran to him and found him in very bad case, though\r\nnot unconscious; and said he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I not tell you to come back, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote; and that what you\r\nwere going to attack were not armies but droves of sheep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how that thief of a sage, my enemy, can alter and falsify\r\nthings,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthou must know, Sancho, that it is a\r\nvery easy matter for those of his sort to make us believe what they\r\nchoose; and this malignant being who persecutes me, envious of the\r\nglory he knew I was to win in this battle, has turned the squadrons of\r\nthe enemy into droves of sheep. At any rate, do this much, I beg of\r\nthee, Sancho, to undeceive thyself, and see that what I say is true;\r\nmount thy ass and follow them quietly, and thou shalt see that when\r\nthey have gone some little distance from this they will return to their\r\noriginal shape and, ceasing to be sheep, become men in all respects as\r\nI described them to thee at first. But go not just yet, for I want thy\r\nhelp and assistance; come hither, and see how many of my teeth and\r\ngrinders are missing, for I feel as if there was not one left in my\r\nmouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his mouth; now\r\njust at that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of Don Quixote,\r\nso, at the very instant when Sancho came to examine his mouth, he\r\ndischarged all its contents with more force than a musket, and full\r\ninto the beard of the compassionate squire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Mary!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is this that has happened me? Clearly\r\nthis sinner is mortally wounded, as he vomits blood from the mouth;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut considering the matter a little more closely he perceived by the\r\ncolour, taste, and smell, that it was not blood but the balsam from the\r\nflask which he had seen him drink; and he was taken with such a\r\nloathing that his stomach turned, and he vomited up his inside over his\r\nvery master, and both were left in a precious state. Sancho ran to his\r\nass to get something wherewith to clean himself, and relieve his\r\nmaster, out of his alforjas; but not finding them, he well-nigh took\r\nleave of his senses, and cursed himself anew, and in his heart resolved\r\nto quit his master and return home, even though he forfeited the wages\r\nof his service and all hopes of the promised island.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote now rose, and putting his left hand to his mouth to keep\r\nhis teeth from falling out altogether, with the other he laid hold of\r\nthe bridle of Rocinante, who had never stirred from his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94so loyal and well-behaved was he\xe2\x80\x94and betook himself to where the\r\nsquire stood leaning over his ass with his hand to his cheek, like one\r\nin deep dejection. Seeing him in this mood, looking so sad, Don Quixote\r\nsaid to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBear in mind, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless he\r\ndoes more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signs\r\nthat fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well with\r\nus, for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and hence\r\nit follows that the evil having lasted long, the good must be now nigh\r\nat hand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes which\r\nhappen to me, since thou hast no share in them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow have I not?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cwas he whom they blanketed yesterday\r\nperchance any other than my father\xe2\x80\x99s son? and the alforjas that are\r\nmissing to-day with all my treasures, did they belong to any other but\r\nmyself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! are the alforjas missing, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they are missing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case we have nothing to eat to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif there were none of the herbs\r\nyour worship says you know in these meadows, those with which\r\nknights-errant as unlucky as your worship are wont to supply such-like\r\nshortcomings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather have just now a\r\nquarter of bread, or a loaf and a couple of pilchards\xe2\x80\x99 heads, than all\r\nthe herbs described by Dioscorides, even with Doctor Laguna\xe2\x80\x99s notes.\r\nNevertheless, Sancho the Good, mount thy beast and come along with me,\r\nfor God, who provides for all things, will not fail us (more especially\r\nwhen we are so active in his service as we are), since he fails not the\r\nmidges of the air, nor the grubs of the earth, nor the tadpoles of the\r\nwater, and is so merciful that he maketh his sun to rise on the good\r\nand on the evil, and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour worship would make a better preacher than knight-errant,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnights-errant knew and ought to know everything, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor there were knights-errant in former times as well\r\nqualified to deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of an\r\nencampment, as if they had graduated in the University of Paris;\r\nwhereby we may see that the lance has never blunted the pen, nor the\r\npen the lance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, be it as your worship says,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9clet us be off now\r\nand find some place of shelter for the night, and God grant it may be\r\nsomewhere where there are no blankets, nor blanketeers, nor phantoms,\r\nnor enchanted Moors; for if there are, may the devil take the whole\r\nconcern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk that of God, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; and do thou lead on where\r\nthou wilt, for this time I leave our lodging to thy choice; but reach\r\nme here thy hand, and feel with thy finger, and find out how many of my\r\nteeth and grinders are missing from this right side of the upper jaw,\r\nfor it is there I feel the pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho put in his fingers, and feeling about asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cHow many\r\ngrinders used your worship have on this side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbesides the back-tooth, all whole and\r\nquite sound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind what you are saying, se\xc3\xb1or.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say four, if not five,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor never in my life\r\nhave I had tooth or grinder drawn, nor has any fallen out or been\r\ndestroyed by any decay or rheum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cin this lower side your worship has no more\r\nthan two grinders and a half, and in the upper neither a half nor any\r\nat all, for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuckless that I am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, hearing the sad news his squire\r\ngave him; \xe2\x80\x9cI had rather they despoiled me of an arm, so it were not the\r\nsword-arm; for I tell thee, Sancho, a mouth without teeth is like a\r\nmill without a millstone, and a tooth is much more to be prized than a\r\ndiamond; but we who profess the austere order of chivalry are liable to\r\nall this. Mount, friend, and lead the way, and I will follow thee at\r\nwhatever pace thou wilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho did as he bade him, and proceeded in the direction in which he\r\nthought he might find refuge without quitting the high road, which was\r\nthere very much frequented. As they went along, then, at a slow\r\npace\xe2\x80\x94for the pain in Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s jaws kept him uneasy and\r\nill-disposed for speed\xe2\x80\x94Sancho thought it well to amuse and divert him\r\nby talk of some kind, and among the things he said to him was that\r\nwhich will be told in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc18e.jpg (44K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nOF THE SHREWD DISCOURSE WHICH SANCHO HELD WITH HIS MASTER, AND OF THE\r\nADVENTURE THAT BEFELL HIM WITH A DEAD BODY, TOGETHER WITH OTHER NOTABLE\r\nOCCURRENCES\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me, se\xc3\xb1or, that all these mishaps that have befallen us of\r\nlate have been without any doubt a punishment for the offence committed\r\nby your worship against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oath\r\nyou made not to eat bread off a tablecloth or embrace the queen, and\r\nall the rest of it that your worship swore to observe until you had\r\ntaken that helmet of Malandrino\xe2\x80\x99s, or whatever the Moor is called, for\r\nI do not very well remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art very right, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut to tell the\r\ntruth, it had escaped my memory; and likewise thou mayest rely upon it\r\nthat the affair of the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault in\r\nnot reminding me of it in time; but I will make amends, for there are\r\nways of compounding for everything in the order of chivalry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy! have I taken an oath of some sort, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote; \xe2\x80\x9csuffice it that I see thou art not quite clear of complicity;\r\nand whether or no, it will not be ill done to provide ourselves with a\r\nremedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cmind that your worship does not forget\r\nthis as you did the oath; perhaps the phantoms may take it into their\r\nheads to amuse themselves once more with me; or even with your worship\r\nif they see you so obstinate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in this and other talk, night overtook them on the road\r\nbefore they had reached or discovered any place of shelter; and what\r\nmade it still worse was that they were dying of hunger, for with the\r\nloss of the alforjas they had lost their entire larder and\r\ncommissariat; and to complete the misfortune they met with an adventure\r\nwhich without any invention had really the appearance of one. It so\r\nhappened that the night closed in somewhat darkly, but for all that\r\nthey pushed on, Sancho feeling sure that as the road was the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhighway they might reasonably expect to find some inn within a league\r\nor two. Going along, then, in this way, the night dark, the squire\r\nhungry, the master sharp-set, they saw coming towards them on the road\r\nthey were travelling a great number of lights which looked exactly like\r\nstars in motion. Sancho was taken aback at the sight of them, nor did\r\nDon Quixote altogether relish them: the one pulled up his ass by the\r\nhalter, the other his hack by the bridle, and they stood still,\r\nwatching anxiously to see what all this would turn out to be, and found\r\nthat the lights were approaching them, and the nearer they came the\r\ngreater they seemed, at which spectacle Sancho began to shake like a\r\nman dosed with mercury, and Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s hair stood on end; he,\r\nhowever, plucking up spirit a little, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous adventure,\r\nin which it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour and\r\nresolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnlucky me!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cif this adventure happens to be one of\r\nphantoms, as I am beginning to think it is, where shall I find the ribs\r\nto bear it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe they phantoms ever so much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not permit\r\nthem to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks with\r\nthee the time before, it was because I was unable to leap the walls of\r\nthe yard; but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able to\r\nwield my sword as I please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat difference will it make being on the open plain or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI entreat thee, Sancho, to keep a\r\ngood heart, for experience will tell thee what mine is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, please God,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one side\r\nof the road set themselves to observe closely what all these moving\r\nlights might be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twenty\r\nencamisados, all on horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, the\r\nawe-inspiring aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage of\r\nSancho, who began to chatter with his teeth like one in the cold fit of\r\nan ague; and his heart sank and his teeth chattered still more when\r\nthey perceived distinctly that behind them there came a litter covered\r\nover with black and followed by six more mounted figures in mourning\r\ndown to the very feet of their mules\xe2\x80\x94for they could perceive plainly\r\nthey were not horses by the easy pace at which they went. And as the\r\nencamisados came along they muttered to themselves in a low plaintive\r\ntone. This strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitary\r\nplace was quite enough to strike terror into Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and even\r\ninto his master\xe2\x80\x99s; and (save in Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s case) did so, for all\r\nSancho\xe2\x80\x99s resolution had now broken down. It was just the opposite with\r\nhis master, whose imagination immediately conjured up all this to him\r\nvividly as one of the adventures of his books.\r\n\r\nHe took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne\r\nsome sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reserved\r\nfor him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance in\r\nrest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit and\r\nbearing took up his position in the middle of the road where the\r\nencamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near at\r\nhand he raised his voice and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who ye\r\nare, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye carry upon that bier,\r\nfor, to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or some\r\nwrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that I\r\nshould know, either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done,\r\nor else that I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted\r\nupon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are in haste,\xe2\x80\x9d answered one of the encamisados, \xe2\x80\x9cand the inn is far\r\noff, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand spurring his mule he moved on.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the mule\r\nby the bridle he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHalt, and be more mannerly, and render an\r\naccount of what I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat,\r\nall of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized that\r\nrearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches. An\r\nattendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse\r\nDon Quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his\r\nlance in rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badly\r\nwounded to the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others the\r\nagility with which he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for\r\nit seemed just as if wings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, so\r\nlightly and proudly did he bear himself. The encamisados were all timid\r\nfolk and unarmed, so they speedily made their escape from the fray and\r\nset off at a run across the plain with their lighted torches, looking\r\nexactly like maskers running on some gala or festival night. The\r\nmourners, too, enveloped and swathed in their skirts and gowns, were\r\nunable to bestir themselves, and so with entire safety to himself Don\r\nQuixote belaboured them all and drove them off against their will, for\r\nthey all thought it was no man but a devil from hell come to carry away\r\nthe dead body they had in the litter.\r\n\r\nSancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord,\r\nand said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cClearly this master of mine is as bold and\r\nvaliant as he says he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule had\r\nthrown, by the light of which Don Quixote perceived him, and coming up\r\nto him he presented the point of the lance to his face, calling on him\r\nto yield himself prisoner, or else he would kill him; to which the\r\nprostrate man replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI am prisoner enough as it is; I cannot stir,\r\nfor one of my legs is broken: I entreat you, if you be a Christian\r\ngentleman, not to kill me, which will be committing grave sacrilege,\r\nfor I am a licentiate and I hold first orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, se\xc3\xb1or?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cMy bad luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen still worse awaits you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif you do not satisfy\r\nme as to all I asked you at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be soon satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d said the licentiate; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must know,\r\nthen, that though just now I said I was a licentiate, I am only a\r\nbachelor, and my name is Alonzo Lopez; I am a native of Alcobendas, I\r\ncome from the city of Baeza with eleven others, priests, the same who\r\nfled with the torches, and we are going to the city of Segovia\r\naccompanying a dead body which is in that litter, and is that of a\r\ngentleman who died in Baeza, where he was interred; and now, as I said,\r\nwe are taking his bones to their burial-place, which is in Segovia,\r\nwhere he was born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who killed him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod, by means of a malignant fever that took him,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nbachelor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Lord has relieved me of the task\r\nof avenging his death had any other slain him; but, he who slew him\r\nhaving slain him, there is nothing for it but to be silent, and shrug\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders; I should do the same were he to slay myself; and I\r\nwould have your reverence know that I am a knight of La Mancha, Don\r\nQuixote by name, and it is my business and calling to roam the world\r\nrighting wrongs and redressing injuries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know how that about righting wrongs can be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nbachelor, \xe2\x80\x9cfor from straight you have made me crooked, leaving me with\r\na broken leg that will never see itself straight again all the days of\r\nits life; and the injury you have redressed in my case has been to\r\nleave me injured in such a way that I shall remain injured for ever;\r\nand the height of misadventure it was to fall in with you who go in\r\nsearch of adventures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings do not all happen in the same way,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nall came, Sir Bachelor Alonzo Lopez, of your going, as you did, by\r\nnight, dressed in those surplices, with lighted torches, praying,\r\ncovered with mourning, so that naturally you looked like something evil\r\nand of the other world; and so I could not avoid doing my duty in\r\nattacking you, and I should have attacked you even had I known\r\npositively that you were the very devils of hell, for such I certainly\r\nbelieved and took you to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs my fate has so willed it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bachelor, \xe2\x80\x9cI entreat you, sir\r\nknight-errant, whose errand has been such an evil one for me, to help\r\nme to get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught between\r\nthe stirrup and the saddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have talked on till to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9chow long\r\nwere you going to wait before telling me of your distress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe at once called to Sancho, who, however, had no mind to come, as he\r\nwas just then engaged in unloading a sumpter mule, well laden with\r\nprovender, which these worthy gentlemen had brought with them. Sancho\r\nmade a bag of his coat, and, getting together as much as he could, and\r\nas the bag would hold, he loaded his beast, and then hastened to obey\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s call, and helped him to remove the bachelor from under the\r\nmule; then putting him on her back he gave him the torch, and Don\r\nQuixote bade him follow the track of his companions, and beg pardon of\r\nthem on his part for the wrong which he could not help doing them.\r\n\r\nAnd said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cIf by chance these gentlemen should want to know who\r\nwas the hero that served them so, your worship may tell them that he is\r\nthe famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of the\r\nRueful Countenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bachelor then took his departure.\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention that before he did so he said to Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent hands\r\non a holy thing, _juxta illud, si quis, suadente diabolo_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand that Latin,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know\r\nwell I did not lay hands, only this pike; besides, I did not think I\r\nwas committing an assault upon priests or things of the Church, which,\r\nlike a Catholic and faithful Christian as I am, I respect and revere,\r\nbut upon phantoms and spectres of the other world; but even so, I\r\nremember how it fared with Cid Ruy Diaz when he broke the chair of the\r\nambassador of that king before his Holiness the Pope, who\r\nexcommunicated him for the same; and yet the good Roderick of Vivar\r\nbore himself that day like a very noble and valiant knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this the bachelor took his departure, as has been said,\r\nwithout making any reply; and Don Quixote asked Sancho what had induced\r\nhim to call him the \xe2\x80\x9cKnight of the Rueful Countenance\xe2\x80\x9d more then than\r\nat any other time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cit was because I have been looking\r\nat you for some time by the light of the torch held by that\r\nunfortunate, and verily your worship has got of late the most\r\nill-favoured countenance I ever saw: it must be either owing to the\r\nfatigue of this combat, or else to the want of teeth and grinders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut because the sage whose duty\r\nit will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought it\r\nproper that I should take some distinctive name as all knights of yore\r\ndid; one being \xe2\x80\x98He of the Burning Sword,\xe2\x80\x99 another \xe2\x80\x98He of the Unicorn,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthis one \xe2\x80\x98He of the Damsels,\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98He of the Ph\xc5\x93nix,\xe2\x80\x99 another \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nKnight of the Griffin,\xe2\x80\x99 and another \xe2\x80\x98He of the Death,\xe2\x80\x99 and by these\r\nnames and designations they were known all the world round; and so I\r\nsay that the sage aforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mind\r\njust now to call me \xe2\x80\x98The Knight of the Rueful Countenance,\xe2\x80\x99 as I intend\r\nto call myself from this day forward; and that the said name may fit me\r\nbetter, I mean, when the opportunity offers, to have a very rueful\r\ncountenance painted on my shield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no occasion, se\xc3\xb1or, for wasting time or money on making that\r\ncountenance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor all that need be done is for your\r\nworship to show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, and\r\nwithout anything more, either image or shield, they will call you \xe2\x80\x98Him\r\nof the Rueful Countenance\xe2\x80\x99 and believe me I am telling you the truth,\r\nfor I assure you, se\xc3\xb1or (and in good part be it said), hunger and the\r\nloss of your grinders have given you such an ill-favoured face that, as\r\nI say, the rueful picture may be very well spared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote laughed at Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s pleasantry; nevertheless he resolved to\r\ncall himself by that name, and have his shield or buckler painted as he\r\nhad devised.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litter\r\nwere bones or not, but Sancho would not have it, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourself\r\nthan any of those I have seen: perhaps these people, though beaten and\r\nrouted, may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has beaten\r\nthem, and feeling sore and ashamed of it may take heart and come in\r\nsearch of us and give us trouble enough. The ass is in proper trim, the\r\nmountains are near at hand, hunger presses, we have nothing more to do\r\nbut make good our retreat, and, as the saying is, the dead to the grave\r\nand the living to the loaf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who,\r\nfeeling that Sancho was right, did so without replying; and after\r\nproceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves\r\nin a wide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloaded\r\nhis beast, and stretched upon the green grass, with hunger for sauce,\r\nthey breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfying\r\ntheir appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s clerical gentlemen (who seldom put themselves on short allowance)\r\nhad brought with them on their sumpter mule. But another piece of\r\nill-luck befell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that was\r\nthat they had no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips;\r\nand as thirst tormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow where\r\nthey were was full of green and tender grass, said what will be told in\r\nthe following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nOF THE UNEXAMPLED AND UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURE WHICH WAS ACHIEVED BY THE\r\nVALIANT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WITH LESS PERIL THAN ANY EVER ACHIEVED\r\nBY ANY FAMOUS KNIGHT IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc19a.jpg (147K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be, se\xc3\xb1or, but that this grass is a proof that there must be\r\nhard by some spring or brook to give it moisture, so it would be well\r\nto move a little farther on, that we may find some place where we may\r\nquench this terrible thirst that plagues us, which beyond a doubt is\r\nmore distressing than hunger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe advice seemed good to Don Quixote, and, he leading Rocinante by the\r\nbridle and Sancho the ass by the halter, after he had packed away upon\r\nhim the remains of the supper, they advanced the meadow feeling their\r\nway, for the darkness of the night made it impossible to see anything;\r\nbut they had not gone two hundred paces when a loud noise of water, as\r\nif falling from great rocks, struck their ears. The sound cheered them\r\ngreatly; but halting to make out by listening from what quarter it came\r\nthey heard unseasonably another noise which spoiled the satisfaction\r\nthe sound of the water gave them, especially for Sancho, who was by\r\nnature timid and faint-hearted. They heard, I say, strokes falling with\r\na measured beat, and a certain rattling of iron and chains that,\r\ntogether with the furious din of the water, would have struck terror\r\ninto any heart but Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s. The night was, as has been said,\r\ndark, and they had happened to reach a spot in among some tall trees,\r\nwhose leaves stirred by a gentle breeze made a low ominous sound; so\r\nthat, what with the solitude, the place, the darkness, the noise of the\r\nwater, and the rustling of the leaves, everything inspired awe and\r\ndread; more especially as they perceived that the strokes did not\r\ncease, nor the wind lull, nor morning approach; to all which might be\r\nadded their ignorance as to where they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc19b.jpg (204K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Don Quixote, supported by his intrepid heart, leaped on Rocinante,\r\nand bracing his buckler on his arm, brought his pike to the slope, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cFriend Sancho, know that I by Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s will have been born in\r\nthis our iron age to revive in it the age of gold, or the golden as it\r\nis called; I am he for whom perils, mighty achievements, and valiant\r\ndeeds are reserved; I am, I say again, he who is to revive the Knights\r\nof the Round Table, the Twelve of France and the Nine Worthies; and he\r\nwho is to consign to oblivion the Platirs, the Tablantes, the Olivantes\r\nand Tirantes, the Ph\xc5\x93buses and Belianises, with the whole herd of\r\nfamous knights-errant of days gone by, performing in these in which I\r\nlive such exploits, marvels, and feats of arms as shall obscure their\r\nbrightest deeds. Thou dost mark well, faithful and trusty squire, the\r\ngloom of this night, its strange silence, the dull confused murmur of\r\nthose trees, the awful sound of that water in quest of which we came,\r\nthat seems as though it were precipitating and dashing itself down from\r\nthe lofty mountains of the Moon, and that incessant hammering that\r\nwounds and pains our ears; which things all together and each of itself\r\nare enough to instil fear, dread, and dismay into the breast of Mars\r\nhimself, much more into one not used to hazards and adventures of the\r\nkind. Well, then, all this that I put before thee is but an incentive\r\nand stimulant to my spirit, making my heart burst in my bosom through\r\neagerness to engage in this adventure, arduous as it promises to be;\r\ntherefore tighten Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s girths a little, and God be with thee;\r\nwait for me here three days and no more, and if in that time I come not\r\nback, thou canst return to our village, and thence, to do me a favour\r\nand a service, thou wilt go to El Toboso, where thou shalt say to my\r\nincomparable lady Dulcinea that her captive knight hath died in\r\nattempting things that might make him worthy of being called hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Sancho heard his master\xe2\x80\x99s words he began to weep in the most\r\npathetic way, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, I know not why your worship wants to attempt this so dreadful\r\nadventure; it is night now, no one sees us here, we can easily turn\r\nabout and take ourselves out of danger, even if we don\xe2\x80\x99t drink for\r\nthree days to come; and as there is no one to see us, all the less will\r\nthere be anyone to set us down as cowards; besides, I have many a time\r\nheard the curate of our village, whom your worship knows well, preach\r\nthat he who seeks danger perishes in it; so it is not right to tempt\r\nGod by trying so tremendous a feat from which there can be no escape\r\nsave by a miracle, and Heaven has performed enough of them for your\r\nworship in delivering you from being blanketed as I was, and bringing\r\nyou out victorious and safe and sound from among all those enemies that\r\nwere with the dead man; and if all this does not move or soften that\r\nhard heart, let this thought and reflection move it, that you will have\r\nhardly quitted this spot when from pure fear I shall yield my soul up\r\nto anyone that will take it. I left home and wife and children to come\r\nand serve your worship, trusting to do better and not worse; but as\r\ncovetousness bursts the bag, it has rent my hopes asunder, for just as\r\nI had them highest about getting that wretched unlucky island your\r\nworship has so often promised me, I see that instead and in lieu of it\r\nyou mean to desert me now in a place so far from human reach: for God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, master mine, deal not so unjustly by me, and if your worship will\r\nnot entirely give up attempting this feat, at least put it off till\r\nmorning, for by what the lore I learned when I was a shepherd tells me\r\nit cannot want three hours of dawn now, because the mouth of the Horn\r\nis overhead and makes midnight in the line of the left arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow canst thou see, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere it makes that\r\nline, or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of, when\r\nthe night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole\r\nheaven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut fear has sharp eyes, and sees things\r\nunderground, much more above in heavens; besides, there is good reason\r\nto show that it now wants but little of day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it want what it may,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cit shall not be said\r\nof me now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside from\r\ndoing what was in accordance with knightly usage; and so I beg of thee,\r\nSancho, to hold thy peace, for God, who has put it into my heart to\r\nundertake now this so unexampled and terrible adventure, will take care\r\nto watch over my safety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to do is\r\nto tighten Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s girths well, and wait here, for I shall come\r\nback shortly, alive or dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho perceiving it his master\xe2\x80\x99s final resolve, and how little his\r\ntears, counsels, and entreaties prevailed with him, determined to have\r\nrecourse to his own ingenuity and compel him, if he could, to wait till\r\ndaylight; and so, while tightening the girths of the horse, he quietly\r\nand without being felt, with his ass\xe2\x80\x99 halter tied both Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlegs, so that when Don Quixote strove to go he was unable as the horse\r\ncould only move by jumps. Seeing the success of his trick, Sancho Panza\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee there, se\xc3\xb1or! Heaven, moved by my tears and prayers, has so\r\nordered it that Rocinante cannot stir; and if you will be obstinate,\r\nand spur and strike him, you will only provoke fortune, and kick, as\r\nthey say, against the pricks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote at this grew desperate, but the more he drove his heels\r\ninto the horse, the less he stirred him; and not having any suspicion\r\nof the tying, he was fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak or\r\nuntil Rocinante could move, firmly persuaded that all this came of\r\nsomething other than Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s ingenuity. So he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cAs it is\r\nso, Sancho, and as Rocinante cannot move, I am content to wait till\r\ndawn smiles upon us, even though I weep while it delays its coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to weep,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I will amuse your\r\nworship by telling stories from this till daylight, unless indeed you\r\nlike to dismount and lie down to sleep a little on the green grass\r\nafter the fashion of knights-errant, so as to be fresher when day comes\r\nand the moment arrives for attempting this extraordinary adventure you\r\nare looking forward to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou talking about dismounting or sleeping for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I, thinkest thou, one of those knights that take their\r\nrest in the presence of danger? Sleep thou who art born to sleep, or do\r\nas thou wilt, for I will act as I think most consistent with my\r\ncharacter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe not angry, master mine,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not mean to say\r\nthat;\xe2\x80\x9d and coming close to him he laid one hand on the pommel of the\r\nsaddle and the other on the cantle so that he held his master\xe2\x80\x99s left\r\nthigh in his embrace, not daring to separate a finger\xe2\x80\x99s width from him;\r\nso much afraid was he of the strokes which still resounded with a\r\nregular beat. Don Quixote bade him tell some story to amuse him as he\r\nhad proposed, to which Sancho replied that he would if his dread of\r\nwhat he heard would let him; \xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI will strive to tell a\r\nstory which, if I can manage to relate it, and nobody interferes with\r\nthe telling, is the best of stories, and let your worship give me your\r\nattention, for here I begin. What was, was; and may the good that is to\r\ncome be for all, and the evil for him who goes to look for it\xe2\x80\x94your\r\nworship must know that the beginning the old folk used to put to their\r\ntales was not just as each one pleased; it was a maxim of Cato\r\nZonzorino the Roman, that says \xe2\x80\x98the evil for him that goes to look for\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x99 and it comes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger, to show\r\nthat your worship should keep quiet and not go looking for evil in any\r\nquarter, and that we should go back by some other road, since nobody\r\nforces us to follow this in which so many terrors affright us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on with thy story, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand leave the choice\r\nof our road to my care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say then,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in a village of Estremadura there\r\nwas a goat-shepherd\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, one who tended goats\xe2\x80\x94which shepherd\r\nor goatherd, as my story goes, was called Lope Ruiz, and this Lope Ruiz\r\nwas in love with a shepherdess called Torralva, which shepherdess\r\ncalled Torralva was the daughter of a rich grazier, and this rich\r\ngrazier\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that is the way thou tellest thy tale, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crepeating twice all thou hast to say, thou wilt not have done these\r\ntwo days; go straight on with it, and tell it like a reasonable man, or\r\nelse say nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTales are always told in my country in the very way I am telling\r\nthis,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand I cannot tell it in any other, nor is it\r\nright of your worship to ask me to make new customs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell it as thou wilt,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand as fate will have it\r\nthat I cannot help listening to thee, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so, lord of my soul,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sancho, as I have said, this\r\nshepherd was in love with Torralva the shepherdess, who was a wild\r\nbuxom lass with something of the look of a man about her, for she had\r\nlittle moustaches; I fancy I see her now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you knew her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he who told me the story said\r\nit was so true and certain that when I told it to another I might\r\nsafely declare and swear I had seen it all myself. And so in course of\r\ntime, the devil, who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion,\r\ncontrived that the love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned into\r\nhatred and ill-will, and the reason, according to evil tongues, was\r\nsome little jealousy she caused him that crossed the line and\r\ntrespassed on forbidden ground; and so much did the shepherd hate her\r\nfrom that time forward that, in order to escape from her, he determined\r\nto quit the country and go where he should never set eyes on her again.\r\nTorralva, when she found herself spurned by Lope, was immediately\r\nsmitten with love for him, though she had never loved him before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the natural way of women,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cto scorn the one\r\nthat loves them, and love the one that hates them: go on, Sancho.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came to pass,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the shepherd carried out his\r\nintention, and driving his goats before him took his way across the\r\nplains of Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal.\r\nTorralva, who knew of it, went after him, and on foot and barefoot\r\nfollowed him at a distance, with a pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s staff in her hand and a\r\nscrip round her neck, in which she carried, it is said, a bit of\r\nlooking-glass and a piece of a comb and some little pot or other of\r\npaint for her face; but let her carry what she did, I am not going to\r\ntrouble myself to prove it; all I say is, that the shepherd, they say,\r\ncame with his flock to cross over the river Guadiana, which was at that\r\ntime swollen and almost overflowing its banks, and at the spot he came\r\nto there was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to carry him or his\r\nflock to the other side, at which he was much vexed, for he perceived\r\nthat Torralva was approaching and would give him great annoyance with\r\nher tears and entreaties; however, he went looking about so closely\r\nthat he discovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat so small\r\nthat it could only hold one person and one goat; but for all that he\r\nspoke to him and agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundred\r\ngoats across. The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat\r\nover; he came back and carried another over; he came back again, and\r\nagain brought over another\xe2\x80\x94let your worship keep count of the goats the\r\nfisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will be\r\nan end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word of\r\nit. To proceed, I must tell you the landing place on the other side was\r\nmiry and slippery, and the fisherman lost a great deal of time in going\r\nand coming; still he returned for another goat, and another, and\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it for granted he brought them all across,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t keep going and coming in this way, or thou wilt not make an\r\nend of bringing them over this twelvemonth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many have gone across so far?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow the devil do I know?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I told you, that you must keep a good\r\ncount; well then, by God, there is an end of the story, for there is no\r\ngoing any farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can that be?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cis it so essential to the story\r\nto know to a nicety the goats that have crossed over, that if there be\r\na mistake of one in the reckoning, thou canst not go on with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, se\xc3\xb1or, not a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor when I asked your worship\r\nto tell me how many goats had crossed, and you answered you did not\r\nknow, at that very instant all I had to say passed away out of my\r\nmemory, and, faith, there was much virtue in it, and entertainment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe story has come to an end?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as my mother has,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast told one of the rarest\r\nstories, tales, or histories, that anyone in the world could have\r\nimagined, and such a way of telling it and ending it was never seen nor\r\nwill be in a lifetime; though I expected nothing else from thy\r\nexcellent understanding. But I do not wonder, for perhaps those\r\nceaseless strokes may have confused thy wits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that may be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know that as to my story, all\r\nthat can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the count\r\nof the passage of the goats begins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it end where it will, well and good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand let\r\nus see if Rocinante can go;\xe2\x80\x9d and again he spurred him, and again\r\nRocinante made jumps and remained where he was, so well tied was he.\r\n\r\nJust then, whether it was the cold of the morning that was now\r\napproaching, or that he had eaten something laxative at supper, or that\r\nit was only natural (as is most likely), Sancho felt a desire to do\r\nwhat no one could do for him; but so great was the fear that had\r\npenetrated his heart, he dared not separate himself from his master by\r\nas much as the black of his nail; to escape doing what he wanted was,\r\nhowever, also impossible; so what he did for peace\xe2\x80\x99s sake was to remove\r\nhis right hand, which held the back of the saddle, and with it to untie\r\ngently and silently the running string which alone held up his\r\nbreeches, so that on loosening it they at once fell down round his feet\r\nlike fetters; he then raised his shirt as well as he could and bared\r\nhis hind quarters, no slim ones. But, this accomplished, which he\r\nfancied was all he had to do to get out of this terrible strait and\r\nembarrassment, another still greater difficulty presented itself, for\r\nit seemed to him impossible to relieve himself without making some\r\nnoise, and he ground his teeth and squeezed his shoulders together,\r\nholding his breath as much as he could; but in spite of his precautions\r\nhe was unlucky enough after all to make a little noise, very different\r\nfrom that which was causing him so much fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc19c.jpg (308K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote, hearing it, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat noise is that, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cit must be something new, for\r\nadventures and misadventures never begin with a trifle.\xe2\x80\x9d Once more he\r\ntried his luck, and succeeded so well, that without any further noise\r\nor disturbance he found himself relieved of the burden that had given\r\nhim so much discomfort. But as Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s sense of smell was as\r\nacute as his hearing, and as Sancho was so closely linked with him that\r\nthe fumes rose almost in a straight line, it could not be but that some\r\nshould reach his nose, and as soon as they did he came to its relief by\r\ncompressing it between his fingers, saying in a rather snuffing tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSancho, it strikes me thou art in great fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut how does your worship perceive it now\r\nmore than ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause just now thou smellest stronger than ever, and not of\r\nambergris,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault, but your\r\nworship\xe2\x80\x99s, for leading me about at unseasonable hours and at such\r\nunwonted paces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen go back three or four, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, all the time\r\nwith his fingers to his nose; \xe2\x80\x9cand for the future pay more attention to\r\nthy person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my great\r\nfamiliarity with thee that has bred this contempt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your worship thinks I have done\r\nsomething I ought not with my person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes it worse to stir it, friend Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote.\r\n\r\nWith this and other talk of the same sort master and man passed the\r\nnight, till Sancho, perceiving that daybreak was coming on apace, very\r\ncautiously untied Rocinante and tied up his breeches. As soon as\r\nRocinante found himself free, though by nature he was not at all\r\nmettlesome, he seemed to feel lively and began pawing\xe2\x80\x94for as to\r\ncapering, begging his pardon, he knew not what it meant. Don Quixote,\r\nthen, observing that Rocinante could move, took it as a good sign and a\r\nsignal that he should attempt the dread adventure. By this time day had\r\nfully broken and everything showed distinctly, and Don Quixote saw that\r\nhe was among some tall trees, chestnuts, which cast a very deep shade;\r\nhe perceived likewise that the sound of the strokes did not cease, but\r\ncould not discover what caused it, and so without any further delay he\r\nlet Rocinante feel the spur, and once more taking leave of Sancho, he\r\ntold him to wait for him there three days at most, as he had said\r\nbefore, and if he should not have returned by that time, he might feel\r\nsure it had been God\xe2\x80\x99s will that he should end his days in that\r\nperilous adventure. He again repeated the message and commission with\r\nwhich he was to go on his behalf to his lady Dulcinea, and said he was\r\nnot to be uneasy as to the payment of his services, for before leaving\r\nhome he had made his will, in which he would find himself fully\r\nrecompensed in the matter of wages in due proportion to the time he had\r\nserved; but if God delivered him safe, sound, and unhurt out of that\r\ndanger, he might look upon the promised island as much more than\r\ncertain. Sancho began to weep afresh on again hearing the affecting\r\nwords of his good master, and resolved to stay with him until the final\r\nissue and end of the business. From these tears and this honourable\r\nresolve of Sancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s the author of this history infers that he\r\nmust have been of good birth and at least an old Christian; and the\r\nfeeling he displayed touched his but not so much as to make him show\r\nany weakness; on the contrary, hiding what he felt as well as he could,\r\nhe began to move towards that quarter whence the sound of the water and\r\nof the strokes seemed to come.\r\n\r\nSancho followed him on foot, leading by the halter, as his custom was,\r\nhis ass, his constant comrade in prosperity or adversity; and advancing\r\nsome distance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a little\r\nmeadow at the foot of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush of\r\nwater flung itself. At the foot of the rocks were some rudely\r\nconstructed houses looking more like ruins than houses, from among\r\nwhich came, they perceived, the din and clatter of blows, which still\r\ncontinued without intermission. Rocinante took fright at the noise of\r\nthe water and of the blows, but quieting him Don Quixote advanced step\r\nby step towards the houses, commending himself with all his heart to\r\nhis lady, imploring her support in that dread pass and enterprise, and\r\non the way commending himself to God, too, not to forget him. Sancho\r\nwho never quitted his side, stretched his neck as far as he could and\r\npeered between the legs of Rocinante to see if he could now discover\r\nwhat it was that caused him such fear and apprehension. They went it\r\nmight be a hundred paces farther, when on turning a corner the true\r\ncause, beyond the possibility of any mistake, of that dread-sounding\r\nand to them awe-inspiring noise that had kept them all the night in\r\nsuch fear and perplexity, appeared plain and obvious; and it was (if,\r\nreader, thou art not disgusted and disappointed) six fulling hammers\r\nwhich by their alternate strokes made all the din.\r\n\r\nWhen Don Quixote perceived what it was, he was struck dumb and rigid\r\nfrom head to foot. Sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bent\r\ndown upon his breast in manifest mortification; and Don Quixote glanced\r\nat Sancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full of\r\nlaughter, and evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of his\r\nvexation he could not help laughing at the sight of him; and when\r\nSancho saw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to hold\r\nhis sides with both hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter.\r\nFour times he stopped, and as many times did his laughter break out\r\nafresh with the same violence as at first, whereat Don Quixote grew\r\nfurious, above all when he heard him say mockingly, \xe2\x80\x9cThou must know,\r\nfriend Sancho, that of Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s will I was born in this our iron age to\r\nrevive in it the golden or age of gold; I am he for whom are reserved\r\nperils, mighty achievements, valiant deeds;\xe2\x80\x9d and here he went on\r\nrepeating the words that Don Quixote uttered the first time they heard\r\nthe awful strokes.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule,\r\nwas so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two\r\nsuch blows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had\r\ncaught them on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless\r\nindeed to his heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward\r\nreturn in earnest for his jest, and fearing his master might carry it\r\nstill further, said to him very humbly, \xe2\x80\x9cCalm yourself, sir, for by God\r\nI am only joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, if you are joking I am not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cLook\r\nhere, my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers,\r\nhad been some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown the\r\ncourage required for the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance,\r\nbeing, as I am, a gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and\r\ntell whether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, when\r\nperhaps, as is the case, I have never in my life seen any as you have,\r\nlow boor as you are, that have been born and bred among them? But turn\r\nme these six hammers into six giants, and bring them to beard me, one\r\nby one or all together, and if I do not knock them head over heels,\r\nthen make what mockery you like of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more of that, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI own I went a little too\r\nfar with the joke. But tell me, your worship, now that peace is made\r\nbetween us (and may God bring you out of all the adventures that may\r\nbefall you as safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one),\r\nwas it not a thing to laugh at, and is it not a good story, the great\r\nfear we were in?\xe2\x80\x94at least that I was in; for as to your worship I see\r\nnow that you neither know nor understand what either fear or dismay\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not deny,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat what happened to us may be\r\nworth laughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it is\r\nnot everyone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship knew how to hit the right\r\npoint with your pike, aiming at my head and hitting me on the\r\nshoulders, thanks be to God and my own smartness in dodging it. But let\r\nthat pass; all will come out in the scouring; for I have heard say \xe2\x80\x98he\r\nloves thee well that makes thee weep;\xe2\x80\x99 and moreover that it is the way\r\nwith great lords after any hard words they give a servant to give him a\r\npair of breeches; though I do not know what they give after blows,\r\nunless it be that knights-errant after blows give islands, or kingdoms\r\non the mainland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be on the dice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat all thou sayest will\r\ncome true; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd enough to know that\r\nour first movements are not in our own control; and one thing for the\r\nfuture bear in mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in my\r\ncompany; for in all the books of chivalry that I have read, and they\r\nare innumerable, I never met with a squire who talked so much to his\r\nlord as thou dost to thine; and in fact I feel it to be a great fault\r\nof thine and of mine: of thine, that thou hast so little respect for\r\nme; of mine, that I do not make myself more respected. There was\r\nGandalin, the squire of Amadis of Gaul, that was Count of the Insula\r\nFirme, and we read of him that he always addressed his lord with his\r\ncap in his hand, his head bowed down and his body bent double, more\r\nturquesco. And then, what shall we say of Gasabal, the squire of\r\nGalaor, who was so silent that in order to indicate to us the greatness\r\nof his marvellous taciturnity his name is only once mentioned in the\r\nwhole of that history, as long as it is truthful? From all I have said\r\nthou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must be a difference between\r\nmaster and man, between lord and lackey, between knight and squire: so\r\nthat from this day forward in our intercourse we must observe more\r\nrespect and take less liberties, for in whatever way I may be provoked\r\nwith you it will be bad for the pitcher. The favours and benefits that\r\nI have promised you will come in due time, and if they do not your\r\nwages at least will not be lost, as I have already told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that your worship says is very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I should\r\nlike to know (in case the time of favours should not come, and it might\r\nbe necessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of a\r\nknight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or by\r\nthe day like bricklayers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat such squires were ever\r\non wages, but were dependent on favour; and if I have now mentioned\r\nthine in the sealed will I have left at home, it was with a view to\r\nwhat may happen; for as yet I know not how chivalry will turn out in\r\nthese wretched times of ours, and I do not wish my soul to suffer for\r\ntrifles in the other world; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that in\r\nthis there is no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9csince the mere noise of the hammers of a\r\nfulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valiant\r\nerrant adventurer as your worship; but you may be sure I will not open\r\nmy lips henceforward to make light of anything of your worship\xe2\x80\x99s, but\r\nonly to honour you as my master and natural lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy so doing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cshalt thou live long on the face\r\nof the earth; for next to parents, masters are to be respected as\r\nthough they were parents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc19e.jpg (33K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF THE EXALTED ADVENTURE AND RICH PRIZE OF MAMBRINO\xe2\x80\x99S\r\nHELMET, TOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO OUR INVINCIBLE\r\nKNIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc20a.jpg (73K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt now began to rain a little, and Sancho was for going into the\r\nfulling mills, but Don Quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them on\r\naccount of the late joke that he would not enter them on any account;\r\nso turning aside to right they came upon another road, different from\r\nthat which they had taken the night before. Shortly afterwards Don\r\nQuixote perceived a man on horseback who wore on his head something\r\nthat shone like gold, and the moment he saw him he turned to Sancho and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being\r\nmaxims drawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences,\r\nespecially that one that says, \xe2\x80\x98Where one door shuts, another opens.\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsay so because if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we\r\nwere looking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it now\r\nopens wide another one for another better and more certain adventure,\r\nand if I do not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and I\r\ncannot lay it to my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of the\r\nnight. I say this because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us one\r\nwho wears on his head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took\r\nthe oath thou rememberest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling\r\nand knocking our senses out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil take thee, man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has a helmet to do\r\nwith fulling mills?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, faith, if I might speak as I\r\nused, perhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see you\r\nwere mistaken in what you say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nDon Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9ctell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us\r\non a dappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I see and make out,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cis only a man on a grey\r\nass like my own, who has something that shines on his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is the helmet of Mambrino,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cstand to one\r\nside and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying a\r\nword, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue and\r\npossess myself of the helmet I have so longed for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take care to stand aside,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut God grant, I say\r\nonce more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling\r\nmills to me again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cor I vow\xe2\x80\x94and I say no more\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfull the soul out of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow\r\nhe had hurled like a bowl at him.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight that\r\nDon Quixote saw, was this. In that neighbourhood there were two\r\nvillages, one of them so small that it had neither apothecary\xe2\x80\x99s shop\r\nnor barber, which the other that was close to it had, so the barber of\r\nthe larger served the smaller, and in it there was a sick man who\r\nrequired to be bled and another man who wanted to be shaved, and on\r\nthis errand the barber was going, carrying with him a brass basin; but\r\nas luck would have it, as he was on the way it began to rain, and not\r\nto spoil his hat, which probably was a new one, he put the basin on his\r\nhead, and being clean it glittered at half a league\xe2\x80\x99s distance. He rode\r\nupon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and this was what made it seem to Don\r\nQuixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a knight and a golden helmet; for\r\neverything he saw he made to fall in with his crazy chivalry and\r\nill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor knight draw near, without\r\nentering into any parley with him, at Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s top speed he bore\r\ndown upon him with the pike pointed low, fully determined to run him\r\nthrough and through, and as he reached him, without checking the fury\r\nof his charge, he cried to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDefend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that\r\nwhich is so reasonably my due.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this\r\napparition coming down upon him, had no other way of saving himself\r\nfrom the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; and\r\nno sooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than\r\na deer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind.\r\n\r\nHe left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented\r\nhimself, saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated\r\nthe beaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts\r\noff with its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it\r\nis pursued.\r\n\r\nHe told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his hands\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it is\r\nworth a maravedis,\xe2\x80\x9d and handed it to his master, who immediately put it\r\non his head, turning it round, now this way, now that, in search of\r\nfitment, and not finding it he said, \xe2\x80\x9cClearly the pagan to whose\r\nmeasure this famous head-piece was first forged must have had a very\r\nlarge head; but the worst of it is half of it is wanting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable to\r\nrestrain his laughter, but remembering his master\xe2\x80\x99s wrath he checked\r\nhimself in the midst of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou laughing at, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am laughing,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto think of the great head the pagan must\r\nhave had who owned this helmet, for it looks exactly like a regular\r\nbarber\xe2\x80\x99s basin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthat this\r\nwonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accident\r\nhave come into the hands of someone who was unable to recognise or\r\nrealise its value, and who, not knowing what he did, and seeing it to\r\nbe of the purest gold, must have melted down one half for the sake of\r\nwhat it might be worth, and of the other made this which is like a\r\nbarber\xe2\x80\x99s basin as thou sayest; but be it as it may, to me who recognise\r\nit, its transformation makes no difference, for I will set it to rights\r\nat the first village where there is a blacksmith, and in such style\r\nthat that helmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battles\r\nshall not surpass it or even come up to it; and in the meantime I will\r\nwear it as well as I can, for something is better than nothing; all the\r\nmore as it will be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a\r\nstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif it is not shot with a sling as they were in\r\nthe battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross on your\r\nworship\xe2\x80\x99s grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that\r\nmade me vomit my bowels up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not grieve me much to have lost it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nthou knowest, Sancho, that I have the receipt in my memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo have I,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if ever I make it, or try it again\r\nas long as I live, may this be my last hour; moreover, I have no\r\nintention of putting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean, with\r\nall my five senses, to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding\r\nanyone: as to being blanketed again I say nothing, for it is hard to\r\nprevent mishaps of that sort, and if they come there is nothing for it\r\nbut to squeeze our shoulders together, hold our breath, shut our eyes,\r\nand let ourselves go where luck and the blanket may send us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art a bad Christian, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote on hearing this,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it: but\r\nknow that it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach\r\nimportance to trifles. What lame leg hast thou got by it, what broken\r\nrib, what cracked head, that thou canst not forget that jest? For jest\r\nand sport it was, properly regarded, and had I not seen it in that\r\nlight I would have returned and done more mischief in revenging thee\r\nthan the Greeks did for the rape of Helen, who, if she were alive now,\r\nor if my Dulcinea had lived then, might depend upon it she would not be\r\nso famous for her beauty as she is;\xe2\x80\x9d and here he heaved a sigh and sent\r\nit aloft; and said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cLet it pass for a jest as it cannot be\r\nrevenged in earnest, but I know what sort of jest and earnest it was,\r\nand I know it will never be rubbed out of my memory any more than off\r\nmy shoulders. But putting that aside, will your worship tell me what\r\nare we to do with this dapple-grey steed that looks like a grey ass,\r\nwhich that Martino that your worship overthrew has left deserted here?\r\nfor, from the way he took to his heels and bolted, he is not likely\r\never to come back for it; and by my beard but the grey is a good one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never been in the habit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cof taking spoil of\r\nthose whom I vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take away\r\ntheir horses and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that the\r\nvictor have lost his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful to\r\ntake that of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war; therefore,\r\nSancho, leave this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be;\r\nfor when its owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows I should like to take it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cor at least to\r\nchange it for my own, which does not seem to me as good a one: verily\r\nthe laws of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to let\r\none ass be changed for another; I should like to know if I might at\r\nleast change trappings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn that head I am not quite certain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand the\r\nmatter being doubtful, pending better information, I say thou mayest\r\nchange them, if so be thou hast urgent need of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo urgent is it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if they were for my own\r\nperson I could not want them more;\xe2\x80\x9d and forthwith, fortified by this\r\nlicence, he effected the _mutatio capparum_, and rigged out his beast\r\nto the ninety-nines and making quite another thing of it. This done,\r\nthey broke their fast on the remains of the spoils of war plundered\r\nfrom the sumpter mule, and drank of the brook that flowed from the\r\nfulling mills, without casting a look in that direction, in such\r\nloathing did they hold them for the alarm they had caused them; and,\r\nall anger and gloom removed, they mounted and, without taking any fixed\r\nroad (not to fix upon any being the proper thing for true\r\nknights-errant), they set out, guided by Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s will, which\r\ncarried along with it that of his master, not to say that of the ass,\r\nwhich always followed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably;\r\nnevertheless they returned to the high road, and pursued it at a\r\nventure without any other aim.\r\n\r\nAs they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to his master,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? For\r\nsince you laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things\r\nhave gone to rot in my stomach, and I have now just one on the tip of\r\nmy tongue that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be spoiled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, on, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand be brief in thy discourse,\r\nfor there is no pleasure in one that is long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI say that for some days past I\r\nhave been considering how little is got or gained by going in search of\r\nthese adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and\r\ncross-roads, where, even if the most perilous are victoriously\r\nachieved, there is no one to see or know of them, and so they must be\r\nleft untold for ever, to the loss of your worship\xe2\x80\x99s object and the\r\ncredit they deserve; therefore it seems to me it would be better\r\n(saving your worship\xe2\x80\x99s better judgment) if we were to go and serve some\r\nemperor or other great prince who may have some war on hand, in whose\r\nservice your worship may prove the worth of your person, your great\r\nmight, and greater understanding, on perceiving which the lord in whose\r\nservice we may be will perforce have to reward us, each according to\r\nhis merits; and there you will not be at a loss for someone to set down\r\nyour achievements in writing so as to preserve their memory for ever.\r\nOf my own I say nothing, as they will not go beyond squirely limits,\r\nthough I make bold to say that, if it be the practice in chivalry to\r\nwrite the achievements of squires, I think mine must not be left out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou speakest not amiss, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut before\r\nthat point is reached it is requisite to roam the world, as it were on\r\nprobation, seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some, name\r\nand fame may be acquired, such that when he betakes himself to the\r\ncourt of some great monarch the knight may be already known by his\r\ndeeds, and that the boys, the instant they see him enter the gate of\r\nthe city, may all follow him and surround him, crying, \xe2\x80\x98This is the\r\nKnight of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94or the Serpent, or any other title under which he\r\nmay have achieved great deeds. \xe2\x80\x98This,\xe2\x80\x99 they will say, \xe2\x80\x98is he who\r\nvanquished in single combat the gigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength;\r\nhe who delivered the great Mameluke of Persia out of the long\r\nenchantment under which he had been for almost nine hundred years.\xe2\x80\x99 So\r\nfrom one to another they will go proclaiming his achievements; and\r\npresently at the tumult of the boys and the others the king of that\r\nkingdom will appear at the windows of his royal palace, and as soon as\r\nhe beholds the knight, recognising him by his arms and the device on\r\nhis shield, he will as a matter of course say, \xe2\x80\x98What ho! Forth all ye,\r\nthe knights of my court, to receive the flower of chivalry who cometh\r\nhither!\xe2\x80\x99 At which command all will issue forth, and he himself,\r\nadvancing half-way down the stairs, will embrace him closely, and\r\nsalute him, kissing him on the cheek, and will then lead him to the\r\nqueen\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, where the knight will find her with the princess her\r\ndaughter, who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplished\r\ndamsels that could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the\r\nknown world. Straightway it will come to pass that she will fix her\r\neyes upon the knight and he his upon her, and each will seem to the\r\nother something more divine than human, and, without knowing how or why\r\nthey will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, and\r\nsorely distressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their\r\npains and sufferings known by speech. Thence they will lead him, no\r\ndoubt, to some richly adorned chamber of the palace, where, having\r\nremoved his armour, they will bring him a rich mantle of scarlet\r\nwherewith to robe himself, and if he looked noble in his armour he will\r\nlook still more so in a doublet. When night comes he will sup with the\r\nking, queen, and princess; and all the time he will never take his eyes\r\noff her, stealing stealthy glances, unnoticed by those present, and she\r\nwill do the same, and with equal cautiousness, being, as I have said, a\r\ndamsel of great discretion. The tables being removed, suddenly through\r\nthe door of the hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf\r\nfollowed by a fair dame, between two giants, who comes with a certain\r\nadventure, the work of an ancient sage; and he who shall achieve it\r\nshall be deemed the best knight in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe king will then command all those present to essay it, and none\r\nwill bring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to the\r\ngreat enhancement of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyed\r\nand will esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed\r\nher thoughts so high. And the best of it is that this king, or prince,\r\nor whatever he is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as\r\npowerful as himself, and the stranger knight, after having been some\r\ndays at his court, requests leave from him to go and serve him in the\r\nsaid war. The king will grant it very readily, and the knight will\r\ncourteously kiss his hands for the favour done to him; and that night\r\nhe will take leave of his lady the princess at the grating of the\r\nchamber where she sleeps, which looks upon a garden, and at which he\r\nhas already many times conversed with her, the go-between and\r\nconfidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the princess.\r\nHe will sigh, she will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, much\r\ndistressed because morning approaches, and for the honour of her lady\r\nhe would not that they were discovered; at last the princess will come\r\nto herself and will present her white hands through the grating to the\r\nknight, who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathing\r\nthem with his tears. It will be arranged between them how they are to\r\ninform each other of their good or evil fortunes, and the princess will\r\nentreat him to make his absence as short as possible, which he will\r\npromise to do with many oaths; once more he kisses her hands, and takes\r\nhis leave in such grief that he is well-nigh ready to die. He betakes\r\nhim thence to his chamber, flings himself on his bed, cannot sleep for\r\nsorrow at parting, rises early in the morning, goes to take leave of\r\nthe king, queen, and princess, and, as he takes his leave of the pair,\r\nit is told him that the princess is indisposed and cannot receive a\r\nvisit; the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure, his heart\r\nis pierced, and he is hardly able to keep from showing his pain. The\r\nconfidante is present, observes all, goes to tell her mistress, who\r\nlistens with tears and says that one of her greatest distresses is not\r\nknowing who this knight is, and whether he is of kingly lineage or not;\r\nthe damsel assures her that so much courtesy, gentleness, and gallantry\r\nof bearing as her knight possesses could not exist in any save one who\r\nwas royal and illustrious; her anxiety is thus relieved, and she\r\nstrives to be of good cheer lest she should excite suspicion in her\r\nparents, and at the end of two days she appears in public. Meanwhile\r\nthe knight has taken his departure; he fights in the war, conquers the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many battles, returns to\r\nthe court, sees his lady where he was wont to see her, and it is agreed\r\nthat he shall demand her in marriage of her parents as the reward of\r\nhis services; the king is unwilling to give her, as he knows not who he\r\nis, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other way it\r\nmay be, the princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes to\r\nregard it as very good fortune; for it so happens that this knight is\r\nproved to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know not\r\nwhat, for I fancy it is not likely to be on the map. The father dies,\r\nthe princess inherits, and in two words the knight becomes king. And\r\nhere comes in at once the bestowal of rewards upon his squire and all\r\nwho have aided him in rising to so exalted a rank. He marries his\r\nsquire to a damsel of the princess\xe2\x80\x99s, who will be, no doubt, the one\r\nwho was confidante in their amour, and is daughter of a very great\r\nduke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I want, and no mistake about it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting for; for all this, word for word, is in store for your\r\nworship under the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou needst not doubt it, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor in the\r\nsame manner, and by the same steps as I have described here,\r\nknights-errant rise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all we\r\nwant now is to find out what king, Christian or pagan, is at war and\r\nhas a beautiful daughter; but there will be time enough to think of\r\nthat, for, as I have told thee, fame must be won in other quarters\r\nbefore repairing to the court. There is another thing, too, that is\r\nwanting; for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautiful\r\ndaughter, and that I have won incredible fame throughout the universe,\r\nI know not how it can be made out that I am of royal lineage, or even\r\nsecond cousin to an emperor; for the king will not be willing to give\r\nme his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on\r\nthis point, however much my famous deeds may deserve it; so that by\r\nthis deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has fairly earned. True\r\nit is I am a gentleman of known house, of estate and property, and\r\nentitled to the five hundred sueldos mulet; and it may be that the sage\r\nwho shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and pedigree\r\nthat I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king; for I\r\nwould have thee know, Sancho, that there are two kinds of lineages in\r\nthe world; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings\r\nand princes, whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a\r\npoint like a pyramid upside down; and others who spring from the common\r\nherd and go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords;\r\nso that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are,\r\nand the others are what they formerly were not. And I may be of such\r\nthat after investigation my origin may prove great and famous, with\r\nwhich the king, my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied;\r\nand should he not be, the princess will so love me that even though she\r\nwell knew me to be the son of a water-carrier, she will take me for her\r\nlord and husband in spite of her father; if not, then it comes to\r\nseizing her and carrying her off where I please; for time or death will\r\nput an end to the wrath of her parents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt comes to this, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat some naughty people say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;\xe2\x80\x99 though it would\r\nfit better to say, \xe2\x80\x98A clear escape is better than good men\xe2\x80\x99s prayers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI say so because if my lord the king, your worship\xe2\x80\x99s father-in-law,\r\nwill not condescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothing\r\nfor it but, as your worship says, to seize her and transport her. But\r\nthe mischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful\r\nenjoyment of your kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far as\r\nrewards go, unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be his\r\nwife comes with the princess, and that with her he tides over his bad\r\nluck until Heaven otherwise orders things; for his master, I suppose,\r\nmay as well give her to him at once for a lawful wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody can object to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen since that may be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing for it but to\r\ncommend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod guide it according to my wishes and thy wants,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand mean be he who thinks himself mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn God\xe2\x80\x99s name let him be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho: \xe2\x80\x9cI am an old Christian, and\r\nto fit me for a count that\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd more than enough for thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand even wert thou\r\nnot, it would make no difference, because I being the king can easily\r\ngive thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee, for\r\nwhen I make thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and they\r\nmay say what they will, but by my faith they will have to call thee\r\n\xe2\x80\x98your lordship,\xe2\x80\x99 whether they like it or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a doubt of it; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll know how to support the tittle,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTitle thou shouldst say, not tittle,\xe2\x80\x9d said his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cI say I will know how to behave, for once\r\nin my life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle\xe2\x80\x99s gown sat so\r\nwell on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the same\r\nbrotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke\xe2\x80\x99s robe on my\r\nback, or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? I believe\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll come a hundred leagues to see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt look well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut thou must shave thy beard\r\noften, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou\r\ndost not shave it every second day at least, they will see what thou\r\nart at the distance of a musket shot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat more will it be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthan having a barber, and keeping\r\nhim at wages in the house? and even if it be necessary, I will make him\r\ngo behind me like a nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s equerry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cYears ago I was for a month at the\r\ncapital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they\r\nsaid was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in\r\nevery turn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this man\r\ndid not join the other man, instead of always going behind him; they\r\nanswered me that he was his equerry, and that it was the custom with\r\nnobles to have such persons behind them, and ever since then I know it,\r\nfor I have never forgotten it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand in the same way thou mayest\r\ncarry thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all\r\ntogether, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the\r\nfirst count to have a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeard is a greater trust than saddling one\xe2\x80\x99s horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the barber business be my look-out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand your\r\nworship\xe2\x80\x99s be it to strive to become a king, and make me a count.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it shall be,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he saw\r\nwhat will be told in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc20e.jpg (18K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nOF THE FREEDOM DON QUIXOTE CONFERRED ON SEVERAL UNFORTUNATES WHO\r\nAGAINST THEIR WILL WERE BEING CARRIED WHERE THEY HAD NO WISH TO GO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc22a.jpg (178K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCid Hamete Benengeli, the Arab and Manchegan author, relates in this\r\nmost grave, high-sounding, minute, delightful, and original history\r\nthat after the discussion between the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha\r\nand his squire Sancho Panza which is set down at the end of chapter\r\ntwenty-one, Don Quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the road\r\nhe was following some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck,\r\nlike beads, on a great iron chain, and all with manacles on their\r\nhands. With them there came also two men on horseback and two on foot;\r\nthose on horseback with wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelins\r\nand swords, and as soon as Sancho saw them he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by force\r\nof the king\xe2\x80\x99s orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow by force?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cis it possible that the king uses\r\nforce against anyone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not say that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that these are people\r\ncondemned for their crimes to serve by force in the king\xe2\x80\x99s galleys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9chowever it may be, these people are\r\ngoing where they are taking them by force, and not of their own will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen if so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9chere is a case for the exercise of my\r\noffice, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecollect, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cJustice, which is the king\r\nhimself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, but\r\npunishing them for their crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote in\r\nvery courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be\r\ngood enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were\r\nconducting these people in this manner. One of the guards on horseback\r\nanswered that they were galley slaves belonging to his majesty, that\r\nthey were going to the galleys, and that was all that was to be said\r\nand all he had any business to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc22b.jpg (298K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know from each\r\nof them separately the reason of his misfortune;\xe2\x80\x9d to this he added more\r\nto the same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civilly\r\nthat the other mounted guard said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of\r\nevery one of these wretches, this is no time to take them out or read\r\nthem; come and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and they\r\nwill, for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about\r\nrascalities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had they\r\nnot granted it, he approached the chain and asked the first for what\r\noffences he was now in such a sorry case.\r\n\r\nHe made answer that it was for being a lover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor that only?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, if for being lovers they\r\nsend people to the galleys I might have been rowing in them long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe love is not the sort your worship is thinking of,\xe2\x80\x9d said the galley\r\nslave; \xe2\x80\x9cmine was that I loved a washerwoman\xe2\x80\x99s basket of clean linen so\r\nwell, and held it so close in my embrace, that if the arm of the law\r\nhad not forced it from me, I should never have let it go of my own will\r\nto this moment; I was caught in the act, there was no occasion for\r\ntorture, the case was settled, they treated me to a hundred lashes on\r\nthe back, and three years of gurapas besides, and that was the end of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are gurapas?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGurapas are galleys,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the galley slave, who was a young man\r\nof about four-and-twenty, and said he was a native of Piedrahita.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply,\r\nso downcast and melancholy was he; but the first answered for him, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cHe, sir, goes as a canary, I mean as a musician and a singer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor being musicians and singers are people\r\nsent to the galleys too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the galley slave, \xe2\x80\x9cfor there is nothing worse than\r\nsinging under suffering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, I have heard say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he who\r\nsings scares away his woes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is the reverse,\xe2\x80\x9d said the galley slave; \xe2\x80\x9cfor he who sings once\r\nweeps all his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; but one of the guards said\r\nto him, \xe2\x80\x9cSir, to sing under suffering means with the _non sancta_\r\nfraternity to confess under torture; they put this sinner to the\r\ntorture and he confessed his crime, which was being a cuatrero, that is\r\na cattle-stealer, and on his confession they sentenced him to six years\r\nin the galleys, besides two hundred lashes that he has already had on\r\nthe back; and he is always dejected and downcast because the other\r\nthieves that were left behind and that march here ill-treat, and snub,\r\nand jeer, and despise him for confessing and not having spirit enough\r\nto say nay; for, say they, \xe2\x80\x98nay\xe2\x80\x99 has no more letters in it than \xe2\x80\x98yea,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand a culprit is well off when life or death with him depends on his\r\nown tongue and not on that of witnesses or evidence; and to my thinking\r\nthey are not very far out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think so too,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote; then passing on to the\r\nthird he asked him what he had asked the others, and the man answered\r\nvery readily and unconcernedly, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going for five years to their\r\nladyships the gurapas for the want of ten ducats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDon Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the galley slave, \xe2\x80\x9cis like a man having money at sea when\r\nhe is dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants; I say so\r\nbecause if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that your\r\nworship now offers me, I would have greased the notary\xe2\x80\x99s pen and\r\nfreshened up the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s wit with them, so that to-day I should be\r\nin the middle of the plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo, and not on this\r\nroad coupled like a greyhound. But God is great; patience\xe2\x80\x94there, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenough of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a\r\nwhite beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked the\r\nreason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, but\r\nthe fifth acted as his tongue and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis worthy man is going to\r\nthe galleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony\r\nand on horseback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho Panza, \xe2\x80\x9cas I take it, to have been exposed to\r\nshame in public.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the galley slave, \xe2\x80\x9cand the offence for which they\r\ngave him that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay\r\nbody-broker; I mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and\r\nfor having besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that touch had not been thrown in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9che would not\r\ndeserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to command\r\nand be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one,\r\nbeing the office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in a\r\nwell-ordered state, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth;\r\nnay, there ought to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in other\r\noffices, and recognised number, as with the brokers on change; in this\r\nway many of the evils would be avoided which are caused by this office\r\nand calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such as\r\nwomen more or less silly, and pages and jesters of little standing and\r\nexperience, who on the most urgent occasions, and when ingenuity of\r\ncontrivance is needed, let the crumbs freeze on the way to their\r\nmouths, and know not which is their right hand. I should like to go\r\nfarther, and give reasons to show that it is advisable to choose those\r\nwho are to hold so necessary an office in the state, but this is not\r\nthe fit place for it; some day I will expound the matter to someone\r\nable to see to and rectify it; all I say now is, that the additional\r\nfact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to see\r\nthese white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful a\r\nposition on account of his being a pimp; though I know well there are\r\nno sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some\r\nsimple folk fancy, for our will is free, nor is there herb or charm\r\nthat can force it. All that certain silly women and quacks do is to\r\nturn men mad with potions and poisons, pretending that they have power\r\nto cause love, for, as I say, it is an impossibility to compel the\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good old man, \xe2\x80\x9cand indeed, sir, as far as the\r\ncharge of sorcery goes I was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp I\r\ncannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for my\r\nonly object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in\r\npeace and quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentions\r\nwere unavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back\r\nfrom, with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that\r\nnever gives me a moment\xe2\x80\x99s ease;\xe2\x80\x9d and again he fell to weeping as\r\nbefore, and such compassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out a\r\nreal of four from his bosom and gave it to him in alms.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote went on and asked another what his crime was, and the man\r\nanswered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the last\r\none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here because I carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins\r\nof mine, and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine; in\r\nshort, I carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such a\r\ncomplicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear:\r\nit was all proved against me, I got no favour, I had no money, I was\r\nnear having my neck stretched, they sentenced me to the galleys for six\r\nyears, I accepted my fate, it is the punishment of my fault; I am a\r\nyoung man; let life only last, and with that all will come right. If\r\nyou, sir, have anything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay it\r\nto you in heaven, and we on earth will take care in our petitions to\r\nhim to pray for the life and health of your worship, that they may be\r\nas long and as good as your amiable appearance deserves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis one was in the dress of a student, and one of the guards said he\r\nwas a great talker and a very elegant Latin scholar.\r\n\r\nBehind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow,\r\nexcept that when he looked, his eyes turned in a little one towards the\r\nother. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg a\r\nchain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings on\r\nhis neck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckeep-friend\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfriend\xe2\x80\x99s foot,\xe2\x80\x9d from which hung two irons reaching to\r\nhis waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were\r\nsecured by a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands to\r\nhis mouth nor lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why this\r\nman carried so many more chains than the others. The guard replied that\r\nit was because he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put\r\ntogether, and was so daring and such a villain, that though they\r\nmarched him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him, but were in\r\ndread of his making his escape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat crimes can he have committed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif they have\r\nnot deserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe goes for ten years,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the guard, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is the same thing as\r\ncivil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the\r\nfamous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, se\xc3\xb1or commissary,\xe2\x80\x9d said the galley slave at this, \xe2\x80\x9clet us have\r\nno fixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and my\r\nfamily name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one mind\r\nhis own business, and he will be doing enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nthe commissary, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t want me to make you hold your tongue in\r\nspite of your teeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is easy to see,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the galley slave, \xe2\x80\x9cthat man goes as God\r\npleases, but someone shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillo\r\nde Parapilla or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t they call you so, you liar?\xe2\x80\x9d said the guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Gines, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will make them give over calling me\r\nso, or I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth. If you,\r\nsir, have anything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speed\r\nyou, for you are becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about\r\nthe lives of others; if you want to know about mine, let me tell you I\r\nam Gines de Pasamonte, whose life is written by these fingers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the commissary, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he has himself written his\r\nstory as grand as you please, and has left the book in the prison in\r\npawn for two hundred reals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I mean to take it out of pawn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gines, \xe2\x80\x9cthough it were in for\r\ntwo hundred ducats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it so good?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo good is it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gines, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a fig for \xe2\x80\x98Lazarillo de Tormes,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand all of that kind that have been written, or shall be written\r\ncompared with it: all I will say about it is that it deals with facts,\r\nand facts so neat and diverting that no lies could match them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is the book entitled?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Life of Gines de Pasamonte,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d replied the subject of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it finished?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can it be finished,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen my life is not yet\r\nfinished? All that is written is from my birth down to the point when\r\nthey sent me to the galleys this last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have been there before?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the service of God and the king I have been there for four years\r\nbefore now, and I know by this time what the biscuit and courbash are\r\nlike,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gines; \xe2\x80\x9cand it is no great grievance to me to go back to\r\nthem, for there I shall have time to finish my book; I have still many\r\nthings left to say, and in the galleys of Spain there is more than\r\nenough leisure; though I do not want much for what I have to write, for\r\nI have it by heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem a clever fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd an unfortunate one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gines, \xe2\x80\x9cfor misfortune always\r\npersecutes good wit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt persecutes rogues,\xe2\x80\x9d said the commissary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you already to go gently, master commissary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pasamonte;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctheir lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat us\r\nwretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you;\r\nif not, by the life of-never mind\xe2\x80\x94; it may be that some day the stains\r\nmade in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his\r\ntongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for\r\nwe have had quite enough of this entertainment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his\r\nthreats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not to\r\nill-use him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied\r\nto have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of\r\nthem he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom all you have told me, dear brethren, make out clearly that though\r\nthey have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are about\r\nto endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them very\r\nmuch against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps this\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s want of courage under torture, that one\xe2\x80\x99s want of money, the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s want of advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the\r\njudge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure to\r\nobtain the justice you had on your side. All which presents itself now\r\nto my mind, urging, persuading, and even compelling me to demonstrate\r\nin your case the purpose for which Heaven sent me into the world and\r\ncaused me to make profession of the order of chivalry to which I\r\nbelong, and the vow I took therein to give aid to those in need and\r\nunder the oppression of the strong. But as I know that it is a mark of\r\nprudence not to do by foul means what may be done by fair, I will ask\r\nthese gentlemen, the guards and commissary, to be so good as to release\r\nyou and let you go in peace, as there will be no lack of others to\r\nserve the king under more favourable circumstances; for it seems to me\r\na hard case to make slaves of those whom God and nature have made free.\r\nMoreover, sirs of the guard,\xe2\x80\x9d added Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthese poor fellows\r\nhave done nothing to you; let each answer for his own sins yonder;\r\nthere is a God in Heaven who will not forget to punish the wicked or\r\nreward the good; and it is not fitting that honest men should be the\r\ninstruments of punishment to others, they being therein no way\r\nconcerned. This request I make thus gently and quietly, that, if you\r\ncomply with it, I may have reason for thanking you; and, if you will\r\nnot voluntarily, this lance and sword together with the might of my arm\r\nshall compel you to comply with it by force.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNice nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said the commissary; \xe2\x80\x9ca fine piece of pleasantry he\r\nhas come out with at last! He wants us to let the king\xe2\x80\x99s prisoners go,\r\nas if we had any authority to release them, or he to order us to do so!\r\nGo your way, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got on your head, and don\xe2\x80\x99t go looking for three feet on a cat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, and\r\nacting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him\r\ntime to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with\r\na lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had\r\nthe musket. The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this\r\nunexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on horseback\r\nseized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked Don\r\nQuixote, who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it\r\nwould have gone badly with him if the galley slaves, seeing the chance\r\nbefore them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving\r\nto break the chain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion,\r\nthat the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking\r\nloose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing\r\nat all that was of any use. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to\r\nrelease Gines de Pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon the\r\nplain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary,\r\ntook from him his sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and\r\nlevelling at another, he, without ever discharging it, drove every one\r\nof the guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escape\r\nPasamonte\xe2\x80\x99s musket, as the showers of stones the now released galley\r\nslaves were raining upon them. Sancho was greatly grieved at the\r\naffair, because he anticipated that those who had fled would report the\r\nmatter to the Holy Brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bell\r\nwould at once sally forth in quest of the offenders; and he said so to\r\nhis master, and entreated him to leave the place at once, and go into\r\nhiding in the sierra that was close by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know what must be\r\ndone now;\xe2\x80\x9d and calling together all the galley slaves, who were now\r\nrunning riot, and had stripped the commissary to the skin, he collected\r\nthem round him to hear what he had to say, and addressed them as\r\nfollows: \xe2\x80\x9cTo be grateful for benefits received is the part of persons\r\nof good birth, and one of the sins most offensive to God is\r\ningratitude; I say so because, sirs, ye have already seen by manifest\r\nproof the benefit ye have received of me; in return for which I desire,\r\nand it is my good pleasure that, laden with that chain which I have\r\ntaken off your necks, ye at once set out and proceed to the city of El\r\nToboso, and there present yourselves before the lady Dulcinea del\r\nToboso, and say to her that her knight, he of the Rueful Countenance,\r\nsends to commend himself to her; and that ye recount to her in full\r\ndetail all the particulars of this notable adventure, up to the\r\nrecovery of your longed-for liberty; and this done ye may go where ye\r\nwill, and good fortune attend you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGines de Pasamonte made answer for all, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThat which you, sir,\r\nour deliverer, demand of us, is of all impossibilities the most\r\nimpossible to comply with, because we cannot go together along the\r\nroads, but only singly and separate, and each one his own way,\r\nendeavouring to hide ourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape the\r\nHoly Brotherhood, which, no doubt, will come out in search of us. What\r\nyour worship may do, and fairly do, is to change this service and\r\ntribute as regards the lady Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity\r\nof ave-marias and credos which we will say for your worship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintention, and this is a condition that can be complied with by night\r\nas by day, running or resting, in peace or in war; but to imagine that\r\nwe are going now to return to the flesh-pots of Egypt, I mean to take\r\nup our chain and set out for El Toboso, is to imagine that it is now\r\nnight, though it is not yet ten in the morning, and to ask this of us\r\nis like asking pears of the elm tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen by all that\xe2\x80\x99s good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon son of a bitch, Don Ginesillo de Paropillo, or whatever your name\r\nis, you will have to go yourself alone, with your tail between your\r\nlegs and the whole chain on your back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughly\r\nconvinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he had\r\ncommitted such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused in\r\nthis fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they\r\nbegan to shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quite\r\nunable to protect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no more\r\nheeded the spur than if he had been made of brass. Sancho planted\r\nhimself behind his ass, and with him sheltered himself from the\r\nhailstorm that poured on both of them. Don Quixote was unable to shield\r\nhimself so well but that more pebbles than I could count struck him\r\nfull on the body with such force that they brought him to the ground;\r\nand the instant he fell the student pounced upon him, snatched the\r\nbasin from his head, and with it struck three or four blows on his\r\nshoulders, and as many more on the ground, knocking it almost to\r\npieces. They then stripped him of a jacket that he wore over his\r\narmour, and they would have stripped off his stockings if his greaves\r\nhad not prevented them. From Sancho they took his coat, leaving him in\r\nhis shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves the remaining spoils\r\nof the battle, they went each one his own way, more solicitous about\r\nkeeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they dreaded, than about\r\nburdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselves\r\nbefore the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. The ass and Rocinante, Sancho and\r\nDon Quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with\r\ndrooping head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he\r\nthought the storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over;\r\nRocinante stretched beside his master, for he too had been brought to\r\nthe ground by a stone; Sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the\r\nHoly Brotherhood; and Don Quixote fuming to find himself so served by\r\nthe very persons for whom he had done so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc22e.jpg (44K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nOF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE SIERRA MORENA, WHICH WAS ONE OF THE\r\nRAREST ADVENTURES RELATED IN THIS VERACIOUS HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc23a.jpg (148K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeing himself served in this way, Don Quixote said to his squire, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave always heard it said, Sancho, that to do good to boors is to throw\r\nwater into the sea. If I had believed thy words, I should have avoided\r\nthis trouble; but it is done now, it is only to have patience and take\r\nwarning for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc23b.jpg (318K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nSancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, as you say this mischief might have been avoided if you\r\nhad believed me, believe me now, and a still greater one will be\r\navoided; for I tell you chivalry is of no account with the Holy\r\nBrotherhood, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t care two maravedis for all the\r\nknights-errant in the world; and I can tell you I fancy I hear their\r\narrows whistling past my ears this minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art a coward by nature, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut lest thou\r\nshouldst say I am obstinate, and that I never do as thou dost advise,\r\nthis once I will take thy advice, and withdraw out of reach of that\r\nfury thou so dreadest; but it must be on one condition, that never, in\r\nlife or in death, thou art to say to anyone that I retired or withdrew\r\nfrom this danger out of fear, but only in compliance with thy\r\nentreaties; for if thou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie therein, and\r\nfrom this time to that, and from that to this, I give thee lie, and say\r\nthou liest and wilt lie every time thou thinkest or sayest it; and\r\nanswer me not again; for at the mere thought that I am withdrawing or\r\nretiring from any danger, above all from this, which does seem to carry\r\nsome little shadow of fear with it, I am ready to take my stand here\r\nand await alone, not only that Holy Brotherhood you talk of and dread,\r\nbut the brothers of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the Seven\r\nMaccabees, and Castor and Pollux, and all the brothers and brotherhoods\r\nin the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cto retire is not to flee, and there is no\r\nwisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope, and it is the part of\r\nwise men to preserve themselves to-day for to-morrow, and not risk all\r\nin one day; and let me tell you, though I am a clown and a boor, I have\r\ngot some notion of what they call safe conduct; so repent not of having\r\ntaken my advice, but mount Rocinante if you can, and if not I will help\r\nyou; and follow me, for my mother-wit tells me we have more need of\r\nlegs than hands just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote mounted without replying, and, Sancho leading the way on\r\nhis ass, they entered the side of the Sierra Morena, which was close\r\nby, as it was Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s design to cross it entirely and come out again\r\nat El Viso or Almod\xc3\xb3var del Campo, and hide for some days among its\r\ncrags so as to escape the search of the Brotherhood should they come to\r\nlook for them. He was encouraged in this by perceiving that the stock\r\nof provisions carried by the ass had come safe out of the fray with the\r\ngalley slaves, a circumstance that he regarded as a miracle, seeing how\r\nthey pillaged and ransacked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc23c.jpg (297K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night they reached the very heart of the Sierra Morena, where it\r\nseemed prudent to Sancho to pass the night and even some days, at least\r\nas many as the stores he carried might last, and so they encamped\r\nbetween two rocks and among some cork trees; but fatal destiny, which,\r\naccording to the opinion of those who have not the light of the true\r\nfaith, directs, arranges, and settles everything in its own way, so\r\nordered it that Gines de Pasamonte, the famous knave and thief who by\r\nthe virtue and madness of Don Quixote had been released from the chain,\r\ndriven by fear of the Holy Brotherhood, which he had good reason to\r\ndread, resolved to take hiding in the mountains; and his fate and fear\r\nled him to the same spot to which Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had been\r\nled by theirs, just in time to recognise them and leave them to fall\r\nasleep: and as the wicked are always ungrateful, and necessity leads to\r\nevildoing, and immediate advantage overcomes all considerations of the\r\nfuture, Gines, who was neither grateful nor well-principled, made up\r\nhis mind to steal Sancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s ass, not troubling himself about\r\nRocinante, as being a prize that was no good either to pledge or sell.\r\nWhile Sancho slept he stole his ass, and before day dawned he was far\r\nout of reach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc23d.jpg (256K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAurora made her appearance bringing gladness to the earth but sadness\r\nto Sancho Panza, for he found that his Dapple was missing, and seeing\r\nhimself bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful lament in\r\nthe world, so loud that Don Quixote awoke at his exclamations and heard\r\nhim saying, \xe2\x80\x9cO son of my bowels, born in my very house, my children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplaything, my wife\xe2\x80\x99s joy, the envy of my neighbours, relief of my\r\nburdens, and lastly, half supporter of myself, for with the\r\nsix-and-twenty maravedis thou didst earn me daily I met half my\r\ncharges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote, when he heard the lament and learned the cause, consoled\r\nSancho with the best arguments he could, entreating him to be patient,\r\nand promising to give him a letter of exchange ordering three out of\r\nfive ass-colts that he had at home to be given to him. Sancho took\r\ncomfort at this, dried his tears, suppressed his sobs, and returned\r\nthanks for the kindness shown him by Don Quixote. He on his part was\r\nrejoiced to the heart on entering the mountains, as they seemed to him\r\nto be just the place for the adventures he was in quest of. They\r\nbrought back to his memory the marvellous adventures that had befallen\r\nknights-errant in like solitudes and wilds, and he went along\r\nreflecting on these things, so absorbed and carried away by them that\r\nhe had no thought for anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc23e.jpg (280K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNor had Sancho any other care (now that he fancied he was travelling in\r\na safe quarter) than to satisfy his appetite with such remains as were\r\nleft of the clerical spoils, and so he marched behind his master laden\r\nwith what Dapple used to carry, emptying the sack and packing his\r\npaunch, and so long as he could go that way, he would not have given a\r\nfarthing to meet with another adventure.\r\n\r\nWhile so engaged he raised his eyes and saw that his master had halted,\r\nand was trying with the point of his pike to lift some bulky object\r\nthat lay upon the ground, on which he hastened to join him and help him\r\nif it were needful, and reached him just as with the point of the pike\r\nhe was raising a saddle-pad with a valise attached to it, half or\r\nrather wholly rotten and torn; but so heavy were they that Sancho had\r\nto help to take them up, and his master directed him to see what the\r\nvalise contained. Sancho did so with great alacrity, and though the\r\nvalise was secured by a chain and padlock, from its torn and rotten\r\ncondition he was able to see its contents, which were four shirts of\r\nfine holland, and other articles of linen no less curious than clean;\r\nand in a handkerchief he found a good lot of gold crowns, and as soon\r\nas he saw them he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good for\r\nsomething!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSearching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound; this\r\nDon Quixote asked of him, telling him to take the money and keep it for\r\nhimself. Sancho kissed his hands for the favour, and cleared the valise\r\nof its linen, which he stowed away in the provision sack. Considering\r\nthe whole matter, Don Quixote observed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me, Sancho\xe2\x80\x94and it is impossible it can be otherwise\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nsome strayed traveller must have crossed this sierra and been attacked\r\nand slain by footpads, who brought him to this remote spot to bury\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat cannot be,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause if they had been robbers\r\nthey would not have left this money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand I cannot guess or explain what\r\nthis may mean; but stay; let us see if in this memorandum book there is\r\nanything written by which we may be able to trace out or discover what\r\nwe want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened it, and the first thing he found in it, written roughly but\r\nin a very good hand, was a sonnet, and reading it aloud that Sancho\r\nmight hear it, he found that it ran as follows:\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\nOr Love is lacking in intelligence,\r\nOr to the height of cruelty attains,\r\nOr else it is my doom to suffer pains\r\nBeyond the measure due to my offence.\r\nBut if Love be a God, it follows thence\r\nThat he knows all, and certain it remains\r\nNo God loves cruelty; then who ordains\r\nThis penance that enthrals while it torments?\r\nIt were a falsehood, Chloe, thee to name;\r\nSuch evil with such goodness cannot live;\r\nAnd against Heaven I dare not charge the blame,\r\nI only know it is my fate to die.\r\nTo him who knows not whence his malady\r\nA miracle alone a cure can give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc23f.jpg (344K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to be learned from that rhyme,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cunless\r\nby that clue there\xe2\x80\x99s in it, one may draw out the ball of the whole\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat clue is there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought your worship spoke of a clue in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only said Chloe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand that no doubt, is the\r\nname of the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains; and,\r\nfaith, he must be a tolerable poet, or I know little of the craft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen your worship understands rhyming too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd better than thou thinkest,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cas thou shalt\r\nsee when thou carriest a letter written in verse from beginning to end\r\nto my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, for I would have thee know, Sancho,\r\nthat all or most of the knights-errant in days of yore were great\r\ntroubadours and great musicians, for both of these accomplishments, or\r\nmore properly speaking gifts, are the peculiar property of\r\nlovers-errant: true it is that the verses of the knights of old have\r\nmore spirit than neatness in them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead more, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will find something\r\nthat will enlighten us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote turned the page and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is prose and seems to be a\r\nletter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA correspondence letter, se\xc3\xb1or?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the beginning it seems to be a love letter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let your worship read it aloud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am very fond\r\nof love matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, and reading it aloud as Sancho\r\nhad requested him, he found it ran thus:\r\n\r\nThy false promise and my sure misfortune carry me to a place whence the\r\nnews of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint.\r\nUngrateful one, thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy, but not\r\nmore worthy; but if virtue were esteemed wealth I should neither envy\r\nthe fortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my own. What thy\r\nbeauty raised up thy deeds have laid low; by it I believed thee to be\r\nan angel, by them I know thou art a woman. Peace be with thee who hast\r\nsent war to me, and Heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever\r\nhidden from thee, so that thou repent not of what thou hast done, and I\r\nreap not a revenge I would not have.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished the letter, Don Quixote said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is less to be\r\ngathered from this than from the verses, except that he who wrote it is\r\nsome rejected lover;\xe2\x80\x9d and turning over nearly all the pages of the book\r\nhe found more verses and letters, some of which he could read, while\r\nothers he could not; but they were all made up of complaints, laments,\r\nmisgivings, desires and aversions, favours and rejections, some\r\nrapturous, some doleful. While Don Quixote examined the book, Sancho\r\nexamined the valise, not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in the\r\npad that he did not search, peer into, and explore, or seam that he did\r\nnot rip, or tuft of wool that he did not pick to pieces, lest anything\r\nshould escape for want of care and pains; so keen was the covetousness\r\nexcited in him by the discovery of the crowns, which amounted to near a\r\nhundred; and though he found no more booty, he held the blanket\r\nflights, balsam vomits, stake benedictions, carriers\xe2\x80\x99 fisticuffs,\r\nmissing alforjas, stolen coat, and all the hunger, thirst, and\r\nweariness he had endured in the service of his good master, cheap at\r\nthe price; as he considered himself more than fully indemnified for all\r\nby the payment he received in the gift of the treasure-trove.\r\n\r\nThe Knight of the Rueful Countenance was still very anxious to find out\r\nwho the owner of the valise could be, conjecturing from the sonnet and\r\nletter, from the money in gold, and from the fineness of the shirts,\r\nthat he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of\r\nhis lady had driven to some desperate course; but as in that\r\nuninhabited and rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he\r\ncould inquire, he saw nothing else for it but to push on, taking\r\nwhatever road Rocinante chose\xe2\x80\x94which was where he could make his\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94firmly persuaded that among these wilds he could not fail to meet\r\nsome rare adventure. As he went along, then, occupied with these\r\nthoughts, he perceived on the summit of a height that rose before their\r\neyes a man who went springing from rock to rock and from tussock to\r\ntussock with marvellous agility. As well as he could make out he was\r\nunclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled hair, and bare legs and\r\nfeet, his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny velvet\r\nbut so ragged that they showed his skin in several places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc23g.jpg (360K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he\r\npassed as has been described, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance\r\nobserved and noted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt,\r\nhe was unable to follow him, for it was not granted to the feebleness\r\nof Rocinante to make way over such rough ground, he being, moreover,\r\nslow-paced and sluggish by nature. Don Quixote at once came to the\r\nconclusion that this was the owner of the saddle-pad and of the valise,\r\nand made up his mind to go in search of him, even though he should have\r\nto wander a year in those mountains before he found him, and so he\r\ndirected Sancho to take a short cut over one side of the mountain,\r\nwhile he himself went by the other, and perhaps by this means they\r\nmight light upon this man who had passed so quickly out of their sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not do that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor when I separate from your\r\nworship fear at once lays hold of me, and assails me with all sorts of\r\npanics and fancies; and let what I now say be a notice that from this\r\ntime forth I am not going to stir a finger\xe2\x80\x99s width from your presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Rueful Countenance, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am very\r\nglad that thou art willing to rely on my courage, which will never fail\r\nthee, even though the soul in thy body fail thee; so come on now behind\r\nme slowly as well as thou canst, and make lanterns of thine eyes; let\r\nus make the circuit of this ridge; perhaps we shall light upon this man\r\nthat we saw, who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Sancho made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cFar better would it be not to look for\r\nhim, for, if we find him, and he happens to be the owner of the money,\r\nit is plain I must restore it; it would be better, therefore, that\r\nwithout taking this needless trouble, I should keep possession of it\r\nuntil in some other less meddlesome and officious way the real owner\r\nmay be discovered; and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it,\r\nand then the king will hold me harmless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art wrong there, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor now that we have\r\na suspicion who the owner is, and have him almost before us, we are\r\nbound to seek him and make restitution; and if we do not see him, the\r\nstrong suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty\r\nas if he were so; and so, friend Sancho, let not our search for him\r\ngive thee any uneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and Sancho followed him on\r\nfoot and loaded, and after having partly made the circuit of the\r\nmountain they found lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogs\r\nand pecked by jackdaws, a mule saddled and bridled, all which still\r\nfurther strengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the owner\r\nof the mule and the saddle-pad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc23h.jpg (381K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a\r\nshepherd watching his flock, and suddenly on their left there appeared\r\na great number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain\r\nthe goatherd in charge of them, a man advanced in years. Don Quixote\r\ncalled aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood. He\r\nshouted in return, asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom or\r\nnever trodden except by the feet of goats, or of the wolves and other\r\nwild beasts that roamed around. Sancho in return bade him come down,\r\nand they would explain all to him.\r\n\r\nThe goatherd descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood,\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead\r\nin the hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these six\r\nmonths; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have come upon nobody,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cnor on anything\r\nexcept a saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far from\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found it too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the goatherd, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I would not lift it nor go\r\nnear it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for the\r\ndevil is crafty, and things rise up under one\xe2\x80\x99s feet to make one fall\r\nwithout knowing why or wherefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI found it too, and I would\r\nnot go within a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw of it; there I left it, and there it lies\r\njust as it was, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t want a dog with a bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, good man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know who is the owner of\r\nthis property?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the goatherd, \xe2\x80\x9cis that about six months ago,\r\nmore or less, there arrived at a shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s hut three leagues, perhaps,\r\naway from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted on\r\nthat same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad and\r\nvalise which you say you found and did not touch. He asked us what part\r\nof this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it was\r\nwhere we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half a\r\nleague farther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; and\r\nI am wondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no road\r\nor path that leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing our\r\nanswer the youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out to\r\nhim, leaving us all charmed with his good looks, and wondering at his\r\nquestion and the haste with which we saw him depart in the direction of\r\nthe sierra; and after that we saw him no more, until some days\r\nafterwards he crossed the path of one of our shepherds, and without\r\nsaying a word to him, came up to him and gave him several cuffs and\r\nkicks, and then turned to the ass with our provisions and took all the\r\nbread and cheese it carried, and having done this made off back again\r\ninto the sierra with extraordinary swiftness. When some of us goatherds\r\nlearned this we went in search of him for about two days through the\r\nmost remote portion of this sierra, at the end of which we found him\r\nlodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. He came out to meet us\r\nwith great gentleness, with his dress now torn and his face so\r\ndisfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him but\r\nthat his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection we\r\nhad of them, that he was the person we were looking for. He saluted us\r\ncourteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not to wonder at\r\nseeing him going about in this guise, as it was binding upon him in\r\norder that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had been\r\nimposed upon him. We asked him to tell us who he was, but we were never\r\nable to find out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in want of\r\nfood, which he could not do without, to tell us where we should find\r\nhim, as we would bring it to him with all good-will and readiness; or\r\nif this were not to his taste, at least to come and ask it of us and\r\nnot take it by force from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer,\r\nbegged pardon for the late assault, and promised for the future to ask\r\nit in God\xe2\x80\x99s name without offering violence to anybody. As for fixed\r\nabode, he said he had no other than that which chance offered wherever\r\nnight might overtake him; and his words ended in an outburst of weeping\r\nso bitter that we who listened to him must have been very stones had we\r\nnot joined him in it, comparing what we saw of him the first time with\r\nwhat we saw now; for, as I said, he was a graceful and gracious youth,\r\nand in his courteous and polished language showed himself to be of good\r\nbirth and courtly breeding, and rustics as we were that listened to\r\nhim, even to our rusticity his gentle bearing sufficed to make it\r\nplain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent,\r\nkeeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time, during which we\r\nstood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this\r\nabstraction; and with no little pity, for from his behaviour, now\r\nstaring at the ground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving\r\nan eyelid, again closing them, compressing his lips and raising his\r\neyebrows, we could perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kind\r\nhad come upon him; and before long he showed that what we imagined was\r\nthe truth, for he arose in a fury from the ground where he had thrown\r\nhimself, and attacked the first he found near him with such rage and\r\nfierceness that if we had not dragged him off him, he would have beaten\r\nor bitten him to death, all the while exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98Oh faithless\r\nFernando, here, here shalt thou pay the penalty of the wrong thou hast\r\ndone me; these hands shall tear out that heart of thine, abode and\r\ndwelling of all iniquity, but of deceit and fraud above all; and to\r\nthese he added other words all in effect upbraiding this Fernando and\r\ncharging him with treachery and faithlessness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty, and\r\nwithout another word he left us, and rushing off plunged in among these\r\nbrakes and brambles, so as to make it impossible for us to follow him;\r\nfrom this we suppose that madness comes upon him from time to time, and\r\nthat someone called Fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievous\r\nnature such as the condition to which it had brought him seemed to\r\nshow. All this has been since then confirmed on those occasions, and\r\nthey have been many, on which he has crossed our path, at one time to\r\nbeg the shepherds to give him some of the food they carry, at another\r\nto take it from them by force; for when there is a fit of madness upon\r\nhim, even though the shepherds offer it freely, he will not accept it\r\nbut snatches it from them by dint of blows; but when he is in his\r\nsenses he begs it for the love of God, courteously and civilly, and\r\nreceives it with many thanks and not a few tears. And to tell you the\r\ntruth, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the goatherd, \xe2\x80\x9cit was yesterday that we\r\nresolved, I and four of the lads, two of them our servants, and the\r\nother two friends of mine, to go in search of him until we find him,\r\nand when we do to take him, whether by force or of his own consent, to\r\nthe town of Almod\xc3\xb3var, which is eight leagues from this, and there\r\nstrive to cure him (if indeed his malady admits of a cure), or learn\r\nwhen he is in his senses who he is, and if he has relatives to whom we\r\nmay give notice of his misfortune. This, sirs, is all I can say in\r\nanswer to what you have asked me; and be sure that the owner of the\r\narticles you found is he whom you saw pass by with such nimbleness and\r\nso naked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor Don Quixote had already described how he had seen the man go\r\nbounding along the mountainside, and he was now filled with amazement\r\nat what he heard from the goatherd, and more eager than ever to\r\ndiscover who the unhappy madman was; and in his heart he resolved, as\r\nhe had done before, to search for him all over the mountain, not\r\nleaving a corner or cave unexamined until he had found him. But chance\r\narranged matters better than he expected or hoped, for at that very\r\nmoment, in a gorge on the mountain that opened where they stood, the\r\nyouth he wished to find made his appearance, coming along talking to\r\nhimself in a way that would have been unintelligible near at hand, much\r\nmore at a distance. His garb was what has been described, save that as\r\nhe drew near, Don Quixote perceived that a tattered doublet which he\r\nwore was amber-tanned, from which he concluded that one who wore such\r\ngarments could not be of very low rank.\r\n\r\nApproaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice\r\nbut with great courtesy. Don Quixote returned his salutation with equal\r\npoliteness, and dismounting from Rocinante advanced with well-bred\r\nbearing and grace to embrace him, and held him for some time close in\r\nhis arms as if he had known him for a long time. The other, whom we may\r\ncall the Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance, as Don Quixote was of the\r\nRueful, after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and,\r\nplacing his hands on Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, stood gazing at him as if\r\nseeking to see whether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at the\r\nsight of the face, figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixote\r\nwas at the sight of him. To be brief, the first to speak after\r\nembracing was the Ragged One, and he said what will be told farther on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc23i.jpg (53K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nIN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIERRA MORENA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc24a.jpg (151K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history relates that it was with the greatest attention Don Quixote\r\nlistened to the ragged knight of the Sierra, who began by saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf a surety, se\xc3\xb1or, whoever you are, for I know you not, I thank you\r\nfor the proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me, and would I\r\nwere in a condition to requite with something more than good-will that\r\nwhich you have displayed towards me in the cordial reception you have\r\ngiven me; but my fate does not afford me any other means of returning\r\nkindnesses done me save the hearty desire to repay them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cis to be of service to you, so much so\r\nthat I had resolved not to quit these mountains until I had found you,\r\nand learned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found for\r\nthat sorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem to\r\nlabour; and to search for you with all possible diligence, if search\r\nhad been necessary. And if your misfortune should prove to be one of\r\nthose that refuse admission to any sort of consolation, it was my\r\npurpose to join you in lamenting and mourning over it, so far as I\r\ncould; for it is still some comfort in misfortune to find one who can\r\nfeel for it. And if my good intentions deserve to be acknowledged with\r\nany kind of courtesy, I entreat you, se\xc3\xb1or, by that which I perceive\r\nyou possess in so high a degree, and likewise conjure you by whatever\r\nyou love or have loved best in life, to tell me who you are and the\r\ncause that has brought you to live or die in these solitudes like a\r\nbrute beast, dwelling among them in a manner so foreign to your\r\ncondition as your garb and appearance show. And I swear,\xe2\x80\x9d added Don\r\nQuixote, \xe2\x80\x9cby the order of knighthood which I have received, and by my\r\nvocation of knight-errant, if you gratify me in this, to serve you with\r\nall the zeal my calling demands of me, either in relieving your\r\nmisfortune if it admits of relief, or in joining you in lamenting it as\r\nI promised to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Knight of the Thicket, hearing him of the Rueful Countenance talk\r\nin this strain, did nothing but stare at him, and stare at him again,\r\nand again survey him from head to foot; and when he had thoroughly\r\nexamined him, he said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have anything to give me to eat, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake give it me, and\r\nafter I have eaten I will do all you ask in acknowledgment of the\r\ngoodwill you have displayed towards me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho from his sack, and the goatherd from his pouch, furnished the\r\nRagged One with the means of appeasing his hunger, and what they gave\r\nhim he ate like a half-witted being, so hastily that he took no time\r\nbetween mouthfuls, gorging rather than swallowing; and while he ate\r\nneither he nor they who observed him uttered a word. As soon as he had\r\ndone he made signs to them to follow him, which they did, and he led\r\nthem to a green plot which lay a little farther off round the corner of\r\na rock. On reaching it he stretched himself upon the grass, and the\r\nothers did the same, all keeping silence, until the Ragged One,\r\nsettling himself in his place, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is your wish, sirs, that I should disclose in a few words the\r\nsurpassing extent of my misfortunes, you must promise not to break the\r\nthread of my sad story with any question or other interruption, for the\r\ninstant you do so the tale I tell will come to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words of the Ragged One reminded Don Quixote of the tale his\r\nsquire had told him, when he failed to keep count of the goats that had\r\ncrossed the river and the story remained unfinished; but to return to\r\nthe Ragged One, he went on to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give you this warning because I wish to pass briefly over the story\r\nof my misfortunes, for recalling them to memory only serves to add\r\nfresh ones, and the less you question me the sooner shall I make an end\r\nof the recital, though I shall not omit to relate anything of\r\nimportance in order fully to satisfy your curiosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote gave the promise for himself and the others, and with this\r\nassurance he began as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Cardenio, my birthplace one of the best cities of this\r\nAndalusia, my family noble, my parents rich, my misfortune so great\r\nthat my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without\r\nbeing able by their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune can\r\ndo little to relieve reverses sent by Heaven. In that same country\r\nthere was a heaven in which love had placed all the glory I could\r\ndesire; such was the beauty of Luscinda, a damsel as noble and as rich\r\nas I, but of happier fortunes, and of less firmness than was due to so\r\nworthy a passion as mine. This Luscinda I loved, worshipped, and adored\r\nfrom my earliest and tenderest years, and she loved me in all the\r\ninnocence and sincerity of childhood. Our parents were aware of our\r\nfeelings, and were not sorry to perceive them, for they saw clearly\r\nthat as they ripened they must lead at last to a marriage between us, a\r\nthing that seemed almost prearranged by the equality of our families\r\nand wealth. We grew up, and with our growth grew the love between us,\r\nso that the father of Luscinda felt bound for propriety\xe2\x80\x99s sake to\r\nrefuse me admission to his house, in this perhaps imitating the parents\r\nof that Thisbe so celebrated by the poets, and this refusal but added\r\nlove to love and flame to flame; for though they enforced silence upon\r\nour tongues they could not impose it upon our pens, which can make\r\nknown the heart\xe2\x80\x99s secrets to a loved one more freely than tongues; for\r\nmany a time the presence of the object of love shakes the firmest will\r\nand strikes dumb the boldest tongue. Ah heavens! how many letters did I\r\nwrite her, and how many dainty modest replies did I receive! how many\r\nditties and love-songs did I compose in which my heart declared and\r\nmade known its feelings, described its ardent longings, revelled in its\r\nrecollections and dallied with its desires! At length growing impatient\r\nand feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her, I resolved to\r\nput into execution and carry out what seemed to me the best mode of\r\nwinning my desired and merited reward, to ask her of her father for my\r\nlawful wife, which I did. To this his answer was that he thanked me for\r\nthe disposition I showed to do honour to him and to regard myself as\r\nhonoured by the bestowal of his treasure; but that as my father was\r\nalive it was his by right to make this demand, for if it were not in\r\naccordance with his full will and pleasure, Luscinda was not to be\r\ntaken or given by stealth. I thanked him for his kindness, reflecting\r\nthat there was reason in what he said, and that my father would assent\r\nto it as soon as I should tell him, and with that view I went the very\r\nsame instant to let him know what my desires were. When I entered the\r\nroom where he was I found him with an open letter in his hand, which,\r\nbefore I could utter a word, he gave me, saying, \xe2\x80\x98By this letter thou\r\nwilt see, Cardenio, the disposition the Duke Ricardo has to serve\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x99 This Duke Ricardo, as you, sirs, probably know already, is a\r\ngrandee of Spain who has his seat in the best part of this Andalusia. I\r\ntook and read the letter, which was couched in terms so flattering that\r\neven I myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to comply with\r\nthe request the duke made in it, which was that he would send me\r\nimmediately to him, as he wished me to become the companion, not\r\nservant, of his eldest son, and would take upon himself the charge of\r\nplacing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he held\r\nme. On reading the letter my voice failed me, and still more when I\r\nheard my father say, \xe2\x80\x98Two days hence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, in\r\naccordance with the duke\xe2\x80\x99s wish, and give thanks to God who is opening\r\na road to thee by which thou mayest attain what I know thou dost\r\ndeserve; and to these words he added others of fatherly counsel. The\r\ntime for my departure arrived; I spoke one night to Luscinda, I told\r\nher all that had occurred, as I did also to her father, entreating him\r\nto allow some delay, and to defer the disposal of her hand until I\r\nshould see what the Duke Ricardo sought of me: he gave me the promise,\r\nand she confirmed it with vows and swoonings unnumbered. Finally, I\r\npresented myself to the duke, and was received and treated by him so\r\nkindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the old servants\r\ngrowing envious of me, and regarding the duke\xe2\x80\x99s inclination to show me\r\nfavour as an injury to themselves. But the one to whom my arrival gave\r\nthe greatest pleasure was the duke\xe2\x80\x99s second son, Fernando by name, a\r\ngallant youth, of noble, generous, and amorous disposition, who very\r\nsoon made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody;\r\nfor though the elder was attached to me, and showed me kindness, he did\r\nnot carry his affectionate treatment to the same length as Don\r\nFernando. It so happened, then, that as between friends no secret\r\nremains unshared, and as the favour I enjoyed with Don Fernando had\r\ngrown into friendship, he made all his thoughts known to me, and in\r\nparticular a love affair which troubled his mind a little. He was\r\ndeeply in love with a peasant girl, a vassal of his father\xe2\x80\x99s, the\r\ndaughter of wealthy parents, and herself so beautiful, modest,\r\ndiscreet, and virtuous, that no one who knew her was able to decide in\r\nwhich of these respects she was most highly gifted or most excelled.\r\nThe attractions of the fair peasant raised the passion of Don Fernando\r\nto such a point that, in order to gain his object and overcome her\r\nvirtuous resolutions, he determined to pledge his word to her to become\r\nher husband, for to attempt it in any other way was to attempt an\r\nimpossibility. Bound to him as I was by friendship, I strove by the\r\nbest arguments and the most forcible examples I could think of to\r\nrestrain and dissuade him from such a course; but perceiving I produced\r\nno effect I resolved to make the Duke Ricardo, his father, acquainted\r\nwith the matter; but Don Fernando, being sharp-witted and shrewd,\r\nforesaw and apprehended this, perceiving that by my duty as a good\r\nservant I was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed to\r\nthe honour of my lord the duke; and so, to mislead and deceive me, he\r\ntold me he could find no better way of effacing from his mind the\r\nbeauty that so enslaved him than by absenting himself for some months,\r\nand that he wished the absence to be effected by our going, both of us,\r\nto my father\xe2\x80\x99s house under the pretence, which he would make to the\r\nduke, of going to see and buy some fine horses that there were in my\r\ncity, which produces the best in the world. When I heard him say so,\r\neven if his resolution had not been so good a one I should have hailed\r\nit as one of the happiest that could be imagined, prompted by my\r\naffection, seeing what a favourable chance and opportunity it offered\r\nme of returning to see my Luscinda. With this thought and wish I\r\ncommended his idea and encouraged his design, advising him to put it\r\ninto execution as quickly as possible, as, in truth, absence produced\r\nits effect in spite of the most deeply rooted feelings. But, as\r\nafterwards appeared, when he said this to me he had already enjoyed the\r\npeasant girl under the title of husband, and was waiting for an\r\nopportunity of making it known with safety to himself, being in dread\r\nof what his father the duke would do when he came to know of his folly.\r\nIt happened, then, that as with young men love is for the most part\r\nnothing more than appetite, which, as its final object is enjoyment,\r\ncomes to an end on obtaining it, and that which seemed to be love takes\r\nto flight, as it cannot pass the limit fixed by nature, which fixes no\r\nlimit to true love\xe2\x80\x94what I mean is that after Don Fernando had enjoyed\r\nthis peasant girl his passion subsided and his eagerness cooled, and if\r\nat first he feigned a wish to absent himself in order to cure his love,\r\nhe was now in reality anxious to go to avoid keeping his promise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe duke gave him permission, and ordered me to accompany him; we\r\narrived at my city, and my father gave him the reception due to his\r\nrank; I saw Luscinda without delay, and, though it had not been dead or\r\ndeadened, my love gathered fresh life. To my sorrow I told the story of\r\nit to Don Fernando, for I thought that in virtue of the great\r\nfriendship he bore me I was bound to conceal nothing from him. I\r\nextolled her beauty, her gaiety, her wit, so warmly, that my praises\r\nexcited in him a desire to see a damsel adorned by such attractions. To\r\nmy misfortune I yielded to it, showing her to him one night by the\r\nlight of a taper at a window where we used to talk to one another. As\r\nshe appeared to him in her dressing-gown, she drove all the beauties he\r\nhad seen until then out of his recollection; speech failed him, his\r\nhead turned, he was spell-bound, and in the end love-smitten, as you\r\nwill see in the course of the story of my misfortune; and to inflame\r\nstill further his passion, which he hid from me and revealed to Heaven\r\nalone, it so happened that one day he found a note of hers entreating\r\nme to demand her of her father in marriage, so delicate, so modest, and\r\nso tender, that on reading it he told me that in Luscinda alone were\r\ncombined all the charms of beauty and understanding that were\r\ndistributed among all the other women in the world. It is true, and I\r\nown it now, that though I knew what good cause Don Fernando had to\r\npraise Luscinda, it gave me uneasiness to hear these praises from his\r\nmouth, and I began to fear, and with reason to feel distrust of him,\r\nfor there was no moment when he was not ready to talk of Luscinda, and\r\nhe would start the subject himself even though he dragged it in\r\nunseasonably, a circumstance that aroused in me a certain amount of\r\njealousy; not that I feared any change in the constancy or faith of\r\nLuscinda; but still my fate led me to forebode what she assured me\r\nagainst. Don Fernando contrived always to read the letters I sent to\r\nLuscinda and her answers to me, under the pretence that he enjoyed the\r\nwit and sense of both. It so happened, then, that Luscinda having\r\nbegged of me a book of chivalry to read, one that she was very fond of,\r\nAmadis of Gaul\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned, than he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the Lady\r\nLuscinda was fond of books of chivalry, no other laudation would have\r\nbeen requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding,\r\nfor it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste\r\nfor such delightful reading been wanting; so, as far as I am concerned,\r\nyou need waste no more words in describing her beauty, worth, and\r\nintelligence; for, on merely hearing what her taste was, I declare her\r\nto be the most beautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world;\r\nand I wish your worship had, along with Amadis of Gaul, sent her the\r\nworthy Don Rugel of Greece, for I know the Lady Luscinda would greatly\r\nrelish Daraida and Garaya, and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd\r\nDarinel, and the admirable verses of his bucolics, sung and delivered\r\nby him with such sprightliness, wit, and ease; but a time may come when\r\nthis omission can be remedied, and to rectify it nothing more is needed\r\nthan for your worship to be so good as to come with me to my village,\r\nfor there I can give you more than three hundred books which are the\r\ndelight of my soul and the entertainment of my life;\xe2\x80\x94though it occurs\r\nto me that I have not got one of them now, thanks to the spite of\r\nwicked and envious enchanters;\xe2\x80\x94but pardon me for having broken the\r\npromise we made not to interrupt your discourse; for when I hear\r\nchivalry or knights-errant mentioned, I can no more help talking about\r\nthem than the rays of the sun can help giving heat, or those of the\r\nmoon moisture; pardon me, therefore, and proceed, for that is more to\r\nthe purpose now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Don Quixote was saying this, Cardenio allowed his head to fall\r\nupon his breast, and seemed plunged in deep thought; and though twice\r\nDon Quixote bade him go on with his story, he neither looked up nor\r\nuttered a word in reply; but after some time he raised his head and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot get rid of the idea, nor will anyone in the world\r\nremove it, or make me think otherwise\xe2\x80\x94and he would be a blockhead who\r\nwould hold or believe anything else than that that arrant knave Master\r\nElisabad made free with Queen Madasima.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not true, by all that\xe2\x80\x99s good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote in high wrath,\r\nturning upon him angrily, as his way was; \xe2\x80\x9cand it is a very great\r\nslander, or rather villainy. Queen Madasima was a very illustrious\r\nlady, and it is not to be supposed that so exalted a princess would\r\nhave made free with a quack; and whoever maintains the contrary lies\r\nlike a great scoundrel, and I will give him to know it, on foot or on\r\nhorseback, armed or unarmed, by night or by day, or as he likes best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCardenio was looking at him steadily, and his mad fit having now come\r\nupon him, he had no disposition to go on with his story, nor would Don\r\nQuixote have listened to it, so much had what he had heard about\r\nMadasima disgusted him. Strange to say, he stood up for her as if she\r\nwere in earnest his veritable born lady; to such a pass had his unholy\r\nbooks brought him. Cardenio, then, being, as I said, now mad, when he\r\nheard himself given the lie, and called a scoundrel and other insulting\r\nnames, not relishing the jest, snatched up a stone that he found near\r\nhim, and with it delivered such a blow on Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s breast that he\r\nlaid him on his back. Sancho Panza, seeing his master treated in this\r\nfashion, attacked the madman with his closed fist; but the Ragged One\r\nreceived him in such a way that with a blow of his fist he stretched\r\nhim at his feet, and then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own\r\nsatisfaction; the goatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the same\r\nfate; and having beaten and pummelled them all he left them and quietly\r\nwithdrew to his hiding-place on the mountain. Sancho rose, and with the\r\nrage he felt at finding himself so belaboured without deserving it, ran\r\nto take vengeance on the goatherd, accusing him of not giving them\r\nwarning that this man was at times taken with a mad fit, for if they\r\nhad known it they would have been on their guard to protect themselves.\r\nThe goatherd replied that he had said so, and that if he had not heard\r\nhim, that was no fault of his. Sancho retorted, and the goatherd\r\nrejoined, and the altercation ended in their seizing each other by the\r\nbeard, and exchanging such fisticuffs that if Don Quixote had not made\r\npeace between them, they would have knocked one another to pieces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho,\r\ngrappling with the goatherd, \xe2\x80\x9cfor of this fellow, who is a clown like\r\nmyself, and no dubbed knight, I can safely take satisfaction for the\r\naffront he has offered me, fighting with him hand to hand like an\r\nhonest man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know that he is not to blame\r\nfor what has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this he pacified them, and again asked the goatherd if it would be\r\npossible to find Cardenio, as he felt the greatest anxiety to know the\r\nend of his story. The goatherd told him, as he had told him before,\r\nthat there was no knowing of a certainty where his lair was; but that\r\nif he wandered about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to\r\nfall in with him either in or out of his senses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc24e.jpg (69K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THE STOUT KNIGHT OF\r\nLA MANCHA IN THE SIERRA MORENA, AND OF HIS IMITATION OF THE PENANCE OF\r\nBELTENEBROS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc25a.jpg (168K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote took leave of the goatherd, and once more mounting\r\nRocinante bade Sancho follow him, which he having no ass, did very\r\ndiscontentedly. They proceeded slowly, making their way into the most\r\nrugged part of the mountain, Sancho all the while dying to have a talk\r\nwith his master, and longing for him to begin, so that there should be\r\nno breach of the injunction laid upon him; but unable to keep silence\r\nso long he said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, give me your worship\xe2\x80\x99s blessing and dismissal, for\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like to go home at once to my wife and children with whom I can at\r\nany rate talk and converse as much as I like; for to want me to go\r\nthrough these solitudes day and night and not speak to you when I have\r\na mind is burying me alive. If luck would have it that animals spoke as\r\nthey did in the days of Guisopete, it would not be so bad, because I\r\ncould talk to Rocinante about whatever came into my head, and so put up\r\nwith my ill-fortune; but it is a hard case, and not to be borne with\r\npatience, to go seeking adventures all one\xe2\x80\x99s life and get nothing but\r\nkicks and blanketings, brickbats and punches, and with all this to have\r\nto sew up one\xe2\x80\x99s mouth without daring to say what is in one\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\njust as if one were dumb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand thee, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthou art dying to\r\nhave the interdict I placed upon thy tongue removed; consider it\r\nremoved, and say what thou wilt while we are wandering in these\r\nmountains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9clet me speak now, for God knows what will\r\nhappen by-and-by; and to take advantage of the permit at once, I ask,\r\nwhat made your worship stand up so for that Queen Majimasa, or whatever\r\nher name is, or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of\r\nhers or not? for if your worship had let that pass\xe2\x80\x94and you were not a\r\njudge in the matter\xe2\x80\x94it is my belief the madman would have gone on with\r\nhis story, and the blow of the stone, and the kicks, and more than half\r\na dozen cuffs would have been escaped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn faith, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif thou knewest as I do what\r\nan honourable and illustrious lady Queen Madasima was, I know thou\r\nwouldst say I had great patience that I did not break in pieces the\r\nmouth that uttered such blasphemies, for a very great blasphemy it is\r\nto say or imagine that a queen has made free with a surgeon. The truth\r\nof the story is that that Master Elisabad whom the madman mentioned was\r\na man of great prudence and sound judgment, and served as governor and\r\nphysician to the queen, but to suppose that she was his mistress is\r\nnonsense deserving very severe punishment; and as a proof that Cardenio\r\ndid not know what he was saying, remember when he said it he was out of\r\nhis wits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cthere was no occasion for minding\r\nthe words of a madman; for if good luck had not helped your worship,\r\nand he had sent that stone at your head instead of at your breast, a\r\nfine way we should have been in for standing up for my lady yonder, God\r\nconfound her! And then, would not Cardenio have gone free as a madman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgainst men in their senses or against madmen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cevery knight-errant is bound to stand up for the honour of women,\r\nwhoever they may be, much more for queens of such high degree and\r\ndignity as Queen Madasima, for whom I have a particular regard on\r\naccount of her amiable qualities; for, besides being extremely\r\nbeautiful, she was very wise, and very patient under her misfortunes,\r\nof which she had many; and the counsel and society of the Master\r\nElisabad were a great help and support to her in enduring her\r\nafflictions with wisdom and resignation; hence the ignorant and\r\nill-disposed vulgar took occasion to say and think that she was his\r\nmistress; and they lie, I say it once more, and will lie two hundred\r\ntimes more, all who think and say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI neither say nor think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9clet them look to it; with\r\ntheir bread let them eat it; they have rendered account to God whether\r\nthey misbehaved or not; I come from my vineyard, I know nothing; I am\r\nnot fond of prying into other men\xe2\x80\x99s lives; he who buys and lies feels\r\nit in his purse; moreover, naked was I born, naked I find myself, I\r\nneither lose nor gain; but if they did, what is that to me? many think\r\nthere are flitches where there are no hooks; but who can put gates to\r\nthe open plain? moreover they said of God\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a set of absurdities thou art\r\nstringing together! What has what we are talking about got to do with\r\nthe proverbs thou art threading one after the other? for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake\r\nhold thy tongue, Sancho, and henceforward keep to prodding thy ass and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t meddle in what does not concern thee; and understand with all thy\r\nfive senses that everything I have done, am doing, or shall do, is well\r\nfounded on reason and in conformity with the rules of chivalry, for I\r\nunderstand them better than all the world that profess them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cis it a good rule of chivalry that we should\r\ngo astray through these mountains without path or road, looking for a\r\nmadman who when he is found will perhaps take a fancy to finish what he\r\nbegan, not his story, but your worship\xe2\x80\x99s head and my ribs, and end by\r\nbreaking them altogether for us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc25b.jpg (330K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, I say again, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor let me tell thee\r\nit is not so much the desire of finding that madman that leads me into\r\nthese regions as that which I have of performing among them an\r\nachievement wherewith I shall win eternal name and fame throughout the\r\nknown world; and it shall be such that I shall thereby set the seal on\r\nall that can make a knight-errant perfect and famous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it very perilous, this achievement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he of the Rueful Countenance; \xe2\x80\x9cthough it may be in the\r\ndice that we may throw deuce-ace instead of sixes; but all will depend\r\non thy diligence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my diligence!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor if thou dost return soon from the place\r\nwhere I mean to send thee, my penance will be soon over, and my glory\r\nwill soon begin. But as it is not right to keep thee any longer in\r\nsuspense, waiting to see what comes of my words, I would have thee\r\nknow, Sancho, that the famous Amadis of Gaul was one of the most\r\nperfect knights-errant\xe2\x80\x94I am wrong to say he was one; he stood alone,\r\nthe first, the only one, the lord of all that were in the world in his\r\ntime. A fig for Don Belianis, and for all who say he equalled him in\r\nany respect, for, my oath upon it, they are deceiving themselves! I\r\nsay, too, that when a painter desires to become famous in his art he\r\nendeavours to copy the originals of the rarest painters that he knows;\r\nand the same rule holds good for all the most important crafts and\r\ncallings that serve to adorn a state; thus must he who would be\r\nesteemed prudent and patient imitate Ulysses, in whose person and\r\nlabours Homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence and patience;\r\nas Virgil, too, shows us in the person of \xc3\x86neas the virtue of a pious\r\nson and the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain; not representing\r\nor describing them as they were, but as they ought to be, so as to\r\nleave the example of their virtues to posterity. In the same way Amadis\r\nwas the polestar, day-star, sun of valiant and devoted knights, whom\r\nall we who fight under the banner of love and chivalry are bound to\r\nimitate. This, then, being so, I consider, friend Sancho, that the\r\nknight-errant who shall imitate him most closely will come nearest to\r\nreaching the perfection of chivalry. Now one of the instances in which\r\nthis knight most conspicuously showed his prudence, worth, valour,\r\nendurance, fortitude, and love, was when he withdrew, rejected by the\r\nLady Oriana, to do penance upon the Pe\xc3\xb1a Pobre, changing his name into\r\nthat of Beltenebros, a name assuredly significant and appropriate to\r\nthe life which he had voluntarily adopted. So, as it is easier for me\r\nto imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder, cutting off\r\nserpents\xe2\x80\x99 heads, slaying dragons, routing armies, destroying fleets,\r\nand breaking enchantments, and as this place is so well suited for a\r\nsimilar purpose, I must not allow the opportunity to escape which now\r\nso conveniently offers me its forelock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it in reality,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your worship means to do in\r\nsuch an out-of-the-way place as this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I not told thee,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I mean to imitate\r\nAmadis here, playing the victim of despair, the madman, the maniac, so\r\nas at the same time to imitate the valiant Don Roland, when at the\r\nfountain he had evidence of the fair Angelica having disgraced herself\r\nwith Medoro and through grief thereat went mad, and plucked up trees,\r\ntroubled the waters of the clear springs, slew destroyed flocks, burned\r\ndown huts, levelled houses, dragged mares after him, and perpetrated a\r\nhundred thousand other outrages worthy of everlasting renown and\r\nrecord? And though I have no intention of imitating Roland, or Orlando,\r\nor Rotolando (for he went by all these names), step by step in all the\r\nmad things he did, said, and thought, I will make a rough copy to the\r\nbest of my power of all that seems to me most essential; but perhaps I\r\nshall content myself with the simple imitation of Amadis, who without\r\ngiving way to any mischievous madness but merely to tears and sorrow,\r\ngained as much fame as the most famous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the knights who behaved in this\r\nway had provocation and cause for those follies and penances; but what\r\ncause has your worship for going mad? What lady has rejected you, or\r\nwhat evidence have you found to prove that the lady Dulcinea del Toboso\r\nhas been trifling with Moor or Christian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the point,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is the beauty of\r\nthis business of mine; no thanks to a knight-errant for going mad when\r\nhe has cause; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation, and\r\nlet my lady know, if I do this in the dry, what I would do in the\r\nmoist; moreover I have abundant cause in the long separation I have\r\nendured from my lady till death, Dulcinea del Toboso; for as thou didst\r\nhear that shepherd Ambrosio say the other day, in absence all ills are\r\nfelt and feared; and so, friend Sancho, waste no time in advising me\r\nagainst so rare, so happy, and so unheard-of an imitation; mad I am,\r\nand mad I must be until thou returnest with the answer to a letter that\r\nI mean to send by thee to my lady Dulcinea; and if it be such as my\r\nconstancy deserves, my insanity and penance will come to an end; and if\r\nit be to the opposite effect, I shall become mad in earnest, and, being\r\nso, I shall suffer no more; thus in whatever way she may answer I shall\r\nescape from the struggle and affliction in which thou wilt leave me,\r\nenjoying in my senses the boon thou bearest me, or as a madman not\r\nfeeling the evil thou bringest me. But tell me, Sancho, hast thou got\r\nMambrino\xe2\x80\x99s helmet safe? for I saw thee take it up from the ground when\r\nthat ungrateful wretch tried to break it in pieces but could not, by\r\nwhich the fineness of its temper may be seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Sancho made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cBy the living God, Sir Knight of the\r\nRueful Countenance, I cannot endure or bear with patience some of the\r\nthings that your worship says; and from them I begin to suspect that\r\nall you tell me about chivalry, and winning kingdoms and empires, and\r\ngiving islands, and bestowing other rewards and dignities after the\r\ncustom of knights-errant, must be all made up of wind and lies, and all\r\npigments or figments, or whatever we may call them; for what would\r\nanyone think that heard your worship calling a barber\xe2\x80\x99s basin\r\nMambrino\xe2\x80\x99s helmet without ever seeing the mistake all this time, but\r\nthat one who says and maintains such things must have his brains\r\naddled? I have the basin in my sack all dinted, and I am taking it home\r\nto have it mended, to trim my beard in it, if, by God\xe2\x80\x99s grace, I am\r\nallowed to see my wife and children some day or other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cby him thou didst swear by just\r\nnow I swear thou hast the most limited understanding that any squire in\r\nthe world has or ever had. Is it possible that all this time thou hast\r\nbeen going about with me thou hast never found out that all things\r\nbelonging to knights-errant seem to be illusions and nonsense and\r\nravings, and to go always by contraries? And not because it really is\r\nso, but because there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendance\r\nupon us that change and alter everything with us, and turn things as\r\nthey please, and according as they are disposed to aid or destroy us;\r\nthus what seems to thee a barber\xe2\x80\x99s basin seems to me Mambrino\xe2\x80\x99s helmet,\r\nand to another it will seem something else; and rare foresight it was\r\nin the sage who is on my side to make what is really and truly\r\nMambrino\xe2\x80\x99s helmet seem a basin to everybody, for, being held in such\r\nestimation as it is, all the world would pursue me to rob me of it; but\r\nwhen they see it is only a barber\xe2\x80\x99s basin they do not take the trouble\r\nto obtain it; as was plainly shown by him who tried to break it, and\r\nleft it on the ground without taking it, for, by my faith, had he known\r\nit he would never have left it behind. Keep it safe, my friend, for\r\njust now I have no need of it; indeed, I shall have to take off all\r\nthis armour and remain as naked as I was born, if I have a mind to\r\nfollow Roland rather than Amadis in my penance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus talking they reached the foot of a high mountain which stood like\r\nan isolated peak among the others that surrounded it. Past its base\r\nthere flowed a gentle brook, all around it spread a meadow so green and\r\nluxuriant that it was a delight to the eyes to look upon it, and forest\r\ntrees in abundance, and shrubs and flowers, added to the charms of the\r\nspot. Upon this place the Knight of the Rueful Countenance fixed his\r\nchoice for the performance of his penance, and as he beheld it\r\nexclaimed in a loud voice as though he were out of his senses:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the place, oh, ye heavens, that I select and choose for\r\nbewailing the misfortune in which ye yourselves have plunged me: this\r\nis the spot where the overflowings of mine eyes shall swell the waters\r\nof yon little brook, and my deep and endless sighs shall stir\r\nunceasingly the leaves of these mountain trees, in testimony and token\r\nof the pain my persecuted heart is suffering. Oh, ye rural deities,\r\nwhoever ye be that haunt this lone spot, give ear to the complaint of a\r\nwretched lover whom long absence and brooding jealousy have driven to\r\nbewail his fate among these wilds and complain of the hard heart of\r\nthat fair and ungrateful one, the end and limit of all human beauty!\r\nOh, ye wood nymphs and dryads, that dwell in the thickets of the\r\nforest, so may the nimble wanton satyrs by whom ye are vainly wooed\r\nnever disturb your sweet repose, help me to lament my hard fate or at\r\nleast weary not at listening to it! Oh, Dulcinea del Toboso, day of my\r\nnight, glory of my pain, guide of my path, star of my fortune, so may\r\nHeaven grant thee in full all thou seekest of it, bethink thee of the\r\nplace and condition to which absence from thee has brought me, and make\r\nthat return in kindness that is due to my fidelity! Oh, lonely trees,\r\nthat from this day forward shall bear me company in my solitude, give\r\nme some sign by the gentle movement of your boughs that my presence is\r\nnot distasteful to you! Oh, thou, my squire, pleasant companion in my\r\nprosperous and adverse fortunes, fix well in thy memory what thou shalt\r\nsee me do here, so that thou mayest relate and report it to the sole\r\ncause of all,\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying he dismounted from Rocinante, and in an\r\ninstant relieved him of saddle and bridle, and giving him a slap on the\r\ncroup, said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe gives thee freedom who is bereft of it himself, oh\r\nsteed as excellent in deed as thou art unfortunate in thy lot; begone\r\nwhere thou wilt, for thou bearest written on thy forehead that neither\r\nAstolfo\xe2\x80\x99s hippogriff, nor the famed Frontino that cost Bradamante so\r\ndear, could equal thee in speed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing this Sancho said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood luck to him who has saved us the trouble\r\nof stripping the pack-saddle off Dapple! By my faith he would not have\r\ngone without a slap on the croup and something said in his praise;\r\nthough if he were here I would not let anyone strip him, for there\r\nwould be no occasion, as he had nothing of the lover or victim of\r\ndespair about him, inasmuch as his master, which I was while it was\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure, was nothing of the sort; and indeed, Sir Knight of the\r\nRueful Countenance, if my departure and your worship\xe2\x80\x99s madness are to\r\ncome off in earnest, it will be as well to saddle Rocinante again in\r\norder that he may supply the want of Dapple, because it will save me\r\ntime in going and returning: for if I go on foot I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when I\r\nshall get there or when I shall get back, as I am, in truth, a bad\r\nwalker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cit shall be as thou wilt,\r\nfor thy plan does not seem to me a bad one, and three days hence thou\r\nwilt depart, for I wish thee to observe in the meantime what I do and\r\nsay for her sake, that thou mayest be able to tell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what more have I to see besides what I have seen?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch thou knowest about it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cI have now got to tear\r\nup my garments, to scatter about my armour, knock my head against these\r\nrocks, and more of the same sort of thing, which thou must witness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbe careful, your worship, how you\r\ngive yourself those knocks on the head, for you may come across such a\r\nrock, and in such a way, that the very first may put an end to the\r\nwhole contrivance of this penance; and I should think, if indeed knocks\r\non the head seem necessary to you, and this business cannot be done\r\nwithout them, you might be content\xe2\x80\x94as the whole thing is feigned, and\r\ncounterfeit, and in joke\xe2\x80\x94you might be content, I say, with giving them\r\nto yourself in the water, or against something soft, like cotton; and\r\nleave it all to me; for I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell my lady that your worship knocked\r\nyour head against a point of rock harder than a diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank thee for thy good intentions, friend Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don\r\nQuixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I would have thee know that all these things I am doing\r\nare not in joke, but very much in earnest, for anything else would be a\r\ntransgression of the ordinances of chivalry, which forbid us to tell\r\nany lie whatever under the penalties due to apostasy; and to do one\r\nthing instead of another is just the same as lying; so my knocks on the\r\nhead must be real, solid, and valid, without anything sophisticated or\r\nfanciful about them, and it will be needful to leave me some lint to\r\ndress my wounds, since fortune has compelled us to do without the\r\nbalsam we lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was worse losing the ass,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor with him lint and\r\nall were lost; but I beg of your worship not to remind me again of that\r\naccursed liquor, for my soul, not to say my stomach, turns at hearing\r\nthe very name of it; and I beg of you, too, to reckon as past the three\r\ndays you allowed me for seeing the mad things you do, for I take them\r\nas seen already and pronounced upon, and I will tell wonderful stories\r\nto my lady; so write the letter and send me off at once, for I long to\r\nreturn and take your worship out of this purgatory where I am leaving\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPurgatory dost thou call it, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9crather call\r\nit hell, or even worse if there be anything worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor one who is in hell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9c_nulla est retentio_, as I have\r\nheard say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand what _retentio_ means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Retentio_,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cmeans that whoever is in hell never\r\ncomes nor can come out of it, which will be the opposite case with your\r\nworship or my legs will be idle, that is if I have spurs to enliven\r\nRocinante: let me once get to El Toboso and into the presence of my\r\nlady Dulcinea, and I will tell her such things of the follies and\r\nmadnesses (for it is all one) that your worship has done and is still\r\ndoing, that I will manage to make her softer than a glove though I find\r\nher harder than a cork tree; and with her sweet and honeyed answer I\r\nwill come back through the air like a witch, and take your worship out\r\nof this purgatory that seems to be hell but is not, as there is hope of\r\ngetting out of it; which, as I have said, those in hell have not, and I\r\nbelieve your worship will not say anything to the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Rueful Countenance, \xe2\x80\x9cbut how shall we\r\nmanage to write the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the ass-colt order too,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll shall be included,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand as there is no paper,\r\nit would be well done to write it on the leaves of trees, as the\r\nancients did, or on tablets of wax; though that would be as hard to\r\nfind just now as paper. But it has just occurred to me how it may be\r\nconveniently and even more than conveniently written, and that is in\r\nthe notebook that belonged to Cardenio, and thou wilt take care to have\r\nit copied on paper, in a good hand, at the first village thou comest to\r\nwhere there is a schoolmaster, or if not, any sacristan will copy it;\r\nbut see thou give it not to any notary to copy, for they write a law\r\nhand that Satan could not make out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is to be done about the signature?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letters of Amadis were never signed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the order must needs be\r\nsigned, and if it is copied they will say the signature is false, and I\r\nshall be left without ass-colts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe order shall go signed in the same book,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand on\r\nseeing it my niece will make no difficulty about obeying it; as to the\r\nloveletter thou canst put by way of signature, \xe2\x80\x98_Yours till death, the\r\nKnight of the Rueful Countenance._\xe2\x80\x99 And it will be no great matter if\r\nit is in some other person\xe2\x80\x99s hand, for as well as I recollect Dulcinea\r\ncan neither read nor write, nor in the whole course of her life has she\r\nseen handwriting or letter of mine, for my love and hers have been\r\nalways platonic, not going beyond a modest look, and even that so\r\nseldom that I can safely swear I have not seen her four times in all\r\nthese twelve years I have been loving her more than the light of these\r\neyes that the earth will one day devour; and perhaps even of those four\r\ntimes she has not once perceived that I was looking at her: such is the\r\nretirement and seclusion in which her father Lorenzo Corchuelo and her\r\nmother Aldonza Nogales have brought her up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cLorenzo Corchuelo\xe2\x80\x99s daughter is the lady\r\nDulcinea del Toboso, otherwise called Aldonza Lorenzo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand she it is that is worthy to be lady\r\nof the whole universe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know her well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand let me tell you she can fling a\r\ncrowbar as well as the lustiest lad in all the town. Giver of all good!\r\nbut she is a brave lass, and a right and stout one, and fit to be\r\nhelpmate to any knight-errant that is or is to be, who may make her his\r\nlady: the whoreson wench, what sting she has and what a voice! I can\r\ntell you one day she posted herself on the top of the belfry of the\r\nvillage to call some labourers of theirs that were in a ploughed field\r\nof her father\xe2\x80\x99s, and though they were better than half a league off\r\nthey heard her as well as if they were at the foot of the tower; and\r\nthe best of her is that she is not a bit prudish, for she has plenty of\r\naffability, and jokes with everybody, and has a grin and a jest for\r\neverything. So, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, I say you not\r\nonly may and ought to do mad freaks for her sake, but you have a good\r\nright to give way to despair and hang yourself; and no one who knows of\r\nit but will say you did well, though the devil should take you; and I\r\nwish I were on my road already, simply to see her, for it is many a day\r\nsince I saw her, and she must be altered by this time, for going about\r\nthe fields always, and the sun and the air spoil women\xe2\x80\x99s looks greatly.\r\nBut I must own the truth to your worship, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote; until now\r\nI have been under a great mistake, for I believed truly and honestly\r\nthat the lady Dulcinea must be some princess your worship was in love\r\nwith, or some person great enough to deserve the rich presents you have\r\nsent her, such as the Biscayan and the galley slaves, and many more no\r\ndoubt, for your worship must have won many victories in the time when I\r\nwas not yet your squire. But all things considered, what good can it do\r\nthe lady Aldonza Lorenzo, I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, to have\r\nthe vanquished your worship sends or will send coming to her and going\r\ndown on their knees before her? Because maybe when they came she\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nhackling flax or threshing on the threshing floor, and they\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nashamed to see her, and she\xe2\x80\x99d laugh, or resent the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have before now told thee many times, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat thou art a mighty great chatterer, and that with a blunt wit thou\r\nart always striving at sharpness; but to show thee what a fool thou art\r\nand how rational I am, I would have thee listen to a short story. Thou\r\nmust know that a certain widow, fair, young, independent, and rich, and\r\nabove all free and easy, fell in love with a sturdy strapping young\r\nlay-brother; his superior came to know of it, and one day said to the\r\nworthy widow by way of brotherly remonstrance, \xe2\x80\x98I am surprised, se\xc3\xb1ora,\r\nand not without good reason, that a woman of such high standing, so\r\nfair, and so rich as you are, should have fallen in love with such a\r\nmean, low, stupid fellow as So-and-so, when in this house there are so\r\nmany masters, graduates, and divinity students from among whom you\r\nmight choose as if they were a lot of pears, saying, \xe2\x80\x98This one I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake, that I won\xe2\x80\x99t take;\xe2\x80\x99 but she replied to him with great\r\nsprightliness and candour, \xe2\x80\x98My dear sir, you are very much mistaken,\r\nand your ideas are very old-fashioned, if you think that I have made a\r\nbad choice in So-and-so, fool as he seems; because for all I want with\r\nhim he knows as much and more philosophy than Aristotle.\xe2\x80\x99 In the same\r\nway, Sancho, for all I want with Dulcinea del Toboso she is just as\r\ngood as the most exalted princess on earth. It is not to be supposed\r\nthat all those poets who sang the praises of ladies under the fancy\r\nnames they give them, had any such mistresses. Thinkest thou that the\r\nAmarillises, the Phillises, the Sylvias, the Dianas, the Galateas, the\r\nF\xc3\xadlidas, and all the rest of them, that the books, the ballads, the\r\nbarber\xe2\x80\x99s shops, the theatres are full of, were really and truly ladies\r\nof flesh and blood, and mistresses of those that glorify and have\r\nglorified them? Nothing of the kind; they only invent them for the most\r\npart to furnish a subject for their verses, and that they may pass for\r\nlovers, or for men valiant enough to be so; and so it suffices me to\r\nthink and believe that the good Aldonza Lorenzo is fair and virtuous;\r\nand as to her pedigree it is very little matter, for no one will\r\nexamine into it for the purpose of conferring any order upon her, and\r\nI, for my part, reckon her the most exalted princess in the world. For\r\nthou shouldst know, Sancho, if thou dost not know, that two things\r\nalone beyond all others are incentives to love, and these are great\r\nbeauty and a good name, and these two things are to be found in\r\nDulcinea in the highest degree, for in beauty no one equals her and in\r\ngood name few approach her; and to put the whole thing in a nutshell, I\r\npersuade myself that all I say is as I say, neither more nor less, and\r\nI picture her in my imagination as I would have her to be, as well in\r\nbeauty as in condition; Helen approaches her not nor does Lucretia come\r\nup to her, nor any other of the famous women of times past, Greek,\r\nBarbarian, or Latin; and let each say what he will, for if in this I am\r\ntaken to task by the ignorant, I shall not be censured by the\r\ncritical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say that your worship is entirely right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand that I\r\nam an ass. But I know not how the name of ass came into my mouth, for a\r\nrope is not to be mentioned in the house of him who has been hanged;\r\nbut now for the letter, and then, God be with you, I am off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote took out the notebook, and, retiring to one side, very\r\ndeliberately began to write the letter, and when he had finished it he\r\ncalled to Sancho, saying he wished to read it to him, so that he might\r\ncommit it to memory, in case of losing it on the road; for with evil\r\nfortune like his anything might be apprehended. To which Sancho\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cWrite it two or three times there in the book and give it to\r\nme, and I will carry it very carefully, because to expect me to keep it\r\nin my memory is all nonsense, for I have such a bad one that I often\r\nforget my own name; but for all that repeat it to me, as I shall like\r\nto hear it, for surely it will run as if it was in print.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is what it says:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s Letter to Dulcinea del Toboso_\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSovereign and exalted Lady,\xe2\x80\x94The pierced by the point of absence, the\r\nwounded to the heart\xe2\x80\x99s core, sends thee, sweetest Dulcinea del Toboso,\r\nthe health that he himself enjoys not. If thy beauty despises me, if\r\nthy worth is not for me, if thy scorn is my affliction, though I be\r\nsufficiently long-suffering, hardly shall I endure this anxiety, which,\r\nbesides being oppressive, is protracted. My good squire Sancho will\r\nrelate to thee in full, fair ingrate, dear enemy, the condition to\r\nwhich I am reduced on thy account: if it be thy pleasure to give me\r\nrelief, I am thine; if not, do as may be pleasing to thee; for by\r\nending my life I shall satisfy thy cruelty and my desire.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThine till death,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the life of my father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, when he heard the letter, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nis the loftiest thing I ever heard. Body of me! how your worship says\r\neverything as you like in it! And how well you fit in \xe2\x80\x98The Knight of\r\nthe Rueful Countenance\xe2\x80\x99 into the signature. I declare your worship is\r\nindeed the very devil, and there is nothing you don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is needed for the calling I follow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9clet your worship put the order for the three\r\nass-colts on the other side, and sign it very plainly, that they may\r\nrecognise it at first sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, and as he had written it he read\r\nit to this effect:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMistress Niece,\xe2\x80\x94By this first of ass-colts please pay to Sancho Panza,\r\nmy squire, three of the five I left at home in your charge: said three\r\nass-colts to be paid and delivered for the same number received here in\r\nhand, which upon this and upon his receipt shall be duly paid. Done in\r\nthe heart of the Sierra Morena, the twenty-seventh of August of this\r\npresent year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cnow let your worship sign it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to sign it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut merely to put my\r\nflourish, which is the same as a signature, and enough for three asses,\r\nor even three hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can trust your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9clet me go and saddle\r\nRocinante, and be ready to give me your blessing, for I mean to go at\r\nonce without seeing the fooleries your worship is going to do; I\xe2\x80\x99ll say\r\nI saw you do so many that she will not want any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like\xe2\x80\x94and there is\r\nreason for it\xe2\x80\x94I should like thee, I say, to see me stripped to the skin\r\nand performing a dozen or two of insanities, which I can get done in\r\nless than half an hour; for having seen them with thine own eyes, thou\r\ncanst then safely swear to the rest that thou wouldst add; and I\r\npromise thee thou wilt not tell of as many as I mean to perform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of God, master mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9clet me not see your\r\nworship stripped, for it will sorely grieve me, and I shall not be able\r\nto keep from tears, and my head aches so with all I shed last night for\r\nDapple, that I am not fit to begin any fresh weeping; but if it is your\r\nworship\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure that I should see some insanities, do them in your\r\nclothes, short ones, and such as come readiest to hand; for I myself\r\nwant nothing of the sort, and, as I have said, it will be a saving of\r\ntime for my return, which will be with the news your worship desires\r\nand deserves. If not, let the lady Dulcinea look to it; if she does not\r\nanswer reasonably, I swear as solemnly as I can that I will fetch a\r\nfair answer out of her stomach with kicks and cuffs; for why should it\r\nbe borne that a knight-errant as famous as your worship should go mad\r\nwithout rhyme or reason for a\xe2\x80\x94? Her ladyship had best not drive me to\r\nsay it, for by God I will speak out and let off everything cheap, even\r\nif it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sell: I am pretty good at that! she little knows me;\r\nfaith, if she knew me she\xe2\x80\x99d be in awe of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn faith, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cto all appearance thou art no\r\nsounder in thy wits than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so mad,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am more peppery; but apart\r\nfrom all this, what has your worship to eat until I come back? Will you\r\nsally out on the road like Cardenio to force it from the shepherds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet not that anxiety trouble thee,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor even if\r\nI had it I should not eat anything but the herbs and the fruits which\r\nthis meadow and these trees may yield me; the beauty of this business\r\nof mine lies in not eating, and in performing other mortifications.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I am afraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho upon this; \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall\r\nnot be able to find my way back to this spot where I am leaving you, it\r\nis such an out-of-the-way place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObserve the landmarks well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I will try not to\r\ngo far from this neighbourhood, and I will even take care to mount the\r\nhighest of these rocks to see if I can discover thee returning;\r\nhowever, not to miss me and lose thyself, the best plan will be to cut\r\nsome branches of the broom that is so abundant about here, and as thou\r\ngoest to lay them at intervals until thou hast come out upon the plain;\r\nthese will serve thee, after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinth\r\nof Theseus, as marks and signs for finding me on thy return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho Panza, and having cut some, he asked his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s blessing, and not without many tears on both sides, took his\r\nleave of him, and mounting Rocinante, of whom Don Quixote charged him\r\nearnestly to have as much care as of his own person, he set out for the\r\nplain, strewing at intervals the branches of broom as his master had\r\nrecommended him; and so he went his way, though Don Quixote still\r\nentreated him to see him do were it only a couple of mad acts. He had\r\nnot gone a hundred paces, however, when he returned and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must say, se\xc3\xb1or, your worship said quite right, that in order to be\r\nable to swear without a weight on my conscience that I had seen you do\r\nmad things, it would be well for me to see if it were only one; though\r\nin your worship\xe2\x80\x99s remaining here I have seen a very great one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc25c.jpg (261K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I not tell thee so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cWait, Sancho, and I will\r\ndo them in the saying of a credo,\xe2\x80\x9d and pulling off his breeches in all\r\nhaste he stripped himself to his skin and his shirt, and then, without\r\nmore ado, he cut a couple of gambados in the air, and a couple of\r\nsomersaults, heels over head, making such a display that, not to see it\r\na second time, Sancho wheeled Rocinante round, and felt easy, and\r\nsatisfied in his mind that he could swear he had left his master mad;\r\nand so we will leave him to follow his road until his return, which was\r\na quick one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc25e.jpg (20K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nIN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE REFINEMENTS WHEREWITH DON QUIXOTE PLAYED THE\r\nPART OF A LOVER IN THE SIERRA MORENA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc26a.jpg (111K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning to the proceedings of him of the Rueful Countenance when he\r\nfound himself alone, the history says that when Don Quixote had\r\ncompleted the performance of the somersaults or capers, naked from the\r\nwaist down and clothed from the waist up, and saw that Sancho had gone\r\noff without waiting to see any more crazy feats, he climbed up to the\r\ntop of a high rock, and there set himself to consider what he had\r\nseveral times before considered without ever coming to any conclusion\r\non the point, namely whether it would be better and more to his purpose\r\nto imitate the outrageous madness of Roland, or the melancholy madness\r\nof Amadis; and communing with himself he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat wonder is it if Roland was so good a knight and so valiant as\r\neveryone says he was, when, after all, he was enchanted, and nobody\r\ncould kill him save by thrusting a corking pin into the sole of his\r\nfoot, and he always wore shoes with seven iron soles? Though cunning\r\ndevices did not avail him against Bernardo del Carpio, who knew all\r\nabout them, and strangled him in his arms at Roncesvalles. But putting\r\nthe question of his valour aside, let us come to his losing his wits,\r\nfor certain it is that he did lose them in consequence of the proofs he\r\ndiscovered at the fountain, and the intelligence the shepherd gave him\r\nof Angelica having slept more than two siestas with Medoro, a little\r\ncurly-headed Moor, and page to Agramante. If he was persuaded that this\r\nwas true, and that his lady had wronged him, it is no wonder that he\r\nshould have gone mad; but I, how am I to imitate him in his madness,\r\nunless I can imitate him in the cause of it? For my Dulcinea, I will\r\nventure to swear, never saw a Moor in her life, as he is, in his proper\r\ncostume, and she is this day as the mother that bore her, and I should\r\nplainly be doing her a wrong if, fancying anything else, I were to go\r\nmad with the same kind of madness as Roland the Furious. On the other\r\nhand, I see that Amadis of Gaul, without losing his senses and without\r\ndoing anything mad, acquired as a lover as much fame as the most\r\nfamous; for, according to his history, on finding himself rejected by\r\nhis lady Oriana, who had ordered him not to appear in her presence\r\nuntil it should be her pleasure, all he did was to retire to the Pe\xc3\xb1a\r\nPobre in company with a hermit, and there he took his fill of weeping\r\nuntil Heaven sent him relief in the midst of his great grief and need.\r\nAnd if this be true, as it is, why should I now take the trouble to\r\nstrip stark naked, or do mischief to these trees which have done me no\r\nharm, or why am I to disturb the clear waters of these brooks which\r\nwill give me to drink whenever I have a mind? Long live the memory of\r\nAmadis and let him be imitated so far as is possible by Don Quixote of\r\nLa Mancha, of whom it will be said, as was said of the other, that if\r\nhe did not achieve great things, he died in attempting them; and if I\r\nam not repulsed or rejected by my Dulcinea, it is enough for me, as I\r\nhave said, to be absent from her. And so, now to business; come to my\r\nmemory ye deeds of Amadis, and show me how I am to begin to imitate\r\nyou. I know already that what he chiefly did was to pray and commend\r\nhimself to God; but what am I to do for a rosary, for I have not got\r\none?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then it occurred to him how he might make one, and that was by\r\ntearing a great strip off the tail of his shirt which hung down, and\r\nmaking eleven knots on it, one bigger than the rest, and this served\r\nhim for a rosary all the time he was there, during which he repeated\r\ncountless ave-marias. But what distressed him greatly was not having\r\nanother hermit there to confess him and receive consolation from; and\r\nso he solaced himself with pacing up and down the little meadow, and\r\nwriting and carving on the bark of the trees and on the fine sand a\r\nmultitude of verses all in harmony with his sadness, and some in praise\r\nof Dulcinea; but, when he was found there afterwards, the only ones\r\ncompletely legible that could be discovered were those that follow\r\nhere:\r\n\r\nYe on the mountainside that grow,\r\nYe green things all, trees, shrubs, and bushes,\r\nAre ye aweary of the woe\r\nThat this poor aching bosom crushes?\r\nIf it disturb you, and I owe\r\nSome reparation, it may be a\r\nDefence for me to let you know\r\nDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s tears are on the flow,\r\nAnd all for distant Dulcinea\r\nDel Toboso.\r\n\r\nThe lealest lover time can show,\r\nDoomed for a lady-love to languish,\r\nAmong these solitudes doth go,\r\nA prey to every kind of anguish.\r\nWhy Love should like a spiteful foe\r\nThus use him, he hath no idea,\r\nBut hogsheads full\xe2\x80\x94this doth he know\xe2\x80\x94\r\nDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s tears are on the flow,\r\nAnd all for distant Dulcinea\r\nDel Toboso.\r\n\r\nAdventure-seeking doth he go\r\nUp rugged heights, down rocky valleys,\r\nBut hill or dale, or high or low,\r\nMishap attendeth all his sallies:\r\nLove still pursues him to and fro,\r\nAnd plies his cruel scourge\xe2\x80\x94ah me! a\r\nRelentless fate, an endless woe;\r\nDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s tears are on the flow,\r\nAnd all for distant Dulcinea\r\nDel Toboso.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe addition of \xe2\x80\x9cDel Toboso\xe2\x80\x9d to Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s name gave rise to no little\r\nlaughter among those who found the above lines, for they suspected Don\r\nQuixote must have fancied that unless he added \xe2\x80\x9cdel Toboso\xe2\x80\x9d when he\r\nintroduced the name of Dulcinea the verse would be unintelligible;\r\nwhich was indeed the fact, as he himself afterwards admitted. He wrote\r\nmany more, but, as has been said, these three verses were all that\r\ncould be plainly and perfectly deciphered. In this way, and in sighing\r\nand calling on the fauns and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs of the\r\nstreams, and Echo, moist and mournful, to answer, console, and hear\r\nhim, as well as in looking for herbs to sustain him, he passed his time\r\nuntil Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s return; and had that been delayed three weeks, as it was\r\nthree days, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance would have worn such\r\nan altered countenance that the mother that bore him would not have\r\nknown him: and here it will be well to leave him, wrapped up in sighs\r\nand verses, to relate how Sancho Panza fared on his mission.\r\n\r\nAs for him, coming out upon the high road, he made for El Toboso, and\r\nthe next day reached the inn where the mishap of the blanket had\r\nbefallen him. As soon as he recognised it he felt as if he were once\r\nmore living through the air, and he could not bring himself to enter it\r\nthough it was an hour when he might well have done so, for it was\r\ndinner-time, and he longed to taste something hot as it had been all\r\ncold fare with him for many days past. This craving drove him to draw\r\nnear to the inn, still undecided whether to go in or not, and as he was\r\nhesitating there came out two persons who at once recognised him, and\r\nsaid one to the other:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or licentiate, is not he on the horse there Sancho Panza who, our\r\nadventurer\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeper told us, went off with her master as esquire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the licentiate, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is our friend Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorse;\xe2\x80\x9d and if they knew him so well it was because they were the\r\ncurate and the barber of his own village, the same who had carried out\r\nthe scrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they\r\nrecognised Sancho Panza and Rocinante, being anxious to hear of Don\r\nQuixote, they approached, and calling him by his name the curate said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend Sancho Panza, where is your master?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho recognised them at once, and determined to keep secret the place\r\nand circumstances where and under which he had left his master, so he\r\nreplied that his master was engaged in a certain quarter on a certain\r\nmatter of great importance to him which he could not disclose for the\r\neyes in his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t tell us where he is, Sancho\r\nPanza, we will suspect as we suspect already, that you have murdered\r\nand robbed him, for here you are mounted on his horse; in fact, you\r\nmust produce the master of the hack, or else take the consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need of threats with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am not a man\r\nto rob or murder anybody; let his own fate, or God who made him, kill\r\neach one; my master is engaged very much to his taste doing penance in\r\nthe midst of these mountains;\xe2\x80\x9d and then, offhand and without stopping,\r\nhe told them how he had left him, what adventures had befallen him, and\r\nhow he was carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, the\r\ndaughter of Lorenzo Corchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears in\r\nlove. They were both amazed at what Sancho Panza told them; for though\r\nthey were aware of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s madness and the nature of it, each\r\ntime they heard of it they were filled with fresh wonder. They then\r\nasked Sancho Panza to show them the letter he was carrying to the lady\r\nDulcinea del Toboso. He said it was written in a notebook, and that his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s directions were that he should have it copied on paper at the\r\nfirst village he came to. On this the curate said if he showed it to\r\nhim, he himself would make a fair copy of it. Sancho put his hand into\r\nhis bosom in search of the notebook but could not find it, nor, if he\r\nhad been searching until now, could he have found it, for Don Quixote\r\nhad kept it, and had never given it to him, nor had he himself thought\r\nof asking for it. When Sancho discovered he could not find the book his\r\nface grew deadly pale, and in great haste he again felt his body all\r\nover, and seeing plainly it was not to be found, without more ado he\r\nseized his beard with both hands and plucked away half of it, and then,\r\nas quick as he could and without stopping, gave himself half a dozen\r\ncuffs on the face and nose till they were bathed in blood.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, the curate and the barber asked him what had happened him\r\nthat he gave himself such rough treatment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should happen to me?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut to have lost from one\r\nhand to the other, in a moment, three ass-colts, each of them like a\r\ncastle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lost the notebook,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat contained the letter to\r\nDulcinea, and an order signed by my master in which he directed his\r\nniece to give me three ass-colts out of four or five he had at home;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand he then told them about the loss of Dapple.\r\n\r\nThe curate consoled him, telling him that when his master was found he\r\nwould get him to renew the order, and make a fresh draft on paper, as\r\nwas usual and customary; for those made in notebooks were never\r\naccepted or honoured.\r\n\r\nSancho comforted himself with this, and said if that were so the loss\r\nof Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s letter did not trouble him much, for he had it almost by\r\nheart, and it could be taken down from him wherever and whenever they\r\nliked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRepeat it then, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cand we will write it down\r\nafterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho Panza stopped to scratch his head to bring back the letter to\r\nhis memory, and balanced himself now on one foot, now the other, one\r\nmoment staring at the ground, the next at the sky, and after having\r\nhalf gnawed off the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waiting\r\nfor him to begin, he said, after a long pause, \xe2\x80\x9cBy God, se\xc3\xb1or\r\nlicentiate, devil a thing can I recollect of the letter; but it said at\r\nthe beginning, \xe2\x80\x98Exalted and scrubbing Lady.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot have said \xe2\x80\x98scrubbing,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cbut \xe2\x80\x98superhuman\xe2\x80\x99\r\nor \xe2\x80\x98sovereign.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cthen, as well as I remember, it went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The wounded, and wanting of sleep, and the pierced, kisses your\r\nworship\xe2\x80\x99s hands, ungrateful and very unrecognised fair one; and it said\r\nsomething or other about health and sickness that he was sending her;\r\nand from that it went tailing off until it ended with \xe2\x80\x98Yours till\r\ndeath, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt gave them no little amusement, both of them, to see what a good\r\nmemory Sancho had, and they complimented him greatly upon it, and\r\nbegged him to repeat the letter a couple of times more, so that they\r\ntoo might get it by heart to write it out by-and-by. Sancho repeated it\r\nthree times, and as he did, uttered three thousand more absurdities;\r\nthen he told them more about his master but he never said a word about\r\nthe blanketing that had befallen himself in that inn, into which he\r\nrefused to enter. He told them, moreover, how his lord, if he brought\r\nhim a favourable answer from the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, was to put\r\nhimself in the way of endeavouring to become an emperor, or at least a\r\nmonarch; for it had been so settled between them, and with his personal\r\nworth and the might of his arm it was an easy matter to come to be one:\r\nand how on becoming one his lord was to make a marriage for him (for he\r\nwould be a widower by that time, as a matter of course) and was to give\r\nhim as a wife one of the damsels of the empress, the heiress of some\r\nrich and grand state on the mainland, having nothing to do with islands\r\nof any sort, for he did not care for them now. All this Sancho\r\ndelivered with so much composure\xe2\x80\x94wiping his nose from time to time\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwith so little common-sense that his two hearers were again filled with\r\nwonder at the force of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s madness that could run away with\r\nthis poor man\xe2\x80\x99s reason. They did not care to take the trouble of\r\ndisabusing him of his error, as they considered that since it did not\r\nin any way hurt his conscience it would be better to leave him in it,\r\nand they would have all the more amusement in listening to his\r\nsimplicities; and so they bade him pray to God for his lord\xe2\x80\x99s health,\r\nas it was a very likely and a very feasible thing for him in course of\r\ntime to come to be an emperor, as he said, or at least an archbishop or\r\nsome other dignitary of equal rank.\r\n\r\nTo which Sancho made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cIf fortune, sirs, should bring things\r\nabout in such a way that my master should have a mind, instead of being\r\nan emperor, to be an archbishop, I should like to know what\r\narchbishops-errant commonly give their squires?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey commonly give them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, some simple benefice or\r\ncure, or some place as sacristan which brings them a good fixed income,\r\nnot counting the altar fees, which may be reckoned at as much more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthe squire must be unmarried, and must\r\nknow, at any rate, how to help at mass, and if that be so, woe is me,\r\nfor I am married already and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the first letter of the A B\r\nC. What will become of me if my master takes a fancy to be an\r\narchbishop and not an emperor, as is usual and customary with\r\nknights-errant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe not uneasy, friend Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we will entreat\r\nyour master, and advise him, even urging it upon him as a case of\r\nconscience, to become an emperor and not an archbishop, because it will\r\nbe easier for him as he is more valiant than lettered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I have thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cthough I can tell you he is fit for\r\nanything: what I mean to do for my part is to pray to our Lord to place\r\nhim where it may be best for him, and where he may be able to bestow\r\nmost favours upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak like a man of sense,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will be\r\nacting like a good Christian; but what must now be done is to take\r\nsteps to coax your master out of that useless penance you say he is\r\nperforming; and we had best turn into this inn to consider what plan to\r\nadopt, and also to dine, for it is now time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho said they might go in, but that he would wait there outside, and\r\nthat he would tell them afterwards the reason why he was unwilling, and\r\nwhy it did not suit him to enter it; but he begged them to bring him\r\nout something to eat, and to let it be hot, and also to bring barley\r\nfor Rocinante. They left him and went in, and presently the barber\r\nbrought him out something to eat. By-and-by, after they had between\r\nthem carefully thought over what they should do to carry out their\r\nobject, the curate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour Don\r\nQuixote, and effect their purpose; and his notion, which he explained\r\nto the barber, was that he himself should assume the disguise of a\r\nwandering damsel, while the other should try as best he could to pass\r\nfor a squire, and that they should thus proceed to where Don Quixote\r\nwas, and he, pretending to be an aggrieved and distressed damsel,\r\nshould ask a favour of him, which as a valiant knight-errant he could\r\nnot refuse to grant; and the favour he meant to ask him was that he\r\nshould accompany her whither she would conduct him, in order to redress\r\na wrong which a wicked knight had done her, while at the same time she\r\nshould entreat him not to require her to remove her mask, nor ask her\r\nany question touching her circumstances until he had righted her with\r\nthe wicked knight. And he had no doubt that Don Quixote would comply\r\nwith any request made in these terms, and that in this way they might\r\nremove him and take him to his own village, where they would endeavour\r\nto find out if his extraordinary madness admitted of any kind of\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc26e.jpg (48K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nOF HOW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER PROCEEDED WITH THEIR SCHEME; TOGETHER\r\nWITH OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF RECORD IN THIS GREAT HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc27a.jpg (169K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curate\xe2\x80\x99s plan did not seem a bad one to the barber, but on the\r\ncontrary so good that they immediately set about putting it in\r\nexecution. They begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady, leaving\r\nher in pledge a new cassock of the curate\xe2\x80\x99s; and the barber made a\r\nbeard out of a grey-brown or red ox-tail in which the landlord used to\r\nstick his comb. The landlady asked them what they wanted these things\r\nfor, and the curate told her in a few words about the madness of Don\r\nQuixote, and how this disguise was intended to get him away from the\r\nmountain where he then was. The landlord and landlady immediately came\r\nto the conclusion that the madman was their guest, the balsam man and\r\nmaster of the blanketed squire, and they told the curate all that had\r\npassed between him and them, not omitting what Sancho had been so\r\nsilent about. Finally the landlady dressed up the curate in a style\r\nthat left nothing to be desired; she put on him a cloth petticoat with\r\nblack velvet stripes a palm broad, all slashed, and a bodice of green\r\nvelvet set off by a binding of white satin, which as well as the\r\npetticoat must have been made in the time of king Wamba. The curate\r\nwould not let them hood him, but put on his head a little quilted linen\r\ncap which he used for a night-cap, and bound his forehead with a strip\r\nof black silk, while with another he made a mask with which he\r\nconcealed his beard and face very well. He then put on his hat, which\r\nwas broad enough to serve him for an umbrella, and enveloping himself\r\nin his cloak seated himself woman-fashion on his mule, while the barber\r\nmounted his with a beard down to the waist of mingled red and white,\r\nfor it was, as has been said, the tail of a clay-red ox.\r\n\r\nThey took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as she\r\nwas, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant them\r\nsuccess in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had\r\nin hand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck\r\nthe curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that\r\nfashion, as it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself\r\nthat way even though much might depend upon it; and saying so to the\r\nbarber he begged him to change dresses, as it was fitter he should be\r\nthe distressed damsel, while he himself would play the squire\xe2\x80\x99s part,\r\nwhich would be less derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was\r\nresolved to have nothing more to do with the matter, and let the devil\r\ntake Don Quixote. Just at this moment Sancho came up, and on seeing the\r\npair in such a costume he was unable to restrain his laughter; the\r\nbarber, however, agreed to do as the curate wished, and, altering their\r\nplan, the curate went on to instruct him how to play his part and what\r\nto say to Don Quixote to induce and compel him to come with them and\r\ngive up his fancy for the place he had chosen for his idle penance. The\r\nbarber told him he could manage it properly without any instruction,\r\nand as he did not care to dress himself up until they were near where\r\nDon Quixote was, he folded up the garments, and the curate adjusted his\r\nbeard, and they set out under the guidance of Sancho Panza, who went\r\nalong telling them of the encounter with the madman they met in the\r\nSierra, saying nothing, however, about the finding of the valise and\r\nits contents; for with all his simplicity the lad was a trifle\r\ncovetous.\r\n\r\nThe next day they reached the place where Sancho had laid the\r\nbroom-branches as marks to direct him to where he had left his master,\r\nand recognising it he told them that here was the entrance, and that\r\nthey would do well to dress themselves, if that was required to deliver\r\nhis master; for they had already told him that going in this guise and\r\ndressing in this way were of the highest importance in order to rescue\r\nhis master from the pernicious life he had adopted; and they charged\r\nhim strictly not to tell his master who they were, or that he knew\r\nthem, and should he ask, as ask he would, if he had given the letter to\r\nDulcinea, to say that he had, and that, as she did not know how to\r\nread, she had given an answer by word of mouth, saying that she\r\ncommanded him, on pain of her displeasure, to come and see her at once;\r\nand it was a very important matter for himself, because in this way and\r\nwith what they meant to say to him they felt sure of bringing him back\r\nto a better mode of life and inducing him to take immediate steps to\r\nbecome an emperor or monarch, for there was no fear of his becoming an\r\narchbishop. All this Sancho listened to and fixed it well in his\r\nmemory, and thanked them heartily for intending to recommend his master\r\nto be an emperor instead of an archbishop, for he felt sure that in the\r\nway of bestowing rewards on their squires emperors could do more than\r\narchbishops-errant. He said, too, that it would be as well for him to\r\ngo on before them to find him, and give him his lady\xe2\x80\x99s answer; for that\r\nperhaps might be enough to bring him away from the place without\r\nputting them to all this trouble. They approved of what Sancho\r\nproposed, and resolved to wait for him until he brought back word of\r\nhaving found his master.\r\n\r\nSancho pushed on into the glens of the Sierra, leaving them in one\r\nthrough which there flowed a little gentle rivulet, and where the rocks\r\nand trees afforded a cool and grateful shade. It was an August day with\r\nall the heat of one, and the heat in those parts is intense, and the\r\nhour was three in the afternoon, all which made the spot the more\r\ninviting and tempted them to wait there for Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s return, which they\r\ndid. They were reposing, then, in the shade, when a voice unaccompanied\r\nby the notes of any instrument, but sweet and pleasing in its tone,\r\nreached their ears, at which they were not a little astonished, as the\r\nplace did not seem to them likely quarters for one who sang so well;\r\nfor though it is often said that shepherds of rare voice are to be\r\nfound in the woods and fields, this is rather a flight of the poet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfancy than the truth. And still more surprised were they when they\r\nperceived that what they heard sung were the verses not of rustic\r\nshepherds, but of the polished wits of the city; and so it proved, for\r\nthe verses they heard were these:\r\n\r\nWhat makes my quest of happiness seem vain?\r\nDisdain.\r\nWhat bids me to abandon hope of ease?\r\nJealousies.\r\nWhat holds my heart in anguish of suspense?\r\nAbsence.\r\nIf that be so, then for my grief\r\nWhere shall I turn to seek relief,\r\nWhen hope on every side lies slain\r\nBy Absence, Jealousies, Disdain?\r\n\r\nWhat the prime cause of all my woe doth prove?\r\nLove.\r\nWhat at my glory ever looks askance?\r\nChance.\r\nWhence is permission to afflict me given?\r\nHeaven.\r\nIf that be so, I but await\r\nThe stroke of a resistless fate,\r\nSince, working for my woe, these three,\r\nLove, Chance and Heaven, in league I see.\r\n\r\nWhat must I do to find a remedy?\r\nDie.\r\nWhat is the lure for love when coy and strange?\r\nChange.\r\nWhat, if all fail, will cure the heart of sadness?\r\nMadness.\r\nIf that be so, it is but folly\r\nTo seek a cure for melancholy:\r\nAsk where it lies; the answer saith\r\nIn Change, in Madness, or in Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hour, the summer season, the solitary place, the voice and skill of\r\nthe singer, all contributed to the wonder and delight of the two\r\nlisteners, who remained still waiting to hear something more; finding,\r\nhowever, that the silence continued some little time, they resolved to\r\ngo in search of the musician who sang with so fine a voice; but just as\r\nthey were about to do so they were checked by the same voice, which\r\nonce more fell upon their ears, singing this\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\nWhen heavenward, holy Friendship, thou didst go\r\nSoaring to seek thy home beyond the sky,\r\nAnd take thy seat among the saints on high,\r\nIt was thy will to leave on earth below\r\nThy semblance, and upon it to bestow\r\nThy veil, wherewith at times hypocrisy,\r\nParading in thy shape, deceives the eye,\r\nAnd makes its vileness bright as virtue show.\r\nFriendship, return to us, or force the cheat\r\nThat wears it now, thy livery to restore,\r\nBy aid whereof sincerity is slain.\r\nIf thou wilt not unmask thy counterfeit,\r\nThis earth will be the prey of strife once more,\r\nAs when prim\xc3\xa6val discord held its reign.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe song ended with a deep sigh, and again the listeners remained\r\nwaiting attentively for the singer to resume; but perceiving that the\r\nmusic had now turned to sobs and heart-rending moans they determined to\r\nfind out who the unhappy being could be whose voice was as rare as his\r\nsighs were piteous, and they had not proceeded far when on turning the\r\ncorner of a rock they discovered a man of the same aspect and\r\nappearance as Sancho had described to them when he told them the story\r\nof Cardenio. He, showing no astonishment when he saw them, stood still\r\nwith his head bent down upon his breast like one in deep thought,\r\nwithout raising his eyes to look at them after the first glance when\r\nthey suddenly came upon him. The curate, who was aware of his\r\nmisfortune and recognised him by the description, being a man of good\r\naddress, approached him and in a few sensible words entreated and urged\r\nhim to quit a life of such misery, lest he should end it there, which\r\nwould be the greatest of all misfortunes. Cardenio was then in his\r\nright mind, free from any attack of that madness which so frequently\r\ncarried him away, and seeing them dressed in a fashion so unusual among\r\nthe frequenters of those wilds, could not help showing some surprise,\r\nespecially when he heard them speak of his case as if it were a\r\nwell-known matter (for the curate\xe2\x80\x99s words gave him to understand as\r\nmuch) so he replied to them thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see plainly, sirs, whoever you may be, that Heaven, whose care it is\r\nto succour the good, and even the wicked very often, here, in this\r\nremote spot, cut off from human intercourse, sends me, though I deserve\r\nit not, those who seek to draw me away from this to some better\r\nretreat, showing me by many and forcible arguments how unreasonably I\r\nact in leading the life I do; but as they know, that if I escape from\r\nthis evil I shall fall into another still greater, perhaps they will\r\nset me down as a weak-minded man, or, what is worse, one devoid of\r\nreason; nor would it be any wonder, for I myself can perceive that the\r\neffect of the recollection of my misfortunes is so great and works so\r\npowerfully to my ruin, that in spite of myself I become at times like a\r\nstone, without feeling or consciousness; and I come to feel the truth\r\nof it when they tell me and show me proofs of the things I have done\r\nwhen the terrible fit overmasters me; and all I can do is bewail my lot\r\nin vain, and idly curse my destiny, and plead for my madness by telling\r\nhow it was caused, to any that care to hear it; for no reasonable\r\nbeings on learning the cause will wonder at the effects; and if they\r\ncannot help me at least they will not blame me, and the repugnance they\r\nfeel at my wild ways will turn into pity for my woes. If it be, sirs,\r\nthat you are here with the same design as others have come with, before\r\nyou proceed with your wise arguments, I entreat you to hear the story\r\nof my countless misfortunes, for perhaps when you have heard it you\r\nwill spare yourselves the trouble you would take in offering\r\nconsolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they, both of them, desired nothing more than to hear from his own\r\nlips the cause of his suffering, they entreated him to tell it,\r\npromising not to do anything for his relief or comfort that he did not\r\nwish; and thereupon the unhappy gentleman began his sad story in nearly\r\nthe same words and manner in which he had related it to Don Quixote and\r\nthe goatherd a few days before, when, through Master Elisabad, and Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry, the tale\r\nwas left unfinished, as this history has already recorded; but now\r\nfortunately the mad fit kept off, allowed him to tell it to the end;\r\nand so, coming to the incident of the note which Don Fernando had found\r\nin the volume of \xe2\x80\x9cAmadis of Gaul,\xe2\x80\x9d Cardenio said that he remembered it\r\nperfectly and that it was in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Luscinda to Cardenio._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery day I discover merits in you that oblige and compel me to hold\r\nyou in higher estimation; so if you desire to relieve me of this\r\nobligation without cost to my honour, you may easily do so. I have a\r\nfather who knows you and loves me dearly, who without putting any\r\nconstraint on my inclination will grant what will be reasonable for you\r\nto have, if it be that you value me as you say and as I believe you\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy this letter I was induced, as I told you, to demand Luscinda for my\r\nwife, and it was through it that Luscinda came to be regarded by Don\r\nFernando as one of the most discreet and prudent women of the day, and\r\nthis letter it was that suggested his design of ruining me before mine\r\ncould be carried into effect. I told Don Fernando that all Luscinda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather was waiting for was that mine should ask her of him, which I did\r\nnot dare to suggest to him, fearing that he would not consent to do so;\r\nnot because he did not know perfectly well the rank, goodness, virtue,\r\nand beauty of Luscinda, and that she had qualities that would do honour\r\nto any family in Spain, but because I was aware that he did not wish me\r\nto marry so soon, before seeing what the Duke Ricardo would do for me.\r\nIn short, I told him I did not venture to mention it to my father, as\r\nwell on account of that difficulty, as of many others that discouraged\r\nme though I knew not well what they were, only that it seemed to me\r\nthat what I desired was never to come to pass. To all this Don Fernando\r\nanswered that he would take it upon himself to speak to my father, and\r\npersuade him to speak to Luscinda\xe2\x80\x99s father. O, ambitious Marius! O,\r\ncruel Catiline! O, wicked Sylla! O, perfidious Ganelon! O, treacherous\r\nVellido! O, vindictive Julian! O, covetous Judas! Traitor, cruel,\r\nvindictive, and perfidious, wherein had this poor wretch failed in his\r\nfidelity, who with such frankness showed thee the secrets and the joys\r\nof his heart? What offence did I commit? What words did I utter, or\r\nwhat counsels did I give that had not the furtherance of thy honour and\r\nwelfare for their aim? But, woe is me, wherefore do I complain? for\r\nsure it is that when misfortunes spring from the stars, descending from\r\non high they fall upon us with such fury and violence that no power on\r\nearth can check their course nor human device stay their coming. Who\r\ncould have thought that Don Fernando, a highborn gentleman,\r\nintelligent, bound to me by gratitude for my services, one that could\r\nwin the object of his love wherever he might set his affections, could\r\nhave become so obdurate, as they say, as to rob me of my one ewe lamb\r\nthat was not even yet in my possession? But laying aside these useless\r\nand unavailing reflections, let us take up the broken thread of my\r\nunhappy story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo proceed, then: Don Fernando finding my presence an obstacle to the\r\nexecution of his treacherous and wicked design, resolved to send me to\r\nhis elder brother under the pretext of asking money from him to pay for\r\nsix horses which, purposely, and with the sole object of sending me\r\naway that he might the better carry out his infernal scheme, he had\r\npurchased the very day he offered to speak to my father, and the price\r\nof which he now desired me to fetch. Could I have anticipated this\r\ntreachery? Could I by any chance have suspected it? Nay; so far from\r\nthat, I offered with the greatest pleasure to go at once, in my\r\nsatisfaction at the good bargain that had been made. That night I spoke\r\nwith Luscinda, and told her what had been agreed upon with Don\r\nFernando, and how I had strong hopes of our fair and reasonable wishes\r\nbeing realised. She, as unsuspicious as I was of the treachery of Don\r\nFernando, bade me try to return speedily, as she believed the\r\nfulfilment of our desires would be delayed only so long as my father\r\nput off speaking to hers. I know not why it was that on saying this to\r\nme her eyes filled with tears, and there came a lump in her throat that\r\nprevented her from uttering a word of many more that it seemed to me\r\nshe was striving to say to me. I was astonished at this unusual turn,\r\nwhich I never before observed in her. for we always conversed, whenever\r\ngood fortune and my ingenuity gave us the chance, with the greatest\r\ngaiety and cheerfulness, mingling tears, sighs, jealousies, doubts, or\r\nfears with our words; it was all on my part a eulogy of my good fortune\r\nthat Heaven should have given her to me for my mistress; I glorified\r\nher beauty, I extolled her worth and her understanding; and she paid me\r\nback by praising in me what in her love for me she thought worthy of\r\npraise; and besides we had a hundred thousand trifles and doings of our\r\nneighbours and acquaintances to talk about, and the utmost extent of my\r\nboldness was to take, almost by force, one of her fair white hands and\r\ncarry it to my lips, as well as the closeness of the low grating that\r\nseparated us allowed me. But the night before the unhappy day of my\r\ndeparture she wept, she moaned, she sighed, and she withdrew leaving me\r\nfilled with perplexity and amazement, overwhelmed at the sight of such\r\nstrange and affecting signs of grief and sorrow in Luscinda; but not to\r\ndash my hopes I ascribed it all to the depth of her love for me and the\r\npain that separation gives those who love tenderly. At last I took my\r\ndeparture, sad and dejected, my heart filled with fancies and\r\nsuspicions, but not knowing well what it was I suspected or fancied;\r\nplain omens pointing to the sad event and misfortune that was awaiting\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reached the place whither I had been sent, gave the letter to Don\r\nFernando\xe2\x80\x99s brother, and was kindly received but not promptly dismissed,\r\nfor he desired me to wait, very much against my will, eight days in\r\nsome place where the duke his father was not likely to see me, as his\r\nbrother wrote that the money was to be sent without his knowledge; all\r\nof which was a scheme of the treacherous Don Fernando, for his brother\r\nhad no want of money to enable him to despatch me at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeying\r\nit, as it seemed to me impossible to endure life for so many days\r\nseparated from Luscinda, especially after leaving her in the sorrowful\r\nmood I have described to you; nevertheless as a dutiful servant I\r\nobeyed, though I felt it would be at the cost of my well-being. But\r\nfour days later there came a man in quest of me with a letter which he\r\ngave me, and which by the address I perceived to be from Luscinda, as\r\nthe writing was hers. I opened it with fear and trepidation, persuaded\r\nthat it must be something serious that had impelled her to write to me\r\nwhen at a distance, as she seldom did so when I was near. Before\r\nreading it I asked the man who it was that had given it to him, and how\r\nlong he had been upon the road; he told me that as he happened to be\r\npassing through one of the streets of the city at the hour of noon, a\r\nvery beautiful lady called to him from a window, and with tears in her\r\neyes said to him hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x98Brother, if you are, as you seem to be, a\r\nChristian, for the love of God I entreat you to have this letter\r\ndespatched without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay to the place and person named in\r\nthe address, all which is well known, and by this you will render a\r\ngreat service to our Lord; and that you may be at no inconvenience in\r\ndoing so take what is in this handkerchief;\xe2\x80\x99 and said he, \xe2\x80\x98with this\r\nshe threw me a handkerchief out of the window in which were tied up a\r\nhundred reals and this gold ring which I bring here together with the\r\nletter I have given you. And then without waiting for any answer she\r\nleft the window, though not before she saw me take the letter and the\r\nhandkerchief, and I had by signs let her know that I would do as she\r\nbade me; and so, seeing myself so well paid for the trouble I would\r\nhave in bringing it to you, and knowing by the address that it was to\r\nyou it was sent (for, se\xc3\xb1or, I know you very well), and also unable to\r\nresist that beautiful lady\xe2\x80\x99s tears, I resolved to trust no one else,\r\nbut to come myself and give it to you, and in sixteen hours from the\r\ntime when it was given me I have made the journey, which, as you know,\r\nis eighteen leagues.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the while the good-natured improvised courier was telling me this,\r\nI hung upon his words, my legs trembling under me so that I could\r\nscarcely stand. However, I opened the letter and read these words:\r\n\r\nThe promise Don Fernando gave you to urge your father to speak to mine,\r\nhe has fulfilled much more to his own satisfaction than to your\r\nadvantage. I have to tell you, se\xc3\xb1or, that he has demanded me for a\r\nwife, and my father, led away by what he considers Don Fernando\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuperiority over you, has favoured his suit so cordially, that in two\r\ndays hence the betrothal is to take place with such secrecy and so\r\nprivately that the only witnesses are to be the Heavens above and a few\r\nof the household. Picture to yourself the state I am in; judge if it be\r\nurgent for you to come; the issue of the affair will show you whether I\r\nlove you or not. God grant this may come to your hand before mine shall\r\nbe forced to link itself with his who keeps so ill the faith that he\r\nhas pledged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch, in brief, were the words of the letter, words that made me set\r\nout at once without waiting any longer for reply or money; for I now\r\nsaw clearly that it was not the purchase of horses but of his own\r\npleasure that had made Don Fernando send me to his brother. The\r\nexasperation I felt against Don Fernando, joined with the fear of\r\nlosing the prize I had won by so many years of love and devotion, lent\r\nme wings; so that almost flying I reached home the same day, by the\r\nhour which served for speaking with Luscinda. I arrived unobserved, and\r\nleft the mule on which I had come at the house of the worthy man who\r\nhad brought me the letter, and fortune was pleased to be for once so\r\nkind that I found Luscinda at the grating that was the witness of our\r\nloves. She recognised me at once, and I her, but not as she ought to\r\nhave recognised me, or I her. But who is there in the world that can\r\nboast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstable\r\nnature of a woman? Of a truth no one. To proceed: as soon as Luscinda\r\nsaw me she said, \xe2\x80\x98Cardenio, I am in my bridal dress, and the\r\ntreacherous Don Fernando and my covetous father are waiting for me in\r\nthe hall with the other witnesses, who shall be the witnesses of my\r\ndeath before they witness my betrothal. Be not distressed, my friend,\r\nbut contrive to be present at this sacrifice, and if that cannot be\r\nprevented by my words, I have a dagger concealed which will prevent\r\nmore deliberate violence, putting an end to my life and giving thee a\r\nfirst proof of the love I have borne and bear thee.\xe2\x80\x99 I replied to her\r\ndistractedly and hastily, in fear lest I should not have time to reply,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May thy words be verified by thy deeds, lady; and if thou hast a\r\ndagger to save thy honour, I have a sword to defend thee or kill myself\r\nif fortune be against us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she could not have heard all these words, for I perceived that\r\nthey called her away in haste, as the bridegroom was waiting. Now the\r\nnight of my sorrow set in, the sun of my happiness went down, I felt my\r\neyes bereft of sight, my mind of reason. I could not enter the house,\r\nnor was I capable of any movement; but reflecting how important it was\r\nthat I should be present at what might take place on the occasion, I\r\nnerved myself as best I could and went in, for I well knew all the\r\nentrances and outlets; and besides, with the confusion that in secret\r\npervaded the house no one took notice of me, so, without being seen, I\r\nfound an opportunity of placing myself in the recess formed by a window\r\nof the hall itself, and concealed by the ends and borders of two\r\ntapestries, from between which I could, without being seen, see all\r\nthat took place in the room. Who could describe the agitation of heart\r\nI suffered as I stood there\xe2\x80\x94the thoughts that came to me\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nreflections that passed through my mind? They were such as cannot be,\r\nnor were it well they should be, told. Suffice it to say that the\r\nbridegroom entered the hall in his usual dress, without ornament of any\r\nkind; as groomsman he had with him a cousin of Luscinda\xe2\x80\x99s and except\r\nthe servants of the house there was no one else in the chamber. Soon\r\nafterwards Luscinda came out from an antechamber, attended by her\r\nmother and two of her damsels, arrayed and adorned as became her rank\r\nand beauty, and in full festival and ceremonial attire. My anxiety and\r\ndistraction did not allow me to observe or notice particularly what she\r\nwore; I could only perceive the colours, which were crimson and white,\r\nand the glitter of the gems and jewels on her head dress and apparel,\r\nsurpassed by the rare beauty of her lovely auburn hair that vying with\r\nthe precious stones and the light of the four torches that stood in the\r\nhall shone with a brighter gleam than all. Oh memory, mortal foe of my\r\npeace! why bring before me now the incomparable beauty of that adored\r\nenemy of mine? Were it not better, cruel memory, to remind me and\r\nrecall what she then did, that stirred by a wrong so glaring I may\r\nseek, if not vengeance now, at least to rid myself of life? Be not\r\nweary, sirs, of listening to these digressions; my sorrow is not one of\r\nthose that can or should be told tersely and briefly, for to me each\r\nincident seems to call for many words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this the curate replied that not only were they not weary of\r\nlistening to him, but that the details he mentioned interested them\r\ngreatly, being of a kind by no means to be omitted and deserving of the\r\nsame attention as the main story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo proceed, then,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Cardenio: \xe2\x80\x9call being assembled in the\r\nhall, the priest of the parish came in and as he took the pair by the\r\nhand to perform the requisite ceremony, at the words, \xe2\x80\x98Will you, Se\xc3\xb1ora\r\nLuscinda, take Se\xc3\xb1or Don Fernando, here present, for your lawful\r\nhusband, as the holy Mother Church ordains?\xe2\x80\x99 I thrust my head and neck\r\nout from between the tapestries, and with eager ears and throbbing\r\nheart set myself to listen to Luscinda\xe2\x80\x99s answer, awaiting in her reply\r\nthe sentence of death or the grant of life. Oh, that I had but dared at\r\nthat moment to rush forward crying aloud, \xe2\x80\x98Luscinda, Luscinda! have a\r\ncare what thou dost; remember what thou owest me; bethink thee thou art\r\nmine and canst not be another\xe2\x80\x99s; reflect that thy utterance of \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand the end of my life will come at the same instant. O, treacherous\r\nDon Fernando! robber of my glory, death of my life! What seekest thou?\r\nRemember that thou canst not as a Christian attain the object of thy\r\nwishes, for Luscinda is my bride, and I am her husband!\xe2\x80\x99 Fool that I\r\nam! now that I am far away, and out of danger, I say I should have done\r\nwhat I did not do: now that I have allowed my precious treasure to be\r\nrobbed from me, I curse the robber, on whom I might have taken\r\nvengeance had I as much heart for it as I have for bewailing my fate;\r\nin short, as I was then a coward and a fool, little wonder is it if I\r\nam now dying shame-stricken, remorseful, and mad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe priest stood waiting for the answer of Luscinda, who for a long\r\ntime withheld it; and just as I thought she was taking out the dagger\r\nto save her honour, or struggling for words to make some declaration of\r\nthe truth on my behalf, I heard her say in a faint and feeble voice, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwill:\xe2\x80\x99 Don Fernando said the same, and giving her the ring they stood\r\nlinked by a knot that could never be loosed. The bridegroom then\r\napproached to embrace his bride; and she, pressing her hand upon her\r\nheart, fell fainting in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms. It only remains now for me\r\nto tell you the state I was in when in that consent that I heard I saw\r\nall my hopes mocked, the words and promises of Luscinda proved\r\nfalsehoods, and the recovery of the prize I had that instant lost\r\nrendered impossible for ever. I stood stupefied, wholly abandoned, it\r\nseemed, by Heaven, declared the enemy of the earth that bore me, the\r\nair refusing me breath for my sighs, the water moisture for my tears;\r\nit was only the fire that gathered strength so that my whole frame\r\nglowed with rage and jealousy. They were all thrown into confusion by\r\nLuscinda\xe2\x80\x99s fainting, and as her mother was unlacing her to give her air\r\na sealed paper was discovered in her bosom which Don Fernando seized at\r\nonce and began to read by the light of one of the torches. As soon as\r\nhe had read it he seated himself in a chair, leaning his cheek on his\r\nhand in the attitude of one deep in thought, without taking any part in\r\nthe efforts that were being made to recover his bride from her fainting\r\nfit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing all the household in confusion, I ventured to come out\r\nregardless whether I were seen or not, and determined, if I were, to do\r\nsome frenzied deed that would prove to all the world the righteous\r\nindignation of my breast in the punishment of the treacherous Don\r\nFernando, and even in that of the fickle fainting traitress. But my\r\nfate, doubtless reserving me for greater sorrows, if such there be, so\r\nordered it that just then I had enough and to spare of that reason\r\nwhich has since been wanting to me; and so, without seeking to take\r\nvengeance on my greatest enemies (which might have been easily taken,\r\nas all thought of me was so far from their minds), I resolved to take\r\nit upon myself, and on myself to inflict the pain they deserved,\r\nperhaps with even greater severity than I should have dealt out to them\r\nhad I then slain them; for sudden pain is soon over, but that which is\r\nprotracted by tortures is ever slaying without ending life. In a word,\r\nI quitted the house and reached that of the man with whom I had left my\r\nmule; I made him saddle it for me, mounted without bidding him\r\nfarewell, and rode out of the city, like another Lot, not daring to\r\nturn my head to look back upon it; and when I found myself alone in the\r\nopen country, screened by the darkness of the night, and tempted by the\r\nstillness to give vent to my grief without apprehension or fear of\r\nbeing heard or seen, then I broke silence and lifted up my voice in\r\nmaledictions upon Luscinda and Don Fernando, as if I could thus avenge\r\nthe wrong they had done me. I called her cruel, ungrateful, false,\r\nthankless, but above all covetous, since the wealth of my enemy had\r\nblinded the eyes of her affection, and turned it from me to transfer it\r\nto one to whom fortune had been more generous and liberal. And yet, in\r\nthe midst of this outburst of execration and upbraiding, I found\r\nexcuses for her, saying it was no wonder that a young girl in the\r\nseclusion of her parents\xe2\x80\x99 house, trained and schooled to obey them\r\nalways, should have been ready to yield to their wishes when they\r\noffered her for a husband a gentleman of such distinction, wealth, and\r\nnoble birth, that if she had refused to accept him she would have been\r\nthought out of her senses, or to have set her affection elsewhere, a\r\nsuspicion injurious to her fair name and fame. But then again, I said,\r\nhad she declared I was her husband, they would have seen that in\r\nchoosing me she had not chosen so ill but that they might excuse her,\r\nfor before Don Fernando had made his offer, they themselves could not\r\nhave desired, if their desires had been ruled by reason, a more\r\neligible husband for their daughter than I was; and she, before taking\r\nthe last fatal step of giving her hand, might easily have said that I\r\nhad already given her mine, for I should have come forward to support\r\nany assertion of hers to that effect. In short, I came to the\r\nconclusion that feeble love, little reflection, great ambition, and a\r\ncraving for rank, had made her forget the words with which she had\r\ndeceived me, encouraged and supported by my firm hopes and honourable\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus soliloquising and agitated, I journeyed onward for the remainder\r\nof the night, and by daybreak I reached one of the passes of these\r\nmountains, among which I wandered for three days more without taking\r\nany path or road, until I came to some meadows lying on I know not\r\nwhich side of the mountains, and there I inquired of some herdsmen in\r\nwhat direction the most rugged part of the range lay. They told me that\r\nit was in this quarter, and I at once directed my course hither,\r\nintending to end my life here; but as I was making my way among these\r\ncrags, my mule dropped dead through fatigue and hunger, or, as I think\r\nmore likely, in order to have done with such a worthless burden as it\r\nbore in me. I was left on foot, worn out, famishing, without anyone to\r\nhelp me or any thought of seeking help: and so thus I lay stretched on\r\nthe ground, how long I know not, after which I rose up free from\r\nhunger, and found beside me some goatherds, who no doubt were the\r\npersons who had relieved me in my need, for they told me how they had\r\nfound me, and how I had been uttering ravings that showed plainly I had\r\nlost my reason; and since then I am conscious that I am not always in\r\nfull possession of it, but at times so deranged and crazed that I do a\r\nthousand mad things, tearing my clothes, crying aloud in these\r\nsolitudes, cursing my fate, and idly calling on the dear name of her\r\nwho is my enemy, and only seeking to end my life in lamentation; and\r\nwhen I recover my senses I find myself so exhausted and weary that I\r\ncan scarcely move. Most commonly my dwelling is the hollow of a cork\r\ntree large enough to shelter this miserable body; the herdsmen and\r\ngoatherds who frequent these mountains, moved by compassion, furnish me\r\nwith food, leaving it by the wayside or on the rocks, where they think\r\nI may perhaps pass and find it; and so, even though I may be then out\r\nof my senses, the wants of nature teach me what is required to sustain\r\nme, and make me crave it and eager to take it. At other times, so they\r\ntell me when they find me in a rational mood, I sally out upon the\r\nroad, and though they would gladly give it me, I snatch food by force\r\nfrom the shepherds bringing it from the village to their huts. Thus do\r\npass the wretched life that remains to me, until it be Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s will to\r\nbring it to a close, or so to order my memory that I no longer\r\nrecollect the beauty and treachery of Luscinda, or the wrong done me by\r\nDon Fernando; for if it will do this without depriving me of life, I\r\nwill turn my thoughts into some better channel; if not, I can only\r\nimplore it to have full mercy on my soul, for in myself I feel no power\r\nor strength to release my body from this strait in which I have of my\r\nown accord chosen to place it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch, sirs, is the dismal story of my misfortune: say if it be one\r\nthat can be told with less emotion than you have seen in me; and do not\r\ntrouble yourselves with urging or pressing upon me what reason suggests\r\nas likely to serve for my relief, for it will avail me as much as the\r\nmedicine prescribed by a wise physician avails the sick man who will\r\nnot take it. I have no wish for health without Luscinda; and since it\r\nis her pleasure to be another\xe2\x80\x99s, when she is or should be mine, let it\r\nbe mine to be a prey to misery when I might have enjoyed happiness. She\r\nby her fickleness strove to make my ruin irretrievable; I will strive\r\nto gratify her wishes by seeking destruction; and it will show\r\ngenerations to come that I alone was deprived of that of which all\r\nothers in misfortune have a superabundance, for to them the\r\nimpossibility of being consoled is itself a consolation, while to me it\r\nis the cause of greater sorrows and sufferings, for I think that even\r\nin death there will not be an end of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Cardenio brought to a close his long discourse and story, as full\r\nof misfortune as it was of love; but just as the curate was going to\r\naddress some words of comfort to him, he was stopped by a voice that\r\nreached his ear, saying in melancholy tones what will be told in the\r\nFourth Part of this narrative; for at this point the sage and sagacious\r\nhistorian, Cid Hamete Benengeli, brought the Third to a conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc27e.jpg (65K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE AND DELIGHTFUL ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL THE\r\nCURATE AND THE BARBER IN THE SAME SIERRA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc28a.jpg (159K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy and fortunate were the times when that most daring knight Don\r\nQuixote of La Mancha was sent into the world; for by reason of his\r\nhaving formed a resolution so honourable as that of seeking to revive\r\nand restore to the world the long-lost and almost defunct order of\r\nknight-errantry, we now enjoy in this age of ours, so poor in light\r\nentertainment, not only the charm of his veracious history, but also of\r\nthe tales and episodes contained in it which are, in a measure, no less\r\npleasing, ingenious, and truthful, than the history itself; which,\r\nresuming its thread, carded, spun, and wound, relates that just as the\r\ncurate was going to offer consolation to Cardenio, he was interrupted\r\nby a voice that fell upon his ear saying in plaintive tones:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God! is it possible I have found a place that may serve as a secret\r\ngrave for the weary load of this body that I support so unwillingly? If\r\nthe solitude these mountains promise deceives me not, it is so; ah! woe\r\nis me! how much more grateful to my mind will be the society of these\r\nrocks and brakes that permit me to complain of my misfortune to Heaven,\r\nthan that of any human being, for there is none on earth to look to for\r\ncounsel in doubt, comfort in sorrow, or relief in distress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him, and as\r\nit seemed to them to be uttered close by, as indeed it was, they got up\r\nto look for the speaker, and before they had gone twenty paces they\r\ndiscovered behind a rock, seated at the foot of an ash tree, a youth in\r\nthe dress of a peasant, whose face they were unable at the moment to\r\nsee as he was leaning forward, bathing his feet in the brook that\r\nflowed past. They approached so silently that he did not perceive them,\r\nbeing fully occupied in bathing his feet, which were so fair that they\r\nlooked like two pieces of shining crystal brought forth among the other\r\nstones of the brook. The whiteness and beauty of these feet struck them\r\nwith surprise, for they did not seem to have been made to crush clods\r\nor to follow the plough and the oxen as their owner\xe2\x80\x99s dress suggested;\r\nand so, finding they had not been noticed, the curate, who was in\r\nfront, made a sign to the other two to conceal themselves behind some\r\nfragments of rock that lay there; which they did, observing closely\r\nwhat the youth was about. He had on a loose double-skirted dark brown\r\njacket bound tight to his body with a white cloth; he wore besides\r\nbreeches and gaiters of brown cloth, and on his head a brown montera;\r\nand he had the gaiters turned up as far as the middle of the leg, which\r\nverily seemed to be of pure alabaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc28b.jpg (339K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had done bathing his beautiful feet, he wiped them with a\r\ntowel he took from under the montera, on taking off which he raised his\r\nface, and those who were watching him had an opportunity of seeing a\r\nbeauty so exquisite that Cardenio said to the curate in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs this is not Luscinda, it is no human creature but a divine being.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth then took off the montera, and shaking his head from side to\r\nside there broke loose and spread out a mass of hair that the beams of\r\nthe sun might have envied; by this they knew that what had seemed a\r\npeasant was a lovely woman, nay the most beautiful the eyes of two of\r\nthem had ever beheld, or even Cardenio\xe2\x80\x99s if they had not seen and known\r\nLuscinda, for he afterwards declared that only the beauty of Luscinda\r\ncould compare with this. The long auburn tresses not only covered her\r\nshoulders, but such was their length and abundance, concealed her all\r\nround beneath their masses, so that except the feet nothing of her form\r\nwas visible. She now used her hands as a comb, and if her feet had\r\nseemed like bits of crystal in the water, her hands looked like pieces\r\nof driven snow among her locks; all which increased not only the\r\nadmiration of the three beholders, but their anxiety to learn who she\r\nwas. With this object they resolved to show themselves, and at the stir\r\nthey made in getting upon their feet the fair damsel raised her head,\r\nand parting her hair from before her eyes with both hands, she looked\r\nto see who had made the noise, and the instant she perceived them she\r\nstarted to her feet, and without waiting to put on her shoes or gather\r\nup her hair, hastily snatched up a bundle as though of clothes that she\r\nhad beside her, and, scared and alarmed, endeavoured to take flight;\r\nbut before she had gone six paces she fell to the ground, her delicate\r\nfeet being unable to bear the roughness of the stones; seeing which,\r\nthe three hastened towards her, and the curate addressing her first\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, se\xc3\xb1ora, whoever you may be, for those whom you see here only\r\ndesire to be of service to you; you have no need to attempt a flight so\r\nheedless, for neither can your feet bear it, nor we allow it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTaken by surprise and bewildered, she made no reply to these words.\r\nThey, however, came towards her, and the curate taking her hand went on\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat your dress would hide, se\xc3\xb1ora, is made known to us by your hair;\r\na clear proof that it can be no trifling cause that has disguised your\r\nbeauty in a garb so unworthy of it, and sent it into solitudes like\r\nthese where we have had the good fortune to find you, if not to relieve\r\nyour distress, at least to offer you comfort; for no distress, so long\r\nas life lasts, can be so oppressive or reach such a height as to make\r\nthe sufferer refuse to listen to comfort offered with good intention.\r\nAnd so, se\xc3\xb1ora, or se\xc3\xb1or, or whatever you prefer to be, dismiss the\r\nfears that our appearance has caused you and make us acquainted with\r\nyour good or evil fortunes, for from all of us together, or from each\r\none of us, you will receive sympathy in your trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the curate was speaking, the disguised damsel stood as if\r\nspell-bound, looking at them without opening her lips or uttering a\r\nword, just like a village rustic to whom something strange that he has\r\nnever seen before has been suddenly shown; but on the curate addressing\r\nsome further words to the same effect to her, sighing deeply she broke\r\nsilence and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me,\r\nand the escape of my dishevelled tresses will not allow my tongue to\r\ndeal in falsehoods, it would be idle for me now to make any further\r\npretence of what, if you were to believe me, you would believe more out\r\nof courtesy than for any other reason. This being so, I say I thank\r\nyou, sirs, for the offer you have made me, which places me under the\r\nobligation of complying with the request you have made of me; though I\r\nfear the account I shall give you of my misfortunes will excite in you\r\nas much concern as compassion, for you will be unable to suggest\r\nanything to remedy them or any consolation to alleviate them. However,\r\nthat my honour may not be left a matter of doubt in your minds, now\r\nthat you have discovered me to be a woman, and see that I am young,\r\nalone, and in this dress, things that taken together or separately\r\nwould be enough to destroy any good name, I feel bound to tell what I\r\nwould willingly keep secret if I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this she who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered without\r\nany hesitation, with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that they\r\nwere not less charmed by her intelligence than by her beauty, and as\r\nthey again repeated their offers and entreaties to her to fulfil her\r\npromise, she without further pressing, first modestly covering her feet\r\nand gathering up her hair, seated herself on a stone with the three\r\nplaced around her, and, after an effort to restrain some tears that\r\ncame to her eyes, in a clear and steady voice began her story thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this Andalusia there is a town from which a duke takes a title\r\nwhich makes him one of those that are called Grandees of Spain. This\r\nnobleman has two sons, the elder heir to his dignity and apparently to\r\nhis good qualities; the younger heir to I know not what, unless it be\r\nthe treachery of Vellido and the falsehood of Ganelon. My parents are\r\nthis lord\xe2\x80\x99s vassals, lowly in origin, but so wealthy that if birth had\r\nconferred as much on them as fortune, they would have had nothing left\r\nto desire, nor should I have had reason to fear trouble like that in\r\nwhich I find myself now; for it may be that my ill fortune came of\r\ntheirs in not having been nobly born. It is true they are not so low\r\nthat they have any reason to be ashamed of their condition, but neither\r\nare they so high as to remove from my mind the impression that my\r\nmishap comes of their humble birth. They are, in short, peasants, plain\r\nhomely people, without any taint of disreputable blood, and, as the\r\nsaying is, old rusty Christians, but so rich that by their wealth and\r\nfree-handed way of life they are coming by degrees to be considered\r\ngentlefolk by birth, and even by position; though the wealth and\r\nnobility they thought most of was having me for their daughter; and as\r\nthey have no other child to make their heir, and are affectionate\r\nparents, I was one of the most indulged daughters that ever parents\r\nindulged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was the mirror in which they beheld themselves, the staff of their\r\nold age, and the object in which, with submission to Heaven, all their\r\nwishes centred, and mine were in accordance with theirs, for I knew\r\ntheir worth; and as I was mistress of their hearts, so was I also of\r\ntheir possessions. Through me they engaged or dismissed their servants;\r\nthrough my hands passed the accounts and returns of what was sown and\r\nreaped; the oil-mills, the wine-presses, the count of the flocks and\r\nherds, the beehives, all in short that a rich farmer like my father has\r\nor can have, I had under my care, and I acted as steward and mistress\r\nwith an assiduity on my part and satisfaction on theirs that I cannot\r\nwell describe to you. The leisure hours left to me after I had given\r\nthe requisite orders to the head-shepherds, overseers, and other\r\nlabourers, I passed in such employments as are not only allowable but\r\nnecessary for young girls, those that the needle, embroidery cushion,\r\nand spinning wheel usually afford, and if to refresh my mind I quitted\r\nthem for a while, I found recreation in reading some devotional book or\r\nplaying the harp, for experience taught me that music soothes the\r\ntroubled mind and relieves weariness of spirit. Such was the life I led\r\nin my parents\xe2\x80\x99 house and if I have depicted it thus minutely, it is not\r\nout of ostentation, or to let you know that I am rich, but that you may\r\nsee how, without any fault of mine, I have fallen from the happy\r\ncondition I have described, to the misery I am in at present. The truth\r\nis, that while I was leading this busy life, in a retirement that might\r\ncompare with that of a monastery, and unseen as I thought by any except\r\nthe servants of the house (for when I went to Mass it was so early in\r\nthe morning, and I was so closely attended by my mother and the women\r\nof the household, and so thickly veiled and so shy, that my eyes\r\nscarcely saw more ground than I trod on), in spite of all this, the\r\neyes of love, or idleness, more properly speaking, that the lynx\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncannot rival, discovered me, with the help of the assiduity of Don\r\nFernando; for that is the name of the younger son of the duke I told\r\nof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moment the speaker mentioned the name of Don Fernando, Cardenio\r\nchanged colour and broke into a sweat, with such signs of emotion that\r\nthe curate and the barber, who observed it, feared that one of the mad\r\nfits which they heard attacked him sometimes was coming upon him; but\r\nCardenio showed no further agitation and remained quiet, regarding the\r\npeasant girl with fixed attention, for he began to suspect who she was.\r\nShe, however, without noticing the excitement of Cardenio, continuing\r\nher story, went on to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they had hardly discovered me, when, as he owned afterwards, he\r\nwas smitten with a violent love for me, as the manner in which it\r\ndisplayed itself plainly showed. But to shorten the long recital of my\r\nwoes, I will pass over in silence all the artifices employed by Don\r\nFernando for declaring his passion for me. He bribed all the household,\r\nhe gave and offered gifts and presents to my parents; every day was\r\nlike a holiday or a merry-making in our street; by night no one could\r\nsleep for the music; the love letters that used to come to my hand, no\r\none knew how, were innumerable, full of tender pleadings and pledges,\r\ncontaining more promises and oaths than there were letters in them; all\r\nwhich not only did not soften me, but hardened my heart against him, as\r\nif he had been my mortal enemy, and as if everything he did to make me\r\nyield were done with the opposite intention. Not that the high-bred\r\nbearing of Don Fernando was disagreeable to me, or that I found his\r\nimportunities wearisome; for it gave me a certain sort of satisfaction\r\nto find myself so sought and prized by a gentleman of such distinction,\r\nand I was not displeased at seeing my praises in his letters (for\r\nhowever ugly we women may be, it seems to me it always pleases us to\r\nhear ourselves called beautiful) but that my own sense of right was\r\nopposed to all this, as well as the repeated advice of my parents, who\r\nnow very plainly perceived Don Fernando\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, for he cared very\r\nlittle if all the world knew it. They told me they trusted and confided\r\ntheir honour and good name to my virtue and rectitude alone, and bade\r\nme consider the disparity between Don Fernando and myself, from which I\r\nmight conclude that his intentions, whatever he might say to the\r\ncontrary, had for their aim his own pleasure rather than my advantage;\r\nand if I were at all desirous of opposing an obstacle to his\r\nunreasonable suit, they were ready, they said, to marry me at once to\r\nanyone I preferred, either among the leading people of our own town, or\r\nof any of those in the neighbourhood; for with their wealth and my good\r\nname, a match might be looked for in any quarter. This offer, and their\r\nsound advice strengthened my resolution, and I never gave Don Fernando\r\na word in reply that could hold out to him any hope of success, however\r\nremote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc28c.jpg (279K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this caution of mine, which he must have taken for coyness, had\r\napparently the effect of increasing his wanton appetite\xe2\x80\x94for that is the\r\nname I give to his passion for me; had it been what he declared it to\r\nbe, you would not know of it now, because there would have been no\r\noccasion to tell you of it. At length he learned that my parents were\r\ncontemplating marriage for me in order to put an end to his hopes of\r\nobtaining possession of me, or at least to secure additional protectors\r\nto watch over me, and this intelligence or suspicion made him act as\r\nyou shall hear. One night, as I was in my chamber with no other\r\ncompanion than a damsel who waited on me, with the doors carefully\r\nlocked lest my honour should be imperilled through any carelessness, I\r\nknow not nor can conceive how it happened, but, with all this seclusion\r\nand these precautions, and in the solitude and silence of my\r\nretirement, I found him standing before me, a vision that so astounded\r\nme that it deprived my eyes of sight, and my tongue of speech. I had no\r\npower to utter a cry, nor, I think, did he give me time to utter one,\r\nas he immediately approached me, and taking me in his arms (for,\r\noverwhelmed as I was, I was powerless, I say, to help myself), he began\r\nto make such professions to me that I know not how falsehood could have\r\nhad the power of dressing them up to seem so like truth; and the\r\ntraitor contrived that his tears should vouch for his words, and his\r\nsighs for his sincerity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, a poor young creature alone, ill versed among my people in cases\r\nsuch as this, began, I know not how, to think all these lying\r\nprotestations true, though without being moved by his sighs and tears\r\nto anything more than pure compassion; and so, as the first feeling of\r\nbewilderment passed away, and I began in some degree to recover myself,\r\nI said to him with more courage than I thought I could have possessed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If, as I am now in your arms, se\xc3\xb1or, I were in the claws of a fierce\r\nlion, and my deliverance could be procured by doing or saying anything\r\nto the prejudice of my honour, it would no more be in my power to do it\r\nor say it, than it would be possible that what was should not have\r\nbeen; so then, if you hold my body clasped in your arms, I hold my soul\r\nsecured by virtuous intentions, very different from yours, as you will\r\nsee if you attempt to carry them into effect by force. I am your\r\nvassal, but I am not your slave; your nobility neither has nor should\r\nhave any right to dishonour or degrade my humble birth; and low-born\r\npeasant as I am, I have my self-respect as much as you, a lord and\r\ngentleman: with me your violence will be to no purpose, your wealth\r\nwill have no weight, your words will have no power to deceive me, nor\r\nyour sighs or tears to soften me: were I to see any of the things I\r\nspeak of in him whom my parents gave me as a husband, his will should\r\nbe mine, and mine should be bounded by his; and my honour being\r\npreserved even though my inclinations were not would willingly yield\r\nhim what you, se\xc3\xb1or, would now obtain by force; and this I say lest you\r\nshould suppose that any but my lawful husband shall ever win anything\r\nof me.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If that,\xe2\x80\x99 said this disloyal gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98be the only scruple\r\nyou feel, fairest Dorothea\xe2\x80\x99 (for that is the name of this unhappy\r\nbeing), \xe2\x80\x98see here I give you my hand to be yours, and let Heaven, from\r\nwhich nothing is hid, and this image of Our Lady you have here, be\r\nwitnesses of this pledge.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc28d.jpg (289K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Cardenio heard her say she was called Dorothea, he showed fresh\r\nagitation and felt convinced of the truth of his former suspicion, but\r\nhe was unwilling to interrupt the story, and wished to hear the end of\r\nwhat he already all but knew, so he merely said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! is Dorothea your name, se\xc3\xb1ora? I have heard of another of the\r\nsame name who can perhaps match your misfortunes. But proceed;\r\nby-and-by I may tell you something that will astonish you as much as it\r\nwill excite your compassion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorothea was struck by Cardenio\xe2\x80\x99s words as well as by his strange and\r\nmiserable attire, and begged him if he knew anything concerning her to\r\ntell it to her at once, for if fortune had left her any blessing it was\r\ncourage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her, as she felt sure\r\nthat none could reach her capable of increasing in any degree what she\r\nendured already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not let the occasion pass, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cardenio, \xe2\x80\x9cof\r\ntelling you what I think, if what I suspect were the truth, but so far\r\nthere has been no opportunity, nor is it of any importance to you to\r\nknow it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it as it may,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dorothea, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat happened in my story was\r\nthat Don Fernando, taking an image that stood in the chamber, placed it\r\nas a witness of our betrothal, and with the most binding words and\r\nextravagant oaths gave me his promise to become my husband; though\r\nbefore he had made an end of pledging himself I bade him consider well\r\nwhat he was doing, and think of the anger his father would feel at\r\nseeing him married to a peasant girl and one of his vassals; I told him\r\nnot to let my beauty, such as it was, blind him, for that was not\r\nenough to furnish an excuse for his transgression; and if in the love\r\nhe bore me he wished to do me any kindness, it would be to leave my lot\r\nto follow its course at the level my condition required; for marriages\r\nso unequal never brought happiness, nor did they continue long to\r\nafford the enjoyment they began with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this that I have now repeated I said to him, and much more which I\r\ncannot recollect; but it had no effect in inducing him to forego his\r\npurpose; he who has no intention of paying does not trouble himself\r\nabout difficulties when he is striking the bargain. At the same time I\r\nargued the matter briefly in my own mind, saying to myself, \xe2\x80\x98I shall\r\nnot be the first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty\r\nstation, nor will Don Fernando be the first whom beauty or, as is more\r\nlikely, a blind attachment, has led to mate himself below his rank.\r\nThen, since I am introducing no new usage or practice, I may as well\r\navail myself of the honour that chance offers me, for even though his\r\ninclination for me should not outlast the attainment of his wishes, I\r\nshall be, after all, his wife before God. And if I strive to repel him\r\nby scorn, I can see that, fair means failing, he is in a mood to use\r\nforce, and I shall be left dishonoured and without any means of proving\r\nmy innocence to those who cannot know how innocently I have come to be\r\nin this position; for what arguments would persuade my parents that\r\nthis gentleman entered my chamber without my consent?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll these questions and answers passed through my mind in a moment;\r\nbut the oaths of Don Fernando, the witnesses he appealed to, the tears\r\nhe shed, and lastly the charms of his person and his high-bred grace,\r\nwhich, accompanied by such signs of genuine love, might well have\r\nconquered a heart even more free and coy than mine\xe2\x80\x94these were the\r\nthings that more than all began to influence me and lead me unawares to\r\nmy ruin. I called my waiting-maid to me, that there might be a witness\r\non earth besides those in Heaven, and again Don Fernando renewed and\r\nrepeated his oaths, invoked as witnesses fresh saints in addition to\r\nthe former ones, called down upon himself a thousand curses hereafter\r\nshould he fail to keep his promise, shed more tears, redoubled his\r\nsighs and pressed me closer in his arms, from which he had never\r\nallowed me to escape; and so I was left by my maid, and ceased to be\r\none, and he became a traitor and a perjured man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come so\r\nquickly, I imagine, as Don Fernando wished, for when desire has\r\nattained its object, the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene of\r\npleasure. I say so because Don Fernando made all haste to leave me, and\r\nby the adroitness of my maid, who was indeed the one who had admitted\r\nhim, gained the street before daybreak; but on taking leave of me he\r\ntold me, though not with as much earnestness and fervour as when he\r\ncame, that I might rest assured of his faith and of the sanctity and\r\nsincerity of his oaths; and to confirm his words he drew a rich ring\r\noff his finger and placed it upon mine. He then took his departure and\r\nI was left, I know not whether sorrowful or happy; all I can say is, I\r\nwas left agitated and troubled in mind and almost bewildered by what\r\nhad taken place, and I had not the spirit, or else it did not occur to\r\nme, to chide my maid for the treachery she had been guilty of in\r\nconcealing Don Fernando in my chamber; for as yet I was unable to make\r\nup my mind whether what had befallen me was for good or evil. I told\r\nDon Fernando at parting, that as I was now his, he might see me on\r\nother nights in the same way, until it should be his pleasure to let\r\nthe matter become known; but, except the following night, he came no\r\nmore, nor for more than a month could I catch a glimpse of him in the\r\nstreet or in church, while I wearied myself with watching for one;\r\nalthough I knew he was in the town, and almost every day went out\r\nhunting, a pastime he was very fond of. I remember well how sad and\r\ndreary those days and hours were to me; I remember well how I began to\r\ndoubt as they went by, and even to lose confidence in the faith of Don\r\nFernando; and I remember, too, how my maid heard those words in reproof\r\nof her audacity that she had not heard before, and how I was forced to\r\nput a constraint on my tears and on the expression of my countenance,\r\nnot to give my parents cause to ask me why I was so melancholy, and\r\ndrive me to invent falsehoods in reply. But all this was suddenly\r\nbrought to an end, for the time came when all such considerations were\r\ndisregarded, and there was no further question of honour, when my\r\npatience gave way and the secret of my heart became known abroad. The\r\nreason was, that a few days later it was reported in the town that Don\r\nFernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a maiden of rare\r\nbeauty, the daughter of parents of distinguished position, though not\r\nso rich that her portion would entitle her to look for so brilliant a\r\nmatch; it was said, too, that her name was Luscinda, and that at the\r\nbetrothal some strange things had happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCardenio heard the name of Luscinda, but he only shrugged his\r\nshoulders, bit his lips, bent his brows, and before long two streams of\r\ntears escaped from his eyes. Dorothea, however, did not interrupt her\r\nstory, but went on in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis sad intelligence reached my ears, and, instead of being struck\r\nwith a chill, with such wrath and fury did my heart burn that I\r\nscarcely restrained myself from rushing out into the streets, crying\r\naloud and proclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which I was\r\nthe victim; but this transport of rage was for the time checked by a\r\nresolution I formed, to be carried out the same night, and that was to\r\nassume this dress, which I got from a servant of my father\xe2\x80\x99s, one of\r\nthe zagals, as they are called in farmhouses, to whom I confided the\r\nwhole of my misfortune, and whom I entreated to accompany me to the\r\ncity where I heard my enemy was. He, though he remonstrated with me for\r\nmy boldness, and condemned my resolution, when he saw me bent upon my\r\npurpose, offered to bear me company, as he said, to the end of the\r\nworld. I at once packed up in a linen pillow-case a woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress, and\r\nsome jewels and money to provide for emergencies, and in the silence of\r\nthe night, without letting my treacherous maid know, I sallied forth\r\nfrom the house, accompanied by my servant and abundant anxieties, and\r\non foot set out for the city, but borne as it were on wings by my\r\neagerness to reach it, if not to prevent what I presumed to be already\r\ndone, at least to call upon Don Fernando to tell me with what\r\nconscience he had done it. I reached my destination in two days and a\r\nhalf, and on entering the city inquired for the house of Luscinda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparents. The first person I asked gave me more in reply than I sought\r\nto know; he showed me the house, and told me all that had occurred at\r\nthe betrothal of the daughter of the family, an affair of such\r\nnotoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers in\r\nthe street. He said that on the night of Don Fernando\xe2\x80\x99s betrothal with\r\nLuscinda, as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe was taken with a sudden fainting fit, and that on the bridegroom\r\napproaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air, he found\r\na paper in her own handwriting, in which she said and declared that she\r\ncould not be Don Fernando\xe2\x80\x99s bride, because she was already Cardenio\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwho, according to the man\xe2\x80\x99s account, was a gentleman of distinction of\r\nthe same city; and that if she had accepted Don Fernando, it was only\r\nin obedience to her parents. In short, he said, the words of the paper\r\nmade it clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of the\r\nbetrothal, and gave her reasons for putting an end to herself all which\r\nwas confirmed, it was said, by a dagger they found somewhere in her\r\nclothes. On seeing this, Don Fernando, persuaded that Luscinda had\r\nbefooled, slighted, and trifled with him, assailed her before she had\r\nrecovered from her swoon, and tried to stab her with the dagger that\r\nhad been found, and would have succeeded had not her parents and those\r\nwho were present prevented him. It was said, moreover, that Don\r\nFernando went away at once, and that Luscinda did not recover from her\r\nprostration until the next day, when she told her parents how she was\r\nreally the bride of that Cardenio I have mentioned. I learned besides\r\nthat Cardenio, according to report, had been present at the betrothal;\r\nand that upon seeing her betrothed contrary to his expectation, he had\r\nquitted the city in despair, leaving behind him a letter declaring the\r\nwrong Luscinda had done him, and his intention of going where no one\r\nshould ever see him again. All this was a matter of notoriety in the\r\ncity, and everyone spoke of it; especially when it became known that\r\nLuscinda was missing from her father\xe2\x80\x99s house and from the city, for she\r\nwas not to be found anywhere, to the distraction of her parents, who\r\nknew not what steps to take to recover her. What I learned revived my\r\nhopes, and I was better pleased not to have found Don Fernando than to\r\nfind him married, for it seemed to me that the door was not yet\r\nentirely shut upon relief in my case, and I thought that perhaps Heaven\r\nhad put this impediment in the way of the second marriage, to lead him\r\nto recognise his obligations under the former one, and reflect that as\r\na Christian he was bound to consider his soul above all human objects.\r\nAll this passed through my mind, and I strove to comfort myself without\r\ncomfort, indulging in faint and distant hopes of cherishing that life\r\nthat I now abhor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut while I was in the city, uncertain what to do, as I could not find\r\nDon Fernando, I heard notice given by the public crier offering a great\r\nreward to anyone who should find me, and giving the particulars of my\r\nage and of the very dress I wore; and I heard it said that the lad who\r\ncame with me had taken me away from my father\xe2\x80\x99s house; a thing that cut\r\nme to the heart, showing how low my good name had fallen, since it was\r\nnot enough that I should lose it by my flight, but they must add with\r\nwhom I had fled, and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of my\r\nconsideration. The instant I heard the notice I quitted the city with\r\nmy servant, who now began to show signs of wavering in his fidelity to\r\nme, and the same night, for fear of discovery, we entered the most\r\nthickly wooded part of these mountains. But, as is commonly said, one\r\nevil calls up another and the end of one misfortune is apt to be the\r\nbeginning of one still greater, and so it proved in my case; for my\r\nworthy servant, until then so faithful and trusty when he found me in\r\nthis lonely spot, moved more by his own villainy than by my beauty,\r\nsought to take advantage of the opportunity which these solitudes\r\nseemed to present him, and with little shame and less fear of God and\r\nrespect for me, began to make overtures to me; and finding that I\r\nreplied to the effrontery of his proposals with justly severe language,\r\nhe laid aside the entreaties which he had employed at first, and began\r\nto use violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc28e.jpg (324K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut just Heaven, that seldom fails to watch over and aid good\r\nintentions, so aided mine that with my slight strength and with little\r\nexertion I pushed him over a precipice, where I left him, whether dead\r\nor alive I know not; and then, with greater speed than seemed possible\r\nin my terror and fatigue, I made my way into the mountains, without any\r\nother thought or purpose save that of hiding myself among them, and\r\nescaping my father and those despatched in search of me by his orders.\r\nIt is now I know not how many months since with this object I came\r\nhere, where I met a herdsman who engaged me as his servant at a place\r\nin the heart of this Sierra, and all this time I have been serving him\r\nas herd, striving to keep always afield to hide these locks which have\r\nnow unexpectedly betrayed me. But all my care and pains were\r\nunavailing, for my master made the discovery that I was not a man, and\r\nharboured the same base designs as my servant; and as fortune does not\r\nalways supply a remedy in cases of difficulty, and I had no precipice\r\nor ravine at hand down which to fling the master and cure his passion,\r\nas I had in the servant\xe2\x80\x99s case, I thought it a lesser evil to leave him\r\nand again conceal myself among these crags, than make trial of my\r\nstrength and argument with him. So, as I say, once more I went into\r\nhiding to seek for some place where I might with sighs and tears\r\nimplore Heaven to have pity on my misery, and grant me help and\r\nstrength to escape from it, or let me die among the solitudes, leaving\r\nno trace of an unhappy being who, by no fault of hers, has furnished\r\nmatter for talk and scandal at home and abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc28f.jpg (42K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF THE DROLL DEVICE AND METHOD ADOPTED TO EXTRICATE OUR\r\nLOVE-STRICKEN KNIGHT FROM THE SEVERE PENANCE HE HAD IMPOSED UPON\r\nHIMSELF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc29a.jpg (99K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch, sirs, is the true story of my sad adventures; judge for\r\nyourselves now whether the sighs and lamentations you heard, and the\r\ntears that flowed from my eyes, had not sufficient cause even if I had\r\nindulged in them more freely; and if you consider the nature of my\r\nmisfortune you will see that consolation is idle, as there is no\r\npossible remedy for it. All I ask of you is, what you may easily and\r\nreasonably do, to show me where I may pass my life unharassed by the\r\nfear and dread of discovery by those who are in search of me; for\r\nthough the great love my parents bear me makes me feel sure of being\r\nkindly received by them, so great is my feeling of shame at the mere\r\nthought that I cannot present myself before them as they expect, that I\r\nhad rather banish myself from their sight for ever than look them in\r\nthe face with the reflection that they beheld mine stripped of that\r\npurity they had a right to expect in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words she became silent, and the colour that overspread her\r\nface showed plainly the pain and shame she was suffering at heart. In\r\ntheirs the listeners felt as much pity as wonder at her misfortunes;\r\nbut as the curate was just about to offer her some consolation and\r\nadvice Cardenio forestalled him, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSo then, se\xc3\xb1ora, you are the\r\nfair Dorothea, the only daughter of the rich Clenardo?\xe2\x80\x9d Dorothea was\r\nastonished at hearing her father\xe2\x80\x99s name, and at the miserable\r\nappearance of him who mentioned it, for it has been already said how\r\nwretchedly clad Cardenio was; so she said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who may you be, brother, who seem to know my father\xe2\x80\x99s name so\r\nwell? For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not mentioned it in the\r\nwhole story of my misfortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am that unhappy being, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cardenio, \xe2\x80\x9cwhom, as you have\r\nsaid, Luscinda declared to be her husband; I am the unfortunate\r\nCardenio, whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your\r\npresent condition has reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged,\r\nbereft of all human comfort, and what is worse, of reason, for I only\r\npossess it when Heaven is pleased for some short space to restore it to\r\nme. I, Dorothea, am he who witnessed the wrong done by Don Fernando,\r\nand waited to hear the \xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x99 uttered by which Luscinda owned herself\r\nhis betrothed: I am he who had not courage enough to see how her\r\nfainting fit ended, or what came of the paper that was found in her\r\nbosom, because my heart had not the fortitude to endure so many strokes\r\nof ill-fortune at once; and so losing patience I quitted the house, and\r\nleaving a letter with my host, which I entreated him to place in\r\nLuscinda\xe2\x80\x99s hands, I betook myself to these solitudes, resolved to end\r\nhere the life I hated as if it were my mortal enemy. But fate would not\r\nrid me of it, contenting itself with robbing me of my reason, perhaps\r\nto preserve me for the good fortune I have had in meeting you; for if\r\nthat which you have just told us be true, as I believe it to be, it may\r\nbe that Heaven has yet in store for both of us a happier termination to\r\nour misfortunes than we look for; because seeing that Luscinda cannot\r\nmarry Don Fernando, being mine, as she has herself so openly declared,\r\nand that Don Fernando cannot marry her as he is yours, we may\r\nreasonably hope that Heaven will restore to us what is ours, as it is\r\nstill in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed. And as we have\r\nthis consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, I\r\nentreat you, se\xc3\xb1ora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as I\r\nmean to do in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happier\r\nfortunes; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a\r\nChristian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don\r\nFernando, and if I cannot by words induce him to recognise his\r\nobligation to you, in that case to avail myself of the right which my\r\nrank as a gentleman gives me, and with just cause challenge him on\r\naccount of the injury he has done you, not regarding my own wrongs,\r\nwhich I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while I on earth devote myself\r\nto yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCardenio\xe2\x80\x99s words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, and not\r\nknowing how to return thanks for such an offer, she attempted to kiss\r\nhis feet; but Cardenio would not permit it, and the licentiate replied\r\nfor both, commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly,\r\nbegged, advised, and urged them to come with him to his village, where\r\nthey might furnish themselves with what they needed, and take measures\r\nto discover Don Fernando, or restore Dorothea to her parents, or do\r\nwhat seemed to them most advisable. Cardenio and Dorothea thanked him,\r\nand accepted the kind offer he made them; and the barber, who had been\r\nlistening to all attentively and in silence, on his part some kindly\r\nwords also, and with no less good-will than the curate offered his\r\nservices in any way that might be of use to them. He also explained to\r\nthem in a few words the object that had brought them there, and the\r\nstrange nature of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s madness, and how they were waiting for\r\nhis squire, who had gone in search of him. Like the recollection of a\r\ndream, the quarrel he had had with Don Quixote came back to Cardenio\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmemory, and he described it to the others; but he was unable to say\r\nwhat the dispute was about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc29b.jpg (351K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this moment they heard a shout, and recognised it as coming from\r\nSancho Panza, who, not finding them where he had left them, was calling\r\naloud to them. They went to meet him, and in answer to their inquiries\r\nabout Don Quixote, he told them how he had found him stripped to his\r\nshirt, lank, yellow, half dead with hunger, and sighing for his lady\r\nDulcinea; and although he had told him that she commanded him to quit\r\nthat place and come to El Toboso, where she was expecting him, he had\r\nanswered that he was determined not to appear in the presence of her\r\nbeauty until he had done deeds to make him worthy of her favour; and if\r\nthis went on, Sancho said, he ran the risk of not becoming an emperor\r\nas in duty bound, or even an archbishop, which was the least he could\r\nbe; for which reason they ought to consider what was to be done to get\r\nhim away from there. The licentiate in reply told him not to be uneasy,\r\nfor they would fetch him away in spite of himself. He then told\r\nCardenio and Dorothea what they had proposed to do to cure Don Quixote,\r\nor at any rate take him home; upon which Dorothea said that she could\r\nplay the distressed damsel better than the barber; especially as she\r\nhad there the dress in which to do it to the life, and that they might\r\ntrust to her acting the part in every particular requisite for carrying\r\nout their scheme, for she had read a great many books of chivalry, and\r\nknew exactly the style in which afflicted damsels begged boons of\r\nknights-errant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing more required than\r\nto set about it at once, for beyond a doubt fortune is declaring itself\r\nin our favour, since it has so unexpectedly begun to open a door for\r\nyour relief, and smoothed the way for us to our object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorothea then took out of her pillow-case a complete petticoat of some\r\nrich stuff, and a green mantle of some other fine material, and a\r\nnecklace and other ornaments out of a little box, and with these in an\r\ninstant she so arrayed herself that she looked like a great and rich\r\nlady. All this, and more, she said, she had taken from home in case of\r\nneed, but that until then she had had no occasion to make use of it.\r\nThey were all highly delighted with her grace, air, and beauty, and\r\ndeclared Don Fernando to be a man of very little taste when he rejected\r\nsuch charms. But the one who admired her most was Sancho Panza, for it\r\nseemed to him (what indeed was true) that in all the days of his life\r\nhe had never seen such a lovely creature; and he asked the curate with\r\ngreat eagerness who this beautiful lady was, and what she wanted in\r\nthese out-of-the-way quarters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis fair lady, brother Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cis no less a\r\npersonage than the heiress in the direct male line of the great kingdom\r\nof Micomicon, who has come in search of your master to beg a boon of\r\nhim, which is that he redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant has\r\ndone her; and from the fame as a good knight which your master has\r\nacquired far and wide, this princess has come from Guinea to seek him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lucky seeking and a lucky finding!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho Panza at this;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cespecially if my master has the good fortune to redress that injury,\r\nand right that wrong, and kill that son of a bitch of a giant your\r\nworship speaks of; as kill him he will if he meets him, unless, indeed,\r\nhe happens to be a phantom; for my master has no power at all against\r\nphantoms. But one thing among others I would beg of you, se\xc3\xb1or\r\nlicentiate, which is, that, to prevent my master taking a fancy to be\r\nan archbishop, for that is what I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of, your worship would\r\nrecommend him to marry this princess at once; for in this way he will\r\nbe disabled from taking archbishop\xe2\x80\x99s orders, and will easily come into\r\nhis empire, and I to the end of my desires; I have been thinking over\r\nthe matter carefully, and by what I can make out I find it will not do\r\nfor me that my master should become an archbishop, because I am no good\r\nfor the Church, as I am married; and for me now, having as I have a\r\nwife and children, to set about obtaining dispensations to enable me to\r\nhold a place of profit under the Church, would be endless work; so\r\nthat, se\xc3\xb1or, it all turns on my master marrying this lady at once\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nas yet I do not know her grace, and so I cannot call her by her name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is called the Princess Micomicona,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cfor as her\r\nkingdom is Micomicon, it is clear that must be her name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt of that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have known many to\r\ntake their name and title from the place where they were born and call\r\nthemselves Pedro of Alcal\xc3\xa1, Juan of \xc3\x9abeda, and Diego of Valladolid; and\r\nit may be that over there in Guinea queens have the same way of taking\r\nthe names of their kingdoms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it may,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cand as for your master\xe2\x80\x99s marrying, I\r\nwill do all in my power towards it:\xe2\x80\x9d with which Sancho was as much\r\npleased as the curate was amazed at his simplicity and at seeing what a\r\nhold the absurdities of his master had taken of his fancy, for he had\r\nevidently persuaded himself that he was going to be an emperor.\r\n\r\nBy this time Dorothea had seated herself upon the curate\xe2\x80\x99s mule, and\r\nthe barber had fitted the ox-tail beard to his face, and they now told\r\nSancho to conduct them to where Don Quixote was, warning him not to say\r\nthat he knew either the licentiate or the barber, as his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbecoming an emperor entirely depended on his not recognising them;\r\nneither the curate nor Cardenio, however, thought fit to go with them;\r\nCardenio lest he should remind Don Quixote of the quarrel he had with\r\nhim, and the curate as there was no necessity for his presence just\r\nyet, so they allowed the others to go on before them, while they\r\nthemselves followed slowly on foot. The curate did not forget to\r\ninstruct Dorothea how to act, but she said they might make their minds\r\neasy, as everything would be done exactly as the books of chivalry\r\nrequired and described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc29c.jpg (286K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had gone about three-quarters of a league when they discovered Don\r\nQuixote in a wilderness of rocks, by this time clothed, but without his\r\narmour; and as soon as Dorothea saw him and was told by Sancho that\r\nthat was Don Quixote, she whipped her palfrey, the well-bearded barber\r\nfollowing her, and on coming up to him her squire sprang from his mule\r\nand came forward to receive her in his arms, and she dismounting with\r\ngreat ease of manner advanced to kneel before the feet of Don Quixote;\r\nand though he strove to raise her up, she without rising addressed him\r\nin this fashion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom this spot I will not rise, valiant and doughty knight, until your\r\ngoodness and courtesy grant me a boon, which will redound to the honour\r\nand renown of your person and render a service to the most disconsolate\r\nand afflicted damsel the sun has seen; and if the might of your strong\r\narm corresponds to the repute of your immortal fame, you are bound to\r\naid the helpless being who, led by the savour of your renowned name,\r\nhath come from far distant lands to seek your aid in her misfortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not answer a word, beauteous lady,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cnor\r\nwill I listen to anything further concerning you, until you rise from\r\nthe earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not rise, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the afflicted damsel, \xe2\x80\x9cunless of\r\nyour courtesy the boon I ask is first granted me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI grant and accord it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cprovided without detriment\r\nor prejudice to my king, my country, or her who holds the key of my\r\nheart and freedom, it may be complied with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not be to the detriment or prejudice of any of them, my worthy\r\nlord,\xe2\x80\x9d said the afflicted damsel; and here Sancho Panza drew close to\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s ear and said to him very softly, \xe2\x80\x9cYour worship may very\r\nsafely grant the boon she asks; it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing at all; only to kill a big\r\ngiant; and she who asks it is the exalted Princess Micomicona, queen of\r\nthe great kingdom of Micomicon of Ethiopia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her be who she may,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI will do what is my\r\nbounden duty, and what my conscience bids me, in conformity with what I\r\nhave professed;\xe2\x80\x9d and turning to the damsel he said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet your great\r\nbeauty rise, for I grant the boon which you would ask of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what I ask,\xe2\x80\x9d said the damsel, \xe2\x80\x9cis that your magnanimous person\r\naccompany me at once whither I will conduct you, and that you promise\r\nnot to engage in any other adventure or quest until you have avenged me\r\nof a traitor who against all human and divine law, has usurped my\r\nkingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI repeat that I grant it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand so, lady, you may\r\nfrom this day forth lay aside the melancholy that distresses you, and\r\nlet your failing hopes gather new life and strength, for with the help\r\nof God and of my arm you will soon see yourself restored to your\r\nkingdom, and seated upon the throne of your ancient and mighty realm,\r\nnotwithstanding and despite of the felons who would gainsay it; and now\r\nhands to the work, for in delay there is apt to be danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe distressed damsel strove with much pertinacity to kiss his hands;\r\nbut Don Quixote, who was in all things a polished and courteous knight,\r\nwould by no means allow it, but made her rise and embraced her with\r\ngreat courtesy and politeness, and ordered Sancho to look to\r\nRocinante\xe2\x80\x99s girths, and to arm him without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay. Sancho\r\ntook down the armour, which was hung up on a tree like a trophy, and\r\nhaving seen to the girths armed his master in a trice, who as soon as\r\nhe found himself in his armour exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us be gone in the name of God to bring aid to this great lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe barber was all this time on his knees at great pains to hide his\r\nlaughter and not let his beard fall, for had it fallen maybe their fine\r\nscheme would have come to nothing; but now seeing the boon granted, and\r\nthe promptitude with which Don Quixote prepared to set out in\r\ncompliance with it, he rose and took his lady\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and between them\r\nthey placed her upon the mule. Don Quixote then mounted Rocinante, and\r\nthe barber settled himself on his beast, Sancho being left to go on\r\nfoot, which made him feel anew the loss of his Dapple, finding the want\r\nof him now. But he bore all with cheerfulness, being persuaded that his\r\nmaster had now fairly started and was just on the point of becoming an\r\nemperor; for he felt no doubt at all that he would marry this princess,\r\nand be king of Micomicon at least. The only thing that troubled him was\r\nthe reflection that this kingdom was in the land of the blacks, and\r\nthat the people they would give him for vassals would be all black; but\r\nfor this he soon found a remedy in his fancy, and said he to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it to me if my vassals are blacks? What more have I to do than\r\nmake a cargo of them and carry them to Spain, where I can sell them and\r\nget ready money for them, and with it buy some title or some office in\r\nwhich to live at ease all the days of my life? Not unless you go to\r\nsleep and haven\xe2\x80\x99t the wit or skill to turn things to account and sell\r\nthree, six, or ten thousand vassals while you would be talking about\r\nit! By God I will stir them up, big and little, or as best I can, and\r\nlet them be ever so black I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn them into white or yellow. Come,\r\ncome, what a fool I am!\xe2\x80\x9d And so he jogged on, so occupied with his\r\nthoughts and easy in his mind that he forgot all about the hardship of\r\ntravelling on foot.\r\n\r\nCardenio and the curate were watching all this from among some bushes,\r\nnot knowing how to join company with the others; but the curate, who\r\nwas very fertile in devices, soon hit upon a way of effecting their\r\npurpose, and with a pair of scissors he had in a case he quickly cut\r\noff Cardenio\xe2\x80\x99s beard, and putting on him a grey jerkin of his own he\r\ngave him a black cloak, leaving himself in his breeches and doublet,\r\nwhile Cardenio\xe2\x80\x99s appearance was so different from what it had been that\r\nhe would not have known himself had he seen himself in a mirror. Having\r\neffected this, although the others had gone on ahead while they were\r\ndisguising themselves, they easily came out on the high road before\r\nthem, for the brambles and awkward places they encountered did not\r\nallow those on horseback to go as fast as those on foot. They then\r\nposted themselves on the level ground at the outlet of the Sierra, and\r\nas soon as Don Quixote and his companions emerged from it the curate\r\nbegan to examine him very deliberately, as though he were striving to\r\nrecognise him, and after having stared at him for some time he hastened\r\ntowards him with open arms exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cA happy meeting with the mirror\r\nof chivalry, my worthy compatriot Don Quixote of La Mancha, the flower\r\nand cream of high breeding, the protection and relief of the\r\ndistressed, the quintessence of knights-errant!\xe2\x80\x9d And so saying he\r\nclasped in his arms the knee of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s left leg. He, astonished\r\nat the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s words and behaviour, looked at him attentively, and\r\nat length recognised him, very much surprised to see him there, and\r\nmade great efforts to dismount. This, however, the curate would not\r\nallow, on which Don Quixote said, \xe2\x80\x9cPermit me, se\xc3\xb1or licentiate, for it\r\nis not fitting that I should be on horseback and so reverend a person\r\nas your worship on foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn no account will I allow it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cyour mightiness must\r\nremain on horseback, for it is on horseback you achieve the greatest\r\ndeeds and adventures that have been beheld in our age; as for me, an\r\nunworthy priest, it will serve me well enough to mount on the haunches\r\nof one of the mules of these gentlefolk who accompany your worship, if\r\nthey have no objection, and I will fancy I am mounted on the steed\r\nPegasus, or on the zebra or charger that bore the famous Moor,\r\nMuzaraque, who to this day lies enchanted in the great hill of Zulema,\r\na little distance from the great Complutum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor even that will I consent to, se\xc3\xb1or licentiate,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don\r\nQuixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know it will be the good pleasure of my lady the\r\nprincess, out of love for me, to order her squire to give up the saddle\r\nof his mule to your worship, and he can sit behind if the beast will\r\nbear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the princess, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am sure, too, that I\r\nneed not order my squire, for he is too courteous and considerate to\r\nallow a Churchman to go on foot when he might be mounted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, and at once alighting, he offered his\r\nsaddle to the curate, who accepted it without much entreaty; but\r\nunfortunately as the barber was mounting behind, the mule, being as it\r\nhappened a hired one, which is the same thing as saying\r\nill-conditioned, lifted its hind hoofs and let fly a couple of kicks in\r\nthe air, which would have made Master Nicholas wish his expedition in\r\nquest of Don Quixote at the devil had they caught him on the breast or\r\nhead. As it was, they so took him by surprise that he came to the\r\nground, giving so little heed to his beard that it fell off, and all he\r\ncould do when he found himself without it was to cover his face hastily\r\nwith both his hands and moan that his teeth were knocked out. Don\r\nQuixote when he saw all that bundle of beard detached, without jaws or\r\nblood, from the face of the fallen squire, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the living God, but this is a great miracle! it has knocked off and\r\nplucked away the beard from his face as if it had been shaved off\r\ndesignedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe curate, seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his scheme,\r\nat once pounced upon the beard and hastened with it to where Master\r\nNicholas lay, still uttering moans, and drawing his head to his breast\r\nhad it on in an instant, muttering over him some words which he said\r\nwere a certain special charm for sticking on beards, as they would see;\r\nand as soon as he had it fixed he left him, and the squire appeared\r\nwell bearded and whole as before, whereat Don Quixote was beyond\r\nmeasure astonished, and begged the curate to teach him that charm when\r\nhe had an opportunity, as he was persuaded its virtue must extend\r\nbeyond the sticking on of beards, for it was clear that where the beard\r\nhad been stripped off the flesh must have remained torn and lacerated,\r\nand when it could heal all that it must be good for more than beards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, and he promised to teach it to him on\r\nthe first opportunity. They then agreed that for the present the curate\r\nshould mount, and that the three should ride by turns until they\r\nreached the inn, which might be about six leagues from where they were.\r\n\r\nThree then being mounted, that is to say, Don Quixote, the princess,\r\nand the curate, and three on foot, Cardenio, the barber, and Sancho\r\nPanza, Don Quixote said to the damsel:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet your highness, lady, lead on whithersoever is most pleasing to\r\nyou;\xe2\x80\x9d but before she could answer the licentiate said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc29d.jpg (345K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTowards what kingdom would your ladyship direct our course?

I will only say, se\xc3\xb1ora, that whether it\r\nhas might or not, that which it may or may not have shall be devoted to\r\nyour service even to death; and now, leaving this to its proper season,\r\nI would ask the se\xc3\xb1or licentiate to tell me what it is that has brought\r\nhim into these parts, alone, unattended, and so lightly clad that I am\r\nfilled with amazement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will answer that briefly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must know then,\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, that Master Nicholas, our friend and barber, and I\r\nwere going to Seville to receive some money that a relative of mine who\r\nwent to the Indies many years ago had sent me, and not such a small sum\r\nbut that it was over sixty thousand pieces of eight, full weight, which\r\nis something; and passing by this place yesterday we were attacked by\r\nfour footpads, who stripped us even to our beards, and them they\r\nstripped off so that the barber found it necessary to put on a false\r\none, and even this young man here\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94pointing to Cardenio\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\ncompletely transformed. But the best of it is, the story goes in the\r\nneighbourhood that those who attacked us belong to a number of galley\r\nslaves who, they say, were set free almost on the very same spot by a\r\nman of such valour that, in spite of the commissary and of the guards,\r\nhe released the whole of them; and beyond all doubt he must have been\r\nout of his senses, or he must be as great a scoundrel as they, or some\r\nman without heart or conscience to let the wolf loose among the sheep,\r\nthe fox among the hens, the fly among the honey. He has defrauded\r\njustice, and opposed his king and lawful master, for he opposed his\r\njust commands; he has, I say, robbed the galleys of their feet, stirred\r\nup the Holy Brotherhood which for many years past has been quiet, and,\r\nlastly, has done a deed by which his soul may be lost without any gain\r\nto his body.\xe2\x80\x9d Sancho had told the curate and the barber of the\r\nadventure of the galley slaves, which, so much to his glory, his master\r\nhad achieved, and hence the curate in alluding to it made the most of\r\nit to see what would be said or done by Don Quixote; who changed colour\r\nat every word, not daring to say that it was he who had been the\r\nliberator of those worthy people. \xe2\x80\x9cThese, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cwere\r\nthey who robbed us; and God in his mercy pardon him who would not let\r\nthem go to the punishment they deserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc29f.jpg (53K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF ADDRESS DISPLAYED BY THE FAIR DOROTHEA, WITH OTHER\r\nMATTERS PLEASANT AND AMUSING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc30a.jpg (147K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curate had hardly ceased speaking, when Sancho said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn faith,\r\nthen, se\xc3\xb1or licentiate, he who did that deed was my master; and it was\r\nnot for want of my telling him beforehand and warning him to mind what\r\nhe was about, and that it was a sin to set them at liberty, as they\r\nwere all on the march there because they were special scoundrels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlockhead!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote at this, \xe2\x80\x9cit is no business or concern of\r\nknights-errant to inquire whether any persons in affliction, in chains,\r\nor oppressed that they may meet on the high roads go that way and\r\nsuffer as they do because of their faults or because of their\r\nmisfortunes. It only concerns them to aid them as persons in need of\r\nhelp, having regard to their sufferings and not to their rascalities. I\r\nencountered a chaplet or string of miserable and unfortunate people,\r\nand did for them what my sense of duty demands of me, and as for the\r\nrest be that as it may; and whoever takes objection to it, saving the\r\nsacred dignity of the se\xc3\xb1or licentiate and his honoured person, I say\r\nhe knows little about chivalry and lies like a whoreson villain, and\r\nthis I will give him to know to the fullest extent with my sword;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nso saying he settled himself in his stirrups and pressed down his\r\nmorion; for the barber\xe2\x80\x99s basin, which according to him was Mambrino\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhelmet, he carried hanging at the saddle-bow until he could repair the\r\ndamage done to it by the galley slaves.\r\n\r\nDorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughly\r\nunderstood Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s crazy turn, and that all except Sancho Panza\r\nwere making game of him, not to be behind the rest said to him, on\r\nobserving his irritation, \xe2\x80\x9cSir Knight, remember the boon you have\r\npromised me, and that in accordance with it you must not engage in any\r\nother adventure, be it ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if the\r\nlicentiate had known that the galley slaves had been set free by that\r\nunconquered arm he would have stopped his mouth thrice over, or even\r\nbitten his tongue three times before he would have said a word that\r\ntended towards disrespect of your worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I swear heartily,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cand I would have even\r\nplucked off a moustache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will hold my peace, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will curb the\r\nnatural anger that had arisen in my breast, and will proceed in peace\r\nand quietness until I have fulfilled my promise; but in return for this\r\nconsideration I entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to do\r\nso, what is the nature of your trouble, and how many, who, and what are\r\nthe persons of whom I am to require due satisfaction, and on whom I am\r\nto take vengeance on your behalf?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will do with all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dorothea, \xe2\x80\x9cif it will not\r\nbe wearisome to you to hear of miseries and misfortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not be wearisome, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; to which Dorothea\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if that be so, give me your attention.\xe2\x80\x9d As soon as she\r\nsaid this, Cardenio and the barber drew close to her side, eager to\r\nhear what sort of story the quick-witted Dorothea would invent for\r\nherself; and Sancho did the same, for he was as much taken in by her as\r\nhis master; and she having settled herself comfortably in the saddle,\r\nand with the help of coughing and other preliminaries taken time to\r\nthink, began with great sprightliness of manner in this fashion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, I would have you know, sirs, that my name is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and here\r\nshe stopped for a moment, for she forgot the name the curate had given\r\nher; but he came to her relief, seeing what her difficulty was, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is no wonder, se\xc3\xb1ora, that your highness should be confused\r\nand embarrassed in telling the tale of your misfortunes; for such\r\nafflictions often have the effect of depriving the sufferers of memory,\r\nso that they do not even remember their own names, as is the case now\r\nwith your ladyship, who has forgotten that she is called the Princess\r\nMicomicona, lawful heiress of the great kingdom of Micomicon; and with\r\nthis cue your highness may now recall to your sorrowful recollection\r\nall you may wish to tell us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the damsel; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think from this on I shall\r\nhave no need of any prompting, and I shall bring my true story safe\r\ninto port, and here it is. The king my father, who was called Tinacrio\r\nthe Sapient, was very learned in what they call magic arts, and became\r\naware by his craft that my mother, who was called Queen Jaramilla, was\r\nto die before he did, and that soon after he too was to depart this\r\nlife, and I was to be left an orphan without father or mother. But all\r\nthis, he declared, did not so much grieve or distress him as his\r\ncertain knowledge that a prodigious giant, the lord of a great island\r\nclose to our kingdom, Pandafilando of the Scowl by name\xe2\x80\x94for it is\r\naverred that, though his eyes are properly placed and straight, he\r\nalways looks askew as if he squinted, and this he does out of\r\nmalignity, to strike fear and terror into those he looks at\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\nknew, I say, that this giant on becoming aware of my orphan condition\r\nwould overrun my kingdom with a mighty force and strip me of all, not\r\nleaving me even a small village to shelter me; but that I could avoid\r\nall this ruin and misfortune if I were willing to marry him; however,\r\nas far as he could see, he never expected that I would consent to a\r\nmarriage so unequal; and he said no more than the truth in this, for it\r\nhas never entered my mind to marry that giant, or any other, let him be\r\never so great or enormous. My father said, too, that when he was dead,\r\nand I saw Pandafilando about to invade my kingdom, I was not to wait\r\nand attempt to defend myself, for that would be destructive to me, but\r\nthat I should leave the kingdom entirely open to him if I wished to\r\navoid the death and total destruction of my good and loyal vassals, for\r\nthere would be no possibility of defending myself against the giant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndevilish power; and that I should at once with some of my followers set\r\nout for Spain, where I should obtain relief in my distress on finding a\r\ncertain knight-errant whose fame by that time would extend over the\r\nwhole kingdom, and who would be called, if I remember rightly, Don\r\nAzote or Don Gigote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x99 he must have said, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Sancho at this,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cotherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorothea; \xe2\x80\x9che said, moreover, that he would be tall\r\nof stature and lank featured; and that on his right side under the left\r\nshoulder, or thereabouts, he would have a grey mole with hairs like\r\nbristles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Don Quixote said to his squire, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Sancho my son,\r\nbear a hand and help me to strip, for I want to see if I am the knight\r\nthat sage king foretold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does your worship want to strip for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorothea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see if I have that mole your father spoke of,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don\r\nQuixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no occasion to strip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I know your worship\r\nhas just such a mole on the middle of your backbone, which is the mark\r\nof a strong man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorothea, \xe2\x80\x9cfor with friends we must not look too\r\nclosely into trifles; and whether it be on the shoulder or on the\r\nbackbone matters little; it is enough if there is a mole, be it where\r\nit may, for it is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit the\r\ntruth in every particular, and I have made a lucky hit in commending\r\nmyself to Don Quixote; for he is the one my father spoke of, as the\r\nfeatures of his countenance correspond with those assigned to this\r\nknight by that wide fame he has acquired not only in Spain but in all\r\nLa Mancha; for I had scarcely landed at Osuna when I heard such\r\naccounts of his achievements, that at once my heart told me he was the\r\nvery one I had come in search of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how did you land at Osuna, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it is\r\nnot a seaport?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut before Dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her, saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe princess meant to say that after she had landed at Malaga the\r\nfirst place where she heard of your worship was Osuna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I meant to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorothea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that would be only natural,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate. \xe2\x80\x9cWill your majesty\r\nplease proceed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no more to add,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorothea, \xe2\x80\x9csave that in finding Don\r\nQuixote I have had such good fortune, that I already reckon and regard\r\nmyself queen and mistress of my entire dominions, since of his courtesy\r\nand magnanimity he has granted me the boon of accompanying me\r\nwhithersoever I may conduct him, which will be only to bring him face\r\nto face with Pandafilando of the Scowl, that he may slay him and\r\nrestore to me what has been unjustly usurped by him: for all this must\r\ncome to pass satisfactorily since my good father Tinacrio the Sapient\r\nforetold it, who likewise left it declared in writing in Chaldee or\r\nGreek characters (for I cannot read them), that if this predicted\r\nknight, after having cut the giant\xe2\x80\x99s throat, should be disposed to\r\nmarry me I was to offer myself at once without demur as his lawful\r\nwife, and yield him possession of my kingdom together with my person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat thinkest thou now, friend Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote at this.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHearest thou that? Did I not tell thee so? See how we have already got\r\na kingdom to govern and a queen to marry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my oath it is so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand foul fortune to him who won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmarry after slitting Se\xc3\xb1or Pandahilado\xe2\x80\x99s windpipe! And then, how\r\nillfavoured the queen is! I wish the fleas in my bed were that sort!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so saying he cut a couple of capers in the air with every sign of\r\nextreme satisfaction, and then ran to seize the bridle of Dorothea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmule, and checking it fell on his knees before her, begging her to give\r\nhim her hand to kiss in token of his acknowledgment of her as his queen\r\nand mistress. Which of the bystanders could have helped laughing to see\r\nthe madness of the master and the simplicity of the servant? Dorothea\r\ntherefore gave her hand, and promised to make him a great lord in her\r\nkingdom, when Heaven should be so good as to permit her to recover and\r\nenjoy it, for which Sancho returned thanks in words that set them all\r\nlaughing again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Dorothea, \xe2\x80\x9cis my story; it only remains to tell\r\nyou that of all the attendants I took with me from my kingdom I have\r\nnone left except this well-bearded squire, for all were drowned in a\r\ngreat tempest we encountered when in sight of port; and he and I came\r\nto land on a couple of planks as if by a miracle; and indeed the whole\r\ncourse of my life is a miracle and a mystery as you may have observed;\r\nand if I have been over minute in any respect or not as precise as I\r\nought, let it be accounted for by what the licentiate said at the\r\nbeginning of my tale, that constant and excessive troubles deprive the\r\nsufferers of their memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey shall not deprive me of mine, exalted and worthy princess,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDon Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9chowever great and unexampled those which I shall endure\r\nin your service may be; and here I confirm anew the boon I have\r\npromised you, and I swear to go with you to the end of the world until\r\nI find myself in the presence of your fierce enemy, whose haughty head\r\nI trust by the aid of my arm to cut off with the edge of this\xe2\x80\x94I will\r\nnot say good sword, thanks to Gines de Pasamonte who carried away\r\nmine\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(this he said between his teeth, and then continued), \xe2\x80\x9cand when\r\nit has been cut off and you have been put in peaceful possession of\r\nyour realm it shall be left to your own decision to dispose of your\r\nperson as may be most pleasing to you; for so long as my memory is\r\noccupied, my will enslaved, and my understanding enthralled by her\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsay no more\xe2\x80\x94it is impossible for me for a moment to contemplate\r\nmarriage, even with a Ph\xc5\x93nix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last words of his master about not wanting to marry were so\r\ndisagreeable to Sancho that raising his voice he exclaimed with great\r\nirritation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my oath, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, you are not in your right senses; for\r\nhow can your worship possibly object to marrying such an exalted\r\nprincess as this? Do you think Fortune will offer you behind every\r\nstone such a piece of luck as is offered you now? Is my lady Dulcinea\r\nfairer, perchance? Not she; nor half as fair; and I will even go so far\r\nas to say she does not come up to the shoe of this one here. A poor\r\nchance I have of getting that county I am waiting for if your worship\r\ngoes looking for dainties in the bottom of the sea. In the devil\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname, marry, marry, and take this kingdom that comes to hand without\r\nany trouble, and when you are king make me a marquis or governor of a\r\nprovince, and for the rest let the devil take it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote, when he heard such blasphemies uttered against his lady\r\nDulcinea, could not endure it, and lifting his pike, without saying\r\nanything to Sancho or uttering a word, he gave him two such thwacks\r\nthat he brought him to the ground; and had it not been that Dorothea\r\ncried out to him to spare him he would have no doubt taken his life on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to him after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cyou scurvy clown, that\r\nyou are to be always interfering with me, and that you are to be always\r\noffending and I always pardoning? Don\xe2\x80\x99t fancy it, impious scoundrel,\r\nfor that beyond a doubt thou art, since thou hast set thy tongue going\r\nagainst the peerless Dulcinea. Know you not, lout, vagabond, beggar,\r\nthat were it not for the might that she infuses into my arm I should\r\nnot have strength enough to kill a flea? Say, scoffer with a viper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntongue, what think you has won this kingdom and cut off this giant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead and made you a marquis (for all this I count as already\r\naccomplished and decided), but the might of Dulcinea, employing my arm\r\nas the instrument of her achievements? She fights in me and conquers in\r\nme, and I live and breathe in her, and owe my life and being to her. O\r\nwhoreson scoundrel, how ungrateful you are, you see yourself raised\r\nfrom the dust of the earth to be a titled lord, and the return you make\r\nfor so great a benefit is to speak evil of her who has conferred it\r\nupon you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho was not so stunned but that he heard all his master said, and\r\nrising with some degree of nimbleness he ran to place himself behind\r\nDorothea\xe2\x80\x99s palfrey, and from that position he said to his master:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, se\xc3\xb1or; if your worship is resolved not to marry this great\r\nprincess, it is plain the kingdom will not be yours; and not being so,\r\nhow can you bestow favours upon me? That is what I complain of. Let\r\nyour worship at any rate marry this queen, now that we have got her\r\nhere as if showered down from heaven, and afterwards you may go back to\r\nmy lady Dulcinea; for there must have been kings in the world who kept\r\nmistresses. As to beauty, I have nothing to do with it; and if the\r\ntruth is to be told, I like them both; though I have never seen the\r\nlady Dulcinea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! never seen her, blasphemous traitor!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Don Quixote;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chast thou not just now brought me a message from her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I did not see her so much at my leisure\r\nthat I could take particular notice of her beauty, or of her charms\r\npiecemeal; but taken in the lump I like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I forgive thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand do thou forgive me the\r\ninjury I have done thee; for our first impulses are not in our\r\ncontrol.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I see,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand with me the wish to speak is always\r\nthe first impulse, and I cannot help saying, once at any rate, what I\r\nhave on the tip of my tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9ctake heed of what thou\r\nsayest, for the pitcher goes so often to the well\xe2\x80\x94I need say no more to\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cGod is in heaven, and sees all tricks, and\r\nwill judge who does most harm, I in not speaking right, or your worship\r\nin not doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorothea; \xe2\x80\x9crun, Sancho, and kiss your lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand and beg his pardon, and henceforward be more circumspect with your\r\npraise and abuse; and say nothing in disparagement of that lady Toboso,\r\nof whom I know nothing save that I am her servant; and put your trust\r\nin God, for you will not fail to obtain some dignity so as to live like\r\na prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho advanced hanging his head and begged his master\xe2\x80\x99s hand, which\r\nDon Quixote with dignity presented to him, giving him his blessing as\r\nsoon as he had kissed it; he then bade him go on ahead a little, as he\r\nhad questions to ask him and matters of great importance to discuss\r\nwith him. Sancho obeyed, and when the two had gone some distance in\r\nadvance Don Quixote said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cSince thy return I have had no\r\nopportunity or time to ask thee many particulars touching thy mission\r\nand the answer thou hast brought back, and now that chance has granted\r\nus the time and opportunity, deny me not the happiness thou canst give\r\nme by such good news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet your worship ask what you will,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I shall\r\nfind a way out of all as I found a way in; but I implore you, se\xc3\xb1or,\r\nnot to be so revengeful in future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy dost thou say that, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say it,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause those blows just now were more\r\nbecause of the quarrel the devil stirred up between us both the other\r\nnight, than for what I said against my lady Dulcinea, whom I love and\r\nreverence as I would a relic\xe2\x80\x94though there is nothing of that about\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94merely as something belonging to your worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay no more on that subject for thy life, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor it is displeasing to me; I have already pardoned thee for that,\r\nand thou knowest the common saying, \xe2\x80\x98for a fresh sin a fresh penance.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on they saw coming along the road they were\r\nfollowing a man mounted on an ass, who when he came close seemed to be\r\na gipsy; but Sancho Panza, whose eyes and heart were there wherever he\r\nsaw asses, no sooner beheld the man than he knew him to be Gines de\r\nPasamonte; and by the thread of the gipsy he got at the ball, his ass,\r\nfor it was, in fact, Dapple that carried Pasamonte, who to escape\r\nrecognition and to sell the ass had disguised himself as a gipsy, being\r\nable to speak the gipsy language, and many more, as well as if they\r\nwere his own. Sancho saw him and recognised him, and the instant he did\r\nso he shouted to him, \xe2\x80\x9cGinesillo, you thief, give up my treasure,\r\nrelease my life, embarrass thyself not with my repose, quit my ass,\r\nleave my delight, be off, rip, get thee gone, thief, and give up what\r\nis not thine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no necessity for so many words or objurgations, for at the\r\nfirst one Gines jumped down, and at a like racing speed made off and\r\ngot clear of them all. Sancho hastened to his Dapple, and embracing him\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow hast thou fared, my blessing, Dapple of my eyes, my\r\ncomrade?\xe2\x80\x9d all the while kissing him and caressing him as if he were a\r\nhuman being. The ass held his peace, and let himself be kissed and\r\ncaressed by Sancho without answering a single word. They all came up\r\nand congratulated him on having found Dapple, Don Quixote especially,\r\nwho told him that notwithstanding this he would not cancel the order\r\nfor the three ass-colts, for which Sancho thanked him.\r\n\r\nWhile the two had been going along conversing in this fashion, the\r\ncurate observed to Dorothea that she had shown great cleverness, as\r\nwell in the story itself as in its conciseness, and the resemblance it\r\nbore to those of the books of chivalry. She said that she had many\r\ntimes amused herself reading them; but that she did not know the\r\nsituation of the provinces or seaports, and so she had said at\r\nhaphazard that she had landed at Osuna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I saw,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cand for that reason I made haste to say\r\nwhat I did, by which it was all set right. But is it not a strange\r\nthing to see how readily this unhappy gentleman believes all these\r\nfigments and lies, simply because they are in the style and manner of\r\nthe absurdities of his books?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cardenio; \xe2\x80\x9cand so uncommon and unexampled, that were\r\none to attempt to invent and concoct it in fiction, I doubt if there be\r\nany wit keen enough to imagine it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut another strange thing about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cis that, apart\r\nfrom the silly things which this worthy gentleman says in connection\r\nwith his craze, when other subjects are dealt with, he can discuss them\r\nin a perfectly rational manner, showing that his mind is quite clear\r\nand composed; so that, provided his chivalry is not touched upon, no\r\none would take him to be anything but a man of thoroughly sound\r\nunderstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile they were holding this conversation Don Quixote continued his\r\nwith Sancho, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend Panza, let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels, and tell\r\nme now, dismissing anger and irritation, where, how, and when didst\r\nthou find Dulcinea? What was she doing? What didst thou say to her?\r\nWhat did she answer? How did she look when she was reading my letter?\r\nWho copied it out for thee? and everything in the matter that seems to\r\nthee worth knowing, asking, and learning; neither adding nor falsifying\r\nto give me pleasure, nor yet curtailing lest you should deprive me of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif the truth is to be told, nobody copied out\r\nthe letter for me, for I carried no letter at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as thou sayest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the notebook in which I\r\nwrote it I found in my own possession two days after thy departure,\r\nwhich gave me very great vexation, as I knew not what thou wouldst do\r\non finding thyself without any letter; and I made sure thou wouldst\r\nreturn from the place where thou didst first miss it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I should have done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif I had not got it by heart\r\nwhen your worship read it to me, so that I repeated it to a sacristan,\r\nwho copied it out for me from hearing it, so exactly that he said in\r\nall the days of his life, though he had read many a letter of\r\nexcommunication, he had never seen or read so pretty a letter as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hast thou got it still in thy memory, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor as soon as I had repeated it, seeing\r\nthere was no further use for it, I set about forgetting it; and if I\r\nrecollect any of it, it is that about \xe2\x80\x98Scrubbing,\xe2\x80\x99 I mean to say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sovereign Lady,\xe2\x80\x99 and the end \xe2\x80\x98Yours till death, the Knight of the\r\nRueful Countenance;\xe2\x80\x99 and between these two I put into it more than\r\nthree hundred \xe2\x80\x98my souls\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98my life\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc30e.jpg (13K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nOF THE DELECTABLE DISCUSSION BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO PANZA, HIS\r\nSQUIRE, TOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc31a.jpg (151K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that is not unsatisfactory to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on; thou\r\ndidst reach her; and what was that queen of beauty doing? Surely thou\r\ndidst find her stringing pearls, or embroidering some device in gold\r\nthread for this her enslaved knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I found her winnowing two bushels of\r\nwheat in the yard of her house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen depend upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe grains of that wheat were\r\npearls when touched by her hands; and didst thou look, friend? was it\r\nwhite wheat or brown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was neither, but red,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I promise thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, winnowed by her hands,\r\nbeyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest; but go on; when\r\nthou gavest her my letter, did she kiss it? Did she place it on her\r\nhead? Did she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I went to give it to her,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cshe was hard at it\r\nswaying from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the sieve, and\r\nshe said to me, \xe2\x80\x98Lay the letter, friend, on the top of that sack, for I\r\ncannot read it until I have done sifting all this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiscreet lady!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthat was in order to read it at her\r\nleisure and enjoy it; proceed, Sancho; while she was engaged in her\r\noccupation what converse did she hold with thee? What did she ask about\r\nme, and what answer didst thou give? Make haste; tell me all, and let\r\nnot an atom be left behind in the ink-bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe asked me nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I told her how your worship\r\nwas left doing penance in her service, naked from the waist up, in\r\namong these mountains like a savage, sleeping on the ground, not eating\r\nbread off a tablecloth nor combing your beard, weeping and cursing your\r\nfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn saying I cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor rather do I bless it and shall bless it all the days of my life\r\nfor having made me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady as\r\nDulcinea del Toboso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so lofty she is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she overtops me by more than\r\na hand\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cdidst thou measure with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI measured in this way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cgoing to help her to put a sack\r\nof wheat on the back of an ass, we came so close together that I could\r\nsee she stood more than a good palm over me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand doth she not of a truth accompany and\r\nadorn this greatness with a thousand million charms of mind! But one\r\nthing thou wilt not deny, Sancho; when thou camest close to her didst\r\nthou not perceive a Sab\xc3\xa6an odour, an aromatic fragrance, a, I know not\r\nwhat, delicious, that I cannot find a name for; I mean a redolence, an\r\nexhalation, as if thou wert in the shop of some dainty glover?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I can say is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I did perceive a little odour,\r\nsomething goaty; it must have been that she was all in a sweat with\r\nhard work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt could not be that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut thou must have been\r\nsuffering from cold in the head, or must have smelt thyself; for I know\r\nwell what would be the scent of that rose among thorns, that lily of\r\nthe field, that dissolved amber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cthere often comes from myself that same\r\nodour which then seemed to me to come from her grace the lady Dulcinea;\r\nbut that\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder, for one devil is like another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cnow she has done sifting the corn\r\nand sent it to the mill; what did she do when she read the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for the letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cshe did not read it, for she said\r\nshe could neither read nor write; instead of that she tore it up into\r\nsmall pieces, saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lest\r\nher secrets should become known in the village, and that what I had\r\ntold her by word of mouth about the love your worship bore her, and the\r\nextraordinary penance you were doing for her sake, was enough; and, to\r\nmake an end of it, she told me to tell your worship that she kissed\r\nyour hands, and that she had a greater desire to see you than to write\r\nto you; and that therefore she entreated and commanded you, on sight of\r\nthis present, to come out of these thickets, and to have done with\r\ncarrying on absurdities, and to set out at once for El Toboso, unless\r\nsomething else of greater importance should happen, for she had a great\r\ndesire to see your worship. She laughed greatly when I told her how\r\nyour worship was called The Knight of the Rueful Countenance; I asked\r\nher if that Biscayan the other day had been there; and she told me he\r\nhad, and that he was an honest fellow; I asked her too about the galley\r\nslaves, but she said she had not seen any as yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far all goes well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut tell me what jewel was\r\nit that she gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings of\r\nme? For it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant\r\nto give the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their\r\nladies to the knights, or of their knights to the ladies, some rich\r\njewel as a guerdon for good news, and acknowledgment of the message.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand a good custom it was, to my\r\nmind; but that must have been in days gone by, for now it would seem to\r\nbe the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because that\r\nwas what my lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when I\r\ntook leave of her; and more by token it was sheep\xe2\x80\x99s-milk cheese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is generous in the extreme,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand if she did not\r\ngive thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she had\r\nnot one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter;\r\nI shall see her and all shall be made right. But knowest thou what\r\namazes me, Sancho? It seems to me thou must have gone and come through\r\nthe air, for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to\r\nEl Toboso and return, though it is more than thirty leagues from here\r\nto there. From which I am inclined to think that the sage magician who\r\nis my friend, and watches over my interests (for of necessity there is\r\nand must be one, or else I should not be a right knight-errant), that\r\nthis same, I say, must have helped thee to travel without thy\r\nknowledge; for some of these sages will catch up a knight-errant\r\nsleeping in his bed, and without his knowing how or in what way it\r\nhappened, he wakes up the next day more than a thousand leagues away\r\nfrom the place where he went to sleep. And if it were not for this,\r\nknights-errant would not be able to give aid to one another in peril,\r\nas they do at every turn. For a knight, maybe, is fighting in the\r\nmountains of Armenia with some dragon, or fierce serpent, or another\r\nknight, and gets the worst of the battle, and is at the point of death;\r\nbut when he least looks for it, there appears over against him on a\r\ncloud, or chariot of fire, another knight, a friend of his, who just\r\nbefore had been in England, and who takes his part, and delivers him\r\nfrom death; and at night he finds himself in his own quarters supping\r\nvery much to his satisfaction; and yet from one place to the other will\r\nhave been two or three thousand leagues. And all this is done by the\r\ncraft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those valiant\r\nknights; so that, friend Sancho, I find no difficulty in believing that\r\nthou mayest have gone from this place to El Toboso and returned in such\r\na short time, since, as I have said, some friendly sage must have\r\ncarried thee through the air without thee perceiving it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must have been it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor indeed Rocinante went like\r\na gipsy\xe2\x80\x99s ass with quicksilver in his ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuicksilver!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9caye and what is more, a legion of\r\ndevils, folk that can travel and make others travel without being\r\nweary, exactly as the whim seizes them. But putting this aside, what\r\nthinkest thou I ought to do about my lady\xe2\x80\x99s command to go and see her?\r\nFor though I feel that I am bound to obey her mandate, I feel too that\r\nI am debarred by the boon I have accorded to the princess that\r\naccompanies us, and the law of chivalry compels me to have regard for\r\nmy word in preference to my inclination; on the one hand the desire to\r\nsee my lady pursues and harasses me, on the other my solemn promise and\r\nthe glory I shall win in this enterprise urge and call me; but what I\r\nthink I shall do is to travel with all speed and reach quickly the\r\nplace where this giant is, and on my arrival I shall cut off his head,\r\nand establish the princess peacefully in her realm, and forthwith I\r\nshall return to behold the light that lightens my senses, to whom I\r\nshall make such excuses that she will be led to approve of my delay,\r\nfor she will see that it entirely tends to increase her glory and fame;\r\nfor all that I have won, am winning, or shall win by arms in this life,\r\ncomes to me of the favour she extends to me, and because I am hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! what a sad state your worship\xe2\x80\x99s brains are in!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cTell\r\nme, se\xc3\xb1or, do you mean to travel all that way for nothing, and to let\r\nslip and lose so rich and great a match as this where they give as a\r\nportion a kingdom that in sober truth I have heard say is more than\r\ntwenty thousand leagues round about, and abounds with all things\r\nnecessary to support human life, and is bigger than Portugal and\r\nCastile put together? Peace, for the love of God! Blush for what you\r\nhave said, and take my advice, and forgive me, and marry at once in the\r\nfirst village where there is a curate; if not, here is our licentiate\r\nwho will do the business beautifully; remember, I am old enough to give\r\nadvice, and this I am giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in\r\nthe hand is better than a vulture on the wing, and he who has the good\r\nto his hand and chooses the bad, that the good he complains of may not\r\ncome to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cIf thou art advising me to\r\nmarry, in order that immediately on slaying the giant I may become\r\nking, and be able to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have\r\npromised, let me tell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy\r\ndesires without marrying; for before going into battle I will make it a\r\nstipulation that, if I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry,\r\nthey shall give me a portion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon\r\nwhomsoever I choose, and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou\r\nhave me bestow it but upon thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is plain speaking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut let your worship take care\r\nto choose it on the seacoast, so that if I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the life, I may\r\nbe able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said;\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind going to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this\r\ngiant and let us finish off this business; for by God it strikes me it\r\nwill be one of great honour and great profit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nwill take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to\r\nsee Dulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to anyone, or to\r\nthose who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for\r\nas Dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be\r\nknown it is not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, if that be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9chow is it that your worship\r\nmakes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselves\r\nbefore my lady Dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your name\r\nto it that you love her and are her lover? And as those who go must\r\nperforce kneel before her and say they come from your worship to submit\r\nthemselves to her, how can the thoughts of both of you be hid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, how silly and simple thou art!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cseest thou not,\r\nSancho, that this tends to her greater exaltation? For thou must know\r\nthat according to our way of thinking in chivalry, it is a high honour\r\nto a lady to have many knights-errant in her service, whose thoughts\r\nnever go beyond serving her for her own sake, and who look for no other\r\nreward for their great and true devotion than that she should be\r\nwilling to accept them as her knights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is with that kind of love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard preachers\r\nsay we ought to love our Lord, for himself alone, without being moved\r\nby the hope of glory or the fear of punishment; though for my part, I\r\nwould rather love and serve him for what he could do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil take thee for a clown!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand what shrewd\r\nthings thou sayest at times! One would think thou hadst studied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn faith, then, I cannot even read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster Nicholas here called out to them to wait a while, as they wanted\r\nto halt and drink at a little spring there was there. Don Quixote drew\r\nup, not a little to the satisfaction of Sancho, for he was by this time\r\nweary of telling so many lies, and in dread of his master catching him\r\ntripping, for though he knew that Dulcinea was a peasant girl of El\r\nToboso, he had never seen her in all his life. Cardenio had now put on\r\nthe clothes which Dorothea was wearing when they found her, and though\r\nthey were not very good, they were far better than those he put off.\r\nThey dismounted together by the side of the spring, and with what the\r\ncurate had provided himself with at the inn they appeased, though not\r\nvery well, the keen appetite they all of them brought with them.\r\n\r\nWhile they were so employed there happened to come by a youth passing\r\non his way, who stopping to examine the party at the spring, the next\r\nmoment ran to Don Quixote and clasping him round the legs, began to\r\nweep freely, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cO, se\xc3\xb1or, do you not know me? Look at me well; I\r\nam that lad Andres that your worship released from the oak-tree where I\r\nwas tied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote recognised him, and taking his hand he turned to those\r\npresent and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat your worships may see how important it is to\r\nhave knights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by\r\ntyrannical and wicked men in this world, I may tell you that some days\r\nago passing through a wood, I heard cries and piteous complaints as of\r\na person in pain and distress; I immediately hastened, impelled by my\r\nbounden duty, to the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me\r\nto proceed, and I found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before\r\nyou, which in my heart I rejoice at, for his testimony will not permit\r\nme to depart from the truth in any particular. He was, I say, tied to\r\nan oak, naked from the waist up, and a clown, whom I afterwards found\r\nto be his master, was scarifying him by lashes with the reins of his\r\nmare. As soon as I saw him I asked the reason of so cruel a\r\nflagellation. The boor replied that he was flogging him because he was\r\nhis servant and because of carelessness that proceeded rather from\r\ndishonesty than stupidity; on which this boy said, \xe2\x80\x98Se\xc3\xb1or, he flogs me\r\nonly because I ask for my wages.\xe2\x80\x99 The master made I know not what\r\nspeeches and explanations, which, though I listened to them, I did not\r\naccept. In short, I compelled the clown to unbind him, and to swear he\r\nwould take him with him, and pay him real by real, and perfumed into\r\nthe bargain. Is not all this true, Andres my son? Didst thou not mark\r\nwith what authority I commanded him, and with what humility he promised\r\nto do all I enjoined, specified, and required of him? Answer without\r\nhesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place, that they may see\r\nthat it is as great an advantage as I say to have knights-errant\r\nabroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that your worship has said is quite true,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the lad; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nthe end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your\r\nworship supposes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! the opposite?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cdid not the clown pay thee\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot only did he not pay me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lad, \xe2\x80\x9cbut as soon as your\r\nworship had passed out of the wood and we were alone, he tied me up\r\nagain to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging, that left me like a\r\nflayed Saint Bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he followed up\r\nwith some jest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship, and\r\nbut for the pain I was suffering I should have laughed at the things he\r\nsaid. In short he left me in such a condition that I have been until\r\nnow in a hospital getting cured of the injuries which that rascally\r\nclown inflicted on me then; for all which your worship is to blame; for\r\nif you had gone your own way and not come where there was no call for\r\nyou, nor meddled in other people\xe2\x80\x99s affairs, my master would have been\r\ncontent with giving me one or two dozen lashes, and would have then\r\nloosed me and paid me what he owed me; but when your worship abused him\r\nso out of measure, and gave him so many hard words, his anger was\r\nkindled; and as he could not revenge himself on you, as soon as he saw\r\nyou had left him the storm burst upon me in such a way, that I feel as\r\nif I should never be a man again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mischief,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9clay in my going away; for I should\r\nnot have gone until I had seen thee paid; because I ought to have known\r\nwell by long experience that there is no clown who will keep his word\r\nif he finds it will not suit him to keep it; but thou rememberest,\r\nAndres, that I swore if he did not pay thee I would go and seek him,\r\nand find him though he were to hide himself in the whale\xe2\x80\x99s belly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andres; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was of no use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt see now whether it is of use or not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; and\r\nso saying, he got up hastily and bade Sancho bridle Rocinante, who was\r\nbrowsing while they were eating. Dorothea asked him what he meant to\r\ndo. He replied that he meant to go in search of this clown and chastise\r\nhim for such iniquitous conduct, and see Andres paid to the last\r\nmaravedi, despite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world. To\r\nwhich she replied that he must remember that in accordance with his\r\npromise he could not engage in any enterprise until he had concluded\r\nhers; and that as he knew this better than anyone, he should restrain\r\nhis ardour until his return from her kingdom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand Andres must have patience until\r\nmy return as you say, se\xc3\xb1ora; but I once more swear and promise not to\r\nstop until I have seen him avenged and paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no faith in those oaths,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andres; \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather have now\r\nsomething to help me to get to Seville than all the revenges in the\r\nworld; if you have here anything to eat that I can take with me, give\r\nit me, and God be with your worship and all knights-errant; and may\r\ntheir errands turn out as well for themselves as they have for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho took out from his store a piece of bread and another of cheese,\r\nand giving them to the lad he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, take this, brother Andres,\r\nfor we have all of us a share in your misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what share have you got?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis share of bread and cheese I am giving you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nGod knows whether I shall feel the want of it myself or not; for I\r\nwould have you know, friend, that we squires to knights-errant have to\r\nbear a great deal of hunger and hard fortune, and even other things\r\nmore easily felt than told.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndres seized his bread and cheese, and seeing that nobody gave him\r\nanything more, bent his head, and took hold of the road, as the saying\r\nis. However, before leaving he said, \xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of God, sir\r\nknight-errant, if you ever meet me again, though you may see them\r\ncutting me to pieces, give me no aid or succour, but leave me to my\r\nmisfortune, which will not be so great but that a greater will come to\r\nme by being helped by your worship, on whom and all the knights-errant\r\nthat have ever been born God send his curse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was getting up to chastise him, but he took to his heels at\r\nsuch a pace that no one attempted to follow him; and mightily\r\nchapfallen was Don Quixote at Andres\xe2\x80\x99 story, and the others had to take\r\ngreat care to restrain their laughter so as not to put him entirely out\r\nof countenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc31e.jpg (32K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE\xe2\x80\x99S PARTY AT THE INN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc32a.jpg (132K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir dainty repast being finished, they saddled at once, and without\r\nany adventure worth mentioning they reached next day the inn, the\r\nobject of Sancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s fear and dread; but though he would have\r\nrather not entered it, there was no help for it. The landlady, the\r\nlandlord, their daughter, and Maritornes, when they saw Don Quixote and\r\nSancho coming, went out to welcome them with signs of hearty\r\nsatisfaction, which Don Quixote received with dignity and gravity, and\r\nbade them make up a better bed for him than the last time: to which the\r\nlandlady replied that if he paid better than he did the last time she\r\nwould give him one fit for a prince. Don Quixote said he would, so they\r\nmade up a tolerable one for him in the same garret as before; and he\r\nlay down at once, being sorely shaken and in want of sleep.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the door shut upon him than the landlady made at the\r\nbarber, and seizing him by the beard, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer;\r\nyou must give me back my tail, for it is a shame the way that thing of\r\nmy husband\xe2\x80\x99s goes tossing about on the floor; I mean the comb that I\r\nused to stick in my good tail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the\r\nlicentiate told him to let her have it, as there was now no further\r\noccasion for that stratagem, because he might declare himself and\r\nappear in his own character, and tell Don Quixote that he had fled to\r\nthis inn when those thieves the galley slaves robbed him; and should he\r\nask for the princess\xe2\x80\x99s squire, they could tell him that she had sent\r\nhim on before her to give notice to the people of her kingdom that she\r\nwas coming, and bringing with her the deliverer of them all. On this\r\nthe barber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady, and at the\r\nsame time they returned all the accessories they had borrowed to effect\r\nDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s deliverance. All the people of the inn were struck with\r\nastonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, and even at the comely figure\r\nof the shepherd Cardenio. The curate made them get ready such fare as\r\nthere was in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of better payment,\r\nserved them up a tolerably good dinner. All this time Don Quixote was\r\nasleep, and they thought it best not to waken him, as sleeping would\r\nnow do him more good than eating.\r\n\r\nWhile at dinner, the company consisting of the landlord, his wife,\r\ntheir daughter, Maritornes, and all the travellers, they discussed the\r\nstrange craze of Don Quixote and the manner in which he had been found;\r\nand the landlady told them what had taken place between him and the\r\ncarrier; and then, looking round to see if Sancho was there, when she\r\nsaw he was not, she gave them the whole story of his blanketing, which\r\nthey received with no little amusement. But on the curate observing\r\nthat it was the books of chivalry which Don Quixote had read that had\r\nturned his brain, the landlord said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot understand how that can be, for in truth to my mind there is\r\nno better reading in the world, and I have here two or three of them,\r\nwith other writings that are the very life, not only of myself but of\r\nplenty more; for when it is harvest-time, the reapers flock here on\r\nholidays, and there is always one among them who can read and who takes\r\nup one of these books, and we gather round him, thirty or more of us,\r\nand stay listening to him with a delight that makes our grey hairs grow\r\nyoung again. At least I can say for myself that when I hear of what\r\nfurious and terrible blows the knights deliver, I am seized with the\r\nlonging to do the same, and I would like to be hearing about them night\r\nand day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I just as much,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlady, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I never have a quiet\r\nmoment in my house except when you are listening to someone reading;\r\nfor then you are so taken up that for the time being you forget to\r\nscold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maritornes; \xe2\x80\x9cand, faith, I relish hearing these\r\nthings greatly too, for they are very pretty; especially when they\r\ndescribe some lady or another in the arms of her knight under the\r\norange trees, and the duenna who is keeping watch for them half dead\r\nwith envy and fright; all this I say is as good as honey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, what do you think, young lady?\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate turning to\r\nthe landlord\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know indeed, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cI listen too, and to tell the\r\ntruth, though I do not understand it, I like hearing it; but it is not\r\nthe blows that my father likes that I like, but the laments the knights\r\nutter when they are separated from their ladies; and indeed they\r\nsometimes make me weep with the pity I feel for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you would console them if it was for you they wept, young lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Dorothea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I should do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl; \xe2\x80\x9cI only know that there\r\nare some of those ladies so cruel that they call their knights tigers\r\nand lions and a thousand other foul names: and Jesus! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nsort of folk they can be, so unfeeling and heartless, that rather than\r\nbestow a glance upon a worthy man they leave him to die or go mad. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what is the good of such prudery; if it is for honour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, why not marry them? That\xe2\x80\x99s all they want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlady; \xe2\x80\x9cit seems to me thou knowest a great\r\ndeal about these things, and it is not fit for girls to know or talk so\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the gentleman asked me, I could not help answering him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cbring me these books, se\xc3\xb1or landlord,\r\nfor I should like to see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and going into his own room he brought\r\nout an old valise secured with a little chain, on opening which the\r\ncurate found in it three large books and some manuscripts written in a\r\nvery good hand. The first that he opened he found to be \xe2\x80\x9cDon Cirongilio\r\nof Thrace,\xe2\x80\x9d and the second \xe2\x80\x9cDon Felixmarte of Hircania,\xe2\x80\x9d and the other\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cHistory of the Great Captain Gonzalo Hernandez de Cordova, with\r\nthe Life of Diego Garc\xc3\xada de Paredes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the curate read the two first titles he looked over at the barber\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe want my friend\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeper and niece here now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cI can do just as well to carry them to the\r\nyard or to the hearth, and there is a very good fire there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! your worship would burn my books!\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly these two,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cDon Cirongilio, and Felixmarte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre my books, then, heretics or phlegmatics that you want to burn\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchismatics you mean, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cnot phlegmatics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you want to burn any, let it be\r\nthat about the Great Captain and that Diego Garc\xc3\xada; for I would rather\r\nhave a child of mine burnt than either of the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cthose two books are made up of lies, and\r\nare full of folly and nonsense; but this of the Great Captain is a true\r\nhistory, and contains the deeds of Gonzalo Hernandez of Cordova, who by\r\nhis many and great achievements earned the title all over the world of\r\nthe Great Captain, a famous and illustrious name, and deserved by him\r\nalone; and this Diego Garc\xc3\xada de Paredes was a distinguished knight of\r\nthe city of Trujillo in Estremadura, a most gallant soldier, and of\r\nsuch bodily strength that with one finger he stopped a mill-wheel in\r\nfull motion; and posted with a two-handed sword at the foot of a bridge\r\nhe kept the whole of an immense army from passing over it, and achieved\r\nsuch other exploits that if, instead of his relating them himself with\r\nthe modesty of a knight and of one writing his own history, some free\r\nand unbiased writer had recorded them, they would have thrown into the\r\nshade all the deeds of the Hectors, Achilleses, and Rolands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc32b.jpg (395K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell that to my father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a thing to be\r\nastonished at! Stopping a mill-wheel! By God your worship should read\r\nwhat I have read of Felixmarte of Hircania, how with one single\r\nbackstroke he cleft five giants asunder through the middle as if they\r\nhad been made of bean-pods like the little friars the children make;\r\nand another time he attacked a very great and powerful army, in which\r\nthere were more than a million six hundred thousand soldiers, all armed\r\nfrom head to foot, and he routed them all as if they had been flocks of\r\nsheep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc32c.jpg (341K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, what do you say to the good Cirongilio of Thrace, that was\r\nso stout and bold; as may be seen in the book, where it is related that\r\nas he was sailing along a river there came up out of the midst of the\r\nwater against him a fiery serpent, and he, as soon as he saw it, flung\r\nhimself upon it and got astride of its scaly shoulders, and squeezed\r\nits throat with both hands with such force that the serpent, finding he\r\nwas throttling it, had nothing for it but to let itself sink to the\r\nbottom of the river, carrying with it the knight who would not let go\r\nhis hold; and when they got down there he found himself among palaces\r\nand gardens so pretty that it was a wonder to see; and then the serpent\r\nchanged itself into an old ancient man, who told him such things as\r\nwere never heard. Hold your peace, se\xc3\xb1or; for if you were to hear this\r\nyou would go mad with delight. A couple of figs for your Great Captain\r\nand your Diego Garc\xc3\xada!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing this Dorothea said in a whisper to Cardenio, \xe2\x80\x9cOur landlord is\r\nalmost fit to play a second part to Don Quixote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cardenio, \xe2\x80\x9cfor, as he shows, he accepts it as a\r\ncertainty that everything those books relate took place exactly as it\r\nis written down; and the barefooted friars themselves would not\r\npersuade him to the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut consider, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate once more, \xe2\x80\x9cthere never was\r\nany Felixmarte of Hircania in the world, nor any Cirongilio of Thrace,\r\nor any of the other knights of the same sort, that the books of\r\nchivalry talk of; the whole thing is the fabrication and invention of\r\nidle wits, devised by them for the purpose you describe of beguiling\r\nthe time, as your reapers do when they read; for I swear to you in all\r\nseriousness there never were any such knights in the world, and no such\r\nexploits or nonsense ever happened anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry that bone on another dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord; \xe2\x80\x9cas if I did not\r\nknow how many make five, and where my shoe pinches me; don\xe2\x80\x99t think to\r\nfeed me with pap, for by God I am no fool. It is a good joke for your\r\nworship to try and persuade me that everything these good books say is\r\nnonsense and lies, and they printed by the license of the Lords of the\r\nRoyal Council, as if they were people who would allow such a lot of\r\nlies to be printed all together, and so many battles and enchantments\r\nthat they take away one\xe2\x80\x99s senses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this is done to\r\ndivert our idle thoughts; and as in well-ordered states games of chess,\r\nfives, and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not\r\ncare, or are not obliged, or are unable to work, so books of this kind\r\nare allowed to be printed, on the supposition that, what indeed is the\r\ntruth, there can be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true\r\nstories; and if it were permitted me now, and the present company\r\ndesired it, I could say something about the qualities books of chivalry\r\nshould possess to be good ones, that would be to the advantage and even\r\nto the taste of some; but I hope the time will come when I can\r\ncommunicate my ideas to someone who may be able to mend matters; and in\r\nthe meantime, se\xc3\xb1or landlord, believe what I have said, and take your\r\nbooks, and make up your mind about their truth or falsehood, and much\r\ngood may they do you; and God grant you may not fall lame of the same\r\nfoot your guest Don Quixote halts on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fear of that,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the landlord; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be so mad as to\r\nmake a knight-errant of myself; for I see well enough that things are\r\nnot now as they used to be in those days, when they say those famous\r\nknights roamed about the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho had made his appearance in the middle of this conversation, and\r\nhe was very much troubled and cast down by what he heard said about\r\nknights-errant being now no longer in vogue, and all books of chivalry\r\nbeing folly and lies; and he resolved in his heart to wait and see what\r\ncame of this journey of his master\xe2\x80\x99s, and if it did not turn out as\r\nhappily as his master expected, he determined to leave him and go back\r\nto his wife and children and his ordinary labour.\r\n\r\nThe landlord was carrying away the valise and the books, but the curate\r\nsaid to him, \xe2\x80\x9cWait; I want to see what those papers are that are\r\nwritten in such a good hand.\xe2\x80\x9d The landlord taking them out handed them\r\nto him to read, and he perceived they were a work of about eight sheets\r\nof manuscript, with, in large letters at the beginning, the title of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovel of the Ill-advised Curiosity.\xe2\x80\x9d The curate read three or four\r\nlines to himself, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must say the title of this novel does\r\nnot seem to me a bad one, and I feel an inclination to read it all.\xe2\x80\x9d To\r\nwhich the landlord replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThen your reverence will do well to read\r\nit, for I can tell you that some guests who have read it here have been\r\nmuch pleased with it, and have begged it of me very earnestly; but I\r\nwould not give it, meaning to return it to the person who forgot the\r\nvalise, books, and papers here, for maybe he will return here some time\r\nor other; and though I know I shall miss the books, faith I mean to\r\nreturn them; for though I am an innkeeper, still I am a Christian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very right, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cbut for all that, if\r\nthe novel pleases me you must let me copy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the host.\r\n\r\nWhile they were talking Cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to\r\nread it, and forming the same opinion of it as the curate, he begged\r\nhim to read it so that they might all hear it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would read it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cif the time would not be better\r\nspent in sleeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be rest enough for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorothea, \xe2\x80\x9cto while away the time\r\nby listening to some tale, for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough\r\nto let me sleep when it would be seasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, in that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cI will read it, if it were\r\nonly out of curiosity; perhaps it may contain something pleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster Nicholas added his entreaties to the same effect, and Sancho\r\ntoo; seeing which, and considering that he would give pleasure to all,\r\nand receive it himself, the curate said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell then, attend to me\r\neveryone, for the novel begins thus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc32e.jpg (11K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nIN WHICH IS RELATED THE NOVEL OF \xe2\x80\x9cTHE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn Florence, a rich and famous city of Italy in the province called\r\nTuscany, there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality, Anselmo and\r\nLothario, such great friends that by way of distinction they were\r\ncalled by all that knew them \xe2\x80\x9cThe Two Friends.\xe2\x80\x9d They were unmarried,\r\nyoung, of the same age and of the same tastes, which was enough to\r\naccount for the reciprocal friendship between them. Anselmo, it is\r\ntrue, was somewhat more inclined to seek pleasure in love than\r\nLothario, for whom the pleasures of the chase had more attraction; but\r\non occasion Anselmo would forego his own tastes to yield to those of\r\nLothario, and Lothario would surrender his to fall in with those of\r\nAnselmo, and in this way their inclinations kept pace one with the\r\nother with a concord so perfect that the best regulated clock could not\r\nsurpass it.\r\n\r\nAnselmo was deep in love with a high-born and beautiful maiden of the\r\nsame city, the daughter of parents so estimable, and so estimable\r\nherself, that he resolved, with the approval of his friend Lothario,\r\nwithout whom he did nothing, to ask her of them in marriage, and did\r\nso, Lothario being the bearer of the demand, and conducting the\r\nnegotiation so much to the satisfaction of his friend that in a short\r\ntime he was in possession of the object of his desires, and Camilla so\r\nhappy in having won Anselmo for her husband, that she gave thanks\r\nunceasingly to heaven and to Lothario, by whose means such good fortune\r\nhad fallen to her. The first few days, those of a wedding being usually\r\ndays of merry-making, Lothario frequented his friend Anselmo\xe2\x80\x99s house as\r\nhe had been wont, striving to do honour to him and to the occasion, and\r\nto gratify him in every way he could; but when the wedding days were\r\nover and the succession of visits and congratulations had slackened, he\r\nbegan purposely to leave off going to the house of Anselmo, for it\r\nseemed to him, as it naturally would to all men of sense, that friends\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhouses ought not to be visited after marriage with the same frequency\r\nas in their masters\xe2\x80\x99 bachelor days: because, though true and genuine\r\nfriendship cannot and should not be in any way suspicious, still a\r\nmarried man\xe2\x80\x99s honour is a thing of such delicacy that it is held liable\r\nto injury from brothers, much more from friends. Anselmo remarked the\r\ncessation of Lothario\xe2\x80\x99s visits, and complained of it to him, saying\r\nthat if he had known that marriage was to keep him from enjoying his\r\nsociety as he used, he would have never married; and that, if by the\r\nthorough harmony that subsisted between them while he was a bachelor\r\nthey had earned such a sweet name as that of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Two Friends,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nshould not allow a title so rare and so delightful to be lost through a\r\nneedless anxiety to act circumspectly; and so he entreated him, if such\r\na phrase was allowable between them, to be once more master of his\r\nhouse and to come in and go out as formerly, assuring him that his wife\r\nCamilla had no other desire or inclination than that which he would\r\nwish her to have, and that knowing how sincerely they loved one another\r\nshe was grieved to see such coldness in him.\r\n\r\nTo all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade him\r\nto come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing, Lothario\r\nreplied with so much prudence, sense, and judgment, that Anselmo was\r\nsatisfied of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s good intentions, and it was agreed that on\r\ntwo days in the week, and on holidays, Lothario should come to dine\r\nwith him; but though this arrangement was made between them Lothario\r\nresolved to observe it no further than he considered to be in\r\naccordance with the honour of his friend, whose good name was more to\r\nhim than his own. He said, and justly, that a married man upon whom\r\nheaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should consider as carefully what\r\nfriends he brought to his house as what female friends his wife\r\nassociated with, for what cannot be done or arranged in the\r\nmarket-place, in church, at public festivals or at stations\r\n(opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives), may be\r\neasily managed in the house of the female friend or relative in whom\r\nmost confidence is reposed. Lothario said, too, that every married man\r\nshould have some friend who would point out to him any negligence he\r\nmight be guilty of in his conduct, for it will sometimes happen that\r\nowing to the deep affection the husband bears his wife either he does\r\nnot caution her, or, not to vex her, refrains from telling her to do or\r\nnot to do certain things, doing or avoiding which may be a matter of\r\nhonour or reproach to him; and errors of this kind he could easily\r\ncorrect if warned by a friend. But where is such a friend to be found\r\nas Lothario would have, so judicious, so loyal, and so true?\r\n\r\nOf a truth I know not; Lothario alone was such a one, for with the\r\nutmost care and vigilance he watched over the honour of his friend, and\r\nstrove to diminish, cut down, and reduce the number of days for going\r\nto his house according to their agreement, lest the visits of a young\r\nman, wealthy, high-born, and with the attractions he was conscious of\r\npossessing, at the house of a woman so beautiful as Camilla, should be\r\nregarded with suspicion by the inquisitive and malicious eyes of the\r\nidle public. For though his integrity and reputation might bridle\r\nslanderous tongues, still he was unwilling to hazard either his own\r\ngood name or that of his friend; and for this reason most of the days\r\nagreed upon he devoted to some other business which he pretended was\r\nunavoidable; so that a great portion of the day was taken up with\r\ncomplaints on one side and excuses on the other. It happened, however,\r\nthat on one occasion when the two were strolling together outside the\r\ncity, Anselmo addressed the following words to Lothario.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou mayest suppose, Lothario my friend, that I am unable to give\r\nsufficient thanks for the favours God has rendered me in making me the\r\nson of such parents as mine were, and bestowing upon me with no niggard\r\nhand what are called the gifts of nature as well as those of fortune,\r\nand above all for what he has done in giving me thee for a friend and\r\nCamilla for a wife\xe2\x80\x94two treasures that I value, if not as highly as I\r\nought, at least as highly as I am able. And yet, with all these good\r\nthings, which are commonly all that men need to enable them to live\r\nhappily, I am the most discontented and dissatisfied man in the whole\r\nworld; for, I know not how long since, I have been harassed and\r\noppressed by a desire so strange and so unusual, that I wonder at\r\nmyself and blame and chide myself when I am alone, and strive to stifle\r\nit and hide it from my own thoughts, and with no better success than if\r\nI were endeavouring deliberately to publish it to all the world; and\r\nas, in short, it must come out, I would confide it to thy safe keeping,\r\nfeeling sure that by this means, and by thy readiness as a true friend\r\nto afford me relief, I shall soon find myself freed from the distress\r\nit causes me, and that thy care will give me happiness in the same\r\ndegree as my own folly has caused me misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words of Anselmo struck Lothario with astonishment, unable as he\r\nwas to conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble; and though he\r\nstrove to imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his friend,\r\nhis conjectures were all far from the truth, and to relieve the anxiety\r\nwhich this perplexity was causing him, he told him he was doing a\r\nflagrant injustice to their great friendship in seeking circuitous\r\nmethods of confiding to him his most hidden thoughts, for he well knew\r\nhe might reckon upon his counsel in diverting them, or his help in\r\ncarrying them into effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Anselmo, \xe2\x80\x9cand relying upon that I will\r\ntell thee, friend Lothario, that the desire which harasses me is that\r\nof knowing whether my wife Camilla is as good and as perfect as I think\r\nher to be; and I cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this point\r\nexcept by testing her in such a way that the trial may prove the purity\r\nof her virtue as the fire proves that of gold; because I am persuaded,\r\nmy friend, that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she is or is\r\nnot tempted; and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the\r\npromises, gifts, tears, and importunities of earnest lovers; for what\r\nthanks does a woman deserve for being good if no one urges her to be\r\nbad, and what wonder is it that she is reserved and circumspect to whom\r\nno opportunity is given of going wrong and who knows she has a husband\r\nthat will take her life the first time he detects her in an\r\nimpropriety? I do not therefore hold her who is virtuous through fear\r\nor want of opportunity in the same estimation as her who comes out of\r\ntemptation and trial with a crown of victory; and so, for these reasons\r\nand many others that I could give thee to justify and support the\r\nopinion I hold, I am desirous that my wife Camilla should pass this\r\ncrisis, and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herself wooed\r\nand by one worthy to set his affections upon her; and if she comes out,\r\nas I know she will, victorious from this struggle, I shall look upon my\r\ngood fortune as unequalled, I shall be able to say that the cup of my\r\ndesire is full, and that the virtuous woman of whom the sage says \xe2\x80\x98Who\r\nshall find her?\xe2\x80\x99 has fallen to my lot. And if the result be the\r\ncontrary of what I expect, in the satisfaction of knowing that I have\r\nbeen right in my opinion, I shall bear without complaint the pain which\r\nmy so dearly bought experience will naturally cause me. And, as nothing\r\nof all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish will avail to keep me\r\nfrom carrying it into effect, it is my desire, friend Lothario, that\r\nthou shouldst consent to become the instrument for effecting this\r\npurpose that I am bent upon, for I will afford thee opportunities to\r\nthat end, and nothing shall be wanting that I may think necessary for\r\nthe pursuit of a virtuous, honourable, modest and high-minded woman.\r\nAnd among other reasons, I am induced to entrust this arduous task to\r\nthee by the consideration that if Camilla be conquered by thee the\r\nconquest will not be pushed to extremes, but only far enough to account\r\nthat accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left undone;\r\nthus I shall not be wronged in anything more than intention, and my\r\nwrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy silence, which I know\r\nwell will be as lasting as that of death in what concerns me. If,\r\ntherefore, thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life, thou\r\nwilt at once engage in this love struggle, not lukewarmly nor\r\nslothfully, but with the energy and zeal that my desire demands, and\r\nwith the loyalty our friendship assures me of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch were the words Anselmo addressed to Lothario, who listened to them\r\nwith such attention that, except to say what has been already\r\nmentioned, he did not open his lips until the other had finished. Then\r\nperceiving that he had no more to say, after regarding him for a while,\r\nas one would regard something never before seen that excited wonder and\r\namazement, he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot persuade myself, Anselmo my\r\nfriend, that what thou hast said to me is not in jest; if I thought\r\nthat thou wert speaking seriously I would not have allowed thee to go\r\nso far; so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not listening to\r\nthee I verily suspect that either thou dost not know me, or I do not\r\nknow thee; but no, I know well thou art Anselmo, and thou knowest that\r\nI am Lothario; the misfortune is, it seems to me, that thou art not the\r\nAnselmo thou wert, and must have thought that I am not the Lothario I\r\nshould be; for the things that thou hast said to me are not those of\r\nthat Anselmo who was my friend, nor are those that thou demandest of me\r\nwhat should be asked of the Lothario thou knowest. True friends will\r\nprove their friends and make use of them, as a poet has said, _usque ad\r\naras;_ whereby he meant that they will not make use of their friendship\r\nin things that are contrary to God\xe2\x80\x99s will. If this, then, was a\r\nheathen\xe2\x80\x99s feeling about friendship, how much more should it be a\r\nChristian\xe2\x80\x99s, who knows that the divine must not be forfeited for the\r\nsake of any human friendship? And if a friend should go so far as to\r\nput aside his duty to Heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend, it\r\nshould not be in matters that are trifling or of little moment, but in\r\nsuch as affect the friend\xe2\x80\x99s life and honour. Now tell me, Anselmo, in\r\nwhich of these two art thou imperilled, that I should hazard myself to\r\ngratify thee, and do a thing so detestable as that thou seekest of me?\r\nNeither forsooth; on the contrary, thou dost ask of me, so far as I\r\nunderstand, to strive and labour to rob thee of honour and life, and to\r\nrob myself of them at the same time; for if I take away thy honour it\r\nis plain I take away thy life, as a man without honour is worse than\r\ndead; and being the instrument, as thou wilt have it so, of so much\r\nwrong to thee, shall not I, too, be left without honour, and\r\nconsequently without life? Listen to me, Anselmo my friend, and be not\r\nimpatient to answer me until I have said what occurs to me touching the\r\nobject of thy desire, for there will be time enough left for thee to\r\nreply and for me to hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anselmo, \xe2\x80\x9csay what thou wilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLothario then went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me, Anselmo, that thine is\r\njust now the temper of mind which is always that of the Moors, who can\r\nnever be brought to see the error of their creed by quotations from the\r\nHoly Scriptures, or by reasons which depend upon the examination of the\r\nunderstanding or are founded upon the articles of faith, but must have\r\nexamples that are palpable, easy, intelligible, capable of proof, not\r\nadmitting of doubt, with mathematical demonstrations that cannot be\r\ndenied, like, \xe2\x80\x98_If equals be taken from equals, the remainders are\r\nequal:_\xe2\x80\x99 and if they do not understand this in words, and indeed they\r\ndo not, it has to be shown to them with the hands, and put before their\r\neyes, and even with all this no one succeeds in convincing them of the\r\ntruth of our holy religion. This same mode of proceeding I shall have\r\nto adopt with thee, for the desire which has sprung up in thee is so\r\nabsurd and remote from everything that has a semblance of reason, that\r\nI feel it would be a waste of time to employ it in reasoning with thy\r\nsimplicity, for at present I will call it by no other name; and I am\r\neven tempted to leave thee in thy folly as a punishment for thy\r\npernicious desire; but the friendship I bear thee, which will not allow\r\nme to desert thee in such manifest danger of destruction, keeps me from\r\ndealing so harshly by thee. And that thou mayest clearly see this, say,\r\nAnselmo, hast thou not told me that I must force my suit upon a modest\r\nwoman, decoy one that is virtuous, make overtures to one that is\r\npure-minded, pay court to one that is prudent? Yes, thou hast told me\r\nso. Then, if thou knowest that thou hast a wife, modest, virtuous,\r\npure-minded and prudent, what is it that thou seekest? And if thou\r\nbelievest that she will come forth victorious from all my attacks\xe2\x80\x94as\r\ndoubtless she would\xe2\x80\x94what higher titles than those she possesses now\r\ndost thou think thou canst bestow upon her then, or in what will she be\r\nbetter then than she is now? Either thou dost not hold her to be what\r\nthou sayest, or thou knowest not what thou dost demand. If thou dost\r\nnot hold her to be what thou sayest, why dost thou seek to prove her\r\ninstead of treating her as guilty in the way that may seem best to\r\nthee? but if she be as virtuous as thou believest, it is an\r\nuncalled-for proceeding to make trial of truth itself, for, after\r\ntrial, it will but be in the same estimation as before. Thus, then, it\r\nis conclusive that to attempt things from which harm rather than\r\nadvantage may come to us is the part of unreasoning and reckless minds,\r\nmore especially when they are things which we are not forced or\r\ncompelled to attempt, and which show from afar that it is plainly\r\nmadness to attempt them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDifficulties are attempted either for the sake of God or for the sake\r\nof the world, or for both; those undertaken for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake are those\r\nwhich the saints undertake when they attempt to live the lives of\r\nangels in human bodies; those undertaken for the sake of the world are\r\nthose of the men who traverse such a vast expanse of water, such a\r\nvariety of climates, so many strange countries, to acquire what are\r\ncalled the blessings of fortune; and those undertaken for the sake of\r\nGod and the world together are those of brave soldiers, who no sooner\r\ndo they see in the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s wall a breach as wide as a cannon ball could\r\nmake, than, casting aside all fear, without hesitating, or heeding the\r\nmanifest peril that threatens them, borne onward by the desire of\r\ndefending their faith, their country, and their king, they fling\r\nthemselves dauntlessly into the midst of the thousand opposing deaths\r\nthat await them. Such are the things that men are wont to attempt, and\r\nthere is honour, glory, gain, in attempting them, however full of\r\ndifficulty and peril they may be; but that which thou sayest it is thy\r\nwish to attempt and carry out will not win thee the glory of God nor\r\nthe blessings of fortune nor fame among men; for even if the issue be\r\nas thou wouldst have it, thou wilt be no happier, richer, or more\r\nhonoured than thou art this moment; and if it be otherwise thou wilt be\r\nreduced to misery greater than can be imagined, for then it will avail\r\nthee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of the misfortune that has\r\nbefallen thee; it will suffice to torture and crush thee that thou\r\nknowest it thyself. And in confirmation of the truth of what I say, let\r\nme repeat to thee a stanza made by the famous poet Luigi Tansillo at\r\nthe end of the first part of his \xe2\x80\x98Tears of Saint Peter,\xe2\x80\x99 which says\r\nthus:\r\n\r\nThe anguish and the shame but greater grew\r\n    In Peter\xe2\x80\x99s heart as morning slowly came;\r\nNo eye was there to see him, well he knew,\r\n    Yet he himself was to himself a shame;\r\nExposed to all men\xe2\x80\x99s gaze, or screened from view,\r\n    A noble heart will feel the pang the same;\r\nA prey to shame the sinning soul will be,\r\nThough none but heaven and earth its shame can see.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus by keeping it secret thou wilt not escape thy sorrow, but rather\r\nthou wilt shed tears unceasingly, if not tears of the eyes, tears of\r\nblood from the heart, like those shed by that simple doctor our poet\r\ntells us of, that tried the test of the cup, which the wise Rinaldo,\r\nbetter advised, refused to do; for though this may be a poetic fiction\r\nit contains a moral lesson worthy of attention and study and imitation.\r\nMoreover by what I am about to say to thee thou wilt be led to see the\r\ngreat error thou wouldst commit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Anselmo, if Heaven or good fortune had made thee master and\r\nlawful owner of a diamond of the finest quality, with the excellence\r\nand purity of which all the lapidaries that had seen it had been\r\nsatisfied, saying with one voice and common consent that in purity,\r\nquality, and fineness, it was all that a stone of the kind could\r\npossibly be, thou thyself too being of the same belief, as knowing\r\nnothing to the contrary, would it be reasonable in thee to desire to\r\ntake that diamond and place it between an anvil and a hammer, and by\r\nmere force of blows and strength of arm try if it were as hard and as\r\nfine as they said? And if thou didst, and if the stone should resist so\r\nsilly a test, that would add nothing to its value or reputation; and if\r\nit were broken, as it might be, would not all be lost? Undoubtedly it\r\nwould, leaving its owner to be rated as a fool in the opinion of all.\r\nConsider, then, Anselmo my friend, that Camilla is a diamond of the\r\nfinest quality as well in thy estimation as in that of others, and that\r\nit is contrary to reason to expose her to the risk of being broken; for\r\nif she remains intact she cannot rise to a higher value than she now\r\npossesses; and if she give way and be unable to resist, bethink thee\r\nnow how thou wilt be deprived of her, and with what good reason thou\r\nwilt complain of thyself for having been the cause of her ruin and\r\nthine own. Remember there is no jewel in the world so precious as a\r\nchaste and virtuous woman, and that the whole honour of women consists\r\nin reputation; and since thy wife\xe2\x80\x99s is of that high excellence that\r\nthou knowest, wherefore shouldst thou seek to call that truth in\r\nquestion? Remember, my friend, that woman is an imperfect animal, and\r\nthat impediments are not to be placed in her way to make her trip and\r\nfall, but that they should be removed, and her path left clear of all\r\nobstacles, so that without hindrance she may run her course freely to\r\nattain the desired perfection, which consists in being virtuous.\r\nNaturalists tell us that the ermine is a little animal which has a fur\r\nof purest white, and that when the hunters wish to take it, they make\r\nuse of this artifice. Having ascertained the places which it frequents\r\nand passes, they stop the way to them with mud, and then rousing it,\r\ndrive it towards the spot, and as soon as the ermine comes to the mud\r\nit halts, and allows itself to be taken captive rather than pass\r\nthrough the mire, and spoil and sully its whiteness, which it values\r\nmore than life and liberty. The virtuous and chaste woman is an ermine,\r\nand whiter and purer than snow is the virtue of modesty; and he who\r\nwishes her not to lose it, but to keep and preserve it, must adopt a\r\ncourse different from that employed with the ermine; he must not put\r\nbefore her the mire of the gifts and attentions of persevering lovers,\r\nbecause perhaps\xe2\x80\x94and even without a perhaps\xe2\x80\x94she may not have sufficient\r\nvirtue and natural strength in herself to pass through and tread under\r\nfoot these impediments; they must be removed, and the brightness of\r\nvirtue and the beauty of a fair fame must be put before her. A virtuous\r\nwoman, too, is like a mirror, of clear shining crystal, liable to be\r\ntarnished and dimmed by every breath that touches it. She must be\r\ntreated as relics are; adored, not touched. She must be protected and\r\nprized as one protects and prizes a fair garden full of roses and\r\nflowers, the owner of which allows no one to trespass or pluck a\r\nblossom; enough for others that from afar and through the iron grating\r\nthey may enjoy its fragrance and its beauty. Finally let me repeat to\r\nthee some verses that come to my mind; I heard them in a modern comedy,\r\nand it seems to me they bear upon the point we are discussing. A\r\nprudent old man was giving advice to another, the father of a young\r\ngirl, to lock her up, watch over her and keep her in seclusion, and\r\namong other arguments he used these:\r\n\r\nWoman is a thing of glass;\r\n    But her brittleness \xe2\x80\x99tis best\r\n    Not too curiously to test:\r\nWho knows what may come to pass?\r\n\r\nBreaking is an easy matter,\r\n    And it\xe2\x80\x99s folly to expose\r\n    What you cannot mend to blows;\r\nWhat you can\xe2\x80\x99t make whole to shatter.\r\n\r\nThis, then, all may hold as true,\r\n    And the reason\xe2\x80\x99s plain to see;\r\n    For if Dana\xc3\xabs there be,\r\nThere are golden showers too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that I have said to thee so far, Anselmo, has had reference to\r\nwhat concerns thee; now it is right that I should say something of what\r\nregards myself; and if I be prolix, pardon me, for the labyrinth into\r\nwhich thou hast entered and from which thou wouldst have me extricate\r\nthee makes it necessary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou dost reckon me thy friend, and thou wouldst rob me of honour, a\r\nthing wholly inconsistent with friendship; and not only dost thou aim\r\nat this, but thou wouldst have me rob thee of it also. That thou\r\nwouldst rob me of it is clear, for when Camilla sees that I pay court\r\nto her as thou requirest, she will certainly regard me as a man without\r\nhonour or right feeling, since I attempt and do a thing so much opposed\r\nto what I owe to my own position and thy friendship. That thou wouldst\r\nhave me rob thee of it is beyond a doubt, for Camilla, seeing that I\r\npress my suit upon her, will suppose that I have perceived in her\r\nsomething light that has encouraged me to make known to her my base\r\ndesire; and if she holds herself dishonoured, her dishonour touches\r\nthee as belonging to her; and hence arises what so commonly takes\r\nplace, that the husband of the adulterous woman, though he may not be\r\naware of or have given any cause for his wife\xe2\x80\x99s failure in her duty, or\r\n(being careless or negligent) have had it in his power to prevent his\r\ndishonour, nevertheless is stigmatised by a vile and reproachful name,\r\nand in a manner regarded with eyes of contempt instead of pity by all\r\nwho know of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, though they see that he is unfortunate\r\nnot by his own fault, but by the lust of a vicious consort. But I will\r\ntell thee why with good reason dishonour attaches to the husband of the\r\nunchaste wife, though he know not that she is so, nor be to blame, nor\r\nhave done anything, or given any provocation to make her so; and be not\r\nweary with listening to me, for it will be for thy good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen God created our first parent in the earthly paradise, the Holy\r\nScripture says that he infused sleep into Adam and while he slept took\r\na rib from his left side of which he formed our mother Eve, and when\r\nAdam awoke and beheld her he said, \xe2\x80\x98This is flesh of my flesh, and bone\r\nof my bone.\xe2\x80\x99 And God said \xe2\x80\x98For this shall a man leave his father and\r\nhis mother, and they shall be two in one flesh; and then was instituted\r\nthe divine sacrament of marriage, with such ties that death alone can\r\nloose them. And such is the force and virtue of this miraculous\r\nsacrament that it makes two different persons one and the same flesh;\r\nand even more than this when the virtuous are married; for though they\r\nhave two souls they have but one will. And hence it follows that as the\r\nflesh of the wife is one and the same with that of her husband the\r\nstains that may come upon it, or the injuries it incurs fall upon the\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s flesh, though he, as has been said, may have given no cause\r\nfor them; for as the pain of the foot or any member of the body is felt\r\nby the whole body, because all is one flesh, as the head feels the hurt\r\nto the ankle without having caused it, so the husband, being one with\r\nher, shares the dishonour of the wife; and as all worldly honour or\r\ndishonour comes of flesh and blood, and the erring wife\xe2\x80\x99s is of that\r\nkind, the husband must needs bear his part of it and be held\r\ndishonoured without knowing it. See, then, Anselmo, the peril thou art\r\nencountering in seeking to disturb the peace of thy virtuous consort;\r\nsee for what an empty and ill-advised curiosity thou wouldst rouse up\r\npassions that now repose in quiet in the breast of thy chaste wife;\r\nreflect that what thou art staking all to win is little, and what thou\r\nwilt lose so much that I leave it undescribed, not having the words to\r\nexpress it. But if all I have said be not enough to turn thee from thy\r\nvile purpose, thou must seek some other instrument for thy dishonour\r\nand misfortune; for such I will not consent to be, though I lose thy\r\nfriendship, the greatest loss that I can conceive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving said this, the wise and virtuous Lothario was silent, and\r\nAnselmo, troubled in mind and deep in thought, was unable for a while\r\nto utter a word in reply; but at length he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have listened,\r\nLothario my friend, attentively, as thou hast seen, to what thou hast\r\nchosen to say to me, and in thy arguments, examples, and comparisons I\r\nhave seen that high intelligence thou dost possess, and the perfection\r\nof true friendship thou hast reached; and likewise I see and confess\r\nthat if I am not guided by thy opinion, but follow my own, I am flying\r\nfrom the good and pursuing the evil. This being so, thou must remember\r\nthat I am now labouring under that infirmity which women sometimes\r\nsuffer from, when the craving seizes them to eat clay, plaster,\r\ncharcoal, and things even worse, disgusting to look at, much more to\r\neat; so that it will be necessary to have recourse to some artifice to\r\ncure me; and this can be easily effected if only thou wilt make a\r\nbeginning, even though it be in a lukewarm and make-believe fashion, to\r\npay court to Camilla, who will not be so yielding that her virtue will\r\ngive way at the first attack: with this mere attempt I shall rest\r\nsatisfied, and thou wilt have done what our friendship binds thee to\r\ndo, not only in giving me life, but in persuading me not to discard my\r\nhonour. And this thou art bound to do for one reason alone, that,\r\nbeing, as I am, resolved to apply this test, it is not for thee to\r\npermit me to reveal my weakness to another, and so imperil that honour\r\nthou art striving to keep me from losing; and if thine may not stand as\r\nhigh as it ought in the estimation of Camilla while thou art paying\r\ncourt to her, that is of little or no importance, because ere long, on\r\nfinding in her that constancy which we expect, thou canst tell her the\r\nplain truth as regards our stratagem, and so regain thy place in her\r\nesteem; and as thou art venturing so little, and by the venture canst\r\nafford me so much satisfaction, refuse not to undertake it, even if\r\nfurther difficulties present themselves to thee; for, as I have said,\r\nif thou wilt only make a beginning I will acknowledge the issue\r\ndecided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLothario seeing the fixed determination of Anselmo, and not knowing\r\nwhat further examples to offer or arguments to urge in order to\r\ndissuade him from it, and perceiving that he threatened to confide his\r\npernicious scheme to someone else, to avoid a greater evil resolved to\r\ngratify him and do what he asked, intending to manage the business so\r\nas to satisfy Anselmo without corrupting the mind of Camilla; so in\r\nreply he told him not to communicate his purpose to any other, for he\r\nwould undertake the task himself, and would begin it as soon as he\r\npleased. Anselmo embraced him warmly and affectionately, and thanked\r\nhim for his offer as if he had bestowed some great favour upon him; and\r\nit was agreed between them to set about it the next day, Anselmo\r\naffording opportunity and time to Lothario to converse alone with\r\nCamilla, and furnishing him with money and jewels to offer and present\r\nto her. He suggested, too, that he should treat her to music, and write\r\nverses in her praise, and if he was unwilling to take the trouble of\r\ncomposing them, he offered to do it himself. Lothario agreed to all\r\nwith an intention very different from what Anselmo supposed, and with\r\nthis understanding they returned to Anselmo\xe2\x80\x99s house, where they found\r\nCamilla awaiting her husband anxiously and uneasily, for he was later\r\nthan usual in returning that day. Lothario repaired to his own house,\r\nand Anselmo remained in his, as well satisfied as Lothario was troubled\r\nin mind; for he could see no satisfactory way out of this ill-advised\r\nbusiness. That night, however, he thought of a plan by which he might\r\ndeceive Anselmo without any injury to Camilla. The next day he went to\r\ndine with his friend, and was welcomed by Camilla, who received and\r\ntreated him with great cordiality, knowing the affection her husband\r\nfelt for him. When dinner was over and the cloth removed, Anselmo told\r\nLothario to stay there with Camilla while he attended to some pressing\r\nbusiness, as he would return in an hour and a half. Camilla begged him\r\nnot to go, and Lothario offered to accompany him, but nothing could\r\npersuade Anselmo, who on the contrary pressed Lothario to remain\r\nwaiting for him as he had a matter of great importance to discuss with\r\nhim. At the same time he bade Camilla not to leave Lothario alone until\r\nhe came back. In short he contrived to put so good a face on the\r\nreason, or the folly, of his absence that no one could have suspected\r\nit was a pretence.\r\n\r\nAnselmo took his departure, and Camilla and Lothario were left alone at\r\nthe table, for the rest of the household had gone to dinner. Lothario\r\nsaw himself in the lists according to his friend\xe2\x80\x99s wish, and facing an\r\nenemy that could by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron of armed\r\nknights; judge whether he had good reason to fear; but what he did was\r\nto lean his elbow on the arm of the chair, and his cheek upon his hand,\r\nand, asking Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s pardon for his ill manners, he said he wished to\r\ntake a little sleep until Anselmo returned. Camilla in reply said he\r\ncould repose more at his ease in the reception-room than in his chair,\r\nand begged of him to go in and sleep there; but Lothario declined, and\r\nthere he remained asleep until the return of Anselmo, who finding\r\nCamilla in her own room, and Lothario asleep, imagined that he had\r\nstayed away so long as to have afforded them time enough for\r\nconversation and even for sleep, and was all impatience until Lothario\r\nshould wake up, that he might go out with him and question him as to\r\nhis success. Everything fell out as he wished; Lothario awoke, and the\r\ntwo at once left the house, and Anselmo asked what he was anxious to\r\nknow, and Lothario in answer told him that he had not thought it\r\nadvisable to declare himself entirely the first time, and therefore had\r\nonly extolled the charms of Camilla, telling her that all the city\r\nspoke of nothing else but her beauty and wit, for this seemed to him an\r\nexcellent way of beginning to gain her good-will and render her\r\ndisposed to listen to him with pleasure the next time, thus availing\r\nhimself of the device the devil has recourse to when he would deceive\r\none who is on the watch; for he being the angel of darkness transforms\r\nhimself into an angel of light, and, under cover of a fair seeming,\r\ndiscloses himself at length, and effects his purpose if at the\r\nbeginning his wiles are not discovered. All this gave great\r\nsatisfaction to Anselmo, and he said he would afford the same\r\nopportunity every day, but without leaving the house, for he would find\r\nthings to do at home so that Camilla should not detect the plot.\r\n\r\nThus, then, several days went by, and Lothario, without uttering a word\r\nto Camilla, reported to Anselmo that he had talked with her and that he\r\nhad never been able to draw from her the slightest indication of\r\nconsent to anything dishonourable, nor even a sign or shadow of hope;\r\non the contrary, he said she would inform her husband of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anselmo; \xe2\x80\x9cCamilla has thus far resisted words; we\r\nmust now see how she will resist deeds. I will give you to-morrow two\r\nthousand crowns in gold for you to offer or even present, and as many\r\nmore to buy jewels to lure her, for women are fond of being becomingly\r\nattired and going gaily dressed, and all the more so if they are\r\nbeautiful, however chaste they may be; and if she resists this\r\ntemptation, I will rest satisfied and will give you no more trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLothario replied that now he had begun he would carry on the\r\nundertaking to the end, though he perceived he was to come out of it\r\nwearied and vanquished. The next day he received the four thousand\r\ncrowns, and with them four thousand perplexities, for he knew not what\r\nto say by way of a new falsehood; but in the end he made up his mind to\r\ntell him that Camilla stood as firm against gifts and promises as\r\nagainst words, and that there was no use in taking any further trouble,\r\nfor the time was all spent to no purpose.\r\n\r\nBut chance, directing things in a different manner, so ordered it that\r\nAnselmo, having left Lothario and Camilla alone as on other occasions,\r\nshut himself into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listen\r\nthrough the keyhole to what passed between them, and perceived that for\r\nmore than half an hour Lothario did not utter a word to Camilla, nor\r\nwould utter a word though he were to be there for an age; and he came\r\nto the conclusion that what his friend had told him about the replies\r\nof Camilla was all invention and falsehood, and to ascertain if it were\r\nso, he came out, and calling Lothario aside asked him what news he had\r\nand in what humour Camilla was. Lothario replied that he was not\r\ndisposed to go on with the business, for she had answered him so\r\nangrily and harshly that he had no heart to say anything more to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Lothario, Lothario,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anselmo, \xe2\x80\x9chow ill dost thou meet thy\r\nobligations to me, and the great confidence I repose in thee! I have\r\nbeen just now watching through this keyhole, and I have seen that thou\r\nhast not said a word to Camilla, whence I conclude that on the former\r\noccasions thou hast not spoken to her either, and if this be so, as no\r\ndoubt it is, why dost thou deceive me, or wherefore seekest thou by\r\ncraft to deprive me of the means I might find of attaining my desire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnselmo said no more, but he had said enough to cover Lothario with\r\nshame and confusion, and he, feeling as it were his honour touched by\r\nhaving been detected in a lie, swore to Anselmo that he would from that\r\nmoment devote himself to satisfying him without any deception, as he\r\nwould see if he had the curiosity to watch; though he need not take the\r\ntrouble, for the pains he would take to satisfy him would remove all\r\nsuspicions from his mind. Anselmo believed him, and to afford him an\r\nopportunity more free and less liable to surprise, he resolved to\r\nabsent himself from his house for eight days, betaking himself to that\r\nof a friend of his who lived in a village not far from the city; and,\r\nthe better to account for his departure to Camilla, he so arranged it\r\nthat the friend should send him a very pressing invitation.\r\n\r\nUnhappy, shortsighted Anselmo, what art thou doing, what art thou\r\nplotting, what art thou devising? Bethink thee thou art working against\r\nthyself, plotting thine own dishonour, devising thine own ruin. Thy\r\nwife Camilla is virtuous, thou dost possess her in peace and quietness,\r\nno one assails thy happiness, her thoughts wander not beyond the walls\r\nof thy house, thou art her heaven on earth, the object of her wishes,\r\nthe fulfilment of her desires, the measure wherewith she measures her\r\nwill, making it conform in all things to thine and Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s. If, then,\r\nthe mine of her honour, beauty, virtue, and modesty yields thee without\r\nlabour all the wealth it contains and thou canst wish for, why wilt\r\nthou dig the earth in search of fresh veins, of new unknown treasure,\r\nrisking the collapse of all, since it but rests on the feeble props of\r\nher weak nature? Bethink thee that from him who seeks impossibilities\r\nthat which is possible may with justice be withheld, as was better\r\nexpressed by a poet who said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis mine to seek for life in death,\r\n    Health in disease seek I,\r\nI seek in prison freedom\xe2\x80\x99s breath,\r\n    In traitors loyalty.\r\n\r\nSo Fate that ever scorns to grant\r\n    Or grace or boon to me,\r\nSince what can never be I want,\r\n    Denies me what might be.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Anselmo took his departure for the village, leaving\r\ninstructions with Camilla that during his absence Lothario would come\r\nto look after his house and to dine with her, and that she was to treat\r\nhim as she would himself. Camilla was distressed, as a discreet and\r\nright-minded woman would be, at the orders her husband left her, and\r\nbade him remember that it was not becoming that anyone should occupy\r\nhis seat at the table during his absence, and if he acted thus from not\r\nfeeling confidence that she would be able to manage his house, let him\r\ntry her this time, and he would find by experience that she was equal\r\nto greater responsibilities. Anselmo replied that it was his pleasure\r\nto have it so, and that she had only to submit and obey. Camilla said\r\nshe would do so, though against her will.\r\n\r\nAnselmo went, and the next day Lothario came to his house, where he was\r\nreceived by Camilla with a friendly and modest welcome; but she never\r\nsuffered Lothario to see her alone, for she was always attended by her\r\nmen and women servants, especially by a handmaid of hers, Leonela by\r\nname, to whom she was much attached (for they had been brought up\r\ntogether from childhood in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house), and whom she had kept\r\nwith her after her marriage with Anselmo. The first three days Lothario\r\ndid not speak to her, though he might have done so when they removed\r\nthe cloth and the servants retired to dine hastily; for such were\r\nCamilla\xe2\x80\x99s orders; nay more, Leonela had directions to dine earlier than\r\nCamilla and never to leave her side. She, however, having her thoughts\r\nfixed upon other things more to her taste, and wanting that time and\r\nopportunity for her own pleasures, did not always obey her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommands, but on the contrary left them alone, as if they had ordered\r\nher to do so; but the modest bearing of Camilla, the calmness of her\r\ncountenance, the composure of her aspect were enough to bridle the\r\ntongue of Lothario. But the influence which the many virtues of Camilla\r\nexerted in imposing silence on Lothario\xe2\x80\x99s tongue proved mischievous for\r\nboth of them, for if his tongue was silent his thoughts were busy, and\r\ncould dwell at leisure upon the perfections of Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s goodness and\r\nbeauty one by one, charms enough to warm with love a marble statue, not\r\nto say a heart of flesh. Lothario gazed upon her when he might have\r\nbeen speaking to her, and thought how worthy of being loved she was;\r\nand thus reflection began little by little to assail his allegiance to\r\nAnselmo, and a thousand times he thought of withdrawing from the city\r\nand going where Anselmo should never see him nor he see Camilla. But\r\nalready the delight he found in gazing on her interposed and held him\r\nfast. He put a constraint upon himself, and struggled to repel and\r\nrepress the pleasure he found in contemplating Camilla; when alone he\r\nblamed himself for his weakness, called himself a bad friend, nay a bad\r\nChristian; then he argued the matter and compared himself with Anselmo;\r\nalways coming to the conclusion that the folly and rashness of Anselmo\r\nhad been worse than his faithlessness, and that if he could excuse his\r\nintentions as easily before God as with man, he had no reason to fear\r\nany punishment for his offence.\r\n\r\nIn short the beauty and goodness of Camilla, joined with the\r\nopportunity which the blind husband had placed in his hands, overthrew\r\nthe loyalty of Lothario; and giving heed to nothing save the object\r\ntowards which his inclinations led him, after Anselmo had been three\r\ndays absent, during which he had been carrying on a continual struggle\r\nwith his passion, he began to make love to Camilla with so much\r\nvehemence and warmth of language that she was overwhelmed with\r\namazement, and could only rise from her place and retire to her room\r\nwithout answering him a word. But the hope which always springs up with\r\nlove was not weakened in Lothario by this repelling demeanour; on the\r\ncontrary his passion for Camilla increased, and she discovering in him\r\nwhat she had never expected, knew not what to do; and considering it\r\nneither safe nor right to give him the chance or opportunity of\r\nspeaking to her again, she resolved to send, as she did that very\r\nnight, one of her servants with a letter to Anselmo, in which she\r\naddressed the following words to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nIN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE NOVEL OF \xe2\x80\x9cTHE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is commonly said that an army looks ill without its general and a\r\ncastle without its castellan, and I say that a young married woman\r\nlooks still worse without her husband unless there are very good\r\nreasons for it. I find myself so ill at ease without you, and so\r\nincapable of enduring this separation, that unless you return quickly I\r\nshall have to go for relief to my parents\xe2\x80\x99 house, even if I leave yours\r\nwithout a protector; for the one you left me, if indeed he deserved\r\nthat title, has, I think, more regard to his own pleasure than to what\r\nconcerns you: as you are possessed of discernment I need say no more to\r\nyou, nor indeed is it fitting I should say more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnselmo received this letter, and from it he gathered that Lothario had\r\nalready begun his task and that Camilla must have replied to him as he\r\nwould have wished; and delighted beyond measure at such intelligence he\r\nsent word to her not to leave his house on any account, as he would\r\nvery shortly return. Camilla was astonished at Anselmo\xe2\x80\x99s reply, which\r\nplaced her in greater perplexity than before, for she neither dared to\r\nremain in her own house, nor yet to go to her parents\xe2\x80\x99; for in\r\nremaining her virtue was imperilled, and in going she was opposing her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s commands. Finally she decided upon what was the worse course\r\nfor her, to remain, resolving not to fly from the presence of Lothario,\r\nthat she might not give food for gossip to her servants; and she now\r\nbegan to regret having written as she had to her husband, fearing he\r\nmight imagine that Lothario had perceived in her some lightness which\r\nhad impelled him to lay aside the respect he owed her; but confident of\r\nher rectitude she put her trust in God and in her own virtuous\r\nintentions, with which she hoped to resist in silence all the\r\nsolicitations of Lothario, without saying anything to her husband so as\r\nnot to involve him in any quarrel or trouble; and she even began to\r\nconsider how to excuse Lothario to Anselmo when he should ask her what\r\nit was that induced her to write that letter. With these resolutions,\r\nmore honourable than judicious or effectual, she remained the next day\r\nlistening to Lothario, who pressed his suit so strenuously that\r\nCamilla\xe2\x80\x99s firmness began to waver, and her virtue had enough to do to\r\ncome to the rescue of her eyes and keep them from showing signs of a\r\ncertain tender compassion which the tears and appeals of Lothario had\r\nawakened in her bosom. Lothario observed all this, and it inflamed him\r\nall the more. In short he felt that while Anselmo\xe2\x80\x99s absence afforded\r\ntime and opportunity he must press the siege of the fortress, and so he\r\nassailed her self-esteem with praises of her beauty, for there is\r\nnothing that more quickly reduces and levels the castle towers of fair\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s vanity than vanity itself upon the tongue of flattery. In fact\r\nwith the utmost assiduity he undermined the rock of her purity with\r\nsuch engines that had Camilla been of brass she must have fallen. He\r\nwept, he entreated, he promised, he flattered, he importuned, he\r\npretended with so much feeling and apparent sincerity, that he\r\noverthrew the virtuous resolves of Camilla and won the triumph he least\r\nexpected and most longed for. Camilla yielded, Camilla fell; but what\r\nwonder if the friendship of Lothario could not stand firm? A clear\r\nproof to us that the passion of love is to be conquered only by flying\r\nfrom it, and that no one should engage in a struggle with an enemy so\r\nmighty; for divine strength is needed to overcome his human power.\r\nLeonela alone knew of her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s weakness, for the two false\r\nfriends and new lovers were unable to conceal it. Lothario did not care\r\nto tell Camilla the object Anselmo had in view, nor that he had\r\nafforded him the opportunity of attaining such a result, lest she\r\nshould undervalue his love and think that it was by chance and without\r\nintending it and not of his own accord that he had made love to her.\r\n\r\nA few days later Anselmo returned to his house and did not perceive\r\nwhat it had lost, that which he so lightly treated and so highly\r\nprized. He went at once to see Lothario, and found him at home; they\r\nembraced each other, and Anselmo asked for the tidings of his life or\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tidings I have to give thee, Anselmo my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lothario,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9care that thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the pattern and\r\ncrown of all good wives. The words that I have addressed to her were\r\nborne away on the wind, my promises have been despised, my presents\r\nhave been refused, such feigned tears as I shed have been turned into\r\nopen ridicule. In short, as Camilla is the essence of all beauty, so is\r\nshe the treasure-house where purity dwells, and gentleness and modesty\r\nabide with all the virtues that can confer praise, honour, and\r\nhappiness upon a woman. Take back thy money, my friend; here it is, and\r\nI have had no need to touch it, for the chastity of Camilla yields not\r\nto things so base as gifts or promises. Be content, Anselmo, and\r\nrefrain from making further proof; and as thou hast passed dryshod\r\nthrough the sea of those doubts and suspicions that are and may be\r\nentertained of women, seek not to plunge again into the deep ocean of\r\nnew embarrassments, or with another pilot make trial of the goodness\r\nand strength of the bark that Heaven has granted thee for thy passage\r\nacross the sea of this world; but reckon thyself now safe in port, moor\r\nthyself with the anchor of sound reflection, and rest in peace until\r\nthou art called upon to pay that debt which no nobility on earth can\r\nescape paying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnselmo was completely satisfied by the words of Lothario, and believed\r\nthem as fully as if they had been spoken by an oracle; nevertheless he\r\nbegged of him not to relinquish the undertaking, were it but for the\r\nsake of curiosity and amusement; though thenceforward he need not make\r\nuse of the same earnest endeavours as before; all he wished him to do\r\nwas to write some verses to her, praising her under the name of\r\nChloris, for he himself would give her to understand that he was in\r\nlove with a lady to whom he had given that name to enable him to sing\r\nher praises with the decorum due to her modesty; and if Lothario were\r\nunwilling to take the trouble of writing the verses he would compose\r\nthem himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will not be necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lothario, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the muses are not\r\nsuch enemies of mine but that they visit me now and then in the course\r\nof the year. Do thou tell Camilla what thou hast proposed about a\r\npretended amour of mine; as for the verses I will make them, and if not\r\nas good as the subject deserves, they shall be at least the best I can\r\nproduce.\xe2\x80\x9d An agreement to this effect was made between the friends, the\r\nill-advised one and the treacherous, and Anselmo returning to his house\r\nasked Camilla the question she already wondered he had not asked\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94what it was that had caused her to write the letter she had sent\r\nhim. Camilla replied that it had seemed to her that Lothario looked at\r\nher somewhat more freely than when he had been at home; but that now\r\nshe was undeceived and believed it to have been only her own\r\nimagination, for Lothario now avoided seeing her, or being alone with\r\nher. Anselmo told her she might be quite easy on the score of that\r\nsuspicion, for he knew that Lothario was in love with a damsel of rank\r\nin the city whom he celebrated under the name of Chloris, and that even\r\nif he were not, his fidelity and their great friendship left no room\r\nfor fear. Had not Camilla, however, been informed beforehand by\r\nLothario that this love for Chloris was a pretence, and that he himself\r\nhad told Anselmo of it in order to be able sometimes to give utterance\r\nto the praises of Camilla herself, no doubt she would have fallen into\r\nthe despairing toils of jealousy; but being forewarned she received the\r\nstartling news without uneasiness.\r\n\r\nThe next day as the three were at table Anselmo asked Lothario to\r\nrecite something of what he had composed for his mistress Chloris; for\r\nas Camilla did not know her, he might safely say what he liked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven did she know her,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Lothario, \xe2\x80\x9cI would hide nothing, for\r\nwhen a lover praises his lady\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, and charges her with cruelty,\r\nhe casts no imputation upon her fair name; at any rate, all I can say\r\nis that yesterday I made a sonnet on the ingratitude of this Chloris,\r\nwhich goes thus:\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\nAt midnight, in the silence, when the eyes\r\nOf happier mortals balmy slumbers close,\r\nThe weary tale of my unnumbered woes\r\nTo Chloris and to Heaven is wont to rise.\r\nAnd when the light of day returning dyes\r\nThe portals of the east with tints of rose,\r\nWith undiminished force my sorrow flows\r\nIn broken accents and in burning sighs.\r\nAnd when the sun ascends his star-girt throne,\r\nAnd on the earth pours down his midday beams,\r\nNoon but renews my wailing and my tears;\r\nAnd with the night again goes up my moan.\r\nYet ever in my agony it seems\r\nTo me that neither Heaven nor Chloris hears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sonnet pleased Camilla, and still more Anselmo, for he praised it\r\nand said the lady was excessively cruel who made no return for\r\nsincerity so manifest. On which Camilla said, \xe2\x80\x9cThen all that\r\nlove-smitten poets say is true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs poets they do not tell the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lothario; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as lovers\r\nthey are not more defective in expression than they are truthful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt of that,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Anselmo, anxious to support and\r\nuphold Lothario\xe2\x80\x99s ideas with Camilla, who was as regardless of his\r\ndesign as she was deep in love with Lothario; and so taking delight in\r\nanything that was his, and knowing that his thoughts and writings had\r\nher for their object, and that she herself was the real Chloris, she\r\nasked him to repeat some other sonnet or verses if he recollected any.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lothario, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not think it as good as the first\r\none, or, more correctly speaking, less bad; but you can easily judge,\r\nfor it is this.\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\nI know that I am doomed; death is to me\r\nAs certain as that thou, ungrateful fair,\r\nDead at thy feet shouldst see me lying, ere\r\nMy heart repented of its love for thee.\r\nIf buried in oblivion I should be,\r\nBereft of life, fame, favour, even there\r\nIt would be found that I thy image bear\r\nDeep graven in my breast for all to see.\r\nThis like some holy relic do I prize\r\nTo save me from the fate my truth entails,\r\nTruth that to thy hard heart its vigour owes.\r\nAlas for him that under lowering skies,\r\nIn peril o\xe2\x80\x99er a trackless ocean sails,\r\nWhere neither friendly port nor pole-star shows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnselmo praised this second sonnet too, as he had praised the first;\r\nand so he went on adding link after link to the chain with which he was\r\nbinding himself and making his dishonour secure; for when Lothario was\r\ndoing most to dishonour him he told him he was most honoured; and thus\r\neach step that Camilla descended towards the depths of her abasement,\r\nshe mounted, in his opinion, towards the summit of virtue and fair\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that finding herself on one occasion alone with her\r\nmaid, Camilla said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cI am ashamed to think, my dear Leonela, how\r\nlightly I have valued myself that I did not compel Lothario to purchase\r\nby at least some expenditure of time that full possession of me that I\r\nso quickly yielded him of my own free will. I fear that he will think\r\nill of my pliancy or lightness, not considering the irresistible\r\ninfluence he brought to bear upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet not that trouble you, my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Leonela, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it does not\r\ntake away the value of the thing given or make it the less precious to\r\ngive it quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized;\r\nnay, they are wont to say that he who gives quickly gives twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Camilla, \xe2\x80\x9cthat what costs little is valued less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat saying does not hold good in your case,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Leonela, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nlove, as I have heard say, sometimes flies and sometimes walks; with\r\nthis one it runs, with that it moves slowly; some it cools, others it\r\nburns; some it wounds, others it slays; it begins the course of its\r\ndesires, and at the same moment completes and ends it; in the morning\r\nit will lay siege to a fortress and by night will have taken it, for\r\nthere is no power that can resist it; so what are you in dread of, what\r\ndo you fear, when the same must have befallen Lothario, love having\r\nchosen the absence of my lord as the instrument for subduing you? and\r\nit was absolutely necessary to complete then what love had resolved\r\nupon, without affording the time to let Anselmo return and by his\r\npresence compel the work to be left unfinished; for love has no better\r\nagent for carrying out his designs than opportunity; and of opportunity\r\nhe avails himself in all his feats, especially at the outset. All this\r\nI know well myself, more by experience than by hearsay, and some day,\r\nse\xc3\xb1ora, I will enlighten you on the subject, for I am of your flesh and\r\nblood too. Moreover, lady Camilla, you did not surrender yourself or\r\nyield so quickly but that first you saw Lothario\xe2\x80\x99s whole soul in his\r\neyes, in his sighs, in his words, his promises and his gifts, and by it\r\nand his good qualities perceived how worthy he was of your love. This,\r\nthen, being the case, let not these scrupulous and prudish ideas\r\ntrouble your imagination, but be assured that Lothario prizes you as\r\nyou do him, and rest content and satisfied that as you are caught in\r\nthe noose of love it is one of worth and merit that has taken you, and\r\none that has not only the four S\xe2\x80\x99s that they say true lovers ought to\r\nhave, but a complete alphabet; only listen to me and you will see how I\r\ncan repeat it by rote. He is to my eyes and thinking, Amiable, Brave,\r\nCourteous, Distinguished, Elegant, Fond, Gay, Honourable, Illustrious,\r\nLoyal, Manly, Noble, Open, Polite, Quickwitted, Rich, and the S\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccording to the saying, and then Tender, Veracious: X does not suit\r\nhim, for it is a rough letter; Y has been given already; and Z Zealous\r\nfor your honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCamilla laughed at her maid\xe2\x80\x99s alphabet, and perceived her to be more\r\nexperienced in love affairs than she said, which she admitted,\r\nconfessing to Camilla that she had love passages with a young man of\r\ngood birth of the same city. Camilla was uneasy at this, dreading lest\r\nit might prove the means of endangering her honour, and asked whether\r\nher intrigue had gone beyond words, and she with little shame and much\r\neffrontery said it had; for certain it is that ladies\xe2\x80\x99 imprudences make\r\nservants shameless, who, when they see their mistresses make a false\r\nstep, think nothing of going astray themselves, or of its being known.\r\nAll that Camilla could do was to entreat Leonela to say nothing about\r\nher doings to him whom she called her lover, and to conduct her own\r\naffairs secretly lest they should come to the knowledge of Anselmo or\r\nof Lothario. Leonela said she would, but kept her word in such a way\r\nthat she confirmed Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s apprehension of losing her reputation\r\nthrough her means; for this abandoned and bold Leonela, as soon as she\r\nperceived that her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s demeanour was not what it was wont to be,\r\nhad the audacity to introduce her lover into the house, confident that\r\neven if her mistress saw him she would not dare to expose him; for the\r\nsins of mistresses entail this mischief among others; they make\r\nthemselves the slaves of their own servants, and are obliged to hide\r\ntheir laxities and depravities; as was the case with Camilla, who\r\nthough she perceived, not once but many times, that Leonela was with\r\nher lover in some room of the house, not only did not dare to chide\r\nher, but afforded her opportunities for concealing him and removed all\r\ndifficulties, lest he should be seen by her husband. She was unable,\r\nhowever, to prevent him from being seen on one occasion, as he sallied\r\nforth at daybreak, by Lothario, who, not knowing who he was, at first\r\ntook him for a spectre; but, as soon as he saw him hasten away,\r\nmuffling his face with his cloak and concealing himself carefully and\r\ncautiously, he rejected this foolish idea, and adopted another, which\r\nwould have been the ruin of all had not Camilla found a remedy. It did\r\nnot occur to Lothario that this man he had seen issuing at such an\r\nuntimely hour from Anselmo\xe2\x80\x99s house could have entered it on Leonela\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount, nor did he even remember there was such a person as Leonela;\r\nall he thought was that as Camilla had been light and yielding with\r\nhim, so she had been with another; for this further penalty the erring\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s sin brings with it, that her honour is distrusted even by him\r\nto whose overtures and persuasions she has yielded; and he believes her\r\nto have surrendered more easily to others, and gives implicit credence\r\nto every suspicion that comes into his mind. All Lothario\xe2\x80\x99s good sense\r\nseems to have failed him at this juncture; all his prudent maxims\r\nescaped his memory; for without once reflecting rationally, and without\r\nmore ado, in his impatience and in the blindness of the jealous rage\r\nthat gnawed his heart, and dying to revenge himself upon Camilla, who\r\nhad done him no wrong, before Anselmo had risen he hastened to him and\r\nsaid to him, \xe2\x80\x9cKnow, Anselmo, that for several days past I have been\r\nstruggling with myself, striving to withhold from thee what it is no\r\nlonger possible or right that I should conceal from thee. Know that\r\nCamilla\xe2\x80\x99s fortress has surrendered and is ready to submit to my will;\r\nand if I have been slow to reveal this fact to thee, it was in order to\r\nsee if it were some light caprice of hers, or if she sought to try me\r\nand ascertain if the love I began to make to her with thy permission\r\nwas made with a serious intention. I thought, too, that she, if she\r\nwere what she ought to be, and what we both believed her, would have\r\nere this given thee information of my addresses; but seeing that she\r\ndelays, I believe the truth of the promise she has given me that the\r\nnext time thou art absent from the house she will grant me an interview\r\nin the closet where thy jewels are kept (and it was true that Camilla\r\nused to meet him there); but I do not wish thee to rush precipitately\r\nto take vengeance, for the sin is as yet only committed in intention,\r\nand Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s may change perhaps between this and the appointed time,\r\nand repentance spring up in its place. As hitherto thou hast always\r\nfollowed my advice wholly or in part, follow and observe this that I\r\nwill give thee now, so that, without mistake, and with mature\r\ndeliberation, thou mayest satisfy thyself as to what may seem the best\r\ncourse; pretend to absent thyself for two or three days as thou hast\r\nbeen wont to do on other occasions, and contrive to hide thyself in the\r\ncloset; for the tapestries and other things there afford great\r\nfacilities for thy concealment, and then thou wilt see with thine own\r\neyes and I with mine what Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s purpose may be. And if it be a\r\nguilty one, which may be feared rather than expected, with silence,\r\nprudence, and discretion thou canst thyself become the instrument of\r\npunishment for the wrong done thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnselmo was amazed, overwhelmed, and astounded at the words of\r\nLothario, which came upon him at a time when he least expected to hear\r\nthem, for he now looked upon Camilla as having triumphed over the\r\npretended attacks of Lothario, and was beginning to enjoy the glory of\r\nher victory. He remained silent for a considerable time, looking on the\r\nground with fixed gaze, and at length said, \xe2\x80\x9cThou hast behaved,\r\nLothario, as I expected of thy friendship: I will follow thy advice in\r\neverything; do as thou wilt, and keep this secret as thou seest it\r\nshould be kept in circumstances so unlooked for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLothario gave him his word, but after leaving him he repented\r\naltogether of what he had said to him, perceiving how foolishly he had\r\nacted, as he might have revenged himself upon Camilla in some less\r\ncruel and degrading way. He cursed his want of sense, condemned his\r\nhasty resolution, and knew not what course to take to undo the mischief\r\nor find some ready escape from it. At last he decided upon revealing\r\nall to Camilla, and, as there was no want of opportunity for doing so,\r\nhe found her alone the same day; but she, as soon as she had the chance\r\nof speaking to him, said, \xe2\x80\x9cLothario my friend, I must tell thee I have\r\na sorrow in my heart which fills it so that it seems ready to burst;\r\nand it will be a wonder if it does not; for the audacity of Leonela has\r\nnow reached such a pitch that every night she conceals a gallant of\r\nhers in this house and remains with him till morning, at the expense of\r\nmy reputation; inasmuch as it is open to anyone to question it who may\r\nsee him quitting my house at such unseasonable hours; but what\r\ndistresses me is that I cannot punish or chide her, for her privity to\r\nour intrigue bridles my mouth and keeps me silent about hers, while I\r\nam dreading that some catastrophe will come of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Camilla said this Lothario at first imagined it was some device to\r\ndelude him into the idea that the man he had seen going out was\r\nLeonela\xe2\x80\x99s lover and not hers; but when he saw how she wept and\r\nsuffered, and begged him to help her, he became convinced of the truth,\r\nand the conviction completed his confusion and remorse; however, he\r\ntold Camilla not to distress herself, as he would take measures to put\r\na stop to the insolence of Leonela. At the same time he told her what,\r\ndriven by the fierce rage of jealousy, he had said to Anselmo, and how\r\nhe had arranged to hide himself in the closet that he might there see\r\nplainly how little she preserved her fidelity to him; and he entreated\r\nher pardon for this madness, and her advice as to how to repair it, and\r\nescape safely from the intricate labyrinth in which his imprudence had\r\ninvolved him. Camilla was struck with alarm at hearing what Lothario\r\nsaid, and with much anger, and great good sense, she reproved him and\r\nrebuked his base design and the foolish and mischievous resolution he\r\nhad made; but as woman has by nature a nimbler wit than man for good\r\nand for evil, though it is apt to fail when she sets herself\r\ndeliberately to reason, Camilla on the spur of the moment thought of a\r\nway to remedy what was to all appearance irremediable, and told\r\nLothario to contrive that the next day Anselmo should conceal himself\r\nin the place he mentioned, for she hoped from his concealment to obtain\r\nthe means of their enjoying themselves for the future without any\r\napprehension; and without revealing her purpose to him entirely she\r\ncharged him to be careful, as soon as Anselmo was concealed, to come to\r\nher when Leonela should call him, and to all she said to him to answer\r\nas he would have answered had he not known that Anselmo was listening.\r\nLothario pressed her to explain her intention fully, so that he might\r\nwith more certainty and precaution take care to do what he saw to be\r\nneedful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Camilla, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing to take care of except to\r\nanswer me what I shall ask you;\xe2\x80\x9d for she did not wish to explain to him\r\nbeforehand what she meant to do, fearing lest he should be unwilling to\r\nfollow out an idea which seemed to her such a good one, and should try\r\nor devise some other less practicable plan.\r\n\r\nLothario then retired, and the next day Anselmo, under pretence of\r\ngoing to his friend\xe2\x80\x99s country house, took his departure, and then\r\nreturned to conceal himself, which he was able to do easily, as Camilla\r\nand Leonela took care to give him the opportunity; and so he placed\r\nhimself in hiding in the state of agitation that it may be imagined he\r\nwould feel who expected to see the vitals of his honour laid bare\r\nbefore his eyes, and found himself on the point of losing the supreme\r\nblessing he thought he possessed in his beloved Camilla. Having made\r\nsure of Anselmo\xe2\x80\x99s being in his hiding-place, Camilla and Leonela\r\nentered the closet, and the instant she set foot within it Camilla\r\nsaid, with a deep sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! dear Leonela, would it not be better,\r\nbefore I do what I am unwilling you should know lest you should seek to\r\nprevent it, that you should take Anselmo\xe2\x80\x99s dagger that I have asked of\r\nyou and with it pierce this vile heart of mine? But no; there is no\r\nreason why I should suffer the punishment of another\xe2\x80\x99s fault. I will\r\nfirst know what it is that the bold licentious eyes of Lothario have\r\nseen in me that could have encouraged him to reveal to me a design so\r\nbase as that which he has disclosed regardless of his friend and of my\r\nhonour. Go to the window, Leonela, and call him, for no doubt he is in\r\nthe street waiting to carry out his vile project; but mine, cruel it\r\nmay be, but honourable, shall be carried out first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said the crafty Leonela, who knew her part, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is it\r\nyou want to do with this dagger? Can it be that you mean to take your\r\nown life, or Lothario\xe2\x80\x99s? for whichever you mean to do, it will lead to\r\nthe loss of your reputation and good name. It is better to dissemble\r\nyour wrong and not give this wicked man the chance of entering the\r\nhouse now and finding us alone; consider, se\xc3\xb1ora, we are weak women and\r\nhe is a man, and determined, and as he comes with such a base purpose,\r\nblind and urged by passion, perhaps before you can put yours into\r\nexecution he may do what will be worse for you than taking your life.\r\nIll betide my master, Anselmo, for giving such authority in his house\r\nto this shameless fellow! And supposing you kill him, se\xc3\xb1ora, as I\r\nsuspect you mean to do, what shall we do with him when he is dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Camilla, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall leave him for Anselmo to\r\nbury him; for in reason it will be to him a light labour to hide his\r\nown infamy under ground. Summon him, make haste, for all the time I\r\ndelay in taking vengeance for my wrong seems to me an offence against\r\nthe loyalty I owe my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnselmo was listening to all this, and every word that Camilla uttered\r\nmade him change his mind; but when he heard that it was resolved to\r\nkill Lothario his first impulse was to come out and show himself to\r\navert such a disaster; but in his anxiety to see the issue of a\r\nresolution so bold and virtuous he restrained himself, intending to\r\ncome forth in time to prevent the deed. At this moment Camilla,\r\nthrowing herself upon a bed that was close by, swooned away, and\r\nLeonela began to weep bitterly, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cWoe is me! that I should\r\nbe fated to have dying here in my arms the flower of virtue upon earth,\r\nthe crown of true wives, the pattern of chastity!\xe2\x80\x9d with more to the\r\nsame effect, so that anyone who heard her would have taken her for the\r\nmost tender-hearted and faithful handmaid in the world, and her\r\nmistress for another persecuted Penelope.\r\n\r\nCamilla was not long in recovering from her fainting fit and on coming\r\nto herself she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you not go, Leonela, to call hither that\r\nfriend, the falsest to his friend the sun ever shone upon or night\r\nconcealed? Away, run, haste, speed! lest the fire of my wrath burn\r\nitself out with delay, and the righteous vengeance that I hope for melt\r\naway in menaces and maledictions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am just going to call him, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Leonela; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you must\r\nfirst give me that dagger, lest while I am gone you should by means of\r\nit give cause to all who love you to weep all their lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in peace, dear Leonela, I will not do so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Camilla, \xe2\x80\x9cfor rash\r\nand foolish as I may be, to your mind, in defending my honour, I am not\r\ngoing to be so much so as that Lucretia who they say killed herself\r\nwithout having done anything wrong, and without having first killed him\r\non whom the guilt of her misfortune lay. I shall die, if I am to die;\r\nbut it must be after full vengeance upon him who has brought me here to\r\nweep over audacity that no fault of mine gave birth to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeonela required much pressing before she would go to summon Lothario,\r\nbut at last she went, and while awaiting her return Camilla continued,\r\nas if speaking to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cGood God! would it not have been more\r\nprudent to have repulsed Lothario, as I have done many a time before,\r\nthan to allow him, as I am now doing, to think me unchaste and vile,\r\neven for the short time I must wait until I undeceive him? No doubt it\r\nwould have been better; but I should not be avenged, nor the honour of\r\nmy husband vindicated, should he find so clear and easy an escape from\r\nthe strait into which his depravity has led him. Let the traitor pay\r\nwith his life for the temerity of his wanton wishes, and let the world\r\nknow (if haply it shall ever come to know) that Camilla not only\r\npreserved her allegiance to her husband, but avenged him of the man who\r\ndared to wrong him. Still, I think it might be better to disclose this\r\nto Anselmo. But then I have called his attention to it in the letter I\r\nwrote to him in the country, and, if he did nothing to prevent the\r\nmischief I there pointed out to him, I suppose it was that from pure\r\ngoodness of heart and trustfulness he would not and could not believe\r\nthat any thought against his honour could harbour in the breast of so\r\nstanch a friend; nor indeed did I myself believe it for many days, nor\r\nshould I have ever believed it if his insolence had not gone so far as\r\nto make it manifest by open presents, lavish promises, and ceaseless\r\ntears. But why do I argue thus? Does a bold determination stand in need\r\nof arguments? Surely not. Then traitors avaunt! Vengeance to my aid!\r\nLet the false one come, approach, advance, die, yield up his life, and\r\nthen befall what may. Pure I came to him whom Heaven bestowed upon me,\r\npure I shall leave him; and at the worst bathed in my own chaste blood\r\nand in the foul blood of the falsest friend that friendship ever saw in\r\nthe world;\xe2\x80\x9d and as she uttered these words she paced the room holding\r\nthe unsheathed dagger, with such irregular and disordered steps, and\r\nsuch gestures that one would have supposed her to have lost her senses,\r\nand taken her for some violent desperado instead of a delicate woman.\r\n\r\nAnselmo, hidden behind some tapestries where he had concealed himself,\r\nbeheld and was amazed at all, and already felt that what he had seen\r\nand heard was a sufficient answer to even greater suspicions; and he\r\nwould have been now well pleased if the proof afforded by Lothario\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoming were dispensed with, as he feared some sudden mishap; but as he\r\nwas on the point of showing himself and coming forth to embrace and\r\nundeceive his wife he paused as he saw Leonela returning, leading\r\nLothario. Camilla when she saw him, drawing a long line in front of her\r\non the floor with the dagger, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cLothario, pay attention to\r\nwhat I say to thee: if by any chance thou darest to cross this line\r\nthou seest, or even approach it, the instant I see thee attempt it that\r\nsame instant will I pierce my bosom with this dagger that I hold in my\r\nhand; and before thou answerest me a word desire thee to listen to a\r\nfew from me, and afterwards thou shalt reply as may please thee. First,\r\nI desire thee to tell me, Lothario, if thou knowest my husband Anselmo,\r\nand in what light thou regardest him; and secondly I desire to know if\r\nthou knowest me too. Answer me this, without embarrassment or\r\nreflecting deeply what thou wilt answer, for they are no riddles I put\r\nto thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLothario was not so dull but that from the first moment when Camilla\r\ndirected him to make Anselmo hide himself he understood what she\r\nintended to do, and therefore he fell in with her idea so readily and\r\npromptly that between them they made the imposture look more true than\r\ntruth; so he answered her thus: \xe2\x80\x9cI did not think, fair Camilla, that\r\nthou wert calling me to ask questions so remote from the object with\r\nwhich I come; but if it is to defer the promised reward thou art doing\r\nso, thou mightst have put it off still longer, for the longing for\r\nhappiness gives the more distress the nearer comes the hope of gaining\r\nit; but lest thou shouldst say that I do not answer thy questions, I\r\nsay that I know thy husband Anselmo, and that we have known each other\r\nfrom our earliest years; I will not speak of what thou too knowest, of\r\nour friendship, that I may not compel myself to testify against the\r\nwrong that love, the mighty excuse for greater errors, makes me inflict\r\nupon him. Thee I know and hold in the same estimation as he does, for\r\nwere it not so I had not for a lesser prize acted in opposition to what\r\nI owe to my station and the holy laws of true friendship, now broken\r\nand violated by me through that powerful enemy, love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou dost confess that,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Camilla, \xe2\x80\x9cmortal enemy of all\r\nthat rightly deserves to be loved, with what face dost thou dare to\r\ncome before one whom thou knowest to be the mirror wherein he is\r\nreflected on whom thou shouldst look to see how unworthily thou\r\nwrongest him? But, woe is me, I now comprehend what has made thee give\r\nso little heed to what thou owest to thyself; it must have been some\r\nfreedom of mine, for I will not call it immodesty, as it did not\r\nproceed from any deliberate intention, but from some heedlessness such\r\nas women are guilty of through inadvertence when they think they have\r\nno occasion for reserve. But tell me, traitor, when did I by word or\r\nsign give a reply to thy prayers that could awaken in thee a shadow of\r\nhope of attaining thy base wishes? When were not thy professions of\r\nlove sternly and scornfully rejected and rebuked? When were thy\r\nfrequent pledges and still more frequent gifts believed or accepted?\r\nBut as I am persuaded that no one can long persevere in the attempt to\r\nwin love unsustained by some hope, I am willing to attribute to myself\r\nthe blame of thy assurance, for no doubt some thoughtlessness of mine\r\nhas all this time fostered thy hopes; and therefore will I punish\r\nmyself and inflict upon myself the penalty thy guilt deserves. And that\r\nthou mayest see that being so relentless to myself I cannot possibly be\r\notherwise to thee, I have summoned thee to be a witness of the\r\nsacrifice I mean to offer to the injured honour of my honoured husband,\r\nwronged by thee with all the assiduity thou wert capable of, and by me\r\ntoo through want of caution in avoiding every occasion, if I have given\r\nany, of encouraging and sanctioning thy base designs. Once more I say\r\nthe suspicion in my mind that some imprudence of mine has engendered\r\nthese lawless thoughts in thee, is what causes me most distress and\r\nwhat I desire most to punish with my own hands, for were any other\r\ninstrument of punishment employed my error might become perhaps more\r\nwidely known; but before I do so, in my death I mean to inflict death,\r\nand take with me one that will fully satisfy my longing for the revenge\r\nI hope for and have; for I shall see, wheresoever it may be that I go,\r\nthe penalty awarded by inflexible, unswerving justice on him who has\r\nplaced me in a position so desperate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she uttered these words, with incredible energy and swiftness she\r\nflew upon Lothario with the naked dagger, so manifestly bent on burying\r\nit in his breast that he was almost uncertain whether these\r\ndemonstrations were real or feigned, for he was obliged to have\r\nrecourse to all his skill and strength to prevent her from striking\r\nhim; and with such reality did she act this strange farce and\r\nmystification that, to give it a colour of truth, she determined to\r\nstain it with her own blood; for perceiving, or pretending, that she\r\ncould not wound Lothario, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cFate, it seems, will not grant my\r\njust desire complete satisfaction, but it will not be able to keep me\r\nfrom satisfying it partially at least;\xe2\x80\x9d and making an effort to free\r\nthe hand with the dagger which Lothario held in his grasp, she released\r\nit, and directing the point to a place where it could not inflict a\r\ndeep wound, she plunged it into her left side high up close to the\r\nshoulder, and then allowed herself to fall to the ground as if in a\r\nfaint.\r\n\r\nLeonela and Lothario stood amazed and astounded at the catastrophe, and\r\nseeing Camilla stretched on the ground and bathed in her blood they\r\nwere still uncertain as to the true nature of the act. Lothario,\r\nterrified and breathless, ran in haste to pluck out the dagger; but\r\nwhen he saw how slight the wound was he was relieved of his fears and\r\nonce more admired the subtlety, coolness, and ready wit of the fair\r\nCamilla; and the better to support the part he had to play he began to\r\nutter profuse and doleful lamentations over her body as if she were\r\ndead, invoking maledictions not only on himself but also on him who had\r\nbeen the means of placing him in such a position: and knowing that his\r\nfriend Anselmo heard him he spoke in such a way as to make a listener\r\nfeel much more pity for him than for Camilla, even though he supposed\r\nher dead. Leonela took her up in her arms and laid her on the bed,\r\nentreating Lothario to go in quest of someone to attend to her wound in\r\nsecret, and at the same time asking his advice and opinion as to what\r\nthey should say to Anselmo about his lady\xe2\x80\x99s wound if he should chance\r\nto return before it was healed. He replied they might say what they\r\nliked, for he was not in a state to give advice that would be of any\r\nuse; all he could tell her was to try and stanch the blood, as he was\r\ngoing where he should never more be seen; and with every appearance of\r\ndeep grief and sorrow he left the house; but when he found himself\r\nalone, and where there was nobody to see him, he crossed himself\r\nunceasingly, lost in wonder at the adroitness of Camilla and the\r\nconsistent acting of Leonela. He reflected how convinced Anselmo would\r\nbe that he had a second Portia for a wife, and he looked forward\r\nanxiously to meeting him in order to rejoice together over falsehood\r\nand truth the most craftily veiled that could be imagined.\r\n\r\nLeonela, as he told her, stanched her lady\xe2\x80\x99s blood, which was no more\r\nthan sufficed to support her deception; and washing the wound with a\r\nlittle wine she bound it up to the best of her skill, talking all the\r\ntime she was tending her in a strain that, even if nothing else had\r\nbeen said before, would have been enough to assure Anselmo that he had\r\nin Camilla a model of purity. To Leonela\xe2\x80\x99s words Camilla added her own,\r\ncalling herself cowardly and wanting in spirit, since she had not\r\nenough at the time she had most need of it to rid herself of the life\r\nshe so much loathed. She asked her attendant\xe2\x80\x99s advice as to whether or\r\nnot she ought to inform her beloved husband of all that had happened,\r\nbut the other bade her say nothing about it, as she would lay upon him\r\nthe obligation of taking vengeance on Lothario, which he could not do\r\nbut at great risk to himself; and it was the duty of a true wife not to\r\ngive her husband provocation to quarrel, but, on the contrary, to\r\nremove it as far as possible from him.\r\n\r\nCamilla replied that she believed she was right and that she would\r\nfollow her advice, but at any rate it would be well to consider how she\r\nwas to explain the wound to Anselmo, for he could not help seeing it;\r\nto which Leonela answered that she did not know how to tell a lie even\r\nin jest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow then can I know, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Camilla, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I should not dare to\r\nforge or keep up a falsehood if my life depended on it. If we can think\r\nof no escape from this difficulty, it will be better to tell him the\r\nplain truth than that he should find us out in an untrue story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe not uneasy, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Leonela; \xe2\x80\x9cbetween this and to-morrow I\r\nwill think of what we must say to him, and perhaps the wound being\r\nwhere it is it can be hidden from his sight, and Heaven will be pleased\r\nto aid us in a purpose so good and honourable. Compose yourself,\r\nse\xc3\xb1ora, and endeavour to calm your excitement lest my lord find you\r\nagitated; and leave the rest to my care and God\xe2\x80\x99s, who always supports\r\ngood intentions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnselmo had with the deepest attention listened to and seen played out\r\nthe tragedy of the death of his honour, which the performers acted with\r\nsuch wonderfully effective truth that it seemed as if they had become\r\nthe realities of the parts they played. He longed for night and an\r\nopportunity of escaping from the house to go and see his good friend\r\nLothario, and with him give vent to his joy over the precious pearl he\r\nhad gained in having established his wife\xe2\x80\x99s purity. Both mistress and\r\nmaid took care to give him time and opportunity to get away, and taking\r\nadvantage of it he made his escape, and at once went in quest of\r\nLothario, and it would be impossible to describe how he embraced him\r\nwhen he found him, and the things he said to him in the joy of his\r\nheart, and the praises he bestowed upon Camilla; all which Lothario\r\nlistened to without being able to show any pleasure, for he could not\r\nforget how deceived his friend was, and how dishonourably he had\r\nwronged him; and though Anselmo could see that Lothario was not glad,\r\nstill he imagined it was only because he had left Camilla wounded and\r\nhad been himself the cause of it; and so among other things he told him\r\nnot to be distressed about Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s accident, for, as they had agreed\r\nto hide it from him, the wound was evidently trifling; and that being\r\nso, he had no cause for fear, but should henceforward be of good cheer\r\nand rejoice with him, seeing that by his means and adroitness he found\r\nhimself raised to the greatest height of happiness that he could have\r\nventured to hope for, and desired no better pastime than making verses\r\nin praise of Camilla that would preserve her name for all time to come.\r\nLothario commended his purpose, and promised on his own part to aid him\r\nin raising a monument so glorious.\r\n\r\nAnd so Anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could\r\nbe in the world. He himself, persuaded he was conducting the instrument\r\nof his glory, led home by the hand of him who had been the utter\r\ndestruction of his good name; whom Camilla received with averted\r\ncountenance, though with smiles in her heart. The deception was carried\r\non for some time, until at the end of a few months Fortune turned her\r\nwheel and the guilt which had been until then so skilfully concealed\r\nwas published abroad, and Anselmo paid with his life the penalty of his\r\nill-advised curiosity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF THE HEROIC AND PRODIGIOUS BATTLE DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH\r\nCERTAIN SKINS OF RED WINE, AND BRINGS THE NOVEL OF \xe2\x80\x9cTHE ILL-ADVISED\r\nCURIOSITY\xe2\x80\x9d TO A CLOSE\r\n\r\nThere remained but little more of the novel to be read, when Sancho\r\nPanza burst forth in wild excitement from the garret where Don Quixote\r\nwas lying, shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cRun, sirs! quick; and help my master, who is in\r\nthe thick of the toughest and stiffest battle I ever laid eyes on. By\r\nthe living God he has given the giant, the enemy of my lady the\r\nPrincess Micomicona, such a slash that he has sliced his head clean off\r\nas if it were a turnip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, pausing as he\r\nwas about to read the remainder of the novel. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you in your senses,\r\nSancho? How the devil can it be as you say, when the giant is two\r\nthousand leagues away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere they heard a loud noise in the chamber, and Don Quixote shouting\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cStand, thief, brigand, villain; now I have got thee, and thy\r\nscimitar shall not avail thee!\xe2\x80\x9d And then it seemed as though he were\r\nslashing vigorously at the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stop to listen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut go in and part them or help\r\nmy master: though there is no need of that now, for no doubt the giant\r\nis dead by this time and giving account to God of his past wicked life;\r\nfor I saw the blood flowing on the ground, and the head cut off and\r\nfallen on one side, and it is as big as a large wine-skin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I die,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord at this, \xe2\x80\x9cif Don Quixote or Don Devil\r\nhas not been slashing some of the skins of red wine that stand full at\r\nhis bed\xe2\x80\x99s head, and the spilt wine must be what this good fellow takes\r\nfor blood;\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying he went into the room and the rest after him,\r\nand there they found Don Quixote in the strangest costume in the world.\r\nHe was in his shirt, which was not long enough in front to cover his\r\nthighs completely and was six fingers shorter behind; his legs were\r\nvery long and lean, covered with hair, and anything but clean; on his\r\nhead he had a little greasy red cap that belonged to the host, round\r\nhis left arm he had rolled the blanket of the bed, to which Sancho, for\r\nreasons best known to himself, owed a grudge, and in his right hand he\r\nheld his unsheathed sword, with which he was slashing about on all\r\nsides, uttering exclamations as if he were actually fighting some\r\ngiant: and the best of it was his eyes were not open, for he was fast\r\nasleep, and dreaming that he was doing battle with the giant. For his\r\nimagination was so wrought upon by the adventure he was going to\r\naccomplish, that it made him dream he had already reached the kingdom\r\nof Micomicon, and was engaged in combat with his enemy; and believing\r\nhe was laying on the giant, he had given so many sword cuts to the\r\nskins that the whole room was full of wine. On seeing this the landlord\r\nwas so enraged that he fell on Don Quixote, and with his clenched fist\r\nbegan to pummel him in such a way, that if Cardenio and the curate had\r\nnot dragged him off, he would have brought the war of the giant to an\r\nend. But in spite of all the poor gentleman never woke until the barber\r\nbrought a great pot of cold water from the well and flung it with one\r\ndash all over his body, on which Don Quixote woke up, but not so\r\ncompletely as to understand what was the matter. Dorothea, seeing how\r\nshort and slight his attire was, would not go in to witness the battle\r\nbetween her champion and her opponent. As for Sancho, he went searching\r\nall over the floor for the head of the giant, and not finding it he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI see now that it\xe2\x80\x99s all enchantment in this house; for the last\r\ntime, on this very spot where I am now, I got ever so many thumps\r\nwithout knowing who gave them to me, or being able to see anybody; and\r\nnow this head is not to be seen anywhere about, though I saw it cut off\r\nwith my own eyes and the blood running from the body as if from a\r\nfountain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat blood and fountains are you talking about, enemy of God and his\r\nsaints?\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see, you thief, that the blood\r\nand the fountain are only these skins here that have been stabbed and\r\nthe red wine swimming all over the room?\xe2\x80\x94and I wish I saw the soul of\r\nhim that stabbed them swimming in hell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9call I know is it will be my\r\nbad luck that through not finding this head my county will melt away\r\nlike salt in water;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for Sancho awake was worse than his master asleep,\r\nso much had his master\xe2\x80\x99s promises addled his wits.\r\n\r\nThe landlord was beside himself at the coolness of the squire and the\r\nmischievous doings of the master, and swore it should not be like the\r\nlast time when they went without paying; and that their privileges of\r\nchivalry should not hold good this time to let one or other of them off\r\nwithout paying, even to the cost of the plugs that would have to be put\r\nto the damaged wine-skins. The curate was holding Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s hands,\r\nwho, fancying he had now ended the adventure and was in the presence of\r\nthe Princess Micomicona, knelt before the curate and said, \xe2\x80\x9cExalted and\r\nbeauteous lady, your highness may live from this day forth fearless of\r\nany harm this base being could do you; and I too from this day forth am\r\nreleased from the promise I gave you, since by the help of God on high\r\nand by the favour of her by whom I live and breathe, I have fulfilled\r\nit so successfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid not I say so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho on hearing this. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndrunk; there you see my master has already salted the giant; there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ndoubt about the bulls; my county is all right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWho could have helped laughing at the absurdities of the pair, master\r\nand man? And laugh they did, all except the landlord, who cursed\r\nhimself; but at length the barber, Cardenio, and the curate contrived\r\nwith no small trouble to get Don Quixote on the bed, and he fell asleep\r\nwith every appearance of excessive weariness. They left him to sleep,\r\nand came out to the gate of the inn to console Sancho Panza on not\r\nhaving found the head of the giant; but much more work had they to\r\nappease the landlord, who was furious at the sudden death of his\r\nwine-skins; and said the landlady half scolding, half crying, \xe2\x80\x9cAt an\r\nevil moment and in an unlucky hour he came into my house, this\r\nknight-errant\xe2\x80\x94would that I had never set eyes on him, for dear he has\r\ncost me; the last time he went off with the overnight score against him\r\nfor supper, bed, straw, and barley, for himself and his squire and a\r\nhack and an ass, saying he was a knight adventurer\xe2\x80\x94God send unlucky\r\nadventures to him and all the adventurers in the world\xe2\x80\x94and therefore\r\nnot bound to pay anything, for it was so settled by the knight-errantry\r\ntariff: and then, all because of him, came the other gentleman and\r\ncarried off my tail, and gives it back more than two cuartillos the\r\nworse, all stripped of its hair, so that it is no use for my husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npurpose; and then, for a finishing touch to all, to burst my wine-skins\r\nand spill my wine! I wish I saw his own blood spilt! But let him not\r\ndeceive himself, for, by the bones of my father and the shade of my\r\nmother, they shall pay me down every quarts; or my name is not what it\r\nis, and I am not my father\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d All this and more to the same\r\neffect the landlady delivered with great irritation, and her good maid\r\nMaritornes backed her up, while the daughter held her peace and smiled\r\nfrom time to time. The curate smoothed matters by promising to make\r\ngood all losses to the best of his power, not only as regarded the\r\nwine-skins but also the wine, and above all the depreciation of the\r\ntail which they set such store by. Dorothea comforted Sancho, telling\r\nhim that she pledged herself, as soon as it should appear certain that\r\nhis master had decapitated the giant, and she found herself peacefully\r\nestablished in her kingdom, to bestow upon him the best county there\r\nwas in it. With this Sancho consoled himself, and assured the princess\r\nshe might rely upon it that he had seen the head of the giant, and more\r\nby token it had a beard that reached to the girdle, and that if it was\r\nnot to be seen now it was because everything that happened in that\r\nhouse went by enchantment, as he himself had proved the last time he\r\nhad lodged there. Dorothea said she fully believed it, and that he need\r\nnot be uneasy, for all would go well and turn out as he wished. All\r\ntherefore being appeased, the curate was anxious to go on with the\r\nnovel, as he saw there was but little more left to read. Dorothea and\r\nthe others begged him to finish it, and he, as he was willing to please\r\nthem, and enjoyed reading it himself, continued the tale in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\nThe result was, that from the confidence Anselmo felt in Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvirtue, he lived happy and free from anxiety, and Camilla purposely\r\nlooked coldly on Lothario, that Anselmo might suppose her feelings\r\ntowards him to be the opposite of what they were; and the better to\r\nsupport the position, Lothario begged to be excused from coming to the\r\nhouse, as the displeasure with which Camilla regarded his presence was\r\nplain to be seen. But the befooled Anselmo said he would on no account\r\nallow such a thing, and so in a thousand ways he became the author of\r\nhis own dishonour, while he believed he was insuring his happiness.\r\nMeanwhile the satisfaction with which Leonela saw herself empowered to\r\ncarry on her amour reached such a height that, regardless of everything\r\nelse, she followed her inclinations unrestrainedly, feeling confident\r\nthat her mistress would screen her, and even show her how to manage it\r\nsafely. At last one night Anselmo heard footsteps in Leonela\xe2\x80\x99s room,\r\nand on trying to enter to see who it was, he found that the door was\r\nheld against him, which made him all the more determined to open it;\r\nand exerting his strength he forced it open, and entered the room in\r\ntime to see a man leaping through the window into the street. He ran\r\nquickly to seize him or discover who he was, but he was unable to\r\neffect either purpose, for Leonela flung her arms round him crying, \xe2\x80\x9cBe\r\ncalm, se\xc3\xb1or; do not give way to passion or follow him who has escaped\r\nfrom this; he belongs to me, and in fact he is my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnselmo would not believe it, but blind with rage drew a dagger and\r\nthreatened to stab Leonela, bidding her tell the truth or he would kill\r\nher. She, in her fear, not knowing what she was saying, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nnot kill me, se\xc3\xb1or, for I can tell you things more important than any\r\nyou can imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me then at once or thou diest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anselmo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be impossible for me now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Leonela, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so agitated:\r\nleave me till to-morrow, and then you shall hear from me what will fill\r\nyou with astonishment; but rest assured that he who leaped through the\r\nwindow is a young man of this city, who has given me his promise to\r\nbecome my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnselmo was appeased with this, and was content to wait the time she\r\nasked of him, for he never expected to hear anything against Camilla,\r\nso satisfied and sure of her virtue was he; and so he quitted the room,\r\nand left Leonela locked in, telling her she should not come out until\r\nshe had told him all she had to make known to him. He went at once to\r\nsee Camilla, and tell her, as he did, all that had passed between him\r\nand her handmaid, and the promise she had given him to inform him\r\nmatters of serious importance.\r\n\r\nThere is no need of saying whether Camilla was agitated or not, for so\r\ngreat was her fear and dismay, that, making sure, as she had good\r\nreason to do, that Leonela would tell Anselmo all she knew of her\r\nfaithlessness, she had not the courage to wait and see if her\r\nsuspicions were confirmed; and that same night, as soon as she thought\r\nthat Anselmo was asleep, she packed up the most valuable jewels she had\r\nand some money, and without being observed by anybody escaped from the\r\nhouse and betook herself to Lothario\xe2\x80\x99s, to whom she related what had\r\noccurred, imploring him to convey her to some place of safety or fly\r\nwith her where they might be safe from Anselmo. The state of perplexity\r\nto which Camilla reduced Lothario was such that he was unable to utter\r\na word in reply, still less to decide upon what he should do. At length\r\nhe resolved to conduct her to a convent of which a sister of his was\r\nprioress; Camilla agreed to this, and with the speed which the\r\ncircumstances demanded, Lothario took her to the convent and left her\r\nthere, and then himself quitted the city without letting anyone know of\r\nhis departure.\r\n\r\nAs soon as daylight came Anselmo, without missing Camilla from his\r\nside, rose eager to learn what Leonela had to tell him, and hastened to\r\nthe room where he had locked her in. He opened the door, entered, but\r\nfound no Leonela; all he found was some sheets knotted to the window, a\r\nplain proof that she had let herself down from it and escaped. He\r\nreturned, uneasy, to tell Camilla, but not finding her in bed or\r\nanywhere in the house he was lost in amazement. He asked the servants\r\nof the house about her, but none of them could give him any\r\nexplanation. As he was going in search of Camilla it happened by chance\r\nthat he observed her boxes were lying open, and that the greater part\r\nof her jewels were gone; and now he became fully aware of his disgrace,\r\nand that Leonela was not the cause of his misfortune; and, just as he\r\nwas, without delaying to dress himself completely, he repaired, sad at\r\nheart and dejected, to his friend Lothario to make known his sorrow to\r\nhim; but when he failed to find him and the servants reported that he\r\nhad been absent from his house all night and had taken with him all the\r\nmoney he had, he felt as though he were losing his senses; and to make\r\nall complete on returning to his own house he found it deserted and\r\nempty, not one of all his servants, male or female, remaining in it. He\r\nknew not what to think, or say, or do, and his reason seemed to be\r\ndeserting him little by little. He reviewed his position, and saw\r\nhimself in a moment left without wife, friend, or servants, abandoned,\r\nhe felt, by the heaven above him, and more than all robbed of his\r\nhonour, for in Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance he saw his own ruin. After long\r\nreflection he resolved at last to go to his friend\xe2\x80\x99s village, where he\r\nhad been staying when he afforded opportunities for the contrivance of\r\nthis complication of misfortune. He locked the doors of his house,\r\nmounted his horse, and with a broken spirit set out on his journey; but\r\nhe had hardly gone half-way when, harassed by his reflections, he had\r\nto dismount and tie his horse to a tree, at the foot of which he threw\r\nhimself, giving vent to piteous heartrending sighs; and there he\r\nremained till nearly nightfall, when he observed a man approaching on\r\nhorseback from the city, of whom, after saluting him, he asked what was\r\nthe news in Florence.\r\n\r\nThe citizen replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThe strangest that have been heard for many a\r\nday; for it is reported abroad that Lothario, the great friend of the\r\nwealthy Anselmo, who lived at San Giovanni, carried off last night\r\nCamilla, the wife of Anselmo, who also has disappeared. All this has\r\nbeen told by a maid-servant of Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s, whom the governor found last\r\nnight lowering herself by a sheet from the windows of Anselmo\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nI know not indeed, precisely, how the affair came to pass; all I know\r\nis that the whole city is wondering at the occurrence, for no one could\r\nhave expected a thing of the kind, seeing the great and intimate\r\nfriendship that existed between them, so great, they say, that they\r\nwere called \xe2\x80\x98The Two Friends.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it known at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anselmo, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat road Lothario and Camilla\r\ntook?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d said the citizen, \xe2\x80\x9cthough the governor has been\r\nvery active in searching for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod speed you, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anselmo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the citizen and went his way.\r\n\r\nThis disastrous intelligence almost robbed Anselmo not only of his\r\nsenses but of his life. He got up as well as he was able and reached\r\nthe house of his friend, who as yet knew nothing of his misfortune, but\r\nseeing him come pale, worn, and haggard, perceived that he was\r\nsuffering some heavy affliction. Anselmo at once begged to be allowed\r\nto retire to rest, and to be given writing materials. His wish was\r\ncomplied with and he was left lying down and alone, for he desired\r\nthis, and even that the door should be locked. Finding himself alone he\r\nso took to heart the thought of his misfortune that by the signs of\r\ndeath he felt within him he knew well his life was drawing to a close,\r\nand therefore he resolved to leave behind him a declaration of the\r\ncause of his strange end. He began to write, but before he had put down\r\nall he meant to say, his breath failed him and he yielded up his life,\r\na victim to the suffering which his ill-advised curiosity had entailed\r\nupon him. The master of the house observing that it was now late and\r\nthat Anselmo did not call, determined to go in and ascertain if his\r\nindisposition was increasing, and found him lying on his face, his body\r\npartly in the bed, partly on the writing-table, on which he lay with\r\nthe written paper open and the pen still in his hand. Having first\r\ncalled to him without receiving any answer, his host approached him,\r\nand taking him by the hand, found that it was cold, and saw that he was\r\ndead. Greatly surprised and distressed he summoned the household to\r\nwitness the sad fate which had befallen Anselmo; and then he read the\r\npaper, the handwriting of which he recognised as his, and which\r\ncontained these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA foolish and ill-advised desire has robbed me of life. If the news of\r\nmy death should reach the ears of Camilla, let her know that I forgive\r\nher, for she was not bound to perform miracles, nor ought I to have\r\nrequired her to perform them; and since I have been the author of my\r\nown dishonour, there is no reason why\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo far Anselmo had written, and thus it was plain that at this point,\r\nbefore he could finish what he had to say, his life came to an end. The\r\nnext day his friend sent intelligence of his death to his relatives,\r\nwho had already ascertained his misfortune, as well as the convent\r\nwhere Camilla lay almost on the point of accompanying her husband on\r\nthat inevitable journey, not on account of the tidings of his death,\r\nbut because of those she received of her lover\xe2\x80\x99s departure. Although\r\nshe saw herself a widow, it is said she refused either to quit the\r\nconvent or take the veil, until, not long afterwards, intelligence\r\nreached her that Lothario had been killed in a battle in which M. de\r\nLautrec had been recently engaged with the Great Captain Gonzalo\r\nFernandez de Cordova in the kingdom of Naples, whither her too late\r\nrepentant lover had repaired. On learning this Camilla took the veil,\r\nand shortly afterwards died, worn out by grief and melancholy. This was\r\nthe end of all three, an end that came of a thoughtless beginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like this novel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I cannot persuade myself of\r\nits truth; and if it has been invented, the author\xe2\x80\x99s invention is\r\nfaulty, for it is impossible to imagine any husband so foolish as to\r\ntry such a costly experiment as Anselmo\xe2\x80\x99s. If it had been represented\r\nas occurring between a gallant and his mistress it might pass; but\r\nbetween husband and wife there is something of an impossibility about\r\nit. As to the way in which the story is told, however, I have no fault\r\nto find.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF MORE CURIOUS INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED AT THE INN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc36a.jpg (124K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust at that instant the landlord, who was standing at the gate of the\r\ninn, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cHere comes a fine troop of guests; if they stop here\r\nwe may say _gaudeamus_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cardenio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour men,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, \xe2\x80\x9criding _\xc3\xa0 la jineta_, with lances and\r\nbucklers, and all with black veils, and with them there is a woman in\r\nwhite on a side-saddle, whose face is also veiled, and two attendants\r\non foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they very near?\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo near,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the landlord, \xe2\x80\x9cthat here they come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing this Dorothea covered her face, and Cardenio retreated into Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s room, and they hardly had time to do so before the whole\r\nparty the host had described entered the inn, and the four that were on\r\nhorseback, who were of highbred appearance and bearing, dismounted, and\r\ncame forward to take down the woman who rode on the side-saddle, and\r\none of them taking her in his arms placed her in a chair that stood at\r\nthe entrance of the room where Cardenio had hidden himself. All this\r\ntime neither she nor they had removed their veils or spoken a word,\r\nonly on sitting down on the chair the woman gave a deep sigh and let\r\nher arms fall like one that was ill and weak. The attendants on foot\r\nthen led the horses away to the stable. Observing this the curate,\r\ncurious to know who these people in such a dress and preserving such\r\nsilence were, went to where the servants were standing and put the\r\nquestion to one of them, who answered him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, sir, I cannot tell you who they are, I only know they seem to\r\nbe people of distinction, particularly he who advanced to take the lady\r\nyou saw in his arms; and I say so because all the rest show him\r\nrespect, and nothing is done except what he directs and orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the lady, who is she?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I cannot tell you either,\xe2\x80\x9d said the servant, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have not seen\r\nher face all the way: I have indeed heard her sigh many times and utter\r\nsuch groans that she seems to be giving up the ghost every time; but it\r\nis no wonder if we do not know more than we have told you, as my\r\ncomrade and I have only been in their company two days, for having met\r\nus on the road they begged and persuaded us to accompany them to\r\nAndalusia, promising to pay us well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you heard any of them called by his name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the servant; \xe2\x80\x9cthey all preserve a marvellous\r\nsilence on the road, for not a sound is to be heard among them except\r\nthe poor lady\xe2\x80\x99s sighs and sobs, which make us pity her; and we feel\r\nsure that wherever it is she is going, it is against her will, and as\r\nfar as one can judge from her dress she is a nun or, what is more\r\nlikely, about to become one; and perhaps it is because taking the vows\r\nis not of her own free will, that she is so unhappy as she seems to\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may well be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, and leaving them he returned to\r\nwhere Dorothea was, who, hearing the veiled lady sigh, moved by natural\r\ncompassion drew near to her and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you suffering from,\r\nse\xc3\xb1ora? If it be anything that women are accustomed and know how to\r\nrelieve, I offer you my services with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this the unhappy lady made no reply; and though Dorothea repeated\r\nher offers more earnestly she still kept silence, until the gentleman\r\nwith the veil, who, the servant said, was obeyed by the rest,\r\napproached and said to Dorothea, \xe2\x80\x9cDo not give yourself the trouble,\r\nse\xc3\xb1ora, of making any offers to that woman, for it is her way to give\r\nno thanks for anything that is done for her; and do not try to make her\r\nanswer unless you want to hear some lie from her lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never told a lie,\xe2\x80\x9d was the immediate reply of her who had been\r\nsilent until now; \xe2\x80\x9con the contrary, it is because I am so truthful and\r\nso ignorant of lying devices that I am now in this miserable condition;\r\nand this I call you yourself to witness, for it is my unstained truth\r\nthat has made you false and a liar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCardenio heard these words clearly and distinctly, being quite close to\r\nthe speaker, for there was only the door of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s room between\r\nthem, and the instant he did so, uttering a loud exclamation he cried,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God! what is this I hear? What voice is this that has reached my\r\nears?\xe2\x80\x9d Startled at the voice the lady turned her head; and not seeing\r\nthe speaker she stood up and attempted to enter the room; observing\r\nwhich the gentleman held her back, preventing her from moving a step.\r\nIn her agitation and sudden movement the silk with which she had\r\ncovered her face fell off and disclosed a countenance of incomparable\r\nand marvellous beauty, but pale and terrified; for she kept turning her\r\neyes, everywhere she could direct her gaze, with an eagerness that made\r\nher look as if she had lost her senses, and so marked that it excited\r\nthe pity of Dorothea and all who beheld her, though they knew not what\r\ncaused it. The gentleman grasped her firmly by the shoulders, and being\r\nso fully occupied with holding her back, he was unable to put a hand to\r\nhis veil which was falling off, as it did at length entirely, and\r\nDorothea, who was holding the lady in her arms, raising her eyes saw\r\nthat he who likewise held her was her husband, Don Fernando. The\r\ninstant she recognised him, with a prolonged plaintive cry drawn from\r\nthe depths of her heart, she fell backwards fainting, and but for the\r\nbarber being close by to catch her in his arms, she would have fallen\r\ncompletely to the ground. The curate at once hastened to uncover her\r\nface and throw water on it, and as he did so Don Fernando, for he it\r\nwas who held the other in his arms, recognised her and stood as if\r\ndeath-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his grasp of\r\nLuscinda, for it was she that was struggling to release herself from\r\nhis hold, having recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he had recognised\r\nher. Cardenio also heard Dorothea\xe2\x80\x99s cry as she fell fainting, and\r\nimagining that it came from his Luscinda burst forth in terror from the\r\nroom, and the first thing he saw was Don Fernando with Luscinda in his\r\narms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three,\r\nLuscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcely\r\nknowing what had happened to them.\r\n\r\nThey gazed at one another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando,\r\nDon Fernando at Cardenio, Cardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda at\r\nCardenio. The first to break silence was Luscinda, who thus addressed\r\nDon Fernando: \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Fernando, for the sake of what you\r\nowe to yourself; if no other reason will induce you, leave me to cling\r\nto the wall of which I am the ivy, to the support from which neither\r\nyour importunities, nor your threats, nor your promises, nor your gifts\r\nhave been able to detach me. See how Heaven, by ways strange and hidden\r\nfrom our sight, has brought me face to face with my true husband; and\r\nwell you know by dear-bought experience that death alone will be able\r\nto efface him from my memory. May this plain declaration, then, lead\r\nyou, as you can do nothing else, to turn your love into rage, your\r\naffection into resentment, and so to take my life; for if I yield it up\r\nin the presence of my beloved husband I count it well bestowed; it may\r\nbe by my death he will be convinced that I kept my faith to him to the\r\nlast moment of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Dorothea had come to herself, and had heard Luscinda\xe2\x80\x99s words,\r\nby means of which she divined who she was; but seeing that Don Fernando\r\ndid not yet release her or reply to her, summoning up her resolution as\r\nwell as she could she rose and knelt at his feet, and with a flood of\r\nbright and touching tears addressed him thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf, my lord, the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thine\r\narms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight thou wouldst have seen\r\nby this time that she who kneels at thy feet is, so long as thou wilt\r\nhave it so, the unhappy and unfortunate Dorothea. I am that lowly\r\npeasant girl whom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst\r\nraise high enough to call herself thine; I am she who in the seclusion\r\nof innocence led a contented life until at the voice of thy\r\nimportunity, and thy true and tender passion, as it seemed, she opened\r\nthe gates of her modesty and surrendered to thee the keys of her\r\nliberty; a gift received by thee but thanklessly, as is clearly shown\r\nby my forced retreat to the place where thou dost find me, and by thy\r\nappearance under the circumstances in which I see thee. Nevertheless, I\r\nwould not have thee suppose that I have come here driven by my shame;\r\nit is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself forgotten by thee that\r\nhave led me. It was thy will to make me thine, and thou didst so follow\r\nthy will, that now, even though thou repentest, thou canst not help\r\nbeing mine. Bethink thee, my lord, the unsurpassable affection I bear\r\nthee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for which thou\r\nwouldst desert me. Thou canst not be the fair Luscinda\xe2\x80\x99s because thou\r\nart mine, nor can she be thine because she is Cardenio\xe2\x80\x99s; and it will\r\nbe easier, remember, to bend thy will to love one who adores thee, than\r\nto lead one to love thee who abhors thee now. Thou didst address\r\nthyself to my simplicity, thou didst lay siege to my virtue, thou wert\r\nnot ignorant of my station, well dost thou know how I yielded wholly to\r\nthy will; there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception, and\r\nif it be so, as it is, and if thou art a Christian as thou art a\r\ngentleman, why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy\r\nat last as thou didst at first? And if thou wilt not have me for what I\r\nam, thy true and lawful wife, at least take and accept me as thy slave,\r\nfor so long as I am thine I will count myself happy and fortunate. Do\r\nnot by deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips in the\r\nstreets; make not the old age of my parents miserable; for the loyal\r\nservices they as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not\r\ndeserving of such a return; and if thou thinkest it will debase thy\r\nblood to mingle it with mine, reflect that there is little or no\r\nnobility in the world that has not travelled the same road, and that in\r\nillustrious lineages it is not the woman\xe2\x80\x99s blood that is of account;\r\nand, moreover, that true nobility consists in virtue, and if thou art\r\nwanting in that, refusing me what in justice thou owest me, then even I\r\nhave higher claims to nobility than thine. To make an end, se\xc3\xb1or, these\r\nare my last words to thee: whether thou wilt, or wilt not, I am thy\r\nwife; witness thy words, which must not and ought not to be false, if\r\nthou dost pride thyself on that for want of which thou scornest me;\r\nwitness the pledge which thou didst give me, and witness Heaven, which\r\nthou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me; and\r\nif all this fail, thy own conscience will not fail to lift up its\r\nsilent voice in the midst of all thy gaiety, and vindicate the truth of\r\nwhat I say and mar thy highest pleasure and enjoyment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this and more the injured Dorothea delivered with such earnest\r\nfeeling and such tears that all present, even those who came with Don\r\nFernando, were constrained to join her in them. Don Fernando listened\r\nto her without replying, until, ceasing to speak, she gave way to such\r\nsobs and sighs that it must have been a heart of brass that was not\r\nsoftened by the sight of so great sorrow. Luscinda stood regarding her\r\nwith no less compassion for her sufferings than admiration for her\r\nintelligence and beauty, and would have gone to her to say some words\r\nof comfort to her, but was prevented by Don Fernando\xe2\x80\x99s grasp which held\r\nher fast. He, overwhelmed with confusion and astonishment, after\r\nregarding Dorothea for some moments with a fixed gaze, opened his arms,\r\nand, releasing Luscinda, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast conquered, fair Dorothea, thou hast conquered, for it is\r\nimpossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many\r\ntruths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLuscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the ground\r\nwhen Don Fernando released her, but Cardenio, who stood near, having\r\nretreated behind Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting fear aside\r\nand regardless of what might happen, ran forward to support her, and\r\nsaid as he clasped her in his arms, \xe2\x80\x9cIf Heaven in its compassion is\r\nwilling to let thee rest at last, mistress of my heart, true, constant,\r\nand fair, nowhere canst thou rest more safely than in these arms that\r\nnow receive thee, and received thee before when fortune permitted me to\r\ncall thee mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words Luscinda looked up at Cardenio, at first beginning to\r\nrecognise him by his voice and then satisfying herself by her eyes that\r\nit was he, and hardly knowing what she did, and heedless of all\r\nconsiderations of decorum, she flung her arms around his neck and\r\npressing her face close to his, said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear lord, you are the\r\ntrue master of this your slave, even though adverse fate interpose\r\nagain, and fresh dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA strange sight was this for Don Fernando and those that stood around,\r\nfilled with surprise at an incident so unlooked for. Dorothea fancied\r\nthat Don Fernando changed colour and looked as though he meant to take\r\nvengeance on Cardenio, for she observed him put his hand to his sword;\r\nand the instant the idea struck her, with wonderful quickness she\r\nclasped him round the knees, and kissing them and holding him so as to\r\nprevent his moving, she said, while her tears continued to flow, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nis it thou wouldst do, my only refuge, in this unforeseen event? Thou\r\nhast thy wife at thy feet, and she whom thou wouldst have for thy wife\r\nis in the arms of her husband: reflect whether it will be right for\r\nthee, whether it will be possible for thee to undo what Heaven has\r\ndone, or whether it will be becoming in thee to seek to raise her to be\r\nthy mate who in spite of every obstacle, and strong in her truth and\r\nconstancy, is before thine eyes, bathing with the tears of love the\r\nface and bosom of her lawful husband. For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake I entreat of thee,\r\nfor thine own I implore thee, let not this open manifestation rouse thy\r\nanger; but rather so calm it as to allow these two lovers to live in\r\npeace and quiet without any interference from thee so long as Heaven\r\npermits them; and in so doing thou wilt prove the generosity of thy\r\nlofty noble spirit, and the world shall see that with thee reason has\r\nmore influence than passion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the time Dorothea was speaking, Cardenio, though he held Luscinda\r\nin his arms, never took his eyes off Don Fernando, determined, if he\r\nsaw him make any hostile movement, to try and defend himself and resist\r\nas best he could all who might assail him, though it should cost him\r\nhis life. But now Don Fernando\xe2\x80\x99s friends, as well as the curate and the\r\nbarber, who had been present all the while, not forgetting the worthy\r\nSancho Panza, ran forward and gathered round Don Fernando, entreating\r\nhim to have regard for the tears of Dorothea, and not suffer her\r\nreasonable hopes to be disappointed, since, as they firmly believed,\r\nwhat she said was but the truth; and bidding him observe that it was\r\nnot, as it might seem, by accident, but by a special disposition of\r\nProvidence that they had all met in a place where no one could have\r\nexpected a meeting. And the curate bade him remember that only death\r\ncould part Luscinda from Cardenio; that even if some sword were to\r\nseparate them they would think their death most happy; and that in a\r\ncase that admitted of no remedy his wisest course was, by conquering\r\nand putting a constraint upon himself, to show a generous mind, and of\r\nhis own accord suffer these two to enjoy the happiness Heaven had\r\ngranted them. He bade him, too, turn his eyes upon the beauty of\r\nDorothea and he would see that few if any could equal much less excel\r\nher; while to that beauty should be added her modesty and the\r\nsurpassing love she bore him. But besides all this, he reminded him\r\nthat if he prided himself on being a gentleman and a Christian, he\r\ncould not do otherwise than keep his plighted word; and that in doing\r\nso he would obey God and meet the approval of all sensible people, who\r\nknow and recognised it to be the privilege of beauty, even in one of\r\nhumble birth, provided virtue accompany it, to be able to raise itself\r\nto the level of any rank, without any slur upon him who places it upon\r\nan equality with himself; and furthermore that when the potent sway of\r\npassion asserts itself, so long as there be no mixture of sin in it, he\r\nis not to be blamed who gives way to it.\r\n\r\nTo be brief, they added to these such other forcible arguments that Don\r\nFernando\xe2\x80\x99s manly heart, being after all nourished by noble blood, was\r\ntouched, and yielded to the truth which, even had he wished it, he\r\ncould not gainsay; and he showed his submission, and acceptance of the\r\ngood advice that had been offered to him, by stooping down and\r\nembracing Dorothea, saying to her, \xe2\x80\x9cRise, dear lady, it is not right\r\nthat what I hold in my heart should be kneeling at my feet; and if\r\nuntil now I have shown no sign of what I own, it may have been by\r\nHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s decree in order that, seeing the constancy with which you love\r\nme, I may learn to value you as you deserve. What I entreat of you is\r\nthat you reproach me not with my transgression and grievous\r\nwrong-doing; for the same cause and force that drove me to make you\r\nmine impelled me to struggle against being yours; and to prove this,\r\nturn and look at the eyes of the now happy Luscinda, and you will see\r\nin them an excuse for all my errors: and as she has found and gained\r\nthe object of her desires, and I have found in you what satisfies all\r\nmy wishes, may she live in peace and contentment as many happy years\r\nwith her Cardenio, as on my knees I pray Heaven to allow me to live\r\nwith my Dorothea;\xe2\x80\x9d and with these words he once more embraced her and\r\npressed his face to hers with so much tenderness that he had to take\r\ngreat heed to keep his tears from completing the proof of his love and\r\nrepentance in the sight of all. Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, and\r\nalmost all the others, for they shed so many tears, some in their own\r\nhappiness, some at that of the others, that one would have supposed a\r\nheavy calamity had fallen upon them all. Even Sancho Panza was weeping;\r\nthough afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that Dorothea was\r\nnot as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he expected such great\r\nfavours. Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and\r\nthen Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don\r\nFernando, returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them in\r\nlanguage so grateful that he knew not how to answer them, and raising\r\nthem up embraced them with every mark of affection and courtesy.\r\n\r\nHe then asked Dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so far\r\nremoved from her own home, and she in a few fitting words told all that\r\nshe had previously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and his\r\ncompanions were so delighted that they wished the story had been\r\nlonger; so charmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When she\r\nhad finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city\r\nafter he had found in Luscinda\xe2\x80\x99s bosom the paper in which she declared\r\nthat she was Cardenio\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and never could be his. He said he meant\r\nto kill her, and would have done so had he not been prevented by her\r\nparents, and that he quitted the house full of rage and shame, and\r\nresolved to avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should\r\noffer. The next day he learned that Luscinda had disappeared from her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house, and that no one could tell whither she had gone.\r\nFinally, at the end of some months he ascertained that she was in a\r\nconvent and meant to remain there all the rest of her life, if she were\r\nnot to share it with Cardenio; and as soon as he had learned this,\r\ntaking these three gentlemen as his companions, he arrived at the place\r\nwhere she was, but avoided speaking to her, fearing that if it were\r\nknown he was there stricter precautions would be taken in the convent;\r\nand watching a time when the porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge was open he left two to\r\nguard the gate, and he and the other entered the convent in quest of\r\nLuscinda, whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one of\r\nthe nuns, and carrying her off without giving her time to resist, they\r\nreached a place with her where they provided themselves with what they\r\nrequired for taking her away; all which they were able to do in\r\ncomplete safety, as the convent was in the country at a considerable\r\ndistance from the city. He added that when Luscinda found herself in\r\nhis power she lost all consciousness, and after returning to herself\r\ndid nothing but weep and sigh without speaking a word; and thus in\r\nsilence and tears they reached that inn, which for him was reaching\r\nheaven where all the mischances of earth are over and at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc36b.jpg (319K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc36e.jpg (36K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nIN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE STORY OF THE FAMOUS PRINCESS MICOMICONA, WITH\r\nOTHER DROLL ADVENTURES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc37a.jpg (159K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo all this Sancho listened with no little sorrow at heart to see how\r\nhis hopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke, and how\r\nthe fair Princess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant\r\ninto Don Fernando, while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totally\r\nunconscious of all that had come to pass. Dorothea was unable to\r\npersuade herself that her present happiness was not all a dream;\r\nCardenio was in a similar state of mind, and Luscinda\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts ran in\r\nthe same direction. Don Fernando gave thanks to Heaven for the favour\r\nshown to him and for having been rescued from the intricate labyrinth\r\nin which he had been brought so near the destruction of his good name\r\nand of his soul; and in short everybody in the inn was full of\r\ncontentment and satisfaction at the happy issue of such a complicated\r\nand hopeless business. The curate as a sensible man made sound\r\nreflections upon the whole affair, and congratulated each upon his good\r\nfortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and good humour\r\nwas the landlady, because of the promise Cardenio and the curate had\r\ngiven her to pay for all the losses and damage she had sustained\r\nthrough Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s means. Sancho, as has been already said, was the\r\nonly one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected; and so with a long\r\nface he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Rueful Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as\r\nyou like, without troubling yourself about killing any giant or\r\nrestoring her kingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settled\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think it was,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have had the most\r\nprodigious and stupendous battle with the giant that I ever remember\r\nhaving had all the days of my life; and with one back-stroke\xe2\x80\x94swish!\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nbrought his head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forth\r\nfrom him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike red wine, your worship had better say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\r\nwould have you know, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know it, that the dead giant is a\r\nhacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine\r\nthat it had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore\r\nme; and the devil take it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou talking about, fool?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cart thou in thy\r\nsenses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet your worship get up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will see the nice\r\nbusiness you have made of it, and what we have to pay; and you will see\r\nthe queen turned into a private lady called Dorothea, and other things\r\nthat will astonish you, if you understand them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be surprised at anything of the kind,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don\r\nQuixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor if thou dost remember the last time we were here I told\r\nthee that everything that happened here was a matter of enchantment,\r\nand it would be no wonder if it were the same now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could believe all that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif my blanketing was the\r\nsame sort of thing also; only it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, but real and genuine; for I\r\nsaw the landlord, who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket\r\nand jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as\r\nmuch laughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing\r\npeople, I hold for my part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is no\r\nenchantment about it at all, but a great deal of bruising and bad\r\nluck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, God will give a remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9chand me my\r\nclothes and let me go out, for I want to see these transformations and\r\nthings thou speakest of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was dressing, the curate\r\ngave Don Fernando and the others present an account of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmadness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from\r\nthat Pena Pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s scorn. He described to them also nearly all the adventures that\r\nSancho had mentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a little,\r\nthinking it, as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazy\r\nintellect could be capable of. But now, the curate said, that the lady\r\nDorothea\xe2\x80\x99s good fortune prevented her from proceeding with their\r\npurpose, it would be necessary to devise or discover some other way of\r\ngetting him home.\r\n\r\nCardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun, and suggested\r\nthat Luscinda would act and support Dorothea\xe2\x80\x99s part sufficiently well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Fernando, \xe2\x80\x9cthat must not be, for I want Dorothea to\r\nfollow out this idea of hers; and if the worthy gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s village is\r\nnot very far off, I shall be happy if I can do anything for his\r\nrelief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not more than two days\xe2\x80\x99 journey from this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven if it were more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Fernando, \xe2\x80\x9cI would gladly travel so\r\nfar for the sake of doing so good a work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhelmet, all dinted as it was, on his head, his buckler on his arm, and\r\nleaning on his staff or pike. The strange figure he presented filled\r\nDon Fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean\r\nyellow face half a league long, his armour of all sorts, and the\r\nsolemnity of his deportment. They stood silent waiting to see what he\r\nwould say, and he, fixing his eyes on the fair Dorothea, addressed her\r\nwith great gravity and composure:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am informed, fair lady, by my squire here that your greatness has\r\nbeen annihilated and your being abolished, since, from a queen and lady\r\nof high degree as you used to be, you have been turned into a private\r\nmaiden. If this has been done by the command of the magician king your\r\nfather, through fear that I should not afford you the aid you need and\r\nare entitled to, I may tell you he did not know and does not know half\r\nthe mass, and was little versed in the annals of chivalry; for, if he\r\nhad read and gone through them as attentively and deliberately as I\r\nhave, he would have found at every turn that knights of less renown\r\nthan mine have accomplished things more difficult: it is no great\r\nmatter to kill a whelp of a giant, however arrogant he may be; for it\r\nis not many hours since I myself was engaged with one, and\xe2\x80\x94I will not\r\nspeak of it, that they may not say I am lying; time, however, that\r\nreveals all, will tell the tale when we least expect it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were engaged with a couple of wine-skins, and not a giant,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe landlord at this; but Don Fernando told him to hold his tongue and\r\non no account interrupt Don Quixote, who continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI say in\r\nconclusion, high and disinherited lady, that if your father has brought\r\nabout this metamorphosis in your person for the reason I have\r\nmentioned, you ought not to attach any importance to it; for there is\r\nno peril on earth through which my sword will not force a way, and with\r\nit, before many days are over, I will bring your enemy\xe2\x80\x99s head to the\r\nground and place on yours the crown of your kingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote said no more, and waited for the reply of the princess, who\r\naware of Don Fernando\xe2\x80\x99s determination to carry on the deception until\r\nDon Quixote had been conveyed to his home, with great ease of manner\r\nand gravity made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever told you, valiant Knight of the\r\nRueful Countenance, that I had undergone any change or transformation\r\ndid not tell you the truth, for I am the same as I was yesterday. It is\r\ntrue that certain strokes of good fortune, that have given me more than\r\nI could have hoped for, have made some alteration in me; but I have not\r\ntherefore ceased to be what I was before, or to entertain the same\r\ndesire I have had all through of availing myself of the might of your\r\nvaliant and invincible arm. And so, se\xc3\xb1or, let your goodness reinstate\r\nthe father that begot me in your good opinion, and be assured that he\r\nwas a wise and prudent man, since by his craft he found out such a sure\r\nand easy way of remedying my misfortune; for I believe, se\xc3\xb1or, that had\r\nit not been for you I should never have lit upon the good fortune I now\r\npossess; and in this I am saying what is perfectly true; as most of\r\nthese gentlemen who are present can fully testify. All that remains is\r\nto set out on our journey to-morrow, for to-day we could not make much\r\nway; and for the rest of the happy result I am looking forward to, I\r\ntrust to God and the valour of your heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo said the sprightly Dorothea, and on hearing her Don Quixote turned\r\nto Sancho, and said to him, with an angry air, \xe2\x80\x9cI declare now, little\r\nSancho, thou art the greatest little villain in Spain. Say, thief and\r\nvagabond, hast thou not just now told me that this princess had been\r\nturned into a maiden called Dorothea, and that the head which I am\r\npersuaded I cut off from a giant was the bitch that bore thee, and\r\nother nonsense that put me in the greatest perplexity I have ever been\r\nin all my life? I vow\xe2\x80\x9d (and here he looked to heaven and ground his\r\nteeth) \xe2\x80\x9cI have a mind to play the mischief with thee, in a way that\r\nwill teach sense for the future to all lying squires of knights-errant\r\nin the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet your worship be calm, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it may well be\r\nthat I have been mistaken as to the change of the lady princess\r\nMicomicona; but as to the giant\xe2\x80\x99s head, or at least as to the piercing\r\nof the wine-skins, and the blood being red wine, I make no mistake, as\r\nsure as there is a God; because the wounded skins are there at the head\r\nof your worship\xe2\x80\x99s bed, and the wine has made a lake of the room; if not\r\nyou will see when the eggs come to be fried; I mean when his worship\r\nthe landlord calls for all the damages: for the rest, I am heartily\r\nglad that her ladyship the queen is as she was, for it concerns me as\r\nmuch as anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell thee again, Sancho, thou art a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cforgive me, and that will do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Fernando; \xe2\x80\x9clet us say no more about it; and as\r\nher ladyship the princess proposes to set out to-morrow because it is\r\ntoo late to-day, so be it, and we will pass the night in pleasant\r\nconversation, and to-morrow we will all accompany Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote;\r\nfor we wish to witness the valiant and unparalleled achievements he is\r\nabout to perform in the course of this mighty enterprise which he has\r\nundertaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I who shall wait upon and accompany you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI am much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon me, and the\r\ngood opinion entertained of me, which I shall strive to justify or it\r\nshall cost me my life, or even more, if it can possibly cost me more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMany were the compliments and expressions of politeness that passed\r\nbetween Don Quixote and Don Fernando; but they were brought to an end\r\nby a traveller who at this moment entered the inn, and who seemed from\r\nhis attire to be a Christian lately come from the country of the Moors,\r\nfor he was dressed in a short-skirted coat of blue cloth with\r\nhalf-sleeves and without a collar; his breeches were also of blue\r\ncloth, and his cap of the same colour, and he wore yellow buskins and\r\nhad a Moorish cutlass slung from a baldric across his breast. Behind\r\nhim, mounted upon an ass, there came a woman dressed in Moorish\r\nfashion, with her face veiled and a scarf on her head, and wearing a\r\nlittle brocaded cap, and a mantle that covered her from her shoulders\r\nto her feet. The man was of a robust and well-proportioned frame, in\r\nage a little over forty, rather swarthy in complexion, with long\r\nmoustaches and a full beard, and, in short, his appearance was such\r\nthat if he had been well dressed he would have been taken for a person\r\nof quality and good birth. On entering he asked for a room, and when\r\nthey told him there was none in the inn he seemed distressed, and\r\napproaching her who by her dress seemed to be a Moor, he took her down\r\nfrom the saddle in his arms. Luscinda, Dorothea, the landlady, her\r\ndaughter and Maritornes, attracted by the strange, and to them entirely\r\nnew costume, gathered round her; and Dorothea, who was always kindly,\r\ncourteous, and quick-witted, perceiving that both she and the man who\r\nhad brought her were annoyed at not finding a room, said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nnot be put out, se\xc3\xb1ora, by the discomfort and want of luxuries here,\r\nfor it is the way of road-side inns to be without them; still, if you\r\nwill be pleased to share our lodging with us (pointing to Luscinda)\r\nperhaps you will have found worse accommodation in the course of your\r\njourney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this the veiled lady made no reply; all she did was to rise from her\r\nseat, crossing her hands upon her bosom, bowing her head and bending\r\nher body as a sign that she returned thanks. From her silence they\r\nconcluded that she must be a Moor and unable to speak a Christian\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the captive came up, having been until now otherwise\r\nengaged, and seeing that they all stood round his companion and that\r\nshe made no reply to what they addressed to her, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cLadies, this\r\ndamsel hardly understands my language and can speak none but that of\r\nher own country, for which reason she does not and cannot answer what\r\nhas been asked of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing has been asked of her,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Luscinda; \xe2\x80\x9cshe has only been\r\noffered our company for this evening and a share of the quarters we\r\noccupy, where she shall be made as comfortable as the circumstances\r\nallow, with the good-will we are bound to show all strangers that stand\r\nin need of it, especially if it be a woman to whom the service is\r\nrendered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn her part and my own, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captive, \xe2\x80\x9cI kiss your\r\nhands, and I esteem highly, as I ought, the favour you have offered,\r\nwhich, on such an occasion and coming from persons of your appearance,\r\nis, it is plain to see, a very great one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorothea, \xe2\x80\x9cis this lady a Christian or a Moor?\r\nfor her dress and her silence lead us to imagine that she is what we\r\ncould wish she was not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn dress and outwardly,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is a Moor, but at heart she is\r\na thoroughly good Christian, for she has the greatest desire to become\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she has not been baptised?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Luscinda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has been no opportunity for that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captive, \xe2\x80\x9csince\r\nshe left Algiers, her native country and home; and up to the present\r\nshe has not found herself in any such imminent danger of death as to\r\nmake it necessary to baptise her before she has been instructed in all\r\nthe ceremonies our holy mother Church ordains; but, please God, ere\r\nlong she shall be baptised with the solemnity befitting her which is\r\nhigher than her dress or mine indicates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy these words he excited a desire in all who heard him, to know who\r\nthe Moorish lady and the captive were, but no one liked to ask just\r\nthen, seeing that it was a fitter moment for helping them to rest\r\nthemselves than for questioning them about their lives. Dorothea took\r\nthe Moorish lady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself,\r\nrequested her to remove her veil. She looked at the captive as if to\r\nask him what they meant and what she was to do. He said to her in\r\nArabic that they asked her to take off her veil, and thereupon she\r\nremoved it and disclosed a countenance so lovely, that to Dorothea she\r\nseemed more beautiful than Luscinda, and to Luscinda more beautiful\r\nthan Dorothea, and all the bystanders felt that if any beauty could\r\ncompare with theirs it was the Moorish lady\xe2\x80\x99s, and there were even\r\nthose who were inclined to give it somewhat the preference. And as it\r\nis the privilege and charm of beauty to win the heart and secure\r\ngood-will, all forthwith became eager to show kindness and attention to\r\nthe lovely Moor.\r\n\r\nDon Fernando asked the captive what her name was, and he replied that\r\nit was Lela Zoraida; but the instant she heard him, she guessed what\r\nthe Christian had asked, and said hastily, with some displeasure and\r\nenergy, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!\xe2\x80\x9d giving them to understand that\r\nshe was called \xe2\x80\x9cMaria\xe2\x80\x9d and not \xe2\x80\x9cZoraida.\xe2\x80\x9d These words, and the touching\r\nearnestness with which she uttered them, drew more than one tear from\r\nsome of the listeners, particularly the women, who are by nature\r\ntender-hearted and compassionate. Luscinda embraced her affectionately,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, Maria, Maria,\xe2\x80\x9d to which the Moor replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\r\nMaria; Zoraida macange,\xe2\x80\x9d which means \xe2\x80\x9cnot Zoraida.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNight was now approaching, and by the orders of those who accompanied\r\nDon Fernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them\r\nthe best supper that was in his power. The hour therefore having\r\narrived they all took their seats at a long table like a refectory one,\r\nfor round or square table there was none in the inn, and the seat of\r\nhonour at the head of it, though he was for refusing it, they assigned\r\nto Don Quixote, who desired the lady Micomicona to place herself by his\r\nside, as he was her protector. Luscinda and Zoraida took their places\r\nnext her, opposite to them were Don Fernando and Cardenio, and next the\r\ncaptive and the other gentlemen, and by the side of the ladies, the\r\ncurate and the barber. And so they supped in high enjoyment, which was\r\nincreased when they observed Don Quixote leave off eating, and, moved\r\nby an impulse like that which made him deliver himself at such length\r\nwhen he supped with the goatherds, begin to address them:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerily, gentlemen, if we reflect upon it, great and marvellous are the\r\nthings they see, who make profession of the order of knight-errantry.\r\nSay, what being is there in this world, who entering the gate of this\r\ncastle at this moment, and seeing us as we are here, would suppose or\r\nimagine us to be what we are? Who would say that this lady who is\r\nbeside me was the great queen that we all know her to be, or that I am\r\nthat Knight of the Rueful Countenance, trumpeted far and wide by the\r\nmouth of Fame? Now, there can be no doubt that this art and calling\r\nsurpasses all those that mankind has invented, and is the more\r\ndeserving of being held in honour in proportion as it is the more\r\nexposed to peril. Away with those who assert that letters have the\r\npreeminence over arms; I will tell them, whosoever they may be, that\r\nthey know not what they say. For the reason which such persons commonly\r\nassign, and upon which they chiefly rest, is, that the labours of the\r\nmind are greater than those of the body, and that arms give employment\r\nto the body alone; as if the calling were a porter\xe2\x80\x99s trade, for which\r\nnothing more is required than sturdy strength; or as if, in what we who\r\nprofess them call arms, there were not included acts of vigour for the\r\nexecution of which high intelligence is requisite; or as if the soul of\r\nthe warrior, when he has an army, or the defence of a city under his\r\ncare, did not exert itself as much by mind as by body. Nay; see whether\r\nby bodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of\r\nthe enemy, his plans, stratagems, or obstacles, or to ward off\r\nimpending mischief; for all these are the work of the mind, and in them\r\nthe body has no share whatever. Since, therefore, arms have need of the\r\nmind, as much as letters, let us see now which of the two minds, that\r\nof the man of letters or that of the warrior, has most to do; and this\r\nwill be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain; for that\r\npurpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler object.\r\nThe end and goal of letters\xe2\x80\x94I am not speaking now of divine letters,\r\nthe aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an\r\nend so infinite no other can be compared\xe2\x80\x94I speak of human letters, the\r\nend of which is to establish distributive justice, give to every man\r\nthat which is his, and see and take care that good laws are observed:\r\nan end undoubtedly noble, lofty, and deserving of high praise, but not\r\nsuch as should be given to that sought by arms, which have for their\r\nend and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in this\r\nlife. The first good news the world and mankind received was that which\r\nthe angels announced on the night that was our day, when they sang in\r\nthe air, \xe2\x80\x98Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of\r\ngood-will;\xe2\x80\x99 and the salutation which the great Master of heaven and\r\nearth taught his disciples and chosen followers when they entered any\r\nhouse, was to say, \xe2\x80\x98Peace be on this house;\xe2\x80\x99 and many other times he\r\nsaid to them, \xe2\x80\x98My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave you, peace be\r\nwith you;\xe2\x80\x99 a jewel and a precious gift given and left by such a hand: a\r\njewel without which there can be no happiness either on earth or in\r\nheaven. This peace is the true end of war; and war is only another name\r\nfor arms. This, then, being admitted, that the end of war is peace, and\r\nthat so far it has the advantage of the end of letters, let us turn to\r\nthe bodily labours of the man of letters, and those of him who follows\r\nthe profession of arms, and see which are the greater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and in such\r\ncorrect language, that for the time being he made it impossible for any\r\nof his hearers to consider him a madman; on the contrary, as they were\r\nmostly gentlemen, to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth, they\r\nlistened to him with great pleasure as he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cHere, then, I say\r\nis what the student has to undergo; first of all poverty: not that all\r\nare poor, but to put the case as strongly as possible: and when I have\r\nsaid that he endures poverty, I think nothing more need be said about\r\nhis hard fortune, for he who is poor has no share of the good things of\r\nlife. This poverty he suffers from in various ways, hunger, or cold, or\r\nnakedness, or all together; but for all that it is not so extreme but\r\nthat he gets something to eat, though it may be at somewhat\r\nunseasonable hours and from the leavings of the rich; for the greatest\r\nmisery of the student is what they themselves call \xe2\x80\x98going out for\r\nsoup,\xe2\x80\x99 and there is always some neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s brazier or hearth for them,\r\nwhich, if it does not warm, at least tempers the cold to them, and\r\nlastly, they sleep comfortably at night under a roof. I will not go\r\ninto other particulars, as for example want of shirts, and no\r\nsuperabundance of shoes, thin and threadbare garments, and gorging\r\nthemselves to surfeit in their voracity when good luck has treated them\r\nto a banquet of some sort. By this road that I have described, rough\r\nand hard, stumbling here, falling there, getting up again to fall\r\nagain, they reach the rank they desire, and that once attained, we have\r\nseen many who have passed these Syrtes and Scyllas and Charybdises, as\r\nif borne flying on the wings of favouring fortune; we have seen them, I\r\nsay, ruling and governing the world from a chair, their hunger turned\r\ninto satiety, their cold into comfort, their nakedness into fine\r\nraiment, their sleep on a mat into repose in holland and damask, the\r\njustly earned reward of their virtue; but, contrasted and compared with\r\nwhat the warrior undergoes, all they have undergone falls far short of\r\nit, as I am now about to show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc37e.jpg (13K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF THE CURIOUS DISCOURSE DON QUIXOTE DELIVERED ON ARMS AND\r\nLETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc38a.jpg (180K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing his discourse Don Quixote said: \xe2\x80\x9cAs we began in the\r\nstudent\xe2\x80\x99s case with poverty and its accompaniments, let us see now if\r\nthe soldier is richer, and we shall find that in poverty itself there\r\nis no one poorer; for he is dependent on his miserable pay, which comes\r\nlate or never, or else on what he can plunder, seriously imperilling\r\nhis life and conscience; and sometimes his nakedness will be so great\r\nthat a slashed doublet serves him for uniform and shirt, and in the\r\ndepth of winter he has to defend himself against the inclemency of the\r\nweather in the open field with nothing better than the breath of his\r\nmouth, which I need not say, coming from an empty place, must come out\r\ncold, contrary to the laws of nature. To be sure he looks forward to\r\nthe approach of night to make up for all these discomforts on the bed\r\nthat awaits him, which, unless by some fault of his, never sins by\r\nbeing over narrow, for he can easily measure out on the ground as he\r\nlikes, and roll himself about in it to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content without any\r\nfear of the sheets slipping away from him. Then, after all this,\r\nsuppose the day and hour for taking his degree in his calling to have\r\ncome; suppose the day of battle to have arrived, when they invest him\r\nwith the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s cap made of lint, to mend some bullet-hole, perhaps,\r\nthat has gone through his temples, or left him with a crippled arm or\r\nleg. Or if this does not happen, and merciful Heaven watches over him\r\nand keeps him safe and sound, it may be he will be in the same poverty\r\nhe was in before, and he must go through more engagements and more\r\nbattles, and come victorious out of all before he betters himself; but\r\nmiracles of that sort are seldom seen. For tell me, sirs, if you have\r\never reflected upon it, by how much do those who have gained by war\r\nfall short of the number of those who have perished in it? No doubt you\r\nwill reply that there can be no comparison, that the dead cannot be\r\nnumbered, while the living who have been rewarded may be summed up with\r\nthree figures. All which is the reverse in the case of men of letters;\r\nfor by skirts, to say nothing of sleeves, they all find means of\r\nsupport; so that though the soldier has more to endure, his reward is\r\nmuch less. But against all this it may be urged that it is easier to\r\nreward two thousand soldiers, for the former may be remunerated by\r\ngiving them places, which must perforce be conferred upon men of their\r\ncalling, while the latter can only be recompensed out of the very\r\nproperty of the master they serve; but this impossibility only\r\nstrengthens my argument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPutting this, however, aside, for it is a puzzling question for which\r\nit is difficult to find a solution, let us return to the superiority of\r\narms over letters, a matter still undecided, so many are the arguments\r\nput forward on each side; for besides those I have mentioned, letters\r\nsay that without them arms cannot maintain themselves, for war, too,\r\nhas its laws and is governed by them, and laws belong to the domain of\r\nletters and men of letters. To this arms make answer that without them\r\nlaws cannot be maintained, for by arms states are defended, kingdoms\r\npreserved, cities protected, roads made safe, seas cleared of pirates;\r\nand, in short, if it were not for them, states, kingdoms, monarchies,\r\ncities, ways by sea and land would be exposed to the violence and\r\nconfusion which war brings with it, so long as it lasts and is free to\r\nmake use of its privileges and powers. And then it is plain that\r\nwhatever costs most is valued and deserves to be valued most. To attain\r\nto eminence in letters costs a man time, watching, hunger, nakedness,\r\nheadaches, indigestions, and other things of the sort, some of which I\r\nhave already referred to. But for a man to come in the ordinary course\r\nof things to be a good soldier costs him all the student suffers, and\r\nin an incomparably higher degree, for at every step he runs the risk of\r\nlosing his life. For what dread of want or poverty that can reach or\r\nharass the student can compare with what the soldier feels, who finds\r\nhimself beleaguered in some stronghold mounting guard in some ravelin\r\nor cavalier, knows that the enemy is pushing a mine towards the post\r\nwhere he is stationed, and cannot under any circumstances retire or fly\r\nfrom the imminent danger that threatens him? All he can do is to inform\r\nhis captain of what is going on so that he may try to remedy it by a\r\ncounter-mine, and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of the\r\nmoment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into\r\nthe deep against his will. And if this seems a trifling risk, let us\r\nsee whether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys\r\nstem to stem, in the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled one\r\nwith the other, when the soldier has no more standing room than two\r\nfeet of the plank of the spur; and yet, though he sees before him\r\nthreatening him as many ministers of death as there are cannon of the\r\nfoe pointed at him, not a lance length from his body, and sees too that\r\nwith the first heedless step he will go down to visit the profundities\r\nof Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s bosom, still with dauntless heart, urged on by honour that\r\nnerves him, he makes himself a target for all that musketry, and\r\nstruggles to cross that narrow path to the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s ship. And what is\r\nstill more marvellous, no sooner has one gone down into the depths he\r\nwill never rise from till the end of the world, than another takes his\r\nplace; and if he too falls into the sea that waits for him like an\r\nenemy, another and another will succeed him without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause\r\nbetween their deaths: courage and daring the greatest that all the\r\nchances of war can show. Happy the blest ages that knew not the dread\r\nfury of those devilish engines of artillery, whose inventor I am\r\npersuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention,\r\nby which he made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to take the life\r\nof a gallant gentleman; and that, when he knows not how or whence, in\r\nthe height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate brave\r\nhearts, there should come some random bullet, discharged perhaps by one\r\nwho fled in terror at the flash when he fired off his accursed machine,\r\nwhich in an instant puts an end to the projects and cuts off the life\r\nof one who deserved to live for ages to come. And thus when I reflect\r\non this, I am almost tempted to say that in my heart I repent of having\r\nadopted this profession of knight-errant in so detestable an age as we\r\nlive in now; for though no peril can make me fear, still it gives me\r\nsome uneasiness to think that powder and lead may rob me of the\r\nopportunity of making myself famous and renowned throughout the known\r\nearth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword. But Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill be done; if I succeed in my attempt I shall be all the more\r\nhonoured, as I have faced greater dangers than the knights-errant of\r\nyore exposed themselves to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this lengthy discourse Don Quixote delivered while the others\r\nsupped, forgetting to raise a morsel to his lips, though Sancho more\r\nthan once told him to eat his supper, as he would have time enough\r\nafterwards to say all he wanted. It excited fresh pity in those who had\r\nheard him to see a man of apparently sound sense, and with rational\r\nviews on every subject he discussed, so hopelessly wanting in all, when\r\nhis wretched unlucky chivalry was in question. The curate told him he\r\nwas quite right in all he had said in favour of arms, and that he\r\nhimself, though a man of letters and a graduate, was of the same\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThey finished their supper, the cloth was removed, and while the\r\nhostess, her daughter, and Maritornes were getting Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha\xe2\x80\x99s garret ready, in which it was arranged that the women were to\r\nbe quartered by themselves for the night, Don Fernando begged the\r\ncaptive to tell them the story of his life, for it could not fail to be\r\nstrange and interesting, to judge by the hints he had let fall on his\r\narrival in company with Zoraida. To this the captive replied that he\r\nwould very willingly yield to his request, only he feared his tale\r\nwould not give them as much pleasure as he wished; nevertheless, not to\r\nbe wanting in compliance, he would tell it. The curate and the others\r\nthanked him and added their entreaties, and he finding himself so\r\npressed said there was no occasion ask, where a command had such\r\nweight, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cIf your worships will give me your attention you\r\nwill hear a true story which, perhaps, fictitious ones constructed with\r\ningenious and studied art cannot come up to.\xe2\x80\x9d These words made them\r\nsettle themselves in their places and preserve a deep silence, and he\r\nseeing them waiting on his words in mute expectation, began thus in a\r\npleasant quiet voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc38e.jpg (18K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nWHEREIN THE CAPTIVE RELATES HIS LIFE AND ADVENTURES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc39a.jpg (137K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy family had its origin in a village in the mountains of Leon, and\r\nnature had been kinder and more generous to it than fortune; though in\r\nthe general poverty of those communities my father passed for being\r\neven a rich man; and he would have been so in reality had he been as\r\nclever in preserving his property as he was in spending it. This\r\ntendency of his to be liberal and profuse he had acquired from having\r\nbeen a soldier in his youth, for the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s life is a school in\r\nwhich the niggard becomes free-handed and the free-handed prodigal; and\r\nif any soldiers are to be found who are misers, they are monsters of\r\nrare occurrence. My father went beyond liberality and bordered on\r\nprodigality, a disposition by no means advantageous to a married man\r\nwho has children to succeed to his name and position. My father had\r\nthree, all sons, and all of sufficient age to make choice of a\r\nprofession. Finding, then, that he was unable to resist his propensity,\r\nhe resolved to divest himself of the instrument and cause of his\r\nprodigality and lavishness, to divest himself of wealth, without which\r\nAlexander himself would have seemed parsimonious; and so calling us all\r\nthree aside one day into a room, he addressed us in words somewhat to\r\nthe following effect:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sons, to assure you that I love you, no more need be known or said\r\nthan that you are my sons; and to encourage a suspicion that I do not\r\nlove you, no more is needed than the knowledge that I have no\r\nself-control as far as preservation of your patrimony is concerned;\r\ntherefore, that you may for the future feel sure that I love you like a\r\nfather, and have no wish to ruin you like a stepfather, I propose to do\r\nwith you what I have for some time back meditated, and after mature\r\ndeliberation decided upon. You are now of an age to choose your line of\r\nlife or at least make choice of a calling that will bring you honour\r\nand profit when you are older; and what I have resolved to do is to\r\ndivide my property into four parts; three I will give to you, to each\r\nhis portion without making any difference, and the other I will retain\r\nto live upon and support myself for whatever remainder of life Heaven\r\nmay be pleased to grant me. But I wish each of you on taking possession\r\nof the share that falls to him to follow one of the paths I shall\r\nindicate. In this Spain of ours there is a proverb, to my mind very\r\ntrue\xe2\x80\x94as they all are, being short aphorisms drawn from long practical\r\nexperience\xe2\x80\x94and the one I refer to says, \xe2\x80\x98The church, or the sea, or the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s house;\xe2\x80\x99 as much as to say, in plainer language, whoever wants to\r\nflourish and become rich, let him follow the church, or go to sea,\r\nadopting commerce as his calling, or go into the king\xe2\x80\x99s service in his\r\nhousehold, for they say, \xe2\x80\x98Better a king\xe2\x80\x99s crumb than a lord\xe2\x80\x99s favour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI say so because it is my will and pleasure that one of you should\r\nfollow letters, another trade, and the third serve the king in the\r\nwars, for it is a difficult matter to gain admission to his service in\r\nhis household, and if war does not bring much wealth it confers great\r\ndistinction and fame. Eight days hence I will give you your full shares\r\nin money, without defrauding you of a farthing, as you will see in the\r\nend. Now tell me if you are willing to follow out my idea and advice as\r\nI have laid it before you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving called upon me as the eldest to answer, I, after urging him not\r\nto strip himself of his property but to spend it all as he pleased, for\r\nwe were young men able to gain our living, consented to comply with his\r\nwishes, and said that mine were to follow the profession of arms and\r\nthereby serve God and my king. My second brother having made the same\r\nproposal, decided upon going to the Indies, embarking the portion that\r\nfell to him in trade. The youngest, and in my opinion the wisest, said\r\nhe would rather follow the church, or go to complete his studies at\r\nSalamanca. As soon as we had come to an understanding, and made choice\r\nof our professions, my father embraced us all, and in the short time he\r\nmentioned carried into effect all he had promised; and when he had\r\ngiven to each his share, which as well as I remember was three thousand\r\nducats apiece in cash (for an uncle of ours bought the estate and paid\r\nfor it down, not to let it go out of the family), we all three on the\r\nsame day took leave of our good father; and at the same time, as it\r\nseemed to me inhuman to leave my father with such scanty means in his\r\nold age, I induced him to take two of my three thousand ducats, as the\r\nremainder would be enough to provide me with all a soldier needed. My\r\ntwo brothers, moved by my example, gave him each a thousand ducats, so\r\nthat there was left for my father four thousand ducats in money,\r\nbesides three thousand, the value of the portion that fell to him which\r\nhe preferred to retain in land instead of selling it. Finally, as I\r\nsaid, we took leave of him, and of our uncle whom I have mentioned, not\r\nwithout sorrow and tears on both sides, they charging us to let them\r\nknow whenever an opportunity offered how we fared, whether well or ill.\r\nWe promised to do so, and when he had embraced us and given us his\r\nblessing, one set out for Salamanca, the other for Seville, and I for\r\nAlicante, where I had heard there was a Genoese vessel taking in a\r\ncargo of wool for Genoa.\r\n\r\nIt is now some twenty-two years since I left my father\xe2\x80\x99s house, and all\r\nthat time, though I have written several letters, I have had no news\r\nwhatever of him or of my brothers; my own adventures during that period\r\nI will now relate briefly. I embarked at Alicante, reached Genoa after\r\na prosperous voyage, and proceeded thence to Milan, where I provided\r\nmyself with arms and a few soldier\xe2\x80\x99s accoutrements; thence it was my\r\nintention to go and take service in Piedmont, but as I was already on\r\nthe road to Alessandria della Paglia, I learned that the great Duke of\r\nAlva was on his way to Flanders. I changed my plans, joined him, served\r\nunder him in the campaigns he made, was present at the deaths of the\r\nCounts Egmont and Horn, and was promoted to be ensign under a famous\r\ncaptain of Guadalajara, Diego de Urbina by name. Some time after my\r\narrival in Flanders news came of the league that his Holiness Pope Pius\r\nV. of happy memory, had made with Venice and Spain against the common\r\nenemy, the Turk, who had just then with his fleet taken the famous\r\nisland of Cyprus, which belonged to the Venetians, a loss deplorable\r\nand disastrous. It was known as a fact that the Most Serene Don John of\r\nAustria, natural brother of our good king Don Philip, was coming as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the allied forces, and rumours were abroad of the\r\nvast warlike preparations which were being made, all which stirred my\r\nheart and filled me with a longing to take part in the campaign which\r\nwas expected; and though I had reason to believe, and almost certain\r\npromises, that on the first opportunity that presented itself I should\r\nbe promoted to be captain, I preferred to leave all and betake myself,\r\nas I did, to Italy; and it was my good fortune that Don John had just\r\narrived at Genoa, and was going on to Naples to join the Venetian\r\nfleet, as he afterwards did at Messina. I may say, in short, that I\r\ntook part in that glorious expedition, promoted by this time to be a\r\ncaptain of infantry, to which honourable charge my good luck rather\r\nthan my merits raised me; and that day\xe2\x80\x94so fortunate for Christendom,\r\nbecause then all the nations of the earth were disabused of the error\r\nunder which they lay in imagining the Turks to be invincible on sea\xe2\x80\x94on\r\nthat day, I say, on which the Ottoman pride and arrogance were broken,\r\namong all that were there made happy (for the Christians who died that\r\nday were happier than those who remained alive and victorious) I alone\r\nwas miserable; for, instead of some naval crown that I might have\r\nexpected had it been in Roman times, on the night that followed that\r\nfamous day I found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles on my\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nIt happened in this way: El Uchali, the king of Algiers, a daring and\r\nsuccessful corsair, having attacked and taken the leading Maltese\r\ngalley (only three knights being left alive in it, and they badly\r\nwounded), the chief galley of John Andrea, on board of which I and my\r\ncompany were placed, came to its relief, and doing as was bound to do\r\nin such a case, I leaped on board the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s galley, which, sheering\r\noff from that which had attacked it, prevented my men from following\r\nme, and so I found myself alone in the midst of my enemies, who were in\r\nsuch numbers that I was unable to resist; in short I was taken, covered\r\nwith wounds; El Uchali, as you know, sirs, made his escape with his\r\nentire squadron, and I was left a prisoner in his power, the only sad\r\nbeing among so many filled with joy, and the only captive among so many\r\nfree; for there were fifteen thousand Christians, all at the oar in the\r\nTurkish fleet, that regained their longed-for liberty that day.\r\n\r\nThey carried me to Constantinople, where the Grand Turk, Selim, made my\r\nmaster general at sea for having done his duty in the battle and\r\ncarried off as evidence of his bravery the standard of the Order of\r\nMalta. The following year, which was the year seventy-two, I found\r\nmyself at Navarino rowing in the leading galley with the three\r\nlanterns. There I saw and observed how the opportunity of capturing the\r\nwhole Turkish fleet in harbour was lost; for all the marines and\r\njanizzaries that belonged to it made sure that they were about to be\r\nattacked inside the very harbour, and had their kits and pasamaques, or\r\nshoes, ready to flee at once on shore without waiting to be assailed,\r\nin so great fear did they stand of our fleet. But Heaven ordered it\r\notherwise, not for any fault or neglect of the general who commanded on\r\nour side, but for the sins of Christendom, and because it was God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill and pleasure that we should always have instruments of punishment\r\nto chastise us. As it was, El Uchali took refuge at Modon, which is an\r\nisland near Navarino, and landing forces fortified the mouth of the\r\nharbour and waited quietly until Don John retired. On this expedition\r\nwas taken the galley called the Prize, whose captain was a son of the\r\nfamous corsair Barbarossa. It was taken by the chief Neapolitan galley\r\ncalled the She-wolf, commanded by that thunderbolt of war, that father\r\nof his men, that successful and unconquered captain Don \xc3\x81lvaro de\r\nBazan, Marquis of Santa Cruz; and I cannot help telling you what took\r\nplace at the capture of the Prize.\r\n\r\nThe son of Barbarossa was so cruel, and treated his slaves so badly,\r\nthat, when those who were at the oars saw that the She-wolf galley was\r\nbearing down upon them and gaining upon them, they all at once dropped\r\ntheir oars and seized their captain who stood on the stage at the end\r\nof the gangway shouting to them to row lustily; and passing him on from\r\nbench to bench, from the poop to the prow, they so bit him that before\r\nhe had got much past the mast his soul had already got to hell; so\r\ngreat, as I said, was the cruelty with which he treated them, and the\r\nhatred with which they hated him.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Constantinople, and the following year, seventy-three,\r\nit became known that Don John had seized Tunis and taken the kingdom\r\nfrom the Turks, and placed Muley Hamet in possession, putting an end to\r\nthe hopes which Muley Hamida, the cruelest and bravest Moor in the\r\nworld, entertained of returning to reign there. The Grand Turk took the\r\nloss greatly to heart, and with the cunning which all his race possess,\r\nhe made peace with the Venetians (who were much more eager for it than\r\nhe was), and the following year, seventy-four, he attacked the Goletta\r\nand the fort which Don John had left half built near Tunis. While all\r\nthese events were occurring, I was labouring at the oar without any\r\nhope of freedom; at least I had no hope of obtaining it by ransom, for\r\nI was firmly resolved not to write to my father telling him of my\r\nmisfortunes. At length the Goletta fell, and the fort fell, before\r\nwhich places there were seventy-five thousand regular Turkish soldiers,\r\nand more than four hundred thousand Moors and Arabs from all parts of\r\nAfrica, and in the train of all this great host such munitions and\r\nengines of war, and so many pioneers that with their hands they might\r\nhave covered the Goletta and the fort with handfuls of earth. The first\r\nto fall was the Goletta, until then reckoned impregnable, and it fell,\r\nnot by any fault of its defenders, who did all that they could and\r\nshould have done, but because experiment proved how easily\r\nentrenchments could be made in the desert sand there; for water used to\r\nbe found at two palms depth, while the Turks found none at two yards;\r\nand so by means of a quantity of sandbags they raised their works so\r\nhigh that they commanded the walls of the fort, sweeping them as if\r\nfrom a cavalier, so that no one was able to make a stand or maintain\r\nthe defence.\r\n\r\nIt was a common opinion that our men should not have shut themselves up\r\nin the Goletta, but should have waited in the open at the\r\nlanding-place; but those who say so talk at random and with little\r\nknowledge of such matters; for if in the Goletta and in the fort there\r\nwere barely seven thousand soldiers, how could such a small number,\r\nhowever resolute, sally out and hold their own against numbers like\r\nthose of the enemy? And how is it possible to help losing a stronghold\r\nthat is not relieved, above all when surrounded by a host of determined\r\nenemies in their own country? But many thought, and I thought so too,\r\nthat it was special favour and mercy which Heaven showed to Spain in\r\npermitting the destruction of that source and hiding place of mischief,\r\nthat devourer, sponge, and moth of countless money, fruitlessly wasted\r\nthere to no other purpose save preserving the memory of its capture by\r\nthe invincible Charles V.; as if to make that eternal, as it is and\r\nwill be, these stones were needed to support it. The fort also fell;\r\nbut the Turks had to win it inch by inch, for the soldiers who defended\r\nit fought so gallantly and stoutly that the number of the enemy killed\r\nin twenty-two general assaults exceeded twenty-five thousand. Of three\r\nhundred that remained alive not one was taken unwounded, a clear and\r\nmanifest proof of their gallantry and resolution, and how sturdily they\r\nhad defended themselves and held their post. A small fort or tower\r\nwhich was in the middle of the lagoon under the command of Don Juan\r\nZanoguera, a Valencian gentleman and a famous soldier, capitulated upon\r\nterms. They took prisoner Don Pedro Puertocarrero, commandant of the\r\nGoletta, who had done all in his power to defend his fortress, and took\r\nthe loss of it so much to heart that he died of grief on the way to\r\nConstantinople, where they were carrying him a prisoner. They also took\r\nthe commandant of the fort, Gabrio Cerbellon by name, a Milanese\r\ngentleman, a great engineer and a very brave soldier. In these two\r\nfortresses perished many persons of note, among whom was Pagano Doria,\r\nknight of the Order of St. John, a man of generous disposition, as was\r\nshown by his extreme liberality to his brother, the famous John Andrea\r\nDoria; and what made his death the more sad was that he was slain by\r\nsome Arabs to whom, seeing that the fort was now lost, he entrusted\r\nhimself, and who offered to conduct him in the disguise of a Moor to\r\nTabarca, a small fort or station on the coast held by the Genoese\r\nemployed in the coral fishery. These Arabs cut off his head and carried\r\nit to the commander of the Turkish fleet, who proved on them the truth\r\nof our Castilian proverb, that \xe2\x80\x9cthough the treason may please, the\r\ntraitor is hated;\xe2\x80\x9d for they say he ordered those who brought him the\r\npresent to be hanged for not having brought him alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc39b.jpg (371K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the Christians who were taken in the fort was one named Don Pedro\r\nde Aguilar, a native of some place, I know not what, in Andalusia, who\r\nhad been ensign in the fort, a soldier of great repute and rare\r\nintelligence, who had in particular a special gift for what they call\r\npoetry. I say so because his fate brought him to my galley and to my\r\nbench, and made him a slave to the same master; and before we left the\r\nport this gentleman composed two sonnets by way of epitaphs, one on the\r\nGoletta and the other on the fort; indeed, I may as well repeat them,\r\nfor I have them by heart, and I think they will be liked rather than\r\ndisliked.\r\n\r\nThe instant the captive mentioned the name of Don Pedro de Aguilar, Don\r\nFernando looked at his companions and they all three smiled; and when\r\nhe came to speak of the sonnets one of them said, \xe2\x80\x9cBefore your worship\r\nproceeds any further I entreat you to tell me what became of that Don\r\nPedro de Aguilar you have spoken of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captive, \xe2\x80\x9cthat after having been in\r\nConstantinople two years, he escaped in the disguise of an Arnaut, in\r\ncompany with a Greek spy; but whether he regained his liberty or not I\r\ncannot tell, though I fancy he did, because a year afterwards I saw the\r\nGreek at Constantinople, though I was unable to ask him what the result\r\nof the journey was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, you are right,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cfor that Don Pedro\r\nis my brother, and he is now in our village in good health, rich,\r\nmarried, and with three children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks be to God for all the mercies he has shown him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ncaptive; \xe2\x80\x9cfor to my mind there is no happiness on earth to compare with\r\nrecovering lost liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is more,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cI know the sonnets my brother\r\nmade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let your worship repeat them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captive, \xe2\x80\x9cfor you will\r\nrecite them better than I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cthat on the Goletta runs\r\nthus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc39e.jpg (38K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nIN WHICH THE STORY OF THE CAPTIVE IS CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc40a.jpg (131K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlest souls, that, from this mortal husk set free,\r\nIn guerdon of brave deeds beatified,\r\nAbove this lowly orb of ours abide\r\nMade heirs of heaven and immortality,\r\nWith noble rage and ardour glowing ye\r\nYour strength, while strength was yours, in battle plied,\r\nAnd with your own blood and the foeman\xe2\x80\x99s dyed\r\nThe sandy soil and the encircling sea.\r\nIt was the ebbing life-blood first that failed\r\nThe weary arms; the stout hearts never quailed.\r\nThough vanquished, yet ye earned the victor\xe2\x80\x99s crown:\r\nThough mourned, yet still triumphant was your fall\r\nFor there ye won, between the sword and wall,\r\nIn Heaven glory and on earth renown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is it exactly, according to my recollection,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, that on the fort,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cif my memory serves\r\nme, goes thus:\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp from this wasted soil, this shattered shell,\r\nWhose walls and towers here in ruin lie,\r\nThree thousand soldier souls took wing on high,\r\nIn the bright mansions of the blest to dwell.\r\nThe onslaught of the foeman to repel\r\nBy might of arm all vainly did they try,\r\nAnd when at length \xe2\x80\x99twas left them but to die,\r\nWearied and few the last defenders fell.\r\nAnd this same arid soil hath ever been\r\nA haunt of countless mournful memories,\r\nAs well in our day as in days of yore.\r\nBut never yet to Heaven it sent, I ween,\r\nFrom its hard bosom purer souls than these,\r\nOr braver bodies on its surface bore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sonnets were not disliked, and the captive was rejoiced at the\r\ntidings they gave him of his comrade, and continuing his tale, he went\r\non to say:\r\n\r\nThe Goletta and the fort being thus in their hands, the Turks gave\r\norders to dismantle the Goletta\xe2\x80\x94for the fort was reduced to such a\r\nstate that there was nothing left to level\xe2\x80\x94and to do the work more\r\nquickly and easily they mined it in three places; but nowhere were they\r\nable to blow up the part which seemed to be the least strong, that is\r\nto say, the old walls, while all that remained standing of the new\r\nfortifications that the Fratin had made came to the ground with the\r\ngreatest ease. Finally the fleet returned victorious and triumphant to\r\nConstantinople, and a few months later died my master, El Uchali,\r\notherwise Uchali Fartax, which means in Turkish \xe2\x80\x9cthe scabby renegade;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor that he was; it is the practice with the Turks to name people from\r\nsome defect or virtue they may possess; the reason being that there are\r\namong them only four surnames belonging to families tracing their\r\ndescent from the Ottoman house, and the others, as I have said, take\r\ntheir names and surnames either from bodily blemishes or moral\r\nqualities. This \xe2\x80\x9cscabby one\xe2\x80\x9d rowed at the oar as a slave of the Grand\r\nSignor\xe2\x80\x99s for fourteen years, and when over thirty-four years of age, in\r\nresentment at having been struck by a Turk while at the oar, turned\r\nrenegade and renounced his faith in order to be able to revenge\r\nhimself; and such was his valour that, without owing his advancement to\r\nthe base ways and means by which most favourites of the Grand Signor\r\nrise to power, he came to be king of Algiers, and afterwards\r\ngeneral-on-sea, which is the third place of trust in the realm. He was\r\na Calabrian by birth, and a worthy man morally, and he treated his\r\nslaves with great humanity. He had three thousand of them, and after\r\nhis death they were divided, as he directed by his will, between the\r\nGrand Signor (who is heir of all who die and shares with the children\r\nof the deceased) and his renegades. I fell to the lot of a Venetian\r\nrenegade who, when a cabin boy on board a ship, had been taken by\r\nUchali and was so much beloved by him that he became one of his most\r\nfavoured youths. He came to be the most cruel renegade I ever saw: his\r\nname was Hassan Aga, and he grew very rich and became king of Algiers.\r\nWith him I went there from Constantinople, rather glad to be so near\r\nSpain, not that I intended to write to anyone about my unhappy lot, but\r\nto try if fortune would be kinder to me in Algiers than in\r\nConstantinople, where I had attempted in a thousand ways to escape\r\nwithout ever finding a favourable time or chance; but in Algiers I\r\nresolved to seek for other means of effecting the purpose I cherished\r\nso dearly; for the hope of obtaining my liberty never deserted me; and\r\nwhen in my plots and schemes and attempts the result did not answer my\r\nexpectations, without giving way to despair I immediately began to look\r\nout for or conjure up some new hope to support me, however faint or\r\nfeeble it might be.\r\n\r\nIn this way I lived on immured in a building or prison called by the\r\nTurks a ba\xc3\xb1o in which they confine the Christian captives, as well\r\nthose that are the king\xe2\x80\x99s as those belonging to private individuals,\r\nand also what they call those of the Almacen, which is as much as to\r\nsay the slaves of the municipality, who serve the city in the public\r\nworks and other employments; but captives of this kind recover their\r\nliberty with great difficulty, for, as they are public property and\r\nhave no particular master, there is no one with whom to treat for their\r\nransom, even though they may have the means. To these ba\xc3\xb1os, as I have\r\nsaid, some private individuals of the town are in the habit of bringing\r\ntheir captives, especially when they are to be ransomed; because there\r\nthey can keep them in safety and comfort until their ransom arrives.\r\nThe king\xe2\x80\x99s captives also, that are on ransom, do not go out to work\r\nwith the rest of the crew, unless when their ransom is delayed; for\r\nthen, to make them write for it more pressingly, they compel them to\r\nwork and go for wood, which is no light labour.\r\n\r\nI, however, was one of those on ransom, for when it was discovered that\r\nI was a captain, although I declared my scanty means and want of\r\nfortune, nothing could dissuade them from including me among the\r\ngentlemen and those waiting to be ransomed. They put a chain on me,\r\nmore as a mark of this than to keep me safe, and so I passed my life in\r\nthat ba\xc3\xb1o with several other gentlemen and persons of quality marked\r\nout as held to ransom; but though at times, or rather almost always, we\r\nsuffered from hunger and scanty clothing, nothing distressed us so much\r\nas hearing and seeing at every turn the unexampled and unheard-of\r\ncruelties my master inflicted upon the Christians. Every day he hanged\r\na man, impaled one, cut off the ears of another; and all with so little\r\nprovocation, or so entirely without any, that the Turks acknowledged he\r\ndid it merely for the sake of doing it, and because he was by nature\r\nmurderously disposed towards the whole human race. The only one that\r\nfared at all well with him was a Spanish soldier, something de Saavedra\r\nby name, to whom he never gave a blow himself, or ordered a blow to be\r\ngiven, or addressed a hard word, although he had done things that will\r\ndwell in the memory of the people there for many a year, and all to\r\nrecover his liberty; and for the least of the many things he did we all\r\ndreaded that he would be impaled, and he himself was in fear of it more\r\nthan once; and only that time does not allow, I could tell you now\r\nsomething of what that soldier did, that would interest and astonish\r\nyou much more than the narration of my own tale.\r\n\r\nTo go on with my story; the courtyard of our prison was overlooked by\r\nthe windows of the house belonging to a wealthy Moor of high position;\r\nand these, as is usual in Moorish houses, were rather loopholes than\r\nwindows, and besides were covered with thick and close lattice-work. It\r\nso happened, then, that as I was one day on the terrace of our prison\r\nwith three other comrades, trying, to pass away the time, how far we\r\ncould leap with our chains, we being alone, for all the other\r\nChristians had gone out to work, I chanced to raise my eyes, and from\r\none of these little closed windows I saw a reed appear with a cloth\r\nattached to the end of it, and it kept waving to and fro, and moving as\r\nif making signs to us to come and take it. We watched it, and one of\r\nthose who were with me went and stood under the reed to see whether\r\nthey would let it drop, or what they would do, but as he did so the\r\nreed was raised and moved from side to side, as if they meant to say\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d by a shake of the head. The Christian came back, and it was again\r\nlowered, making the same movements as before. Another of my comrades\r\nwent, and with him the same happened as with the first, and then the\r\nthird went forward, but with the same result as the first and second.\r\nSeeing this I did not like not to try my luck, and as soon as I came\r\nunder the reed it was dropped and fell inside the ba\xc3\xb1o at my feet. I\r\nhastened to untie the cloth, in which I perceived a knot, and in this\r\nwere ten cianis, which are coins of base gold, current among the Moors,\r\nand each worth ten reals of our money.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say I rejoiced over this godsend, and my joy was not\r\nless than my wonder as I strove to imagine how this good fortune could\r\nhave come to us, but to me specially; for the evident unwillingness to\r\ndrop the reed for any but me showed that it was for me the favour was\r\nintended. I took my welcome money, broke the reed, and returned to the\r\nterrace, and looking up at the window, I saw a very white hand put out\r\nthat opened and shut very quickly. From this we gathered or fancied\r\nthat it must be some woman living in that house that had done us this\r\nkindness, and to show that we were grateful for it, we made salaams\r\nafter the fashion of the Moors, bowing the head, bending the body, and\r\ncrossing the arms on the breast. Shortly afterwards at the same window\r\na small cross made of reeds was put out and immediately withdrawn. This\r\nsign led us to believe that some Christian woman was a captive in the\r\nhouse, and that it was she who had been so good to us; but the\r\nwhiteness of the hand and the bracelets we had perceived made us\r\ndismiss that idea, though we thought it might be one of the Christian\r\nrenegades whom their masters very often take as lawful wives, and\r\ngladly, for they prefer them to the women of their own nation. In all\r\nour conjectures we were wide of the truth; so from that time forward\r\nour sole occupation was watching and gazing at the window where the\r\ncross had appeared to us, as if it were our pole-star; but at least\r\nfifteen days passed without our seeing either it or the hand, or any\r\nother sign and though meanwhile we endeavoured with the utmost pains to\r\nascertain who it was that lived in the house, and whether there were\r\nany Christian renegade in it, nobody could ever tell us anything more\r\nthan that he who lived there was a rich Moor of high position, Hadji\r\nMorato by name, formerly alcaide of La Pata, an office of high dignity\r\namong them. But when we least thought it was going to rain any more\r\ncianis from that quarter, we saw the reed suddenly appear with another\r\ncloth tied in a larger knot attached to it, and this at a time when, as\r\non the former occasion, the ba\xc3\xb1o was deserted and unoccupied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc40b.jpg (288K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe made trial as before, each of the same three going forward before I\r\ndid; but the reed was delivered to none but me, and on my approach it\r\nwas let drop. I untied the knot and I found forty Spanish gold crowns\r\nwith a paper written in Arabic, and at the end of the writing there was\r\na large cross drawn. I kissed the cross, took the crowns and returned\r\nto the terrace, and we all made our salaams; again the hand appeared, I\r\nmade signs that I would read the paper, and then the window was closed.\r\nWe were all puzzled, though filled with joy at what had taken place;\r\nand as none of us understood Arabic, great was our curiosity to know\r\nwhat the paper contained, and still greater the difficulty of finding\r\nsomeone to read it. At last I resolved to confide in a renegade, a\r\nnative of Murcia, who professed a very great friendship for me, and had\r\ngiven pledges that bound him to keep any secret I might entrust to him;\r\nfor it is the custom with some renegades, when they intend to return to\r\nChristian territory, to carry about them certificates from captives of\r\nmark testifying, in whatever form they can, that such and such a\r\nrenegade is a worthy man who has always shown kindness to Christians,\r\nand is anxious to escape on the first opportunity that may present\r\nitself. Some obtain these testimonials with good intentions, others put\r\nthem to a cunning use; for when they go to pillage on Christian\r\nterritory, if they chance to be cast away, or taken prisoners, they\r\nproduce their certificates and say that from these papers may be seen\r\nthe object they came for, which was to remain on Christian ground, and\r\nthat it was to this end they joined the Turks in their foray. In this\r\nway they escape the consequences of the first outburst and make their\r\npeace with the Church before it does them any harm, and then when they\r\nhave the chance they return to Barbary to become what they were before.\r\nOthers, however, there are who procure these papers and make use of\r\nthem honestly, and remain on Christian soil. This friend of mine, then,\r\nwas one of these renegades that I have described; he had certificates\r\nfrom all our comrades, in which we testified in his favour as strongly\r\nas we could; and if the Moors had found the papers they would have\r\nburned him alive.\r\n\r\nI knew that he understood Arabic very well, and could not only speak\r\nbut also write it; but before I disclosed the whole matter to him, I\r\nasked him to read for me this paper which I had found by accident in a\r\nhole in my cell. He opened it and remained some time examining it and\r\nmuttering to himself as he translated it. I asked him if he understood\r\nit, and he told me he did perfectly well, and that if I wished him to\r\ntell me its meaning word for word, I must give him pen and ink that he\r\nmight do it more satisfactorily. We at once gave him what he required,\r\nand he set about translating it bit by bit, and when he had done he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that is here in Spanish is what the Moorish paper contains, and\r\nyou must bear in mind that when it says \xe2\x80\x98Lela Marien\xe2\x80\x99 it means \xe2\x80\x98Our\r\nLady the Virgin Mary.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe read the paper and it ran thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a child my father had a slave who taught me to pray the\r\nChristian prayer in my own language, and told me many things about Lela\r\nMarien. The Christian died, and I know that she did not go to the fire,\r\nbut to Allah, because since then I have seen her twice, and she told me\r\nto go to the land of the Christians to see Lela Marien, who had great\r\nlove for me. I know not how to go. I have seen many Christians, but\r\nexcept thyself none has seemed to me to be a gentleman. I am young and\r\nbeautiful, and have plenty of money to take with me. See if thou canst\r\ncontrive how we may go, and if thou wilt thou shalt be my husband\r\nthere, and if thou wilt not it will not distress me, for Lela Marien\r\nwill find me someone to marry me. I myself have written this: have a\r\ncare to whom thou givest it to read: trust no Moor, for they are all\r\nperfidious. I am greatly troubled on this account, for I would not have\r\nthee confide in anyone, because if my father knew it he would at once\r\nfling me down a well and cover me with stones. I will put a thread to\r\nthe reed; tie the answer to it, and if thou hast no one to write for\r\nthee in Arabic, tell it to me by signs, for Lela Marien will make me\r\nunderstand thee. She and Allah and this cross, which I often kiss as\r\nthe captive bade me, protect thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJudge, sirs, whether we had reason for surprise and joy at the words of\r\nthis paper; and both one and the other were so great, that the renegade\r\nperceived that the paper had not been found by chance, but had been in\r\nreality addressed to someone of us, and he begged us, if what he\r\nsuspected were the truth, to trust him and tell him all, for he would\r\nrisk his life for our freedom; and so saying he took out from his\r\nbreast a metal crucifix, and with many tears swore by the God the image\r\nrepresented, in whom, sinful and wicked as he was, he truly and\r\nfaithfully believed, to be loyal to us and keep secret whatever we\r\nchose to reveal to him; for he thought and almost foresaw that by means\r\nof her who had written that paper, he and all of us would obtain our\r\nliberty, and he himself obtain the object he so much desired, his\r\nrestoration to the bosom of the Holy Mother Church, from which by his\r\nown sin and ignorance he was now severed like a corrupt limb. The\r\nrenegade said this with so many tears and such signs of repentance,\r\nthat with one consent we all agreed to tell him the whole truth of the\r\nmatter, and so we gave him a full account of all, without hiding\r\nanything from him. We pointed out to him the window at which the reed\r\nappeared, and he by that means took note of the house, and resolved to\r\nascertain with particular care who lived in it. We agreed also that it\r\nwould be advisable to answer the Moorish lady\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and the\r\nrenegade without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay took down the words I dictated to\r\nhim, which were exactly what I shall tell you, for nothing of\r\nimportance that took place in this affair has escaped my memory, or\r\never will while life lasts. This, then, was the answer returned to the\r\nMoorish lady:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe true Allah protect thee, Lady, and that blessed Marien who is the\r\ntrue mother of God, and who has put it into thy heart to go to the land\r\nof the Christians, because she loves thee. Entreat her that she be\r\npleased to show thee how thou canst execute the command she gives thee,\r\nfor she will, such is her goodness. On my own part, and on that of all\r\nthese Christians who are with me, I promise to do all that we can for\r\nthee, even to death. Fail not to write to me and inform me what thou\r\ndost mean to do, and I will always answer thee; for the great Allah has\r\ngiven us a Christian captive who can speak and write thy language well,\r\nas thou mayest see by this paper; without fear, therefore, thou canst\r\ninform us of all thou wouldst. As to what thou sayest, that if thou\r\ndost reach the land of the Christians thou wilt be my wife, I give thee\r\nmy promise upon it as a good Christian; and know that the Christians\r\nkeep their promises better than the Moors. Allah and Marien his mother\r\nwatch over thee, my Lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe paper being written and folded I waited two days until the ba\xc3\xb1o was\r\nempty as before, and immediately repaired to the usual walk on the\r\nterrace to see if there were any sign of the reed, which was not long\r\nin making its appearance. As soon as I saw it, although I could not\r\ndistinguish who put it out, I showed the paper as a sign to attach the\r\nthread, but it was already fixed to the reed, and to it I tied the\r\npaper; and shortly afterwards our star once more made its appearance\r\nwith the white flag of peace, the little bundle. It was dropped, and I\r\npicked it up, and found in the cloth, in gold and silver coins of all\r\nsorts, more than fifty crowns, which fifty times more strengthened our\r\njoy and doubled our hope of gaining our liberty. That very night our\r\nrenegade returned and said he had learned that the Moor we had been\r\ntold of lived in that house, that his name was Hadji Morato, that he\r\nwas enormously rich, that he had one only daughter the heiress of all\r\nhis wealth, and that it was the general opinion throughout the city\r\nthat she was the most beautiful woman in Barbary, and that several of\r\nthe viceroys who came there had sought her for a wife, but that she had\r\nbeen always unwilling to marry; and he had learned, moreover, that she\r\nhad a Christian slave who was now dead; all which agreed with the\r\ncontents of the paper. We immediately took counsel with the renegade as\r\nto what means would have to be adopted in order to carry off the\r\nMoorish lady and bring us all to Christian territory; and in the end it\r\nwas agreed that for the present we should wait for a second\r\ncommunication from Zoraida (for that was the name of her who now\r\ndesires to be called Maria), because we saw clearly that she and no one\r\nelse could find a way out of all these difficulties. When we had\r\ndecided upon this the renegade told us not to be uneasy, for he would\r\nlose his life or restore us to liberty. For four days the ba\xc3\xb1o was\r\nfilled with people, for which reason the reed delayed its appearance\r\nfor four days, but at the end of that time, when the ba\xc3\xb1o was, as it\r\ngenerally was, empty, it appeared with the cloth so bulky that it\r\npromised a happy birth. Reed and cloth came down to me, and I found\r\nanother paper and a hundred crowns in gold, without any other coin. The\r\nrenegade was present, and in our cell we gave him the paper to read,\r\nwhich was to this effect:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot think of a plan, se\xc3\xb1or, for our going to Spain, nor has Lela\r\nMarien shown me one, though I have asked her. All that can be done is\r\nfor me to give you plenty of money in gold from this window. With it\r\nransom yourself and your friends, and let one of you go to the land of\r\nthe Christians, and there buy a vessel and come back for the others;\r\nand he will find me in my father\xe2\x80\x99s garden, which is at the Babazon gate\r\nnear the seashore, where I shall be all this summer with my father and\r\nmy servants. You can carry me away from there by night without any\r\ndanger, and bring me to the vessel. And remember thou art to be my\r\nhusband, else I will pray to Marien to punish thee. If thou canst not\r\ntrust anyone to go for the vessel, ransom thyself and do thou go, for I\r\nknow thou wilt return more surely than any other, as thou art a\r\ngentleman and a Christian. Endeavour to make thyself acquainted with\r\nthe garden; and when I see thee walking yonder I shall know that the\r\nba\xc3\xb1o is empty and I will give thee abundance of money. Allah protect\r\nthee, se\xc3\xb1or.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese were the words and contents of the second paper, and on hearing\r\nthem, each declared himself willing to be the ransomed one, and\r\npromised to go and return with scrupulous good faith; and I too made\r\nthe same offer; but to all this the renegade objected, saying that he\r\nwould not on any account consent to one being set free before all went\r\ntogether, as experience had taught him how ill those who have been set\r\nfree keep promises which they made in captivity; for captives of\r\ndistinction frequently had recourse to this plan, paying the ransom of\r\none who was to go to Valencia or Majorca with money to enable him to\r\narm a bark and return for the others who had ransomed him, but who\r\nnever came back; for recovered liberty and the dread of losing it again\r\nefface from the memory all the obligations in the world. And to prove\r\nthe truth of what he said, he told us briefly what had happened to a\r\ncertain Christian gentleman almost at that very time, the strangest\r\ncase that had ever occurred even there, where astonishing and\r\nmarvellous things are happening every instant. In short, he ended by\r\nsaying that what could and ought to be done was to give the money\r\nintended for the ransom of one of us Christians to him, so that he\r\nmight with it buy a vessel there in Algiers under the pretence of\r\nbecoming a merchant and trader at Tetuan and along the coast; and when\r\nmaster of the vessel, it would be easy for him to hit on some way of\r\ngetting us all out of the ba\xc3\xb1o and putting us on board; especially if\r\nthe Moorish lady gave, as she said, money enough to ransom all, because\r\nonce free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us to embark\r\neven in open day; but the greatest difficulty was that the Moors do not\r\nallow any renegade to buy or own any craft, unless it be a large vessel\r\nfor going on roving expeditions, because they are afraid that anyone\r\nwho buys a small vessel, especially if he be a Spaniard, only wants it\r\nfor the purpose of escaping to Christian territory. This however he\r\ncould get over by arranging with a Tagarin Moor to go shares with him\r\nin the purchase of the vessel, and in the profit on the cargo; and\r\nunder cover of this he could become master of the vessel, in which case\r\nhe looked upon all the rest as accomplished. But though to me and my\r\ncomrades it had seemed a better plan to send to Majorca for the vessel,\r\nas the Moorish lady suggested, we did not dare to oppose him, fearing\r\nthat if we did not do as he said he would denounce us, and place us in\r\ndanger of losing all our lives if he were to disclose our dealings with\r\nZoraida, for whose life we would have all given our own. We therefore\r\nresolved to put ourselves in the hands of God and in the renegade\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nand at the same time an answer was given to Zoraida, telling her that\r\nwe would do all she recommended, for she had given as good advice as if\r\nLela Marien had delivered it, and that it depended on her alone whether\r\nwe were to defer the business or put it in execution at once. I renewed\r\nmy promise to be her husband; and thus the next day that the ba\xc3\xb1o\r\nchanced to be empty she at different times gave us by means of the reed\r\nand cloth two thousand gold crowns and a paper in which she said that\r\nthe next Juma, that is to say Friday, she was going to her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngarden, but that before she went she would give us more money; and if\r\nit were not enough we were to let her know, as she would give us as\r\nmuch as we asked, for her father had so much he would not miss it, and\r\nbesides she kept all the keys.\r\n\r\nWe at once gave the renegade five hundred crowns to buy the vessel, and\r\nwith eight hundred I ransomed myself, giving the money to a Valencian\r\nmerchant who happened to be in Algiers at the time, and who had me\r\nreleased on his word, pledging it that on the arrival of the first ship\r\nfrom Valencia he would pay my ransom; for if he had given the money at\r\nonce it would have made the king suspect that my ransom money had been\r\nfor a long time in Algiers, and that the merchant had for his own\r\nadvantage kept it secret. In fact my master was so difficult to deal\r\nwith that I dared not on any account pay down the money at once. The\r\nThursday before the Friday on which the fair Zoraida was to go to the\r\ngarden she gave us a thousand crowns more, and warned us of her\r\ndeparture, begging me, if I were ransomed, to find out her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngarden at once, and by all means to seek an opportunity of going there\r\nto see her. I answered in a few words that I would do so, and that she\r\nmust remember to commend us to Lela Marien with all the prayers the\r\ncaptive had taught her. This having been done, steps were taken to\r\nransom our three comrades, so as to enable them to quit the ba\xc3\xb1o, and\r\nlest, seeing me ransomed and themselves not, though the money was\r\nforthcoming, they should make a disturbance about it and the devil\r\nshould prompt them to do something that might injure Zoraida; for\r\nthough their position might be sufficient to relieve me from this\r\napprehension, nevertheless I was unwilling to run any risk in the\r\nmatter; and so I had them ransomed in the same way as I was, handing\r\nover all the money to the merchant so that he might with safety and\r\nconfidence give security; without, however, confiding our arrangement\r\nand secret to him, which might have been dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc40e.jpg (34K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nIN WHICH THE CAPTIVE STILL CONTINUES HIS ADVENTURES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc41a.jpg (106K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore fifteen days were over our renegade had already purchased an\r\nexcellent vessel with room for more than thirty persons; and to make\r\nthe transaction safe and lend a colour to it, he thought it well to\r\nmake, as he did, a voyage to a place called Shershel, twenty leagues\r\nfrom Algiers on the Oran side, where there is an extensive trade in\r\ndried figs. Two or three times he made this voyage in company with the\r\nTagarin already mentioned. The Moors of Aragon are called Tagarins in\r\nBarbary, and those of Granada Mud\xc3\xa9jares; but in the Kingdom of Fez they\r\ncall the Mud\xc3\xa9jares Elches, and they are the people the king chiefly\r\nemploys in war. To proceed: every time he passed with his vessel he\r\nanchored in a cove that was not two crossbow shots from the garden\r\nwhere Zoraida was waiting; and there the renegade, together with the\r\ntwo Moorish lads that rowed, used purposely to station himself, either\r\ngoing through his prayers, or else practising as a part what he meant\r\nto perform in earnest. And thus he would go to Zoraida\xe2\x80\x99s garden and ask\r\nfor fruit, which her father gave him, not knowing him; but though, as\r\nhe afterwards told me, he sought to speak to Zoraida, and tell her who\r\nhe was, and that by my orders he was to take her to the land of the\r\nChristians, so that she might feel satisfied and easy, he had never\r\nbeen able to do so; for the Moorish women do not allow themselves to be\r\nseen by any Moor or Turk, unless their husband or father bid them: with\r\nChristian captives they permit freedom of intercourse and\r\ncommunication, even more than might be considered proper. But for my\r\npart I should have been sorry if he had spoken to her, for perhaps it\r\nmight have alarmed her to find her affairs talked of by renegades. But\r\nGod, who ordered it otherwise, afforded no opportunity for our\r\nrenegade\xe2\x80\x99s well-meant purpose; and he, seeing how safely he could go to\r\nShershel and return, and anchor when and how and where he liked, and\r\nthat the Tagarin his partner had no will but his, and that, now I was\r\nransomed, all we wanted was to find some Christians to row, told me to\r\nlook out for any I should be willing to take with me, over and above\r\nthose who had been ransomed, and to engage them for the next Friday,\r\nwhich he fixed upon for our departure. On this I spoke to twelve\r\nSpaniards, all stout rowers, and such as could most easily leave the\r\ncity; but it was no easy matter to find so many just then, because\r\nthere were twenty ships out on a cruise and they had taken all the\r\nrowers with them; and these would not have been found were it not that\r\ntheir master remained at home that summer without going to sea in order\r\nto finish a galliot that he had upon the stocks. To these men I said\r\nnothing more than that the next Friday in the evening they were to come\r\nout stealthily one by one and hang about Hadji Morato\xe2\x80\x99s garden, waiting\r\nfor me there until I came. These directions I gave each one separately,\r\nwith orders that if they saw any other Christians there they were not\r\nto say anything to them except that I had directed them to wait at that\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThis preliminary having been settled, another still more necessary step\r\nhad to be taken, which was to let Zoraida know how matters stood that\r\nshe might be prepared and forewarned, so as not to be taken by surprise\r\nif we were suddenly to seize upon her before she thought the\r\nChristians\xe2\x80\x99 vessel could have returned. I determined, therefore, to go\r\nto the garden and try if I could speak to her; and the day before my\r\ndeparture I went there under the pretence of gathering herbs. The first\r\nperson I met was her father, who addressed me in the language that all\r\nover Barbary and even in Constantinople is the medium between captives\r\nand Moors, and is neither Morisco nor Castilian, nor of any other\r\nnation, but a mixture of all languages, by means of which we can all\r\nunderstand one another. In this sort of language, I say, he asked me\r\nwhat I wanted in his garden, and to whom I belonged. I replied that I\r\nwas a slave of the Arnaut Mami (for I knew as a certainty that he was a\r\nvery great friend of his), and that I wanted some herbs to make a\r\nsalad. He asked me then whether I were on ransom or not, and what my\r\nmaster demanded for me. While these questions and answers were\r\nproceeding, the fair Zoraida, who had already perceived me some time\r\nbefore, came out of the house in the garden, and as Moorish women are\r\nby no means particular about letting themselves be seen by Christians,\r\nor, as I have said before, at all coy, she had no hesitation in coming\r\nto where her father stood with me; moreover her father, seeing her\r\napproaching slowly, called to her to come. It would be beyond my power\r\nnow to describe to you the great beauty, the high-bred air, the\r\nbrilliant attire of my beloved Zoraida as she presented herself before\r\nmy eyes. I will content myself with saying that more pearls hung from\r\nher fair neck, her ears, and her hair than she had hairs on her head.\r\nOn her ankles, which as is customary were bare, she had carcajes (for\r\nso bracelets or anklets are called in Morisco) of the purest gold, set\r\nwith so many diamonds that she told me afterwards her father valued\r\nthem at ten thousand doubloons, and those she had on her wrists were\r\nworth as much more. The pearls were in profusion and very fine, for the\r\nhighest display and adornment of the Moorish women is decking\r\nthemselves with rich pearls and seed-pearls; and of these there are\r\ntherefore more among the Moors than among any other people. Zoraida\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather had to the reputation of possessing a great number, and the\r\npurest in all Algiers, and of possessing also more than two hundred\r\nthousand Spanish crowns; and she, who is now mistress of me only, was\r\nmistress of all this. Whether thus adorned she would have been\r\nbeautiful or not, and what she must have been in her prosperity, may be\r\nimagined from the beauty remaining to her after so many hardships; for,\r\nas everyone knows, the beauty of some women has its times and its\r\nseasons, and is increased or diminished by chance causes; and naturally\r\nthe emotions of the mind will heighten or impair it, though indeed more\r\nfrequently they totally destroy it. In a word she presented herself\r\nbefore me that day attired with the utmost splendour, and supremely\r\nbeautiful; at any rate, she seemed to me the most beautiful object I\r\nhad ever seen; and when, besides, I thought of all I owed to her I felt\r\nas though I had before me some heavenly being come to earth to bring me\r\nrelief and happiness.\r\n\r\nAs she approached her father told her in his own language that I was a\r\ncaptive belonging to his friend the Arnaut Mami, and that I had come\r\nfor salad.\r\n\r\nShe took up the conversation, and in that mixture of tongues I have\r\nspoken of she asked me if I was a gentleman, and why I was not\r\nransomed.\r\n\r\nI answered that I was already ransomed, and that by the price it might\r\nbe seen what value my master set on me, as they had given one thousand\r\nfive hundred zoltanis for me; to which she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cHadst thou been my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s, I can tell thee, I would not have let him part with thee for\r\ntwice as much, for you Christians always tell lies about yourselves and\r\nmake yourselves out poor to cheat the Moors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut indeed I dealt truthfully with my\r\nmaster, as I do and mean to do with everybody in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when dost thou go?\xe2\x80\x9d said Zoraida.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cfor there is a vessel here from France\r\nwhich sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it not be better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zoraida, \xe2\x80\x9cto wait for the arrival of\r\nships from Spain and go with them and not with the French who are not\r\nyour friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cthough if there were intelligence that a vessel were now\r\ncoming from Spain it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, it\r\nis more likely I shall depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel to\r\nreturn to my country and to those I love is so great that it will not\r\nallow me to wait for another opportunity, however more convenient, if\r\nit be delayed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt thou art married in thine own country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zoraida, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nfor that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not married,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have given my promise to marry on\r\nmy arrival there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Zoraida.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, to describe her worthily and tell thee\r\nthe truth, she is very like thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this her father laughed very heartily and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBy Allah,\r\nChristian, she must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter, who\r\nis the most beautiful woman in all this kingdom: only look at her well\r\nand thou wilt see I am telling the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZoraida\xe2\x80\x99s father as the better linguist helped to interpret most of\r\nthese words and phrases, for though she spoke the bastard language,\r\nthat, as I have said, is employed there, she expressed her meaning more\r\nby signs than by words.\r\n\r\nWhile we were still engaged in this conversation, a Moor came running\r\nup, exclaiming that four Turks had leaped over the fence or wall of the\r\ngarden, and were gathering the fruit though it was not yet ripe. The\r\nold man was alarmed and Zoraida too, for the Moors commonly, and, so to\r\nspeak, instinctively have a dread of the Turks, but particularly of the\r\nsoldiers, who are so insolent and domineering to the Moors who are\r\nunder their power that they treat them worse than if they were their\r\nslaves. Her father said to Zoraida, \xe2\x80\x9cDaughter, retire into the house\r\nand shut thyself in while I go and speak to these dogs; and thou,\r\nChristian, pick thy herbs, and go in peace, and Allah bring thee safe\r\nto thy own country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bowed, and he went away to look for the Turks, leaving me alone with\r\nZoraida, who made as if she were about to retire as her father bade\r\nher; but the moment he was concealed by the trees of the garden,\r\nturning to me with her eyes full of tears she said, \xe2\x80\x9cTameji, cristiano,\r\ntameji?\xe2\x80\x9d that is to say, \xe2\x80\x9cArt thou going, Christian, art thou going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, lady, but not without thee, come what may: be on\r\nthe watch for me on the next Juma, and be not alarmed when thou seest\r\nus; for most surely we shall go to the land of the Christians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis I said in such a way that she understood perfectly all that passed\r\nbetween us, and throwing her arm round my neck she began with feeble\r\nsteps to move towards the house; but as fate would have it (and it\r\nmight have been very unfortunate if Heaven had not otherwise ordered\r\nit), just as we were moving on in the manner and position I have\r\ndescribed, with her arm round my neck, her father, as he returned after\r\nhaving sent away the Turks, saw how we were walking and we perceived\r\nthat he saw us; but Zoraida, ready and quickwitted, took care not to\r\nremove her arm from my neck, but on the contrary drew closer to me and\r\nlaid her head on my breast, bending her knees a little and showing all\r\nthe signs and tokens of fainting, while I at the same time made it seem\r\nas though I were supporting her against my will. Her father came\r\nrunning up to where we were, and seeing his daughter in this state\r\nasked what was the matter with her; she, however, giving no answer, he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt she has fainted in alarm at the entrance of those\r\ndogs,\xe2\x80\x9d and taking her from mine he drew her to his own breast, while\r\nshe sighing, her eyes still wet with tears, said again, \xe2\x80\x9cAmeji,\r\ncristiano, ameji\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGo, Christian, go.\xe2\x80\x9d To this her father replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need, daughter, for the Christian to go, for he has done\r\nthee no harm, and the Turks have now gone; feel no alarm, there is\r\nnothing to hurt thee, for as I say, the Turks at my request have gone\r\nback the way they came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc41b.jpg (320K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was they who terrified her, as thou hast said, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to\r\nher father; \xe2\x80\x9cbut since she tells me to go, I have no wish to displease\r\nher: peace be with thee, and with thy leave I will come back to this\r\ngarden for herbs if need be, for my master says there are nowhere\r\nbetter herbs for salad than here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back for any thou hast need of,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hadji Morato; \xe2\x80\x9cfor my\r\ndaughter does not speak thus because she is displeased with thee or any\r\nChristian: she only meant that the Turks should go, not thou; or that\r\nit was time for thee to look for thy herbs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this I at once took my leave of both; and she, looking as though\r\nher heart were breaking, retired with her father. While pretending to\r\nlook for herbs I made the round of the garden at my ease, and studied\r\ncarefully all the approaches and outlets, and the fastenings of the\r\nhouse and everything that could be taken advantage of to make our task\r\neasy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc41c.jpg (326K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving done so I went and gave an account of all that had taken place\r\nto the renegade and my comrades, and looked forward with impatience to\r\nthe hour when, all fear at an end, I should find myself in possession\r\nof the prize which fortune held out to me in the fair and lovely\r\nZoraida. The time passed at length, and the appointed day we so longed\r\nfor arrived; and, all following out the arrangement and plan which,\r\nafter careful consideration and many a long discussion, we had decided\r\nupon, we succeeded as fully as we could have wished; for on the Friday\r\nfollowing the day upon which I spoke to Zoraida in the garden, the\r\nrenegade anchored his vessel at nightfall almost opposite the spot\r\nwhere she was. The Christians who were to row were ready and in hiding\r\nin different places round about, all waiting for me, anxious and\r\nelated, and eager to attack the vessel they had before their eyes; for\r\nthey did not know the renegade\xe2\x80\x99s plan, but expected that they were to\r\ngain their liberty by force of arms and by killing the Moors who were\r\non board the vessel. As soon, then, as I and my comrades made our\r\nappearance, all those that were in hiding seeing us came and joined us.\r\nIt was now the time when the city gates are shut, and there was no one\r\nto be seen in all the space outside. When we were collected together we\r\ndebated whether it would be better first to go for Zoraida, or to make\r\nprisoners of the Moorish rowers who rowed in the vessel; but while we\r\nwere still uncertain our renegade came up asking us what kept us, as it\r\nwas now the time, and all the Moors were off their guard and most of\r\nthem asleep. We told him why we hesitated, but he said it was of more\r\nimportance first to secure the vessel, which could be done with the\r\ngreatest ease and without any danger, and then we could go for Zoraida.\r\nWe all approved of what he said, and so without further delay, guided\r\nby him we made for the vessel, and he leaping on board first, drew his\r\ncutlass and said in Morisco, \xe2\x80\x9cLet no one stir from this if he does not\r\nwant it to cost him his life.\xe2\x80\x9d By this almost all the Christians were\r\non board, and the Moors, who were fainthearted, hearing their captain\r\nspeak in this way, were cowed, and without any one of them taking to\r\nhis arms (and indeed they had few or hardly any) they submitted without\r\nsaying a word to be bound by the Christians, who quickly secured them,\r\nthreatening them that if they raised any kind of outcry they would be\r\nall put to the sword. This having been accomplished, and half of our\r\nparty being left to keep guard over them, the rest of us, again taking\r\nthe renegade as our guide, hastened towards Hadji Morato\xe2\x80\x99s garden, and\r\nas good luck would have it, on trying the gate it opened as easily as\r\nif it had not been locked; and so, quite quietly and in silence, we\r\nreached the house without being perceived by anybody. The lovely\r\nZoraida was watching for us at a window, and as soon as she perceived\r\nthat there were people there, she asked in a low voice if we were\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNizarani,\xe2\x80\x9d as much as to say or ask if we were Christians. I answered\r\nthat we were, and begged her to come down. As soon as she recognised me\r\nshe did not delay an instant, but without answering a word came down\r\nimmediately, opened the door and presented herself before us all, so\r\nbeautiful and so richly attired that I cannot attempt to describe her.\r\nThe moment I saw her I took her hand and kissed it, and the renegade\r\nand my two comrades did the same; and the rest, who knew nothing of the\r\ncircumstances, did as they saw us do, for it only seemed as if we were\r\nreturning thanks to her, and recognising her as the giver of our\r\nliberty. The renegade asked her in the Morisco language if her father\r\nwas in the house. She replied that he was and that he was asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it will be necessary to waken him and take him with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nrenegade, \xe2\x80\x9cand everything of value in this fair mansion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cmy father must not on any account be touched, and\r\nthere is nothing in the house except what I shall take, and that will\r\nbe quite enough to enrich and satisfy all of you; wait a little and you\r\nshall see,\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying she went in, telling us she would return\r\nimmediately and bidding us keep quiet without making any noise.\r\n\r\nI asked the renegade what had passed between them, and when he told me,\r\nI declared that nothing should be done except in accordance with the\r\nwishes of Zoraida, who now came back with a little trunk so full of\r\ngold crowns that she could scarcely carry it. Unfortunately her father\r\nawoke while this was going on, and hearing a noise in the garden, came\r\nto the window, and at once perceiving that all those who were there\r\nwere Christians, raising a prodigiously loud outcry, he began to call\r\nout in Arabic, \xe2\x80\x9cChristians, Christians! thieves, thieves!\xe2\x80\x9d by which\r\ncries we were all thrown into the greatest fear and embarrassment; but\r\nthe renegade seeing the danger we were in and how important it was for\r\nhim to effect his purpose before we were heard, mounted with the utmost\r\nquickness to where Hadji Morato was, and with him went some of our\r\nparty; I, however, did not dare to leave Zoraida, who had fallen almost\r\nfainting in my arms. To be brief, those who had gone upstairs acted so\r\npromptly that in an instant they came down, carrying Hadji Morato with\r\nhis hands bound and a napkin tied over his mouth, which prevented him\r\nfrom uttering a word, warning him at the same time that to attempt to\r\nspeak would cost him his life. When his daughter caught sight of him\r\nshe covered her eyes so as not to see him, and her father was\r\nhorror-stricken, not knowing how willingly she had placed herself in\r\nour hands. But it was now most essential for us to be on the move, and\r\ncarefully and quickly we regained the vessel, where those who had\r\nremained on board were waiting for us in apprehension of some mishap\r\nhaving befallen us. It was barely two hours after night set in when we\r\nwere all on board the vessel, where the cords were removed from the\r\nhands of Zoraida\xe2\x80\x99s father, and the napkin from his mouth; but the\r\nrenegade once more told him not to utter a word, or they would take his\r\nlife. He, when he saw his daughter there, began to sigh piteously, and\r\nstill more when he perceived that I held her closely embraced and that\r\nshe lay quiet without resisting or complaining, or showing any\r\nreluctance; nevertheless he remained silent lest they should carry into\r\neffect the repeated threats the renegade had addressed to him.\r\n\r\nFinding herself now on board, and that we were about to give way with\r\nthe oars, Zoraida, seeing her father there, and the other Moors bound,\r\nbade the renegade ask me to do her the favour of releasing the Moors\r\nand setting her father at liberty, for she would rather drown herself\r\nin the sea than suffer a father that had loved her so dearly to be\r\ncarried away captive before her eyes and on her account. The renegade\r\nrepeated this to me, and I replied that I was very willing to do so;\r\nbut he replied that it was not advisable, because if they were left\r\nthere they would at once raise the country and stir up the city, and\r\nlead to the despatch of swift cruisers in pursuit, and our being taken,\r\nby sea or land, without any possibility of escape; and that all that\r\ncould be done was to set them free on the first Christian ground we\r\nreached. On this point we all agreed; and Zoraida, to whom it was\r\nexplained, together with the reasons that prevented us from doing at\r\nonce what she desired, was satisfied likewise; and then in glad silence\r\nand with cheerful alacrity each of our stout rowers took his oar, and\r\ncommending ourselves to God with all our hearts, we began to shape our\r\ncourse for the island of Majorca, the nearest Christian land. Owing,\r\nhowever, to the Tramontana rising a little, and the sea growing\r\nsomewhat rough, it was impossible for us to keep a straight course for\r\nMajorca, and we were compelled to coast in the direction of Oran, not\r\nwithout great uneasiness on our part lest we should be observed from\r\nthe town of Shershel, which lies on that coast, not more than sixty\r\nmiles from Algiers. Moreover we were afraid of meeting on that course\r\none of the galliots that usually come with goods from Tetuan; although\r\neach of us for himself and all of us together felt confident that, if\r\nwe were to meet a merchant galliot, so that it were not a cruiser, not\r\nonly should we not be lost, but that we should take a vessel in which\r\nwe could more safely accomplish our voyage. As we pursued our course\r\nZoraida kept her head between my hands so as not to see her father, and\r\nI felt that she was praying to Lela Marien to help us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc41d.jpg (266K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe might have made about thirty miles when daybreak found us some three\r\nmusket-shots off the land, which seemed to us deserted, and without\r\nanyone to see us. For all that, however, by hard rowing we put out a\r\nlittle to sea, for it was now somewhat calmer, and having gained about\r\ntwo leagues the word was given to row by batches, while we ate\r\nsomething, for the vessel was well provided; but the rowers said it was\r\nnot a time to take any rest; let food be served out to those who were\r\nnot rowing, but they would not leave their oars on any account. This\r\nwas done, but now a stiff breeze began to blow, which obliged us to\r\nleave off rowing and make sail at once and steer for Oran, as it was\r\nimpossible to make any other course. All this was done very promptly,\r\nand under sail we ran more than eight miles an hour without any fear,\r\nexcept that of coming across some vessel out on a roving expedition. We\r\ngave the Moorish rowers some food, and the renegade comforted them by\r\ntelling them that they were not held as captives, as we should set them\r\nfree on the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe same was said to Zoraida\xe2\x80\x99s father, who replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAnything else,\r\nChristian, I might hope for or think likely from your generosity and\r\ngood behaviour, but do not think me so simple as to imagine you will\r\ngive me my liberty; for you would have never exposed yourselves to the\r\ndanger of depriving me of it only to restore it to me so generously,\r\nespecially as you know who I am and the sum you may expect to receive\r\non restoring it; and if you will only name that, I here offer you all\r\nyou require for myself and for my unhappy daughter there; or else for\r\nher alone, for she is the greatest and most precious part of my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he said this he began to weep so bitterly that he filled us all with\r\ncompassion and forced Zoraida to look at him, and when she saw him\r\nweeping she was so moved that she rose from my feet and ran to throw\r\nher arms round him, and pressing her face to his, they both gave way to\r\nsuch an outburst of tears that several of us were constrained to keep\r\nthem company.\r\n\r\nBut when her father saw her in full dress and with all her jewels about\r\nher, he said to her in his own language, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat means this, my daughter?\r\nLast night, before this terrible misfortune in which we are plunged\r\nbefell us, I saw thee in thy everyday and indoor garments; and now,\r\nwithout having had time to attire thyself, and without my bringing thee\r\nany joyful tidings to furnish an occasion for adorning and bedecking\r\nthyself, I see thee arrayed in the finest attire it would be in my\r\npower to give thee when fortune was most kind to us. Answer me this;\r\nfor it causes me greater anxiety and surprise than even this misfortune\r\nitself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe renegade interpreted to us what the Moor said to his daughter; she,\r\nhowever, returned him no answer. But when he observed in one corner of\r\nthe vessel the little trunk in which she used to keep her jewels, which\r\nhe well knew he had left in Algiers and had not brought to the garden,\r\nhe was still more amazed, and asked her how that trunk had come into\r\nour hands, and what there was in it. To which the renegade, without\r\nwaiting for Zoraida to reply, made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cDo not trouble thyself by\r\nasking thy daughter Zoraida so many questions, se\xc3\xb1or, for the one\r\nanswer I will give thee will serve for all; I would have thee know that\r\nshe is a Christian, and that it is she who has been the file for our\r\nchains and our deliverer from captivity. She is here of her own free\r\nwill, as glad, I imagine, to find herself in this position as he who\r\nescapes from darkness into the light, from death to life, and from\r\nsuffering to glory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaughter, is this true, what he says?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Moor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Zoraida.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat thou art in truth a Christian,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cand that thou\r\nhast given thy father into the power of his enemies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Zoraida made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cA Christian I am, but it is not I who\r\nhave placed thee in this position, for it never was my wish to leave\r\nthee or do thee harm, but only to do good to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what good hast thou done thyself, daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk thou that,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cof Lela Marien, for she can tell thee\r\nbetter than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Moor had hardly heard these words when with marvellous quickness he\r\nflung himself headforemost into the sea, where no doubt he would have\r\nbeen drowned had not the long and full dress he wore held him up for a\r\nlittle on the surface of the water. Zoraida cried aloud to us to save\r\nhim, and we all hastened to help, and seizing him by his robe we drew\r\nhim in half drowned and insensible, at which Zoraida was in such\r\ndistress that she wept over him as piteously and bitterly as though he\r\nwere already dead. We turned him upon his face and he voided a great\r\nquantity of water, and at the end of two hours came to himself.\r\nMeanwhile, the wind having changed we were compelled to head for the\r\nland, and ply our oars to avoid being driven on shore; but it was our\r\ngood fortune to reach a creek that lies on one side of a small\r\npromontory or cape, called by the Moors that of the \xe2\x80\x9cCava rumia,\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nin our language means \xe2\x80\x9cthe wicked Christian woman;\xe2\x80\x9d for it is a\r\ntradition among them that La Cava, through whom Spain was lost, lies\r\nburied at that spot; \xe2\x80\x9ccava\xe2\x80\x9d in their language meaning \xe2\x80\x9cwicked woman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9crumia\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cChristian;\xe2\x80\x9d moreover, they count it unlucky to anchor\r\nthere when necessity compels them, and they never do so otherwise. For\r\nus, however, it was not the resting-place of the wicked woman but a\r\nhaven of safety for our relief, so much had the sea now got up. We\r\nposted a look-out on shore, and never let the oars out of our hands,\r\nand ate of the stores the renegade had laid in, imploring God and Our\r\nLady with all our hearts to help and protect us, that we might give a\r\nhappy ending to a beginning so prosperous. At the entreaty of Zoraida\r\norders were given to set on shore her father and the other Moors who\r\nwere still bound, for she could not endure, nor could her tender heart\r\nbear to see her father in bonds and her fellow-countrymen prisoners\r\nbefore her eyes. We promised her to do this at the moment of departure,\r\nfor as it was uninhabited we ran no risk in releasing them at that\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nOur prayers were not so far in vain as to be unheard by Heaven, for\r\nafter a while the wind changed in our favour, and made the sea calm,\r\ninviting us once more to resume our voyage with a good heart. Seeing\r\nthis we unbound the Moors, and one by one put them on shore, at which\r\nthey were filled with amazement; but when we came to land Zoraida\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather, who had now completely recovered his senses, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it, think ye, Christians, that this wicked woman is rejoiced at\r\nyour giving me my liberty? Think ye it is because of the affection she\r\nbears me? Nay verily, it is only because of the hindrance my presence\r\noffers to the execution of her base designs. And think not that it is\r\nher belief that yours is better than ours that has led her to change\r\nher religion; it is only because she knows that immodesty is more\r\nfreely practised in your country than in ours.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning to\r\nZoraida, while I and another of the Christians held him fast by both\r\narms, lest he should do some mad act, he said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cInfamous girl,\r\nmisguided maiden, whither in thy blindness and madness art thou going\r\nin the hands of these dogs, our natural enemies? Cursed be the hour\r\nwhen I begot thee! Cursed the luxury and indulgence in which I reared\r\nthee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut seeing that he was not likely soon to cease I made haste to put him\r\non shore, and thence he continued his maledictions and lamentations\r\naloud; calling on Mohammed to pray to Allah to destroy us, to confound\r\nus, to make an end of us; and when, in consequence of having made sail,\r\nwe could no longer hear what he said we could see what he did; how he\r\nplucked out his beard and tore his hair and lay writhing on the ground.\r\nBut once he raised his voice to such a pitch that we were able to hear\r\nwhat he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCome back, dear daughter, come back to shore; I forgive\r\nthee all; let those men have the money, for it is theirs now, and come\r\nback to comfort thy sorrowing father, who will yield up his life on\r\nthis barren strand if thou dost leave him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc41e.jpg (281K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this Zoraida heard, and heard with sorrow and tears, and all she\r\ncould say in answer was, \xe2\x80\x9cAllah grant that Lela Marien, who has made me\r\nbecome a Christian, give thee comfort in thy sorrow, my father. Allah\r\nknows that I could not do otherwise than I have done, and that these\r\nChristians owe nothing to my will; for even had I wished not to\r\naccompany them, but remain at home, it would have been impossible for\r\nme, so eagerly did my soul urge me on to the accomplishment of this\r\npurpose, which I feel to be as righteous as to thee, dear father, it\r\nseems wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut neither could her father hear her nor we see him when she said\r\nthis; and so, while I consoled Zoraida, we turned our attention to our\r\nvoyage, in which a breeze from the right point so favoured us that we\r\nmade sure of finding ourselves off the coast of Spain on the morrow by\r\ndaybreak. But, as good seldom or never comes pure and unmixed, without\r\nbeing attended or followed by some disturbing evil that gives a shock\r\nto it, our fortune, or perhaps the curses which the Moor had hurled at\r\nhis daughter (for whatever kind of father they may come from these are\r\nalways to be dreaded), brought it about that when we were now in\r\nmid-sea, and the night about three hours spent, as we were running with\r\nall sail set and oars lashed, for the favouring breeze saved us the\r\ntrouble of using them, we saw by the light of the moon, which shone\r\nbrilliantly, a square-rigged vessel in full sail close to us, luffing\r\nup and standing across our course, and so close that we had to strike\r\nsail to avoid running foul of her, while they too put the helm hard up\r\nto let us pass. They came to the side of the ship to ask who we were,\r\nwhither we were bound, and whence we came, but as they asked this in\r\nFrench our renegade said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet no one answer, for no doubt these are\r\nFrench corsairs who plunder all comers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc41f.jpg (268K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActing on this warning no one answered a word, but after we had gone a\r\nlittle ahead, and the vessel was now lying to leeward, suddenly they\r\nfired two guns, and apparently both loaded with chain-shot, for with\r\none they cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail\r\ninto the sea, and the other, discharged at the same moment, sent a ball\r\ninto our vessel amidships, staving her in completely, but without doing\r\nany further damage. We, however, finding ourselves sinking began to\r\nshout for help and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were\r\nbeginning to fill. They then lay to, and lowering a skiff or boat, as\r\nmany as a dozen Frenchmen, well armed with match-locks, and their\r\nmatches burning, got into it and came alongside; and seeing how few we\r\nwere, and that our vessel was going down, they took us in, telling us\r\nthat this had come to us through our incivility in not giving them an\r\nanswer. Our renegade took the trunk containing Zoraida\xe2\x80\x99s wealth and\r\ndropped it into the sea without anyone perceiving what he did. In short\r\nwe went on board with the Frenchmen, who, after having ascertained all\r\nthey wanted to know about us, rifled us of everything we had, as if\r\nthey had been our bitterest enemies, and from Zoraida they took even\r\nthe anklets she wore on her feet; but the distress they caused her did\r\nnot distress me so much as the fear I was in that from robbing her of\r\nher rich and precious jewels they would proceed to rob her of the most\r\nprecious jewel that she valued more than all. The desires, however, of\r\nthose people do not go beyond money, but of that their covetousness is\r\ninsatiable, and on this occasion it was carried to such a pitch that\r\nthey would have taken even the clothes we wore as captives if they had\r\nbeen worth anything to them. It was the advice of some of them to throw\r\nus all into the sea wrapped up in a sail; for their purpose was to\r\ntrade at some of the ports of Spain, giving themselves out as Bretons,\r\nand if they brought us alive they would be punished as soon as the\r\nrobbery was discovered; but the captain (who was the one who had\r\nplundered my beloved Zoraida) said he was satisfied with the prize he\r\nhad got, and that he would not touch at any Spanish port, but pass the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar by night, or as best he could, and make for La\r\nRochelle, from which he had sailed. So they agreed by common consent to\r\ngive us the skiff belonging to their ship and all we required for the\r\nshort voyage that remained to us, and this they did the next day on\r\ncoming in sight of the Spanish coast, with which, and the joy we felt,\r\nall our sufferings and miseries were as completely forgotten as if they\r\nhad never been endured by us, such is the delight of recovering lost\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nIt may have been about mid-day when they placed us in the boat, giving\r\nus two kegs of water and some biscuit; and the captain, moved by I know\r\nnot what compassion, as the lovely Zoraida was about to embark, gave\r\nher some forty gold crowns, and would not permit his men to take from\r\nher those same garments which she has on now. We got into the boat,\r\nreturning them thanks for their kindness to us, and showing ourselves\r\ngrateful rather than indignant. They stood out to sea, steering for the\r\nstraits; we, without looking to any compass save the land we had before\r\nus, set ourselves to row with such energy that by sunset we were so\r\nnear that we might easily, we thought, land before the night was far\r\nadvanced. But as the moon did not show that night, and the sky was\r\nclouded, and as we knew not whereabouts we were, it did not seem to us\r\na prudent thing to make for the shore, as several of us advised, saying\r\nwe ought to run ourselves ashore even if it were on rocks and far from\r\nany habitation, for in this way we should be relieved from the\r\napprehensions we naturally felt of the prowling vessels of the Tetuan\r\ncorsairs, who leave Barbary at nightfall and are on the Spanish coast\r\nby daybreak, where they commonly take some prize, and then go home to\r\nsleep in their own houses. But of the conflicting counsels the one\r\nwhich was adopted was that we should approach gradually, and land where\r\nwe could if the sea were calm enough to permit us. This was done, and a\r\nlittle before midnight we drew near to the foot of a huge and lofty\r\nmountain, not so close to the sea but that it left a narrow space on\r\nwhich to land conveniently. We ran our boat up on the sand, and all\r\nsprang out and kissed the ground, and with tears of joyful satisfaction\r\nreturned thanks to God our Lord for all his incomparable goodness to us\r\non our voyage. We took out of the boat the provisions it contained, and\r\ndrew it up on the shore, and then climbed a long way up the mountain,\r\nfor even there we could not feel easy in our hearts, or persuade\r\nourselves that it was Christian soil that was now under our feet.\r\n\r\nThe dawn came, more slowly, I think, than we could have wished; we\r\ncompleted the ascent in order to see if from the summit any habitation\r\nor any shepherds\xe2\x80\x99 huts could be discovered, but strain our eyes as we\r\nmight, neither dwelling, nor human being, nor path nor road could we\r\nperceive. However, we determined to push on farther, as it could not\r\nbut be that ere long we must see someone who could tell us where we\r\nwere. But what distressed me most was to see Zoraida going on foot over\r\nthat rough ground; for though I once carried her on my shoulders, she\r\nwas more wearied by my weariness than rested by the rest; and so she\r\nwould never again allow me to undergo the exertion, and went on very\r\npatiently and cheerfully, while I led her by the hand. We had gone\r\nrather less than a quarter of a league when the sound of a little bell\r\nfell on our ears, a clear proof that there were flocks hard by, and\r\nlooking about carefully to see if any were within view, we observed a\r\nyoung shepherd tranquilly and unsuspiciously trimming a stick with his\r\nknife at the foot of a cork tree. We called to him, and he, raising his\r\nhead, sprang nimbly to his feet, for, as we afterwards learned, the\r\nfirst who presented themselves to his sight were the renegade and\r\nZoraida, and seeing them in Moorish dress he imagined that all the\r\nMoors of Barbary were upon him; and plunging with marvellous swiftness\r\ninto the thicket in front of him, he began to raise a prodigious\r\noutcry, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Moors\xe2\x80\x94the Moors have landed! To arms, to\r\narms!\xe2\x80\x9d We were all thrown into perplexity by these cries, not knowing\r\nwhat to do; but reflecting that the shouts of the shepherd would raise\r\nthe country and that the mounted coast-guard would come at once to see\r\nwhat was the matter, we agreed that the renegade must strip off his\r\nTurkish garments and put on a captive\xe2\x80\x99s jacket or coat which one of our\r\nparty gave him at once, though he himself was reduced to his shirt; and\r\nso commending ourselves to God, we followed the same road which we saw\r\nthe shepherd take, expecting every moment that the coast-guard would be\r\ndown upon us. Nor did our expectation deceive us, for two hours had not\r\npassed when, coming out of the brushwood into the open ground, we\r\nperceived some fifty mounted men swiftly approaching us at a\r\nhand-gallop. As soon as we saw them we stood still, waiting for them;\r\nbut as they came close and, instead of the Moors they were in quest of,\r\nsaw a set of poor Christians, they were taken aback, and one of them\r\nasked if it could be we who were the cause of the shepherd having\r\nraised the call to arms. I said \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d and as I was about to explain to\r\nhim what had occurred, and whence we came and who we were, one of the\r\nChristians of our party recognised the horseman who had put the\r\nquestion to us, and before I could say anything more he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks be to God, sirs, for bringing us to such good quarters; for, if\r\nI do not deceive myself, the ground we stand on is that of Velez Malaga\r\nunless, indeed, all my years of captivity have made me unable to\r\nrecollect that you, se\xc3\xb1or, who ask who we are, are Pedro de Bustamante,\r\nmy uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Christian captive had hardly uttered these words, when the horseman\r\nthrew himself off his horse, and ran to embrace the young man, crying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNephew of my soul and life! I recognise thee now; and long have I\r\nmourned thee as dead, I, and my sister, thy mother, and all thy kin\r\nthat are still alive, and whom God has been pleased to preserve that\r\nthey may enjoy the happiness of seeing thee. We knew long since that\r\nthou wert in Algiers, and from the appearance of thy garments and those\r\nof all this company, I conclude that ye have had a miraculous\r\nrestoration to liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cand by-and-by we will tell you\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as the horsemen understood that we were Christian captives,\r\nthey dismounted from their horses, and each offered his to carry us to\r\nthe city of Velez Malaga, which was a league and a half distant. Some\r\nof them went to bring the boat to the city, we having told them where\r\nwe had left it; others took us up behind them, and Zoraida was placed\r\non the horse of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s uncle. The whole town came out to meet\r\nus, for they had by this time heard of our arrival from one who had\r\ngone on in advance. They were not astonished to see liberated captives\r\nor captive Moors, for people on that coast are well used to see both\r\none and the other; but they were astonished at the beauty of Zoraida,\r\nwhich was just then heightened, as well by the exertion of travelling\r\nas by joy at finding herself on Christian soil, and relieved of all\r\nfear of being lost; for this had brought such a glow upon her face,\r\nthat unless my affection for her were deceiving me, I would venture to\r\nsay that there was not a more beautiful creature in the world\xe2\x80\x94at least,\r\nthat I had ever seen. We went straight to the church to return thanks\r\nto God for the mercies we had received, and when Zoraida entered it she\r\nsaid there were faces there like Lela Marien\xe2\x80\x99s. We told her they were\r\nher images; and as well as he could the renegade explained to her what\r\nthey meant, that she might adore them as if each of them were the very\r\nsame Lela Marien that had spoken to her; and she, having great\r\nintelligence and a quick and clear instinct, understood at once all he\r\nsaid to her about them. Thence they took us away and distributed us all\r\nin different houses in the town; but as for the renegade, Zoraida, and\r\nmyself, the Christian who came with us brought us to the house of his\r\nparents, who had a fair share of the gifts of fortune, and treated us\r\nwith as much kindness as they did their own son.\r\n\r\nWe remained six days in Velez, at the end of which the renegade, having\r\ninformed himself of all that was requisite for him to do, set out for\r\nthe city of Granada to restore himself to the sacred bosom of the\r\nChurch through the medium of the Holy Inquisition. The other released\r\ncaptives took their departures, each the way that seemed best to him,\r\nand Zoraida and I were left alone, with nothing more than the crowns\r\nwhich the courtesy of the Frenchman had bestowed upon Zoraida, out of\r\nwhich I bought the beast on which she rides; and, I for the present\r\nattending her as her father and squire and not as her husband, we are\r\nnow going to ascertain if my father is living, or if any of my brothers\r\nhas had better fortune than mine has been; though, as Heaven has made\r\nme the companion of Zoraida, I think no other lot could be assigned to\r\nme, however happy, that I would rather have. The patience with which\r\nshe endures the hardships that poverty brings with it, and the\r\neagerness she shows to become a Christian, are such that they fill me\r\nwith admiration, and bind me to serve her all my life; though the\r\nhappiness I feel in seeing myself hers, and her mine, is disturbed and\r\nmarred by not knowing whether I shall find any corner to shelter her in\r\nmy own country, or whether time and death may not have made such\r\nchanges in the fortunes and lives of my father and brothers, that I\r\nshall hardly find anyone who knows me, if they are not alive.\r\n\r\nI have no more of my story to tell you, gentlemen; whether it be an\r\ninteresting or a curious one let your better judgments decide; all I\r\ncan say is I would gladly have told it to you more briefly; although my\r\nfear of wearying you has made me leave out more than one circumstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc41g.jpg (33K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF WHAT FURTHER TOOK PLACE IN THE INN, AND OF SEVERAL\r\nOTHER THINGS WORTH KNOWING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc42a.jpg (139K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these words the captive held his peace, and Don Fernando said to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, captain, the manner in which you have related this\r\nremarkable adventure has been such as befitted the novelty and\r\nstrangeness of the matter. The whole story is curious and uncommon, and\r\nabounds with incidents that fill the hearers with wonder and\r\nastonishment; and so great is the pleasure we have found in listening\r\nto it that we should be glad if it were to begin again, even though\r\nto-morrow were to find us still occupied with the same tale.\xe2\x80\x9d And while\r\nhe said this Cardenio and the rest of them offered to be of service to\r\nhim in any way that lay in their power, and in words and language so\r\nkindly and sincere that the captain was much gratified by their\r\ngood-will. In particular Don Fernando offered, if he would go back with\r\nhim, to get his brother the marquis to become godfather at the baptism\r\nof Zoraida, and on his own part to provide him with the means of making\r\nhis appearance in his own country with the credit and comfort he was\r\nentitled to. For all this the captive returned thanks very courteously,\r\nalthough he would not accept any of their generous offers.\r\n\r\nBy this time night closed in, and as it did, there came up to the inn a\r\ncoach attended by some men on horseback, who demanded accommodation; to\r\nwhich the landlady replied that there was not a hand\xe2\x80\x99s breadth of the\r\nwhole inn unoccupied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, for all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of those who had entered on horseback,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9croom must be found for his lordship the Judge here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this name the landlady was taken aback, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, the fact\r\nis I have no beds; but if his lordship the Judge carries one with him,\r\nas no doubt he does, let him come in and welcome; for my husband and I\r\nwill give up our room to accommodate his worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, so be it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the squire; but in the meantime a man had\r\ngot out of the coach whose dress indicated at a glance the office and\r\npost he held, for the long robe with ruffled sleeves that he wore\r\nshowed that he was, as his servant said, a Judge of appeal. He led by\r\nthe hand a young girl in a travelling dress, apparently about sixteen\r\nyears of age, and of such a high-bred air, so beautiful and so\r\ngraceful, that all were filled with admiration when she made her\r\nappearance, and but for having seen Dorothea, Luscinda, and Zoraida,\r\nwho were there in the inn, they would have fancied that a beauty like\r\nthat of this maiden\xe2\x80\x99s would have been hard to find. Don Quixote was\r\npresent at the entrance of the Judge with the young lady, and as soon\r\nas he saw him he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYour worship may with confidence enter and take\r\nyour ease in this castle; for though the accommodation be scanty and\r\npoor, there are no quarters so cramped or inconvenient that they cannot\r\nmake room for arms and letters; above all if arms and letters have\r\nbeauty for a guide and leader, as letters represented by your worship\r\nhave in this fair maiden, to whom not only ought castles to throw\r\nthemselves open and yield themselves up, but rocks should rend\r\nthemselves asunder and mountains divide and bow themselves down to give\r\nher a reception. Enter, your worship, I say, into this paradise, for\r\nhere you will find stars and suns to accompany the heaven your worship\r\nbrings with you, here you will find arms in their supreme excellence,\r\nand beauty in its highest perfection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Judge was struck with amazement at the language of Don Quixote,\r\nwhom he scrutinized very carefully, no less astonished by his figure\r\nthan by his talk; and before he could find words to answer him he had a\r\nfresh surprise, when he saw opposite to him Luscinda, Dorothea, and\r\nZoraida, who, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the\r\nyoung lady, had come to see her and welcome her; Don Fernando,\r\nCardenio, and the curate, however, greeted him in a more intelligible\r\nand polished style. In short, the Judge made his entrance in a state of\r\nbewilderment, as well with what he saw as what he heard, and the fair\r\nladies of the inn gave the fair damsel a cordial welcome. On the whole\r\nhe could perceive that all who were there were people of quality; but\r\nwith the figure, countenance, and bearing of Don Quixote he was at his\r\nwits\xe2\x80\x99 end; and all civilities having been exchanged, and the\r\naccommodation of the inn inquired into, it was settled, as it had been\r\nbefore settled, that all the women should retire to the garret that has\r\nbeen already mentioned, and that the men should remain outside as if to\r\nguard them; the Judge, therefore, was very well pleased to allow his\r\ndaughter, for such the damsel was, to go with the ladies, which she did\r\nvery willingly; and with part of the host\xe2\x80\x99s narrow bed and half of what\r\nthe Judge had brought with him, they made a more comfortable\r\narrangement for the night than they had expected.\r\n\r\nThe captive, whose heart had leaped within him the instant he saw the\r\nJudge, telling him somehow that this was his brother, asked one of the\r\nservants who accompanied him what his name was, and whether he knew\r\nfrom what part of the country he came. The servant replied that he was\r\ncalled the Licentiate Juan Perez de Viedma, and that he had heard it\r\nsaid he came from a village in the mountains of Leon. From this\r\nstatement, and what he himself had seen, he felt convinced that this\r\nwas his brother who had adopted letters by his father\xe2\x80\x99s advice; and\r\nexcited and rejoiced, he called Don Fernando and Cardenio and the\r\ncurate aside, and told them how the matter stood, assuring them that\r\nthe judge was his brother. The servant had further informed him that he\r\nwas now going to the Indies with the appointment of Judge of the\r\nSupreme Court of Mexico; and he had learned, likewise, that the young\r\nlady was his daughter, whose mother had died in giving birth to her,\r\nand that he was very rich in consequence of the dowry left to him with\r\nthe daughter. He asked their advice as to what means he should adopt to\r\nmake himself known, or to ascertain beforehand whether, when he had\r\nmade himself known, his brother, seeing him so poor, would be ashamed\r\nof him, or would receive him with a warm heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it to me to find out that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cthough there is no\r\nreason for supposing, se\xc3\xb1or captain, that you will not be kindly\r\nreceived, because the worth and wisdom that your brother\xe2\x80\x99s bearing\r\nshows him to possess do not make it likely that he will prove haughty\r\nor insensible, or that he will not know how to estimate the accidents\r\nof fortune at their proper value.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not make myself known abruptly, but\r\nin some indirect way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you already,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I will manage it in a\r\nway to satisfy us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time supper was ready, and they all took their seats at the\r\ntable, except the captive, and the ladies, who supped by themselves in\r\ntheir own room. In the middle of supper the curate said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a comrade of your worship\xe2\x80\x99s name, Se\xc3\xb1or Judge, in\r\nConstantinople, where I was a captive for several years, and that same\r\ncomrade was one of the stoutest soldiers and captains in the whole\r\nSpanish infantry; but he had as large a share of misfortune as he had\r\nof gallantry and courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how was the captain called, se\xc3\xb1or?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was called Ruy Perez de Viedma,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cand he was\r\nborn in a village in the mountains of Leon; and he mentioned a\r\ncircumstance connected with his father and his brothers which, had it\r\nnot been told me by so truthful a man as he was, I should have set down\r\nas one of those fables the old women tell over the fire in winter; for\r\nhe said his father had divided his property among his three sons and\r\nhad addressed words of advice to them sounder than any of Cato\xe2\x80\x99s. But I\r\ncan say this much, that the choice he made of going to the wars was\r\nattended with such success, that by his gallant conduct and courage,\r\nand without any help save his own merit, he rose in a few years to be\r\ncaptain of infantry, and to see himself on the high-road and in\r\nposition to be given the command of a corps before long; but Fortune\r\nwas against him, for where he might have expected her favour he lost\r\nit, and with it his liberty, on that glorious day when so many\r\nrecovered theirs, at the battle of Lepanto. I lost mine at the Goletta,\r\nand after a variety of adventures we found ourselves comrades at\r\nConstantinople. Thence he went to Algiers, where he met with one of the\r\nmost extraordinary adventures that ever befell anyone in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the curate went on to relate briefly his brother\xe2\x80\x99s adventure with\r\nZoraida; to all which the Judge gave such an attentive hearing that he\r\nnever before had been so much of a hearer. The curate, however, only\r\nwent so far as to describe how the Frenchmen plundered those who were\r\nin the boat, and the poverty and distress in which his comrade and the\r\nfair Moor were left, of whom he said he had not been able to learn what\r\nbecame of them, or whether they had reached Spain, or been carried to\r\nFrance by the Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nThe captain, standing a little to one side, was listening to all the\r\ncurate said, and watching every movement of his brother, who, as soon\r\nas he perceived the curate had made an end of his story, gave a deep\r\nsigh and said with his eyes full of tears, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, se\xc3\xb1or, if you only knew\r\nwhat news you have given me and how it comes home to me, making me show\r\nhow I feel it with these tears that spring from my eyes in spite of all\r\nmy worldly wisdom and self-restraint! That brave captain that you speak\r\nof is my eldest brother, who, being of a bolder and loftier mind than\r\nmy other brother or myself, chose the honourable and worthy calling of\r\narms, which was one of the three careers our father proposed to us, as\r\nyour comrade mentioned in that fable you thought he was telling you. I\r\nfollowed that of letters, in which God and my own exertions have raised\r\nme to the position in which you see me. My second brother is in Peru,\r\nso wealthy that with what he has sent to my father and to me he has\r\nfully repaid the portion he took with him, and has even furnished my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s hands with the means of gratifying his natural generosity,\r\nwhile I too have been enabled to pursue my studies in a more becoming\r\nand creditable fashion, and so to attain my present standing. My father\r\nis still alive, though dying with anxiety to hear of his eldest son,\r\nand he prays God unceasingly that death may not close his eyes until he\r\nhas looked upon those of his son; but with regard to him what surprises\r\nme is, that having so much common sense as he had, he should have\r\nneglected to give any intelligence about himself, either in his\r\ntroubles and sufferings, or in his prosperity, for if his father or any\r\nof us had known of his condition he need not have waited for that\r\nmiracle of the reed to obtain his ransom; but what now disquiets me is\r\nthe uncertainty whether those Frenchmen may have restored him to\r\nliberty, or murdered him to hide the robbery. All this will make me\r\ncontinue my journey, not with the satisfaction in which I began it, but\r\nin the deepest melancholy and sadness. Oh dear brother! that I only\r\nknew where thou art now, and I would hasten to seek thee out and\r\ndeliver thee from thy sufferings, though it were to cost me suffering\r\nmyself! Oh that I could bring news to our old father that thou art\r\nalive, even wert thou in the deepest dungeon of Barbary; for his wealth\r\nand my brother\xe2\x80\x99s and mine would rescue thee thence! Oh beautiful and\r\ngenerous Zoraida, that I could repay thy goodness to a brother! That I\r\ncould be present at the new birth of thy soul, and at thy bridal that\r\nwould give us all such happiness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this and more the Judge uttered with such deep emotion at the news\r\nhe had received of his brother that all who heard him shared in it,\r\nshowing their sympathy with his sorrow. The curate, seeing, then, how\r\nwell he had succeeded in carrying out his purpose and the captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwishes, had no desire to keep them unhappy any longer, so he rose from\r\nthe table and going into the room where Zoraida was he took her by the\r\nhand, Luscinda, Dorothea, and the Judge\xe2\x80\x99s daughter following her. The\r\ncaptain was waiting to see what the curate would do, when the latter,\r\ntaking him with the other hand, advanced with both of them to where the\r\nJudge and the other gentlemen were and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet your tears cease to\r\nflow, Se\xc3\xb1or Judge, and the wish of your heart be gratified as fully as\r\nyou could desire, for you have before you your worthy brother and your\r\ngood sister-in-law. He whom you see here is the Captain Viedma, and\r\nthis is the fair Moor who has been so good to him. The Frenchmen I told\r\nyou of have reduced them to the state of poverty you see that you may\r\nshow the generosity of your kind heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain ran to embrace his brother, who placed both hands on his\r\nbreast so as to have a good look at him, holding him a little way off\r\nbut as soon as he had fully recognised him he clasped him in his arms\r\nso closely, shedding such tears of heartfelt joy, that most of those\r\npresent could not but join in them. The words the brothers exchanged,\r\nthe emotion they showed can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much less\r\nput down in writing. They told each other in a few words the events of\r\ntheir lives; they showed the true affection of brothers in all its\r\nstrength; then the judge embraced Zoraida, putting all he possessed at\r\nher disposal; then he made his daughter embrace her, and the fair\r\nChristian and the lovely Moor drew fresh tears from every eye. And\r\nthere was Don Quixote observing all these strange proceedings\r\nattentively without uttering a word, and attributing the whole to\r\nchimeras of knight-errantry. Then they agreed that the captain and\r\nZoraida should return with his brother to Seville, and send news to his\r\nfather of his having been delivered and found, so as to enable him to\r\ncome and be present at the marriage and baptism of Zoraida, for it was\r\nimpossible for the Judge to put off his journey, as he was informed\r\nthat in a month from that time the fleet was to sail from Seville for\r\nNew Spain, and to miss the passage would have been a great\r\ninconvenience to him. In short, everybody was well pleased and glad at\r\nthe captive\xe2\x80\x99s good fortune; and as now almost two-thirds of the night\r\nwere past, they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it. Don\r\nQuixote offered to mount guard over the castle lest they should be\r\nattacked by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel, covetous of the\r\ngreat treasure of beauty the castle contained. Those who understood him\r\nreturned him thanks for this service, and they gave the Judge an\r\naccount of his extraordinary humour, with which he was not a little\r\namused. Sancho Panza alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for\r\nretiring to rest; and he of all was the one that made himself most\r\ncomfortable, as he stretched himself on the trappings of his ass,\r\nwhich, as will be told farther on, cost him so dear.\r\n\r\nThe ladies, then, having retired to their chamber, and the others\r\nhaving disposed themselves with as little discomfort as they could, Don\r\nQuixote sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he\r\nhad promised. It happened, however, that a little before the approach\r\nof dawn a voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies\r\nthat it forced them all to listen attentively, but especially Dorothea,\r\nwho had been awake, and by whose side Do\xc3\xb1a Clara de Viedma, for so the\r\nJudge\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was called, lay sleeping. No one could imagine who it\r\nwas that sang so sweetly, and the voice was unaccompanied by any\r\ninstrument. At one moment it seemed to them as if the singer were in\r\nthe courtyard, at another in the stable; and as they were all\r\nattention, wondering, Cardenio came to the door and said, \xe2\x80\x9cListen,\r\nwhoever is not asleep, and you will hear a muleteer\xe2\x80\x99s voice that\r\nenchants as it chants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are listening to it already, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorothea; on which\r\nCardenio went away; and Dorothea, giving all her attention to it, made\r\nout the words of the song to be these:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc42e.jpg (11K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE PLEASANT STORY OF THE MULETEER, TOGETHER WITH\r\nOTHER STRANGE THINGS THAT CAME TO PASS IN THE INN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc43a.jpg (127K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAh me, Love\xe2\x80\x99s mariner am I\r\nOn Love\xe2\x80\x99s deep ocean sailing;\r\nI know not where the haven lies,\r\nI dare not hope to gain it.\r\n\r\nOne solitary distant star\r\nIs all I have to guide me,\r\nA brighter orb than those of old\r\nThat Palinurus lighted.\r\n\r\nAnd vaguely drifting am I borne,\r\nI know not where it leads me;\r\nI fix my gaze on it alone,\r\nOf all beside it heedless.\r\n\r\nBut over-cautious prudery,\r\nAnd coyness cold and cruel,\r\nWhen most I need it, these, like clouds,\r\nIts longed-for light refuse me.\r\n\r\nBright star, goal of my yearning eyes\r\nAs thou above me beamest,\r\nWhen thou shalt hide thee from my sight\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll know that death is near me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe singer had got so far when it struck Dorothea that it was not fair\r\nto let Clara miss hearing such a sweet voice, so, shaking her from side\r\nto side, she woke her, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, child, for waking thee, but I do so that thou mayest have\r\nthe pleasure of hearing the best voice thou hast ever heard, perhaps,\r\nin all thy life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClara awoke quite drowsy, and not understanding at the moment what\r\nDorothea said, asked her what it was; she repeated what she had said,\r\nand Clara became attentive at once; but she had hardly heard two lines,\r\nas the singer continued, when a strange trembling seized her, as if she\r\nwere suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, and throwing her\r\narms round Dorothea she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dear lady of my soul and life! why did you wake me? The greatest\r\nkindness fortune could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears so\r\nas neither to see or hear that unhappy musician.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou talking about, child?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorothea. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they say\r\nthis singer is a muleteer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, he is the lord of many places,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Clara, \xe2\x80\x9cand that one in\r\nmy heart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him, unless\r\nhe be willing to surrender it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl, for it seemed\r\nto be far beyond such experience of life as her tender years gave any\r\npromise of, so she said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak in such a way that I cannot understand you, Se\xc3\xb1ora Clara;\r\nexplain yourself more clearly, and tell me what is this you are saying\r\nabout hearts and places and this musician whose voice has so moved you?\r\nBut do not tell me anything now; I do not want to lose the pleasure I\r\nget from listening to the singer by giving my attention to your\r\ntransports, for I perceive he is beginning to sing a new strain and a\r\nnew air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Clara; and not to hear him she\r\nstopped both ears with her hands, at which Dorothea was again\r\nsurprised; but turning her attention to the song she found that it ran\r\nin this fashion:\r\n\r\nSweet Hope, my stay,\r\nThat onward to the goal of thy intent\r\nDost make thy way,\r\nHeedless of hindrance or impediment,\r\nHave thou no fear\r\nIf at each step thou findest death is near.\r\n\r\nNo victory,\r\nNo joy of triumph doth the faint heart know;\r\nUnblest is he\r\nThat a bold front to Fortune dares not show,\r\nBut soul and sense\r\nIn bondage yieldeth up to indolence.\r\n\r\nIf Love his wares\r\nDo dearly sell, his right must be contest;\r\nWhat gold compares\r\nWith that whereon his stamp he hath imprest?\r\nAnd all men know\r\nWhat costeth little that we rate but low.\r\n\r\nLove resolute\r\nKnows not the word \xe2\x80\x9cimpossibility;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd though my suit\r\nBeset by endless obstacles I see,\r\nYet no despair\r\nShall hold me bound to earth while heaven is there.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the voice ceased and Clara\xe2\x80\x99s sobs began afresh, all which excited\r\nDorothea\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity to know what could be the cause of singing so\r\nsweet and weeping so bitter, so she again asked her what it was she was\r\ngoing to say before. On this Clara, afraid that Luscinda might overhear\r\nher, winding her arms tightly round Dorothea put her mouth so close to\r\nher ear that she could speak without fear of being heard by anyone\r\nelse, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis singer, dear se\xc3\xb1ora, is the son of a gentleman of Aragon, lord of\r\ntwo villages, who lives opposite my father\xe2\x80\x99s house at Madrid; and\r\nthough my father had curtains to the windows of his house in winter,\r\nand lattice-work in summer, in some way\xe2\x80\x94I know not how\xe2\x80\x94this gentleman,\r\nwho was pursuing his studies, saw me, whether in church or elsewhere, I\r\ncannot tell, and, in fact, fell in love with me, and gave me to know it\r\nfrom the windows of his house, with so many signs and tears that I was\r\nforced to believe him, and even to love him, without knowing what it\r\nwas he wanted of me. One of the signs he used to make me was to link\r\none hand in the other, to show me he wished to marry me; and though I\r\nshould have been glad if that could be, being alone and motherless I\r\nknew not whom to open my mind to, and so I left it as it was, showing\r\nhim no favour, except when my father, and his too, were from home, to\r\nraise the curtain or the lattice a little and let him see me plainly,\r\nat which he would show such delight that he seemed as if he were going\r\nmad. Meanwhile the time for my father\xe2\x80\x99s departure arrived, which he\r\nbecame aware of, but not from me, for I had never been able to tell him\r\nof it. He fell sick, of grief I believe, and so the day we were going\r\naway I could not see him to take farewell of him, were it only with the\r\neyes. But after we had been two days on the road, on entering the\r\nposada of a village a day\xe2\x80\x99s journey from this, I saw him at the inn\r\ndoor in the dress of a muleteer, and so well disguised, that if I did\r\nnot carry his image graven on my heart it would have been impossible\r\nfor me to recognise him. But I knew him, and I was surprised, and glad;\r\nhe watched me, unsuspected by my father, from whom he always hides\r\nhimself when he crosses my path on the road, or in the posadas where we\r\nhalt; and, as I know what he is, and reflect that for love of me he\r\nmakes this journey on foot in all this hardship, I am ready to die of\r\nsorrow; and where he sets foot there I set my eyes. I know not with\r\nwhat object he has come; or how he could have got away from his father,\r\nwho loves him beyond measure, having no other heir, and because he\r\ndeserves it, as you will perceive when you see him. And moreover, I can\r\ntell you, all that he sings is out of his own head; for I have heard\r\nthem say he is a great scholar and poet; and what is more, every time I\r\nsee him or hear him sing I tremble all over, and am terrified lest my\r\nfather should recognise him and come to know of our loves. I have never\r\nspoken a word to him in my life; and for all that I love him so that I\r\ncould not live without him. This, dear se\xc3\xb1ora, is all I have to tell\r\nyou about the musician whose voice has delighted you so much; and from\r\nit alone you might easily perceive he is no muleteer, but a lord of\r\nhearts and towns, as I told you already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay no more, Do\xc3\xb1a Clara,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorothea at this, at the same time\r\nkissing her a thousand times over, \xe2\x80\x9csay no more, I tell you, but wait\r\ntill day comes; when I trust in God to arrange this affair of yours so\r\nthat it may have the happy ending such an innocent beginning deserves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Do\xc3\xb1a Clara, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat end can be hoped for when his\r\nfather is of such lofty position, and so wealthy, that he would think I\r\nwas not fit to be even a servant to his son, much less wife? And as to\r\nmarrying without the knowledge of my father, I would not do it for all\r\nthe world. I would not ask anything more than that this youth should go\r\nback and leave me; perhaps with not seeing him, and the long distance\r\nwe shall have to travel, the pain I suffer now may become easier;\r\nthough I daresay the remedy I propose will do me very little good. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how the devil this has come about, or how this love I have\r\nfor him got in; I such a young girl, and he such a mere boy; for I\r\nverily believe we are both of an age, and I am not sixteen yet; for I\r\nwill be sixteen Michaelmas Day, next, my father says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorothea could not help laughing to hear how like a child Do\xc3\xb1a Clara\r\nspoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to sleep now, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the little of\r\nthe night that I fancy is left to us: God will soon send us daylight,\r\nand we will set all to rights, or it will go hard with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this they fell asleep, and deep silence reigned all through the\r\ninn. The only persons not asleep were the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter and her\r\nservant Maritornes, who, knowing the weak point of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhumour, and that he was outside the inn mounting guard in armour and on\r\nhorseback, resolved, the pair of them, to play some trick upon him, or\r\nat any rate to amuse themselves for a while by listening to his\r\nnonsense. As it so happened there was not a window in the whole inn\r\nthat looked outwards except a hole in the wall of a straw-loft through\r\nwhich they used to throw out the straw. At this hole the two\r\ndemi-damsels posted themselves, and observed Don Quixote on his horse,\r\nleaning on his pike and from time to time sending forth such deep and\r\ndoleful sighs, that he seemed to pluck up his soul by the roots with\r\neach of them; and they could hear him, too, saying in a soft, tender,\r\nloving tone, \xe2\x80\x9cOh my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, perfection of all beauty,\r\nsummit and crown of discretion, treasure house of grace, depositary of\r\nvirtue, and finally, ideal of all that is good, honourable, and\r\ndelectable in this world! What is thy grace doing now? Art thou,\r\nperchance, mindful of thy enslaved knight who of his own free will hath\r\nexposed himself to so great perils, and all to serve thee? Give me\r\ntidings of her, oh luminary of the three faces! Perhaps at this moment,\r\nenvious of hers, thou art regarding her, either as she paces to and fro\r\nsome gallery of her sumptuous palaces, or leans over some balcony,\r\nmeditating how, whilst preserving her purity and greatness, she may\r\nmitigate the tortures this wretched heart of mine endures for her sake,\r\nwhat glory should recompense my sufferings, what repose my toil, and\r\nlastly what death my life, and what reward my services? And thou, oh\r\nsun, that art now doubtless harnessing thy steeds in haste to rise\r\nbetimes and come forth to see my lady; when thou seest her I entreat of\r\nthee to salute her on my behalf: but have a care, when thou shalt see\r\nher and salute her, that thou kiss not her face; for I shall be more\r\njealous of thee than thou wert of that light-footed ingrate that made\r\nthee sweat and run so on the plains of Thessaly, or on the banks of the\r\nPeneus (for I do not exactly recollect where it was thou didst run on\r\nthat occasion) in thy jealousy and love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote had got so far in his pathetic speech when the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter began to signal to him, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, come over here,\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these signals and voice Don Quixote turned his head and saw by the\r\nlight of the moon, which then was in its full splendour, that someone\r\nwas calling to him from the hole in the wall, which seemed to him to be\r\na window, and what is more, with a gilt grating, as rich castles, such\r\nas he believed the inn to be, ought to have; and it immediately\r\nsuggested itself to his imagination that, as on the former occasion,\r\nthe fair damsel, the daughter of the lady of the castle, overcome by\r\nlove for him, was once more endeavouring to win his affections; and\r\nwith this idea, not to show himself discourteous, or ungrateful, he\r\nturned Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s head and approached the hole, and as he perceived\r\nthe two wenches he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pity you, beauteous lady, that you should have directed your\r\nthoughts of love to a quarter from whence it is impossible that such a\r\nreturn can be made to you as is due to your great merit and gentle\r\nbirth, for which you must not blame this unhappy knight-errant whom\r\nlove renders incapable of submission to any other than her whom, the\r\nfirst moment his eyes beheld her, he made absolute mistress of his\r\nsoul. Forgive me, noble lady, and retire to your apartment, and do not,\r\nby any further declaration of your passion, compel me to show myself\r\nmore ungrateful; and if, of the love you bear me, you should find that\r\nthere is anything else in my power wherein I can gratify you, provided\r\nit be not love itself, demand it of me; for I swear to you by that\r\nsweet absent enemy of mine to grant it this instant, though it be that\r\nyou require of me a lock of Medusa\xe2\x80\x99s hair, which was all snakes, or\r\neven the very beams of the sun shut up in a vial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maritornes\r\nat this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don\r\nQuixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one of your fair hands,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maritornes, \xe2\x80\x9cto enable her to vent\r\nover it the great passion, passion which has brought her to this\r\nloophole, so much to the risk of her honour; for if the lord her father\r\nhad heard her, the least slice he would cut off her would be her ear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see that tried,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he had better\r\nbeware of that, if he does not want to meet the most disastrous end\r\nthat ever father in the world met for having laid hands on the tender\r\nlimbs of a love-stricken daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaritornes felt sure that Don Quixote would present the hand she had\r\nasked, and making up her mind what to do, she got down from the hole\r\nand went into the stable, where she took the halter of Sancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nass, and in all haste returned to the hole, just as Don Quixote had\r\nplanted himself standing on Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s saddle in order to reach the\r\ngrated window where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and giving\r\nher his hand, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cLady, take this hand, or rather this scourge of\r\nthe evil-doers of the earth; take, I say, this hand which no other hand\r\nof woman has ever touched, not even hers who has complete possession of\r\nmy entire body. I present it to you, not that you may kiss it, but that\r\nyou may observe the contexture of the sinews, the close network of the\r\nmuscles, the breadth and capacity of the veins, whence you may infer\r\nwhat must be the strength of the arm that has such a hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat we shall see presently,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maritornes, and making a running\r\nknot on the halter, she passed it over his wrist and coming down from\r\nthe hole tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the\r\nstraw-loft.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote, feeling the roughness of the rope on his wrist, exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour grace seems to be grating rather than caressing my hand; treat it\r\nnot so harshly, for it is not to blame for the offence my resolution\r\nhas given you, nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a\r\npart; remember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself so\r\ncruelly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut there was nobody now to listen to these words of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s, for\r\nas soon as Maritornes had tied him she and the other made off, ready to\r\ndie with laughing, leaving him fastened in such a way that it was\r\nimpossible for him to release himself.\r\n\r\nHe was, as has been said, standing on Rocinante, with his arm passed\r\nthrough the hole and his wrist tied to the bolt of the door, and in\r\nmighty fear and dread of being left hanging by the arm if Rocinante\r\nwere to stir one side or the other; so he did not dare to make the\r\nleast movement, although from the patience and imperturbable\r\ndisposition of Rocinante, he had good reason to expect that he would\r\nstand without budging for a whole century. Finding himself fast, then,\r\nand that the ladies had retired, he began to fancy that all this was\r\ndone by enchantment, as on the former occasion when in that same castle\r\nthat enchanted Moor of a carrier had belaboured him; and he cursed in\r\nhis heart his own want of sense and judgment in venturing to enter the\r\ncastle again, after having come off so badly the first time; it being a\r\nsettled point with knights-errant that when they have tried an\r\nadventure, and have not succeeded in it, it is a sign that it is not\r\nreserved for them but for others, and that therefore they need not try\r\nit again. Nevertheless he pulled his arm to see if he could release\r\nhimself, but it had been made so fast that all his efforts were in\r\nvain. It is true he pulled it gently lest Rocinante should move, but\r\ntry as he might to seat himself in the saddle, he had nothing for it\r\nbut to stand upright or pull his hand off. Then it was he wished for\r\nthe sword of Amadis, against which no enchantment whatever had any\r\npower; then he cursed his ill fortune; then he magnified the loss the\r\nworld would sustain by his absence while he remained there enchanted,\r\nfor that he believed he was beyond all doubt; then he once more took to\r\nthinking of his beloved Dulcinea del Toboso; then he called to his\r\nworthy squire Sancho Panza, who, buried in sleep and stretched upon the\r\npack-saddle of his ass, was oblivious, at that moment, of the mother\r\nthat bore him; then he called upon the sages Lirgandeo and Alquife to\r\ncome to his aid; then he invoked his good friend Urganda to succour\r\nhim; and then, at last, morning found him in such a state of\r\ndesperation and perplexity that he was bellowing like a bull, for he\r\nhad no hope that day would bring any relief to his suffering, which he\r\nbelieved would last for ever, inasmuch as he was enchanted; and of this\r\nhe was convinced by seeing that Rocinante never stirred, much or\r\nlittle, and he felt persuaded that he and his horse were to remain in\r\nthis state, without eating or drinking or sleeping, until the malign\r\ninfluence of the stars was overpast, or until some other more sage\r\nenchanter should disenchant him.\r\n\r\nBut he was very much deceived in this conclusion, for daylight had\r\nhardly begun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on\r\nhorseback, well equipped and accoutred, with firelocks across their\r\nsaddle-bows. They called out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn,\r\nwhich was still shut; on seeing which, Don Quixote, even there where he\r\nwas, did not forget to act as sentinel, and said in a loud and\r\nimperious tone, \xe2\x80\x9cKnights, or squires, or whatever ye be, ye have no\r\nright to knock at the gates of this castle; for it is plain enough that\r\nthey who are within are either asleep, or else are not in the habit of\r\nthrowing open the fortress until the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays are spread over the\r\nwhole surface of the earth. Withdraw to a distance, and wait till it is\r\nbroad daylight, and then we shall see whether it will be proper or not\r\nto open to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil fortress or castle is this,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, \xe2\x80\x9cto make us\r\nstand on such ceremony? If you are the innkeeper bid them open to us;\r\nwe are travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on, for we\r\nare in haste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you look like,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know that\r\nyou are talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA castle it is,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cnay, more, one of the best in\r\nthis whole province, and it has within it people who have had the\r\nsceptre in the hand and the crown on the head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be better if it were the other way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nsceptre on the head and the crown in the hand; but if so, maybe there\r\nis within some company of players, with whom it is a common thing to\r\nhave those crowns and sceptres you speak of; for in such a small inn as\r\nthis, and where such silence is kept, I do not believe any people\r\nentitled to crowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know but little of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9csince you\r\nare ignorant of what commonly occurs in knight-errantry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the comrades of the spokesman, growing weary of the dialogue with\r\nDon Quixote, renewed their knocks with great vehemence, so much so that\r\nthe host, and not only he but everybody in the inn, awoke, and he got\r\nup to ask who knocked. It happened at this moment that one of the\r\nhorses of the four who were seeking admittance went to smell Rocinante,\r\nwho melancholy, dejected, and with drooping ears stood motionless,\r\nsupporting his sorely stretched master; and as he was, after all,\r\nflesh, though he looked as if he were made of wood, he could not help\r\ngiving way and in return smelling the one who had come to offer him\r\nattentions. But he had hardly moved at all when Don Quixote lost his\r\nfooting; and slipping off the saddle, he would have come to the ground,\r\nbut for being suspended by the arm, which caused him such agony that he\r\nbelieved either his wrist would be cut through or his arm torn off; and\r\nhe hung so near the ground that he could just touch it with his feet,\r\nwhich was all the worse for him; for, finding how little was wanted to\r\nenable him to plant his feet firmly, he struggled and stretched himself\r\nas much as he could to gain a footing; just like those undergoing the\r\ntorture of the strappado, when they are fixed at \xe2\x80\x9ctouch and no touch,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwho aggravate their own sufferings by their violent efforts to stretch\r\nthemselves, deceived by the hope which makes them fancy that with a\r\nvery little more they will reach the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc43b.jpg (272K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc43e.jpg (20K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\nIN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURES OF THE INN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc44a.jpg (144K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo loud, in fact, were the shouts of Don Quixote, that the landlord\r\nopening the gate of the inn in all haste, came out in dismay, and ran\r\nto see who was uttering such cries, and those who were outside joined\r\nhim. Maritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the same\r\noutcry, suspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, without anyone\r\nseeing her, untied the halter by which Don Quixote was suspended, and\r\ndown he came to the ground in the sight of the landlord and the\r\ntravellers, who approaching asked him what was the matter with him that\r\nhe shouted so. He without replying a word took the rope off his wrist,\r\nand rising to his feet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his buckler on his\r\narm, put his lance in rest, and making a considerable circuit of the\r\nplain came back at a half-gallop exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever shall say that I have been enchanted with just cause, provided\r\nmy lady the Princess Micomicona grants me permission to do so, I give\r\nhim the lie, challenge him and defy him to single combat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of Don Quixote;\r\nbut the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was, and\r\nnot to mind him as he was out of his senses. They then asked the\r\nlandlord if by any chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had\r\ncome to that inn, one dressed like a muleteer, and of such and such an\r\nappearance, describing that of Do\xc3\xb1a Clara\xe2\x80\x99s lover. The landlord replied\r\nthat there were so many people in the inn he had not noticed the person\r\nthey were inquiring for; but one of them observing the coach in which\r\nthe Judge had come, said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is here no doubt, for this is the coach\r\nhe is following: let one of us stay at the gate, and the rest go in to\r\nlook for him; or indeed it would be as well if one of us went round the\r\ninn, lest he should escape over the wall of the yard.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSo be it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nanother; and while two of them went in, one remained at the gate and\r\nthe other made the circuit of the inn; observing all which, the\r\nlandlord was unable to conjecture for what reason they were taking all\r\nthese precautions, though he understood they were looking for the youth\r\nwhose description they had given him.\r\n\r\nIt was by this time broad daylight; and for that reason, as well as in\r\nconsequence of the noise Don Quixote had made, everybody was awake and\r\nup, but particularly Do\xc3\xb1a Clara and Dorothea; for they had been able to\r\nsleep but badly that night, the one from agitation at having her lover\r\nso near her, the other from curiosity to see him. Don Quixote, when he\r\nsaw that not one of the four travellers took any notice of him or\r\nreplied to his challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation\r\nand wrath; and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry\r\nthat it was lawful for a knight-errant to undertake or engage in\r\nanother enterprise, when he had plighted his word and faith not to\r\ninvolve himself in any until he had made an end of the one to which he\r\nwas pledged, he would have attacked the whole of them, and would have\r\nmade them return an answer in spite of themselves. But considering that\r\nit would not become him, nor be right, to begin any new emprise until\r\nhe had established Micomicona in her kingdom, he was constrained to\r\nhold his peace and wait quietly to see what would be the upshot of the\r\nproceedings of those same travellers; one of whom found the youth they\r\nwere seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer, without a thought\r\nof anyone coming in search of him, much less finding him.\r\n\r\nThe man laid hold of him by the arm, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt becomes you well\r\nindeed, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Luis, to be in the dress you wear, and well the bed\r\nin which I find you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who held\r\nhim, but presently recognised him as one of his father\xe2\x80\x99s servants, at\r\nwhich he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or\r\nutter a word; while the servant went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing for\r\nit now, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Luis, but to submit quietly and return home, unless\r\nit is your wish that my lord, your father, should take his departure\r\nfor the other world, for nothing else can be the consequence of the\r\ngrief he is in at your absence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this\r\ndress?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Luis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a student to whom you confided your intentions,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nservant, \xe2\x80\x9cthat disclosed them, touched with pity at the distress he saw\r\nyour father suffer on missing you; he therefore despatched four of his\r\nservants in quest of you, and here we all are at your service, better\r\npleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able\r\nto restore you to those eyes that so yearn for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat shall be as I please, or as heaven orders,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Luis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you please or heaven order,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept to agree\r\nto go back? Anything else is impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at\r\nwhose side Don Luis lay, and rising, he went to report what had taken\r\nplace to Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the others, who had by this time\r\ndressed themselves; and told them how the man had addressed the youth\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cDon,\xe2\x80\x9d and what words had passed, and how he wanted him to return to\r\nhis father, which the youth was unwilling to do. With this, and what\r\nthey already knew of the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him,\r\nthey all felt very anxious to know more particularly who he was, and\r\neven to help him if it was attempted to employ force against him; so\r\nthey hastened to where he was still talking and arguing with his\r\nservant. Dorothea at this instant came out of her room, followed by\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Clara all in a tremor; and calling Cardenio aside, she told him in\r\na few words the story of the musician and Do\xc3\xb1a Clara, and he at the\r\nsame time told her what had happened, how his father\xe2\x80\x99s servants had\r\ncome in search of him; but in telling her so, he did not speak low\r\nenough but that Do\xc3\xb1a Clara heard what he said, at which she was so much\r\nagitated that had not Dorothea hastened to support her she would have\r\nfallen to the ground. Cardenio then bade Dorothea return to her room,\r\nas he would endeavour to make the whole matter right, and they did as\r\nhe desired. All the four who had come in quest of Don Luis had now come\r\ninto the inn and surrounded him, urging him to return and console his\r\nfather at once and without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay. He replied that he could\r\nnot do so on any account until he had concluded some business in which\r\nhis life, honour, and heart were at stake. The servants pressed him,\r\nsaying that most certainly they would not return without him, and that\r\nthey would take him away whether he liked it or not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not do that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Luis, \xe2\x80\x9cunless you take me dead;\r\nthough however you take me, it will be without life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the\r\ndispute, but particularly Cardenio, Don Fernando, his companions, the\r\nJudge, the curate, the barber, and Don Quixote; for he now considered\r\nthere was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer.\r\nCardenio being already acquainted with the young man\xe2\x80\x99s story, asked the\r\nmen who wanted to take him away, what object they had in seeking to\r\ncarry off this youth against his will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur object,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the four, \xe2\x80\x9cis to save the life of his father,\r\nwho is in danger of losing it through this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon this Don Luis exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to make my affairs\r\npublic here; I am free, and I will return if I please; and if not, none\r\nof you shall compel me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReason will compel your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cand if it has no\r\npower over you, it has power over us, to make us do what we came for,\r\nand what it is our duty to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us hear what the whole affair is about,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Judge at this;\r\nbut the man, who knew him as a neighbour of theirs, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nnot know this gentleman, Se\xc3\xb1or Judge? He is the son of your neighbour,\r\nwho has run away from his father\xe2\x80\x99s house in a dress so unbecoming his\r\nrank, as your worship may perceive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe judge on this looked at him more carefully and recognised him, and\r\nembracing him said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat folly is this, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Luis, or what can\r\nhave been the cause that could have induced you to come here in this\r\nway, and in this dress, which so ill becomes your condition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTears came into the eyes of the young man, and he was unable to utter a\r\nword in reply to the Judge, who told the four servants not to be\r\nuneasy, for all would be satisfactorily settled; and then taking Don\r\nLuis by the hand, he drew him aside and asked the reason of his having\r\ncome there.\r\n\r\nBut while he was questioning him they heard a loud outcry at the gate\r\nof the inn, the cause of which was that two of the guests who had\r\npassed the night there, seeing everybody busy about finding out what it\r\nwas the four men wanted, had conceived the idea of going off without\r\npaying what they owed; but the landlord, who minded his own affairs\r\nmore than other people\xe2\x80\x99s, caught them going out of the gate and\r\ndemanded his reckoning, abusing them for their dishonesty with such\r\nlanguage that he drove them to reply with their fists, and so they\r\nbegan to lay on him in such a style that the poor man was forced to cry\r\nout, and call for help. The landlady and her daughter could see no one\r\nmore free to give aid than Don Quixote, and to him the daughter said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir knight, by the virtue God has given you, help my poor father, for\r\ntwo wicked men are beating him to a mummy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Don Quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFair damsel, at the present moment your request is inopportune, for I\r\nam debarred from involving myself in any adventure until I have brought\r\nto a happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me; but that\r\nwhich I can do for you is what I will now mention: run and tell your\r\nfather to stand his ground as well as he can in this battle, and on no\r\naccount to allow himself to be vanquished, while I go and request\r\npermission of the Princess Micomicona to enable me to succour him in\r\nhis distress; and if she grants it, rest assured I will relieve him\r\nfrom it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSinner that I am,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Maritornes, who stood by; \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you\r\nhave got your permission my master will be in the other world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me leave, se\xc3\xb1ora, to obtain the permission I speak of,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nDon Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand if I get it, it will matter very little if he is in\r\nthe other world; for I will rescue him thence in spite of all the same\r\nworld can do; or at any rate I will give you such a revenge over those\r\nwho shall have sent him there that you will be more than moderately\r\nsatisfied;\xe2\x80\x9d and without saying anything more he went and knelt before\r\nDorothea, requesting her Highness in knightly and errant phrase to be\r\npleased to grant him permission to aid and succour the castellan of\r\nthat castle, who now stood in grievous jeopardy. The princess granted\r\nit graciously, and he at once, bracing his buckler on his arm and\r\ndrawing his sword, hastened to the inn-gate, where the two guests were\r\nstill handling the landlord roughly; but as soon as he reached the spot\r\nhe stopped short and stood still, though Maritornes and the landlady\r\nasked him why he hesitated to help their master and husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hesitate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it is not lawful for me to\r\ndraw sword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squire\r\nSancho to me; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very lively\r\nexchange of fisticuffs and punches, to the sore damage of the landlord\r\nand to the wrath of Maritornes, the landlady, and her daughter, who\r\nwere furious when they saw the pusillanimity of Don Quixote, and the\r\nhard treatment their master, husband and father was undergoing. But let\r\nus leave him there; for he will surely find someone to help him, and if\r\nnot, let him suffer and hold his tongue who attempts more than his\r\nstrength allows him to do; and let us go back fifty paces to see what\r\nDon Luis said in reply to the Judge whom we left questioning him\r\nprivately as to his reasons for coming on foot and so meanly dressed.\r\n\r\nTo which the youth, pressing his hand in a way that showed his heart\r\nwas troubled by some great sorrow, and shedding a flood of tears, made\r\nanswer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, I have no more to tell you than that from the moment when,\r\nthrough heaven\xe2\x80\x99s will and our being near neighbours, I first saw Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nClara, your daughter and my lady, from that instant I made her the\r\nmistress of my will, and if yours, my true lord and father, offers no\r\nimpediment, this very day she shall become my wife. For her I left my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house, and for her I assumed this disguise, to follow her\r\nwhithersoever she may go, as the arrow seeks its mark or the sailor the\r\npole-star. She knows nothing more of my passion than what she may have\r\nlearned from having sometimes seen from a distance that my eyes were\r\nfilled with tears. You know already, se\xc3\xb1or, the wealth and noble birth\r\nof my parents, and that I am their sole heir; if this be a sufficient\r\ninducement for you to venture to make me completely happy, accept me at\r\nonce as your son; for if my father, influenced by other objects of his\r\nown, should disapprove of this happiness I have sought for myself, time\r\nhas more power to alter and change things, than human will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this the love-smitten youth was silent, while the Judge, after\r\nhearing him, was astonished, perplexed, and surprised, as well at the\r\nmanner and intelligence with which Don Luis had confessed the secret of\r\nhis heart, as at the position in which he found himself, not knowing\r\nwhat course to take in a matter so sudden and unexpected. All the\r\nanswer, therefore, he gave him was to bid him to make his mind easy for\r\nthe present, and arrange with his servants not to take him back that\r\nday, so that there might be time to consider what was best for all\r\nparties. Don Luis kissed his hands by force, nay, bathed them with his\r\ntears, in a way that would have touched a heart of marble, not to say\r\nthat of the Judge, who, as a shrewd man, had already perceived how\r\nadvantageous the marriage would be to his daughter; though, were it\r\npossible, he would have preferred that it should be brought about with\r\nthe consent of the father of Don Luis, who he knew looked for a title\r\nfor his son.\r\n\r\nThe guests had by this time made peace with the landlord, for, by\r\npersuasion and Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s fair words more than by threats, they had\r\npaid him what he demanded, and the servants of Don Luis were waiting\r\nfor the end of the conversation with the Judge and their master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndecision, when the devil, who never sleeps, contrived that the barber,\r\nfrom whom Don Quixote had taken Mambrino\xe2\x80\x99s helmet, and Sancho Panza the\r\ntrappings of his ass in exchange for those of his own, should at this\r\ninstant enter the inn; which said barber, as he led his ass to the\r\nstable, observed Sancho Panza engaged in repairing something or other\r\nbelonging to the pack-saddle; and the moment he saw it he knew it, and\r\nmade bold to attack Sancho, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cHo, sir thief, I have caught\r\nyou! hand over my basin and my pack-saddle, and all my trappings that\r\nyou robbed me of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho, finding himself so unexpectedly assailed, and hearing the abuse\r\npoured upon him, seized the pack-saddle with one hand, and with the\r\nother gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood. The\r\nbarber, however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made\r\nin the pack-saddle; on the contrary, he raised such an outcry that\r\neveryone in the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel\r\nmeant. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, in the name of the king and justice!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthis\r\nthief and highwayman wants to kill me for trying to recover my\r\nproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI am no highwayman; it was in fair war my\r\nmaster Don Quixote won these spoils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see his\r\nsquire\xe2\x80\x99s stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that time\r\nforth he reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dub\r\nhim a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling\r\nsure that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death,\r\nand I know it as well as if I had given birth to it, and here is my ass\r\nin the stable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does not\r\nfit him like a glove, call me a rascal; and what is more, the same day\r\nI was robbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin,\r\nnever yet handselled, that would fetch a crown any day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; and\r\ninterposing between the two, and separating them, he placed the\r\npack-saddle on the ground, to lie there in sight until the truth was\r\nestablished, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYour worships may perceive clearly and plainly\r\nthe error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin\r\nwhich was, is, and shall be the helmet of Mambrino which I won from him\r\nin fair war, and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful\r\npossession. With the pack-saddle I do not concern myself; but I may\r\ntell you on that head that my squire Sancho asked my permission to\r\nstrip off the caparison of this vanquished poltroon\xe2\x80\x99s steed, and with\r\nit adorn his own; I allowed him, and he took it; and as to its having\r\nbeen changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle, I can give no\r\nexplanation except the usual one, that such transformations will take\r\nplace in adventures of chivalry. To confirm all which, run, Sancho my\r\nson, and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEgad, master,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif we have no other proof of our case\r\nthan what your worship puts forward, Mambrino\xe2\x80\x99s helmet is just as much\r\na basin as this good fellow\xe2\x80\x99s caparison is a pack-saddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo as I bid thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cit cannot be that everything in\r\nthis castle goes by enchantment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him,\r\nand when Don Quixote saw it, he took hold of it and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that\r\nthis is a basin and not the helmet I told you of; and I swear by the\r\norder of chivalry I profess, that this helmet is the identical one I\r\ntook from him, without anything added to or taken from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor from the time my master\r\nwon it until now he has only fought one battle in it, when he let loose\r\nthose unlucky men in chains; and if it had not been for this\r\nbasin-helmet he would not have come off over well that time, for there\r\nwas plenty of stone-throwing in that affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc44e.jpg (13K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\nIN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO\xe2\x80\x99S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE\r\nIS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND\r\nEARNEST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc45a.jpg (154K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think now, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cof what these\r\ngentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whoever says the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI will let him know\r\nhe lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a\r\nthousand times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his\r\ndelusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing\r\nthe other barber he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your\r\nprofession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty\r\nyears, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of\r\nthem, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the\r\ndays of my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a\r\nheadpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I\r\nmeant to say to soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 arms; and I say\xe2\x80\x94saving better opinions and\r\nalways with submission to sounder judgments\xe2\x80\x94that this piece we have now\r\nbefore us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no\r\nbarber\xe2\x80\x99s basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black,\r\nand truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a\r\nhelmet, is not a complete helmet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor half of it is wanting, that is\r\nto say the beaver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, who saw the object of his friend\r\nthe barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with\r\nhim, and even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don\r\nLuis\xe2\x80\x99s affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so\r\ntaken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid\r\nlittle or no attention to these facetious proceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless me!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed their butt the barber at this; \xe2\x80\x9cis it\r\npossible that such an honourable company can say that this is not a\r\nbasin but a helmet? Why, this is a thing that would astonish a whole\r\nuniversity, however wise it might be! That will do; if this basin is a\r\nhelmet, why, then the pack-saddle must be a horse\xe2\x80\x99s caparison, as this\r\ngentleman has said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me it looks like a pack-saddle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have\r\nalready said that with that question I do not concern myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cit is\r\nonly for Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote to say; for in these matters of chivalry all\r\nthese gentlemen and I bow to his authority.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cso many strange things have\r\nhappened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which I have\r\nsojourned in it, that I will not venture to assert anything positively\r\nin reply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is my\r\nbelief that everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment. The\r\nfirst time, an enchanted Moor that there is in it gave me sore trouble,\r\nnor did Sancho fare well among certain followers of his; and last night\r\nI was kept hanging by this arm for nearly two hours, without knowing\r\nhow or why I came by such a mishap. So that now, for me to come forward\r\nto give an opinion in such a puzzling matter, would be to risk a rash\r\ndecision. As regards the assertion that this is a basin and not a\r\nhelmet I have already given an answer; but as to the question whether\r\nthis is a pack-saddle or a caparison I will not venture to give a\r\npositive opinion, but will leave it to your worships\xe2\x80\x99 better judgment.\r\nPerhaps as you are not dubbed knights like myself, the enchantments of\r\nthis place have nothing to do with you, and your faculties are\r\nunfettered, and you can see things in this castle as they really and\r\ntruly are, and not as they appear to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Fernando on this, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nDon Quixote has spoken very wisely, and that with us rests the decision\r\nof this matter; and that we may have surer ground to go on, I will take\r\nthe votes of the gentlemen in secret, and declare the result clearly\r\nand fully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo those who were in on the secret of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s humour all this\r\nafforded great amusement; but to those who knew nothing about it, it\r\nseemed the greatest nonsense in the world, in particular to the four\r\nservants of Don Luis, as well as to Don Luis himself, and to three\r\nother travellers who had by chance come to the inn, and had the\r\nappearance of officers of the Holy Brotherhood, as indeed they were;\r\nbut the one who above all was at his wits\xe2\x80\x99 end was the barber whose\r\nbasin, there before his very eyes, had been turned into Mambrino\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhelmet, and whose pack-saddle he had no doubt whatever was about to\r\nbecome a rich caparison for a horse. All laughed to see Don Fernando\r\ngoing from one to another collecting the votes, and whispering to them\r\nto give him their private opinion whether the treasure over which there\r\nhad been so much fighting was a pack-saddle or a caparison; but after\r\nhe had taken the votes of those who knew Don Quixote, he said aloud,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, my good fellow, that I am tired collecting such a number\r\nof opinions, for I find that there is not one of whom I ask what I\r\ndesire to know, who does not tell me that it is absurd to say that this\r\nis the pack-saddle of an ass, and not the caparison of a horse, nay, of\r\na thoroughbred horse; so you must submit, for, in spite of you and your\r\nass, this is a caparison and no pack-saddle, and you have stated and\r\nproved your case very badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I never share heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor barber, \xe2\x80\x9cif your worships are\r\nnot all mistaken; and may my soul appear before God as that appears to\r\nme a pack-saddle and not a caparison; but, \xe2\x80\x98laws go,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94I say no more;\r\nand indeed I am not drunk, for I am fasting, except it be from sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than the\r\nabsurdities of Don Quixote, who now observed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs to\r\nhim, and to whom God has given it, may St. Peter add his blessing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut said one of the four servants, \xe2\x80\x9cUnless, indeed, this is a\r\ndeliberate joke, I cannot bring myself to believe that men so\r\nintelligent as those present are, or seem to be, can venture to declare\r\nand assert that this is not a basin, and that not a pack-saddle; but as\r\nI perceive that they do assert and declare it, I can only come to the\r\nconclusion that there is some mystery in this persistence in what is so\r\nopposed to the evidence of experience and truth itself; for I swear\r\nby\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and here he rapped out a round oath\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9call the people in the world\r\nwill not make me believe that this is not a barber\xe2\x80\x99s basin and that a\r\njackass\xe2\x80\x99s pack-saddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might easily be a she-ass\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said the servant; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is not the point; but\r\nwhether it is or is not a pack-saddle, as your worships say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the Brotherhood,\r\nwho had been listening to the dispute and controversy, unable to\r\nrestrain his anger and impatience, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pack-saddle as\r\nsure as my father is my father, and whoever has said or will say\r\nanything else must be drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lie like a rascally clown,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote; and lifting his\r\npike, which he had never let out of his hand, he delivered such a blow\r\nat his head that, had not the officer dodged it, it would have\r\nstretched him at full length. The pike was shivered in pieces against\r\nthe ground, and the rest of the officers, seeing their comrade\r\nassaulted, raised a shout, calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood.\r\nThe landlord, who was of the fraternity, ran at once to fetch his staff\r\nof office and his sword, and ranged himself on the side of his\r\ncomrades; the servants of Don Luis clustered round him, lest he should\r\nescape from them in the confusion; the barber, seeing the house turned\r\nupside down, once more laid hold of his pack-saddle and Sancho did the\r\nsame; Don Quixote drew his sword and charged the officers; Don Luis\r\ncried out to his servants to leave him alone and go and help Don\r\nQuixote, and Cardenio and Don Fernando, who were supporting him; the\r\ncurate was shouting at the top of his voice, the landlady was\r\nscreaming, her daughter was wailing, Maritornes was weeping, Dorothea\r\nwas aghast, Luscinda terror-stricken, and Do\xc3\xb1a Clara in a faint. The\r\nbarber cudgelled Sancho, and Sancho pommelled the barber; Don Luis gave\r\none of his servants, who ventured to catch him by the arm to keep him\r\nfrom escaping, a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood; the Judge took\r\nhis part; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and was\r\nbelabouring him heartily; the landlord raised his voice again calling\r\nfor help for the Holy Brotherhood; so that the whole inn was nothing\r\nbut cries, shouts, shrieks, confusion, terror, dismay, mishaps,\r\nsword-cuts, fisticuffs, cudgellings, kicks, and bloodshed; and in the\r\nmidst of all this chaos, complication, and general entanglement, Don\r\nQuixote took it into his head that he had been plunged into the thick\r\nof the discord of Agramante\xe2\x80\x99s camp; and, in a voice that shook the inn\r\nlike thunder, he cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold all, let all sheathe their swords, let all be calm and attend to\r\nme as they value their lives!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll paused at his mighty voice, and he went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cDid I not tell\r\nyou, sirs, that this castle was enchanted, and that a legion or so of\r\ndevils dwelt in it? In proof whereof I call upon you to behold with\r\nyour own eyes how the discord of Agramante\xe2\x80\x99s camp has come hither, and\r\nbeen transferred into the midst of us. See how they fight, there for\r\nthe sword, here for the horse, on that side for the eagle, on this for\r\nthe helmet; we are all fighting, and all at cross purposes. Come then,\r\nyou, Se\xc3\xb1or Judge, and you, se\xc3\xb1or curate; let the one represent King\r\nAgramante and the other King Sobrino, and make peace among us; for by\r\nGod Almighty it is a sorry business that so many persons of quality as\r\nwe are should slay one another for such trifling cause.\xe2\x80\x9d The officers,\r\nwho did not understand Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s mode of speaking, and found\r\nthemselves roughly handled by Don Fernando, Cardenio, and their\r\ncompanions, were not to be appeased; the barber was, however, for both\r\nhis beard and his pack-saddle were the worse for the struggle; Sancho\r\nlike a good servant obeyed the slightest word of his master; while the\r\nfour servants of Don Luis kept quiet when they saw how little they\r\ngained by not being so. The landlord alone insisted upon it that they\r\nmust punish the insolence of this madman, who at every turn raised a\r\ndisturbance in the inn; but at length the uproar was stilled for the\r\npresent; the pack-saddle remained a caparison till the day of judgment,\r\nand the basin a helmet and the inn a castle in Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nAll having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of the\r\nJudge and the curate, the servants of Don Luis began again to urge him\r\nto return with them at once; and while he was discussing the matter\r\nwith them, the Judge took counsel with Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the\r\ncurate as to what he ought to do in the case, telling them how it\r\nstood, and what Don Luis had said to him. It was agreed at length that\r\nDon Fernando should tell the servants of Don Luis who he was, and that\r\nit was his desire that Don Luis should accompany him to Andalusia,\r\nwhere he would receive from the marquis his brother the welcome his\r\nquality entitled him to; for, otherwise, it was easy to see from the\r\ndetermination of Don Luis that he would not return to his father at\r\npresent, though they tore him to pieces. On learning the rank of Don\r\nFernando and the resolution of Don Luis the four then settled it\r\nbetween themselves that three of them should return to tell his father\r\nhow matters stood, and that the other should remain to wait upon Don\r\nLuis, and not leave him until they came back for him, or his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norders were known. Thus by the authority of Agramante and the wisdom of\r\nKing Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; but the\r\nenemy of concord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and made\r\na fool of, and seeing how little he had gained after having involved\r\nthem all in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his hand\r\nonce more by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances.\r\n\r\nIt came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the\r\nrank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from the\r\ncontest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likely\r\nto get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been\r\nthrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some\r\nwarrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one\r\nagainst Don Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be\r\narrested for setting the galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very\r\ngood reason, apprehended. Suspecting how it was, then, he wished to\r\nsatisfy himself as to whether Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s features corresponded; and\r\ntaking a parchment out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search\r\nof, and setting himself to read it deliberately, for he was not a quick\r\nreader, as he made out each word he fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and\r\nwent on comparing the description in the warrant with his face, and\r\ndiscovered that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it. As\r\nsoon as he had satisfied himself, folding up the parchment, he took the\r\nwarrant in his left hand and with his right seized Don Quixote by the\r\ncollar so tightly that he did not allow him to breathe, and shouted\r\naloud, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp for the Holy Brotherhood! and that you may see I demand it\r\nin earnest, read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be\r\narrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was\r\ntrue, and that it agreed with Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s appearance, who, on his\r\npart, when he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown,\r\nworked up to the highest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking\r\nwith rage, with both hands seized the officer by the throat with all\r\nhis might, so that had he not been helped by his comrades he would have\r\nyielded up his life ere Don Quixote released his hold. The landlord,\r\nwho had perforce to support his brother officers, ran at once to aid\r\nthem. The landlady, when she saw her husband engaged in a fresh\r\nquarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and its note was immediately\r\ncaught up by Maritornes and her daughter, calling upon heaven and all\r\npresent for help; and Sancho, seeing what was going on, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cBy\r\nthe Lord, it is quite true what my master says about the enchantments\r\nof this castle, for it is impossible to live an hour in peace in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Fernando parted the officer and Don Quixote, and to their mutual\r\ncontentment made them relax the grip by which they held, the one the\r\ncoat collar, the other the throat of his adversary; for all this,\r\nhowever, the officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call\r\non them to help, and deliver him over bound into their power, as was\r\nrequired for the service of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood, on\r\nwhose behalf they again demanded aid and assistance to effect the\r\ncapture of this robber and footpad of the highways.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote smiled when he heard these words, and said very calmly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, base, ill-born brood; call ye it highway robbery to give\r\nfreedom to those in bondage, to release the captives, to succour the\r\nmiserable, to raise up the fallen, to relieve the needy? Infamous\r\nbeings, who by your vile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven\r\nshould not make known to you the virtue that lies in knight-errantry,\r\nor show you the sin and ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to\r\nrespect the shadow, not to say the presence, of any knight-errant! Come\r\nnow; band, not of officers, but of thieves; footpads with the licence\r\nof the Holy Brotherhood; tell me who was the ignoramus who signed a\r\nwarrant of arrest against such a knight as I am? Who was he that did\r\nnot know that knights-errant are independent of all jurisdictions, that\r\ntheir law is their sword, their charter their prowess, and their edicts\r\ntheir will? Who, I say again, was the fool that knows not that there\r\nare no letters patent of nobility that confer such privileges or\r\nexemptions as a knight-errant acquires the day he is dubbed a knight,\r\nand devotes himself to the arduous calling of chivalry? What\r\nknight-errant ever paid poll-tax, duty, queen\xe2\x80\x99s pin-money, king\xe2\x80\x99s dues,\r\ntoll or ferry? What tailor ever took payment of him for making his\r\nclothes? What castellan that received him in his castle ever made him\r\npay his shot? What king did not seat him at his table? What damsel was\r\nnot enamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to his will\r\nand pleasure? And, lastly, what knight-errant has there been, is there,\r\nor will there ever be in the world, not bold enough to give,\r\nsingle-handed, four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the\r\nHoly Brotherhood if they come in his way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\nOF THE END OF THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HOLY\r\nBROTHERHOOD; AND OF THE GREAT FEROCITY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT, DON\r\nQUIXOTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc46a.jpg (163K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Don Quixote was talking in this strain, the curate was\r\nendeavouring to persuade the officers that he was out of his senses, as\r\nthey might perceive by his deeds and his words, and that they need not\r\npress the matter any further, for even if they arrested him and carried\r\nhim off, they would have to release him by-and-by as a madman; to which\r\nthe holder of the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with\r\ninquiring into Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s madness, but only to execute his\r\nsuperior\xe2\x80\x99s orders, and that once taken they might let him go three\r\nhundred times if they liked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not take him away this time,\r\nnor will he, it is my opinion, let himself be taken away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn short, the curate used such arguments, and Don Quixote did such mad\r\nthings, that the officers would have been more mad than he was if they\r\nhad not perceived his want of wits, and so they thought it best to\r\nallow themselves to be pacified, and even to act as peacemakers between\r\nthe barber and Sancho Panza, who still continued their altercation with\r\nmuch bitterness. In the end they, as officers of justice, settled the\r\nquestion by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were, if not\r\nperfectly contented, at least to some extent satisfied; for they\r\nchanged the pack-saddles, but not the girths or head-stalls; and as to\r\nMambrino\xe2\x80\x99s helmet, the curate, under the rose and without Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknowing it, paid eight reals for the basin, and the barber executed a\r\nfull receipt and engagement to make no further demand then or\r\nthenceforth for evermore, amen. These two disputes, which were the most\r\nimportant and gravest, being settled, it only remained for the servants\r\nof Don Luis to consent that three of them should return while one was\r\nleft to accompany him whither Don Fernando desired to take him; and\r\ngood luck and better fortune, having already begun to solve\r\ndifficulties and remove obstructions in favour of the lovers and\r\nwarriors of the inn, were pleased to persevere and bring everything to\r\na happy issue; for the servants agreed to do as Don Luis wished; which\r\ngave Do\xc3\xb1a Clara such happiness that no one could have looked into her\r\nface just then without seeing the joy of her heart. Zoraida, though she\r\ndid not fully comprehend all she saw, was grave or gay without knowing\r\nwhy, as she watched and studied the various countenances, but\r\nparticularly her Spaniard\xe2\x80\x99s, whom she followed with her eyes and clung\r\nto with her soul. The gift and compensation which the curate gave the\r\nbarber had not escaped the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s notice, and he demanded Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s reckoning, together with the amount of the damage to his\r\nwine-skins, and the loss of his wine, swearing that neither Rocinante\r\nnor Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s ass should leave the inn until he had been paid to the\r\nvery last farthing. The curate settled all amicably, and Don Fernando\r\npaid; though the Judge had also very readily offered to pay the score;\r\nand all became so peaceful and quiet that the inn no longer reminded\r\none of the discord of Agramante\xe2\x80\x99s camp, as Don Quixote said, but of the\r\npeace and tranquillity of the days of Octavianus: for all which it was\r\nthe universal opinion that their thanks were due to the great zeal and\r\neloquence of the curate, and to the unexampled generosity of Don\r\nFernando.\r\n\r\nFinding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels, his squire\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nwell as his own, Don Quixote considered that it would be advisable to\r\ncontinue the journey he had begun, and bring to a close that great\r\nadventure for which he had been called and chosen; and with this high\r\nresolve he went and knelt before Dorothea, who, however, would not\r\nallow him to utter a word until he had risen; so to obey her he rose,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a common proverb, fair lady, that \xe2\x80\x98diligence is the\r\nmother of good fortune,\xe2\x80\x99 and experience has often shown in important\r\naffairs that the earnestness of the negotiator brings the doubtful case\r\nto a successful termination; but in nothing does this truth show itself\r\nmore plainly than in war, where quickness and activity forestall the\r\ndevices of the enemy, and win the victory before the foe has time to\r\ndefend himself. All this I say, exalted and esteemed lady, because it\r\nseems to me that for us to remain any longer in this castle now is\r\nuseless, and may be injurious to us in a way that we shall find out\r\nsome day; for who knows but that your enemy the giant may have learned\r\nby means of secret and diligent spies that I am going to destroy him,\r\nand if the opportunity be given him he may seize it to fortify himself\r\nin some impregnable castle or stronghold, against which all my efforts\r\nand the might of my indefatigable arm may avail but little? Therefore,\r\nlady, let us, as I say, forestall his schemes by our activity, and let\r\nus depart at once in quest of fair fortune; for your highness is only\r\nkept from enjoying it as fully as you could desire by my delay in\r\nencountering your adversary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote held his peace and said no more, calmly awaiting the reply\r\nof the beauteous princess, who, with commanding dignity and in a style\r\nadapted to Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s own, replied to him in these words, \xe2\x80\x9cI give\r\nyou thanks, sir knight, for the eagerness you, like a good knight to\r\nwhom it is a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the needy,\r\ndisplay to afford me aid in my sore trouble; and heaven grant that your\r\nwishes and mine may be realised, so that you may see that there are\r\nwomen in this world capable of gratitude; as to my departure, let it be\r\nforthwith, for I have no will but yours; dispose of me entirely in\r\naccordance with your good pleasure; for she who has once entrusted to\r\nyou the defence of her person, and placed in your hands the recovery of\r\nher dominions, must not think of offering opposition to that which your\r\nwisdom may ordain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn, then, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, when a lady humbles\r\nherself to me, I will not lose the opportunity of raising her up and\r\nplacing her on the throne of her ancestors. Let us depart at once, for\r\nthe common saying that in delay there is danger, lends spurs to my\r\neagerness to take the road; and as neither heaven has created nor hell\r\nseen any that can daunt or intimidate me, saddle Rocinante, Sancho, and\r\nget ready thy ass and the queen\xe2\x80\x99s palfrey, and let us take leave of the\r\ncastellan and these gentlemen, and go hence this very instant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho, who was standing by all the time, said, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\r\nmaster, master, there is more mischief in the village than one hears\r\nof, begging all good bodies\xe2\x80\x99 pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mischief can there be in any village, or in all the cities of the\r\nworld, you booby, that can hurt my reputation?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your worship is angry,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI will hold my tongue and\r\nleave unsaid what as a good squire I am bound to say, and what a good\r\nservant should tell his master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay what thou wilt,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cprovided thy words be not\r\nmeant to work upon my fears; for thou, if thou fearest, art behaving\r\nlike thyself; but I like myself, in not fearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing of the sort, as I am a sinner before God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut that I take it to be sure and certain that this lady, who calls\r\nherself queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon, is no more so than my\r\nmother; for, if she was what she says, she would not go rubbing noses\r\nwith one that is here every instant and behind every door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorothea turned red at Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s words, for the truth was that her\r\nhusband Don Fernando had now and then, when the others were not\r\nlooking, gathered from her lips some of the reward his love had earned,\r\nand Sancho seeing this had considered that such freedom was more like a\r\ncourtesan than a queen of a great kingdom; she, however, being unable\r\nor not caring to answer him, allowed him to proceed, and he continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis I say, se\xc3\xb1or, because, if after we have travelled roads and\r\nhighways, and passed bad nights and worse days, one who is now enjoying\r\nhimself in this inn is to reap the fruit of our labours, there is no\r\nneed for me to be in a hurry to saddle Rocinante, put the pad on the\r\nass, or get ready the palfrey; for it will be better for us to stay\r\nquiet, and let every jade mind her spinning, and let us go to dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGood God, what was the indignation of Don Quixote when he heard the\r\naudacious words of his squire! So great was it, that in a voice\r\ninarticulate with rage, with a stammering tongue, and eyes that flashed\r\nliving fire, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cRascally clown, boorish, insolent, and\r\nignorant, ill-spoken, foul-mouthed, impudent backbiter and slanderer!\r\nHast thou dared to utter such words in my presence and in that of these\r\nillustrious ladies? Hast thou dared to harbour such gross and shameless\r\nthoughts in thy muddled imagination? Begone from my presence, thou born\r\nmonster, storehouse of lies, hoard of untruths, garner of knaveries,\r\ninventor of scandals, publisher of absurdities, enemy of the respect\r\ndue to royal personages! Begone, show thyself no more before me under\r\npain of my wrath;\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying he knitted his brows, puffed out his\r\ncheeks, gazed around him, and stamped on the ground violently with his\r\nright foot, showing in every way the rage that was pent up in his\r\nheart; and at his words and furious gestures Sancho was so scared and\r\nterrified that he would have been glad if the earth had opened that\r\ninstant and swallowed him, and his only thought was to turn round and\r\nmake his escape from the angry presence of his master.\r\n\r\nBut the ready-witted Dorothea, who by this time so well understood Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s humour, said, to mollify his wrath, \xe2\x80\x9cBe not irritated at the\r\nabsurdities your good squire has uttered, Sir Knight of the Rueful\r\nCountenance, for perhaps he did not utter them without cause, and from\r\nhis good sense and Christian conscience it is not likely that he would\r\nbear false witness against anyone. We may therefore believe, without\r\nany hesitation, that since, as you say, sir knight, everything in this\r\ncastle goes and is brought about by means of enchantment, Sancho, I\r\nsay, may possibly have seen, through this diabolical medium, what he\r\nsays he saw so much to the detriment of my modesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear by God Omnipotent,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Don Quixote at this, \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nhighness has hit the point; and that some vile illusion must have come\r\nbefore this sinner of a Sancho, that made him see what it would have\r\nbeen impossible to see by any other means than enchantments; for I know\r\nwell enough, from the poor fellow\xe2\x80\x99s goodness and harmlessness, that he\r\nis incapable of bearing false witness against anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Fernando, \xe2\x80\x9cfor which reason, Se\xc3\xb1or Don\r\nQuixote, you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of your\r\nfavour, _sicut erat in principio_, before illusions of this sort had\r\ntaken away his senses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote said he was ready to pardon him, and the curate went for\r\nSancho, who came in very humbly, and falling on his knees begged for\r\nthe hand of his master, who having presented it to him and allowed him\r\nto kiss it, gave him his blessing and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Sancho my son, thou\r\nwilt be convinced of the truth of what I have many a time told thee,\r\nthat everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept the affair of the blanket,\r\nwhich came to pass in reality by ordinary means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve it not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor had it been so, I would have\r\navenged thee that instant, or even now; but neither then nor now could\r\nI, nor have I seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was, and the\r\nlandlord gave them a minute account of Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s flights, at which they\r\nlaughed not a little, and at which Sancho would have been no less out\r\nof countenance had not his master once more assured him it was all\r\nenchantment. For all that his simplicity never reached so high a pitch\r\nthat he could persuade himself it was not the plain and simple truth,\r\nwithout any deception whatever about it, that he had been blanketed by\r\nbeings of flesh and blood, and not by visionary and imaginary phantoms,\r\nas his master believed and protested.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious company had now been two days in the inn; and as it\r\nseemed to them time to depart, they devised a plan so that, without\r\ngiving Dorothea and Don Fernando the trouble of going back with Don\r\nQuixote to his village under pretence of restoring Queen Micomicona,\r\nthe curate and the barber might carry him away with them as they\r\nproposed, and the curate be able to take his madness in hand at home;\r\nand in pursuance of their plan they arranged with the owner of an\r\noxcart who happened to be passing that way to carry him after this\r\nfashion. They constructed a kind of cage with wooden bars, large enough\r\nto hold Don Quixote comfortably; and then Don Fernando and his\r\ncompanions, the servants of Don Luis, and the officers of the\r\nBrotherhood, together with the landlord, by the directions and advice\r\nof the curate, covered their faces and disguised themselves, some in\r\none way, some in another, so as to appear to Don Quixote quite\r\ndifferent from the persons he had seen in the castle. This done, in\r\nprofound silence they entered the room where he was asleep, taking his\r\nrest after the past frays, and advancing to where he was sleeping\r\ntranquilly, not dreaming of anything of the kind happening, they seized\r\nhim firmly and bound him fast hand and foot, so that, when he awoke\r\nstartled, he was unable to move, and could only marvel and wonder at\r\nthe strange figures he saw before him; upon which he at once gave way\r\nto the idea which his crazed fancy invariably conjured up before him,\r\nand took it into his head that all these shapes were phantoms of the\r\nenchanted castle, and that he himself was unquestionably enchanted as\r\nhe could neither move nor help himself; precisely what the curate, the\r\nconcoctor of the scheme, expected would happen. Of all that were there\r\nSancho was the only one who was at once in his senses and in his own\r\nproper character, and he, though he was within very little of sharing\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s infirmity, did not fail to perceive who all these\r\ndisguised figures were; but he did not dare to open his lips until he\r\nsaw what came of this assault and capture of his master; nor did the\r\nlatter utter a word, waiting to the upshot of his mishap; which was\r\nthat bringing in the cage, they shut him up in it and nailed the bars\r\nso firmly that they could not be easily burst open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc46b.jpg (342K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey then took him on their shoulders, and as they passed out of the\r\nroom an awful voice\xe2\x80\x94as much so as the barber, not he of the pack-saddle\r\nbut the other, was able to make it\xe2\x80\x94was heard to say, \xe2\x80\x9cO Knight of the\r\nRueful Countenance, let not this captivity in which thou art placed\r\nafflict thee, for this must needs be, for the more speedy\r\naccomplishment of the adventure in which thy great heart has engaged\r\nthee; the which shall be accomplished when the raging Manchegan lion\r\nand the white Tobosan dove shall be linked together, having first\r\nhumbled their haughty necks to the gentle yoke of matrimony. And from\r\nthis marvellous union shall come forth to the light of the world brave\r\nwhelps that shall rival the ravening claws of their valiant father; and\r\nthis shall come to pass ere the pursuer of the flying nymph shall in\r\nhis swift natural course have twice visited the starry signs. And thou,\r\nO most noble and obedient squire that ever bore sword at side, beard on\r\nface, or nose to smell with, be not dismayed or grieved to see the\r\nflower of knight-errantry carried away thus before thy very eyes; for\r\nsoon, if it so please the Framer of the universe, thou shalt see\r\nthyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt not know thyself, and\r\nthe promises which thy good master has made thee shall not prove false;\r\nand I assure thee, on the authority of the sage Mentironiana, that thy\r\nwages shall be paid thee, as thou shalt see in due season. Follow then\r\nthe footsteps of the valiant enchanted knight, for it is expedient that\r\nthou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of you; and as it\r\nis not permitted to me to say more, God be with thee; for I return to\r\nthat place I wot of;\xe2\x80\x9d and as he brought the prophecy to a close he\r\nraised his voice to a high pitch, and then lowered it to such a soft\r\ntone, that even those who knew it was all a joke were almost inclined\r\nto take what they heard seriously.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard, for he at once\r\ncomprehended its meaning perfectly, and perceived it was promised to\r\nhim that he should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with\r\nhis beloved Dulcinea del Toboso, from whose blessed womb should proceed\r\nthe whelps, his sons, to the eternal glory of La Mancha; and being\r\nthoroughly and firmly persuaded of this, he lifted up his voice, and\r\nwith a deep sigh exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh thou, whoever thou art, who hast\r\nforetold me so much good, I implore of thee that on my part thou\r\nentreat that sage enchanter who takes charge of my interests, that he\r\nleave me not to perish in this captivity in which they are now carrying\r\nme away, ere I see fulfilled promises so joyful and incomparable as\r\nthose which have been now made me; for, let this but come to pass, and\r\nI shall glory in the pains of my prison, find comfort in these chains\r\nwherewith they bind me, and regard this bed whereon they stretch me,\r\nnot as a hard battle-field, but as a soft and happy nuptial couch; and\r\ntouching the consolation of Sancho Panza, my squire, I rely upon his\r\ngoodness and rectitude that he will not desert me in good or evil\r\nfortune; for if, by his ill luck or mine, it may not happen to be in my\r\npower to give him the island I have promised, or any equivalent for it,\r\nat least his wages shall not be lost; for in my will, which is already\r\nmade, I have declared the sum that shall be paid to him, measured, not\r\nby his many faithful services, but by the means at my disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed both his hands, for,\r\nbeing tied together, he could not kiss one; and then the apparitions\r\nlifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox-cart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc46e.jpg (56K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\nOF THE STRANGE MANNER IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS CARRIED\r\nAWAY ENCHANTED, TOGETHER WITH OTHER REMARKABLE INCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc47a.jpg (181K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Don Quixote saw himself caged and hoisted on the cart in this way,\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cMany grave histories of knights-errant have I read; but never\r\nyet have I read, seen, or heard of their carrying off enchanted\r\nknights-errant in this fashion, or at the slow pace that these lazy,\r\nsluggish animals promise; for they always take them away through the\r\nair with marvellous swiftness, enveloped in a dark thick cloud, or on a\r\nchariot of fire, or it may be on some hippogriff or other beast of the\r\nkind; but to carry me off like this on an ox-cart! By God, it puzzles\r\nme! But perhaps the chivalry and enchantments of our day take a\r\ndifferent course from that of those in days gone by; and it may be,\r\ntoo, that as I am a new knight in the world, and the first to revive\r\nthe already forgotten calling of knight-adventurers, they may have\r\nnewly invented other kinds of enchantments and other modes of carrying\r\noff the enchanted. What thinkest thou of the matter, Sancho my son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc47b.jpg (357K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to think,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cnot being as well read\r\nas your worship in errant writings; but for all that I venture to say\r\nand swear that these apparitions that are about us are not quite\r\ncatholic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatholic!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cFather of me! how can they be Catholic\r\nwhen they are all devils that have taken fantastic shapes to come and\r\ndo this, and bring me to this condition? And if thou wouldst prove it,\r\ntouch them, and feel them, and thou wilt find they have only bodies of\r\nair, and no consistency except in appearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, master,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI have touched them already; and\r\nthat devil, that goes about there so busily, has firm flesh, and\r\nanother property very different from what I have heard say devils have,\r\nfor by all accounts they all smell of brimstone and other bad smells;\r\nbut this one smells of amber half a league off.\xe2\x80\x9d Sancho was here\r\nspeaking of Don Fernando, who, like a gentleman of his rank, was very\r\nlikely perfumed as Sancho said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarvel not at that, Sancho my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor let me\r\ntell thee devils are crafty; and even if they do carry odours about\r\nwith them, they themselves have no smell, because they are spirits; or,\r\nif they have any smell, they cannot smell of anything sweet, but of\r\nsomething foul and fetid; and the reason is that as they carry hell\r\nwith them wherever they go, and can get no ease whatever from their\r\ntorments, and as a sweet smell is a thing that gives pleasure and\r\nenjoyment, it is impossible that they can smell sweet; if, then, this\r\ndevil thou speakest of seems to thee to smell of amber, either thou art\r\ndeceiving thyself, or he wants to deceive thee by making thee fancy he\r\nis not a devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the conversation that passed between master and man; and Don\r\nFernando and Cardenio, apprehensive of Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s making a complete\r\ndiscovery of their scheme, towards which he had already gone some way,\r\nresolved to hasten their departure, and calling the landlord aside,\r\nthey directed him to saddle Rocinante and put the pack-saddle on\r\nSancho\xe2\x80\x99s ass, which he did with great alacrity. In the meantime the\r\ncurate had made an arrangement with the officers that they should bear\r\nthem company as far as his village, he paying them so much a day.\r\nCardenio hung the buckler on one side of the bow of Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s saddle\r\nand the basin on the other, and by signs commanded Sancho to mount his\r\nass and take Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s bridle, and at each side of the cart he placed\r\ntwo officers with their muskets; but before the cart was put in motion,\r\nout came the landlady and her daughter and Maritornes to bid Don\r\nQuixote farewell, pretending to weep with grief at his misfortune; and\r\nto them Don Quixote said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeep not, good ladies, for all these mishaps are the lot of those who\r\nfollow the profession I profess; and if these reverses did not befall\r\nme I should not esteem myself a famous knight-errant; for such things\r\nnever happen to knights of little renown and fame, because nobody in\r\nthe world thinks about them; to valiant knights they do, for these are\r\nenvied for their virtue and valour by many princes and other knights\r\nwho compass the destruction of the worthy by base means. Nevertheless,\r\nvirtue is of herself so mighty, that, in spite of all the magic that\r\nZoroaster its first inventor knew, she will come victorious out of\r\nevery trial, and shed her light upon the earth as the sun does upon the\r\nheavens. Forgive me, fair ladies, if, through inadvertence, I have in\r\naught offended you; for intentionally and wittingly I have never done\r\nso to any; and pray to God that he deliver me from this captivity to\r\nwhich some malevolent enchanter has consigned me; and should I find\r\nmyself released therefrom, the favours that ye have bestowed upon me in\r\nthis castle shall be held in memory by me, that I may acknowledge,\r\nrecognise, and requite them as they deserve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile this was passing between the ladies of the castle and Don\r\nQuixote, the curate and the barber bade farewell to Don Fernando and\r\nhis companions, to the captain, his brother, and the ladies, now all\r\nmade happy, and in particular to Dorothea and Luscinda. They all\r\nembraced one another, and promised to let each other know how things\r\nwent with them, and Don Fernando directed the curate where to write to\r\nhim, to tell him what became of Don Quixote, assuring him that there\r\nwas nothing that could give him more pleasure than to hear of it, and\r\nthat he too, on his part, would send him word of everything he thought\r\nhe would like to know, about his marriage, Zoraida\xe2\x80\x99s baptism, Don\r\nLuis\xe2\x80\x99s affair, and Luscinda\xe2\x80\x99s return to her home. The curate promised\r\nto comply with his request carefully, and they embraced once more, and\r\nrenewed their promises.\r\n\r\nThe landlord approached the curate and handed him some papers, saying\r\nhe had discovered them in the lining of the valise in which the novel\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ill-advised Curiosity\xe2\x80\x9d had been found, and that he might take\r\nthem all away with him as their owner had not since returned; for, as\r\nhe could not read, he did not want them himself. The curate thanked\r\nhim, and opening them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cNovel of Rinconete and Cortadillo,\xe2\x80\x9d by which he perceived that\r\nit was a novel, and as that of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ill-advised Curiosity\xe2\x80\x9d had been\r\ngood he concluded this would be so too, as they were both probably by\r\nthe same author; so he kept it, intending to read it when he had an\r\nopportunity. He then mounted and his friend the barber did the same,\r\nboth masked, so as not to be recognised by Don Quixote, and set out\r\nfollowing in the rear of the cart. The order of march was this: first\r\nwent the cart with the owner leading it; at each side of it marched the\r\nofficers of the Brotherhood, as has been said, with their muskets; then\r\nfollowed Sancho Panza on his ass, leading Rocinante by the bridle; and\r\nbehind all came the curate and the barber on their mighty mules, with\r\nfaces covered, as aforesaid, and a grave and serious air, measuring\r\ntheir pace to suit the slow steps of the oxen. Don Quixote was seated\r\nin the cage, with his hands tied and his feet stretched out, leaning\r\nagainst the bars as silent and as patient as if he were a stone statue\r\nand not a man of flesh. Thus slowly and silently they made, it might\r\nbe, two leagues, until they reached a valley which the carter thought a\r\nconvenient place for resting and feeding his oxen, and he said so to\r\nthe curate, but the barber was of opinion that they ought to push on a\r\nlittle farther, as at the other side of a hill which appeared close by\r\nhe knew there was a valley that had more grass and much better than the\r\none where they proposed to halt; and his advice was taken and they\r\ncontinued their journey.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment the curate, looking back, saw coming on behind them\r\nsix or seven mounted men, well found and equipped, who soon overtook\r\nthem, for they were travelling, not at the sluggish, deliberate pace of\r\noxen, but like men who rode canons\xe2\x80\x99 mules, and in haste to take their\r\nnoontide rest as soon as possible at the inn which was in sight not a\r\nleague off. The quick travellers came up with the slow, and courteous\r\nsalutations were exchanged; and one of the new comers, who was, in\r\nfact, a canon of Toledo and master of the others who accompanied him,\r\nobserving the regular order of the procession, the cart, the officers,\r\nSancho, Rocinante, the curate and the barber, and above all Don Quixote\r\ncaged and confined, could not help asking what was the meaning of\r\ncarrying the man in that fashion; though, from the badges of the\r\nofficers, he already concluded that he must be some desperate\r\nhighwayman or other malefactor whose punishment fell within the\r\njurisdiction of the Holy Brotherhood. One of the officers to whom he\r\nhad put the question, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cLet the gentleman himself tell you the\r\nmeaning of his going this way, se\xc3\xb1or, for we do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote overheard the conversation and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHaply, gentlemen, you\r\nare versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry? Because if you\r\nare I will tell you my misfortunes; if not, there is no good in my\r\ngiving myself the trouble of relating them;\xe2\x80\x9d but here the curate and\r\nthe barber, seeing that the travellers were engaged in conversation\r\nwith Don Quixote, came forward, in order to answer in such a way as to\r\nsave their stratagem from being discovered.\r\n\r\nThe canon, replying to Don Quixote, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, brother, I know\r\nmore about books of chivalry than I do about Villalpando\xe2\x80\x99s elements of\r\nlogic; so if that be all, you may safely tell me what you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn God\xe2\x80\x99s name, then, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cif that be so, I\r\nwould have you know that I am held enchanted in this cage by the envy\r\nand fraud of wicked enchanters; for virtue is more persecuted by the\r\nwicked than loved by the good. I am a knight-errant, and not one of\r\nthose whose names Fame has never thought of immortalising in her\r\nrecord, but of those who, in defiance and in spite of envy itself, and\r\nall the magicians that Persia, or Brahmans that India, or Gymnosophists\r\nthat Ethiopia ever produced, will place their names in the temple of\r\nimmortality, to serve as examples and patterns for ages to come,\r\nwhereby knights-errant may see the footsteps in which they must tread\r\nif they would attain the summit and crowning point of honour in arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote of La Mancha says,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nthe truth; for he goes enchanted in this cart, not from any fault or\r\nsins of his, but because of the malevolence of those to whom virtue is\r\nodious and valour hateful. This, se\xc3\xb1or, is the Knight of the Rueful\r\nCountenance, if you have ever heard him named, whose valiant\r\nachievements and mighty deeds shall be written on lasting brass and\r\nimperishable marble, notwithstanding all the efforts of envy to obscure\r\nthem and malice to hide them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the canon heard both the prisoner and the man who was at liberty\r\ntalk in such a strain he was ready to cross himself in his\r\nastonishment, and could not make out what had befallen him; and all his\r\nattendants were in the same state of amazement.\r\n\r\nAt this point Sancho Panza, who had drawn near to hear the\r\nconversation, said, in order to make everything plain, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sirs, you\r\nmay like or dislike what I am going to say, but the fact of the matter\r\nis, my master, Don Quixote, is just as much enchanted as my mother. He\r\nis in his full senses, he eats and he drinks, and he has his calls like\r\nother men and as he had yesterday, before they caged him. And if that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he is\r\nenchanted? For I have heard many a one say that enchanted people\r\nneither eat, nor sleep, nor talk; and my master, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t stop him,\r\nwill talk more than thirty lawyers.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning to the curate he\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, se\xc3\xb1or curate, se\xc3\xb1or curate! do you think I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nyou? Do you think I don\xe2\x80\x99t guess and see the drift of these new\r\nenchantments? Well then, I can tell you I know you, for all your face\r\nis covered, and I can tell you I am up to you, however you may hide\r\nyour tricks. After all, where envy reigns virtue cannot live, and where\r\nthere is niggardliness there can be no liberality. Ill betide the\r\ndevil! if it had not been for your worship my master would be married\r\nto the Princess Micomicona this minute, and I should be a count at\r\nleast; for no less was to be expected, as well from the goodness of my\r\nmaster, him of the Rueful Countenance, as from the greatness of my\r\nservices. But I see now how true it is what they say in these parts,\r\nthat the wheel of fortune turns faster than a mill-wheel, and that\r\nthose who were up yesterday are down to-day. I am sorry for my wife and\r\nchildren, for when they might fairly and reasonably expect to see their\r\nfather return to them a governor or viceroy of some island or kingdom,\r\nthey will see him come back a horse-boy. I have said all this, se\xc3\xb1or\r\ncurate, only to urge your paternity to lay to your conscience your\r\nill-treatment of my master; and have a care that God does not call you\r\nto account in another life for making a prisoner of him in this way,\r\nand charge against you all the succours and good deeds that my lord Don\r\nQuixote leaves undone while he is shut up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrim those lamps there!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the barber at this; \xe2\x80\x9cso you are of\r\nthe same fraternity as your master, too, Sancho? By God, I begin to see\r\nthat you will have to keep him company in the cage, and be enchanted\r\nlike him for having caught some of his humour and chivalry. It was an\r\nevil hour when you let yourself be got with child by his promises, and\r\nthat island you long so much for found its way into your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not with child by anyone,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cnor am I a man to\r\nlet myself be got with child, if it was by the King himself. Though I\r\nam poor I am an old Christian, and I owe nothing to nobody, and if I\r\nlong for an island, other people long for worse. Each of us is the son\r\nof his own works; and being a man I may come to be pope, not to say\r\ngovernor of an island, especially as my master may win so many that he\r\nwill not know whom to give them to. Mind how you talk, master barber;\r\nfor shaving is not everything, and there is some difference between\r\nPeter and Peter. I say this because we all know one another, and it\r\nwill not do to throw false dice with me; and as to the enchantment of\r\nmy master, God knows the truth; leave it as it is; it only makes it\r\nworse to stir it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe barber did not care to answer Sancho lest by his plain speaking he\r\nshould disclose what the curate and he himself were trying so hard to\r\nconceal; and under the same apprehension the curate had asked the canon\r\nto ride on a little in advance, so that he might tell him the mystery\r\nof this man in the cage, and other things that would amuse him. The\r\ncanon agreed, and going on ahead with his servants, listened with\r\nattention to the account of the character, life, madness, and ways of\r\nDon Quixote, given him by the curate, who described to him briefly the\r\nbeginning and origin of his craze, and told him the whole story of his\r\nadventures up to his being confined in the cage, together with the plan\r\nthey had of taking him home to try if by any means they could discover\r\na cure for his madness. The canon and his servants were surprised anew\r\nwhen they heard Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s strange story, and when it was finished\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cTo tell the truth, se\xc3\xb1or curate, I for my part consider what\r\nthey call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though,\r\nled by idle and false taste, I have read the beginnings of almost all\r\nthat have been printed, I never could manage to read any one of them\r\nfrom beginning to end; for it seems to me they are all more or less the\r\nsame thing; and one has nothing more in it than another; this no more\r\nthan that. And in my opinion this sort of writing and composition is of\r\nthe same species as the fables they call the Milesian, nonsensical\r\ntales that aim solely at giving amusement and not instruction, exactly\r\nthe opposite of the apologue fables which amuse and instruct at the\r\nsame time. And though it may be the chief object of such books to\r\namuse, I do not know how they can succeed, when they are so full of\r\nsuch monstrous nonsense. For the enjoyment the mind feels must come\r\nfrom the beauty and harmony which it perceives or contemplates in the\r\nthings that the eye or the imagination brings before it; and nothing\r\nthat has any ugliness or disproportion about it can give any pleasure.\r\nWhat beauty, then, or what proportion of the parts to the whole, or of\r\nthe whole to the parts, can there be in a book or fable where a lad of\r\nsixteen cuts down a giant as tall as a tower and makes two halves of\r\nhim as if he was an almond cake? And when they want to give us a\r\npicture of a battle, after having told us that there are a million of\r\ncombatants on the side of the enemy, let the hero of the book be\r\nopposed to them, and we have perforce to believe, whether we like it or\r\nnot, that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of his\r\nstrong arm. And then, what shall we say of the facility with which a\r\nborn queen or empress will give herself over into the arms of some\r\nunknown wandering knight? What mind, that is not wholly barbarous and\r\nuncultured, can find pleasure in reading of how a great tower full of\r\nknights sails away across the sea like a ship with a fair wind, and\r\nwill be to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in the land of\r\nPrester John of the Indies, or some other that Ptolemy never described\r\nnor Marco Polo saw? And if, in answer to this, I am told that the\r\nauthors of books of the kind write them as fiction, and therefore are\r\nnot bound to regard niceties of truth, I would reply that fiction is\r\nall the better the more it looks like truth, and gives the more\r\npleasure the more probability and possibility there is about it. Plots\r\nin fiction should be wedded to the understanding of the reader, and be\r\nconstructed in such a way that, reconciling impossibilities, smoothing\r\nover difficulties, keeping the mind on the alert, they may surprise,\r\ninterest, divert, and entertain, so that wonder and delight joined may\r\nkeep pace one with the other; all which he will fail to effect who\r\nshuns verisimilitude and truth to nature, wherein lies the perfection\r\nof writing. I have never yet seen any book of chivalry that puts\r\ntogether a connected plot complete in all its numbers, so that the\r\nmiddle agrees with the beginning, and the end with the beginning and\r\nmiddle; on the contrary, they construct them with such a multitude of\r\nmembers that it seems as though they meant to produce a chimera or\r\nmonster rather than a well-proportioned figure. And besides all this\r\nthey are harsh in their style, incredible in their achievements,\r\nlicentious in their amours, uncouth in their courtly speeches, prolix\r\nin their battles, silly in their arguments, absurd in their travels,\r\nand, in short, wanting in everything like intelligent art; for which\r\nreason they deserve to be banished from the Christian commonwealth as a\r\nworthless breed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc47c.jpg (300K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curate listened to him attentively and felt that he was a man of\r\nsound understanding, and that there was good reason in what he said; so\r\nhe told him that, being of the same opinion himself, and bearing a\r\ngrudge to books of chivalry, he had burned all Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s, which\r\nwere many; and gave him an account of the scrutiny he had made of them,\r\nand of those he had condemned to the flames and those he had spared,\r\nwith which the canon was not a little amused, adding that though he had\r\nsaid so much in condemnation of these books, still he found one good\r\nthing in them, and that was the opportunity they afforded to a gifted\r\nintellect for displaying itself; for they presented a wide and spacious\r\nfield over which the pen might range freely, describing shipwrecks,\r\ntempests, combats, battles, portraying a valiant captain with all the\r\nqualifications requisite to make one, showing him sagacious in\r\nforeseeing the wiles of the enemy, eloquent in speech to encourage or\r\nrestrain his soldiers, ripe in counsel, rapid in resolve, as bold in\r\nbiding his time as in pressing the attack; now picturing some sad\r\ntragic incident, now some joyful and unexpected event; here a beauteous\r\nlady, virtuous, wise, and modest; there a Christian knight, brave and\r\ngentle; here a lawless, barbarous braggart; there a courteous prince,\r\ngallant and gracious; setting forth the devotion and loyalty of\r\nvassals, the greatness and generosity of nobles. \xe2\x80\x9cOr again,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe author may show himself to be an astronomer, or a skilled\r\ncosmographer, or musician, or one versed in affairs of state, and\r\nsometimes he will have a chance of coming forward as a magician if he\r\nlikes. He can set forth the craftiness of Ulysses, the piety of \xc3\x86neas,\r\nthe valour of Achilles, the misfortunes of Hector, the treachery of\r\nSinon, the friendship of Euryalus, the generosity of Alexander, the\r\nboldness of C\xc3\xa6sar, the clemency and truth of Trajan, the fidelity of\r\nZopyrus, the wisdom of Cato, and in short all the faculties that serve\r\nto make an illustrious man perfect, now uniting them in one individual,\r\nagain distributing them among many; and if this be done with charm of\r\nstyle and ingenious invention, aiming at the truth as much as possible,\r\nhe will assuredly weave a web of bright and varied threads that, when\r\nfinished, will display such perfection and beauty that it will attain\r\nthe worthiest object any writing can seek, which, as I said before, is\r\nto give instruction and pleasure combined; for the unrestricted range\r\nof these books enables the author to show his powers, epic, lyric,\r\ntragic, or comic, and all the moods the sweet and winning arts of poesy\r\nand oratory are capable of; for the epic may be written in prose just\r\nas well as in verse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc47e.jpg (67K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\nIN WHICH THE CANON PURSUES THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOKS OF CHIVALRY, WITH\r\nOTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF HIS WIT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc48a.jpg (80K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as you say, se\xc3\xb1or canon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cand for that reason\r\nthose who have hitherto written books of the sort deserve all the more\r\ncensure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or the\r\nrules of art, by which they might guide themselves and become as famous\r\nin prose as the two princes of Greek and Latin poetry are in verse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI myself, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the canon, \xe2\x80\x9cwas once tempted to write a\r\nbook of chivalry in which all the points I have mentioned were to be\r\nobserved; and if I must own the truth I have more than a hundred sheets\r\nwritten; and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it, I showed\r\nthem to persons who were fond of this kind of reading, to learned and\r\nintelligent men as well as to ignorant people who cared for nothing but\r\nthe pleasure of listening to nonsense, and from all I obtained\r\nflattering approval; nevertheless I proceeded no farther with it, as\r\nwell because it seemed to me an occupation inconsistent with my\r\nprofession, as because I perceived that the fools are more numerous\r\nthan the wise; and, though it is better to be praised by the wise few\r\nthan applauded by the foolish many, I have no mind to submit myself to\r\nthe stupid judgment of the silly public, to whom the reading of such\r\nbooks falls for the most part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what most of all made me hold my hand and even abandon all idea of\r\nfinishing it was an argument I put to myself taken from the plays that\r\nare acted now-a-days, which was in this wise: if those that are now in\r\nvogue, as well those that are pure invention as those founded on\r\nhistory, are, all or most of them, downright nonsense and things that\r\nhave neither head nor tail, and yet the public listens to them with\r\ndelight, and regards and cries them up as perfection when they are so\r\nfar from it; and if the authors who write them, and the players who act\r\nthem, say that this is what they must be, for the public wants this and\r\nwill have nothing else; and that those that go by rule and work out a\r\nplot according to the laws of art will only find some half-dozen\r\nintelligent people to understand them, while all the rest remain blind\r\nto the merit of their composition; and that for themselves it is better\r\nto get bread from the many than praise from the few; then my book will\r\nfare the same way, after I have burnt off my eyebrows in trying to\r\nobserve the principles I have spoken of, and I shall be \xe2\x80\x98the tailor of\r\nthe corner.\xe2\x80\x99 And though I have sometimes endeavoured to convince actors\r\nthat they are mistaken in this notion they have adopted, and that they\r\nwould attract more people, and get more credit, by producing plays in\r\naccordance with the rules of art, than by absurd ones, they are so\r\nthoroughly wedded to their own opinion that no argument or evidence can\r\nwean them from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember saying one day to one of these obstinate fellows, \xe2\x80\x98Tell me,\r\ndo you not recollect that a few years ago, there were three tragedies\r\nacted in Spain, written by a famous poet of these kingdoms, which were\r\nsuch that they filled all who heard them with admiration, delight, and\r\ninterest, the ignorant as well as the wise, the masses as well as the\r\nhigher orders, and brought in more money to the performers, these three\r\nalone, than thirty of the best that have been since produced?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No doubt,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the actor in question, \xe2\x80\x98you mean the \xe2\x80\x9cIsabella,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cPhyllis,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cAlexandra.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Those are the ones I mean,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98and see if they did not observe\r\nthe principles of art, and if, by observing them, they failed to show\r\ntheir superiority and please all the world; so that the fault does not\r\nlie with the public that insists upon nonsense, but with those who\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how to produce something else. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ingratitude Revenged\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas not nonsense, nor was there any in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Numantia,\xe2\x80\x9d nor any to be\r\nfound in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Merchant Lover,\xe2\x80\x9d nor yet in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Friendly Fair Foe,\xe2\x80\x9d nor\r\nin some others that have been written by certain gifted poets, to their\r\nown fame and renown, and to the profit of those that brought them out;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsome further remarks I added to these, with which, I think, I left him\r\nrather dumbfoundered, but not so satisfied or convinced that I could\r\ndisabuse him of his error.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have touched upon a subject, se\xc3\xb1or canon,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the curate\r\nhere, \xe2\x80\x9cthat has awakened an old enmity I have against the plays in\r\nvogue at the present day, quite as strong as that which I bear to the\r\nbooks of chivalry; for while the drama, according to Tully, should be\r\nthe mirror of human life, the model of manners, and the image of the\r\ntruth, those which are presented now-a-days are mirrors of nonsense,\r\nmodels of folly, and images of lewdness. For what greater nonsense can\r\nthere be in connection with what we are now discussing than for an\r\ninfant to appear in swaddling clothes in the first scene of the first\r\nact, and in the second a grown-up bearded man? Or what greater\r\nabsurdity can there be than putting before us an old man as a\r\nswashbuckler, a young man as a poltroon, a lackey using fine language,\r\na page giving sage advice, a king plying as a porter, a princess who is\r\na kitchen-maid? And then what shall I say of their attention to the\r\ntime in which the action they represent may or can take place, save\r\nthat I have seen a play where the first act began in Europe, the second\r\nin Asia, the third finished in Africa, and no doubt, had it been in\r\nfour acts, the fourth would have ended in America, and so it would have\r\nbeen laid in all four quarters of the globe? And if truth to life is\r\nthe main thing the drama should keep in view, how is it possible for\r\nany average understanding to be satisfied when the action is supposed\r\nto pass in the time of King Pepin or Charlemagne, and the principal\r\npersonage in it they represent to be the Emperor Heraclius who entered\r\nJerusalem with the cross and won the Holy Sepulchre, like Godfrey of\r\nBouillon, there being years innumerable between the one and the other?\r\nor, if the play is based on fiction and historical facts are\r\nintroduced, or bits of what occurred to different people and at\r\ndifferent times mixed up with it, all, not only without any semblance\r\nof probability, but with obvious errors that from every point of view\r\nare inexcusable? And the worst of it is, there are ignorant people who\r\nsay that this is perfection, and that anything beyond this is affected\r\nrefinement. And then if we turn to sacred dramas\xe2\x80\x94what miracles they\r\ninvent in them! What apocryphal, ill-devised incidents, attributing to\r\none saint the miracles of another! And even in secular plays they\r\nventure to introduce miracles without any reason or object except that\r\nthey think some such miracle, or transformation as they call it, will\r\ncome in well to astonish stupid people and draw them to the play. All\r\nthis tends to the prejudice of the truth and the corruption of history,\r\nnay more, to the reproach of the wits of Spain; for foreigners who\r\nscrupulously observe the laws of the drama look upon us as barbarous\r\nand ignorant, when they see the absurdity and nonsense of the plays we\r\nproduce. Nor will it be a sufficient excuse to say that the chief\r\nobject well-ordered governments have in view when they permit plays to\r\nbe performed in public is to entertain the people with some harmless\r\namusement occasionally, and keep it from those evil humours which\r\nidleness is apt to engender; and that, as this may be attained by any\r\nsort of play, good or bad, there is no need to lay down laws, or bind\r\nthose who write or act them to make them as they ought to be made,\r\nsince, as I say, the object sought for may be secured by any sort. To\r\nthis I would reply that the same end would be, beyond all comparison,\r\nbetter attained by means of good plays than by those that are not so;\r\nfor after listening to an artistic and properly constructed play, the\r\nhearer will come away enlivened by the jests, instructed by the serious\r\nparts, full of admiration at the incidents, his wits sharpened by the\r\narguments, warned by the tricks, all the wiser for the examples,\r\ninflamed against vice, and in love with virtue; for in all these ways a\r\ngood play will stimulate the mind of the hearer be he ever so boorish\r\nor dull; and of all impossibilities the greatest is that a play endowed\r\nwith all these qualities will not entertain, satisfy, and please much\r\nmore than one wanting in them, like the greater number of those which\r\nare commonly acted now-a-days. Nor are the poets who write them to be\r\nblamed for this; for some there are among them who are perfectly well\r\naware of their faults, and know what they ought to do; but as plays\r\nhave become a salable commodity, they say, and with truth, that the\r\nactors will not buy them unless they are after this fashion; and so the\r\npoet tries to adapt himself to the requirements of the actor who is to\r\npay him for his work. And that this is the truth may be seen by the\r\ncountless plays that a most fertile wit of these kingdoms has written,\r\nwith so much brilliancy, so much grace and gaiety, such polished\r\nversification, such choice language, such profound reflections, and in\r\na word, so rich in eloquence and elevation of style, that he has filled\r\nthe world with his fame; and yet, in consequence of his desire to suit\r\nthe taste of the actors, they have not all, as some of them have, come\r\nas near perfection as they ought. Others write plays with such\r\nheedlessness that, after they have been acted, the actors have to fly\r\nand abscond, afraid of being punished, as they often have been, for\r\nhaving acted something offensive to some king or other, or insulting to\r\nsome noble family. All which evils, and many more that I say nothing\r\nof, would be removed if there were some intelligent and sensible person\r\nat the capital to examine all plays before they were acted, not only\r\nthose produced in the capital itself, but all that were intended to be\r\nacted in Spain; without whose approval, seal, and signature, no local\r\nmagistracy should allow any play to be acted. In that case actors would\r\ntake care to send their plays to the capital, and could act them in\r\nsafety, and those who write them would be more careful and take more\r\npains with their work, standing in awe of having to submit it to the\r\nstrict examination of one who understood the matter; and so good plays\r\nwould be produced and the objects they aim at happily attained; as well\r\nthe amusement of the people, as the credit of the wits of Spain, the\r\ninterest and safety of the actors, and the saving of trouble in\r\ninflicting punishment on them. And if the same or some other person\r\nwere authorised to examine the newly written books of chivalry, no\r\ndoubt some would appear with all the perfections you have described,\r\nenriching our language with the gracious and precious treasure of\r\neloquence, and driving the old books into obscurity before the light of\r\nthe new ones that would come out for the harmless entertainment, not\r\nmerely of the idle but of the very busiest; for the bow cannot be\r\nalways bent, nor can weak human nature exist without some lawful\r\namusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe canon and the curate had proceeded thus far with their\r\nconversation, when the barber, coming forward, joined them, and said to\r\nthe curate, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the spot, se\xc3\xb1or licentiate, that I said was a good\r\none for fresh and plentiful pasture for the oxen, while we take our\r\nnoontide rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it seems,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the curate, and he told the canon what he\r\nproposed to do, on which he too made up his mind to halt with them,\r\nattracted by the aspect of the fair valley that lay before their eyes;\r\nand to enjoy it as well as the conversation of the curate, to whom he\r\nhad begun to take a fancy, and also to learn more particulars about the\r\ndoings of Don Quixote, he desired some of his servants to go on to the\r\ninn, which was not far distant, and fetch from it what eatables there\r\nmight be for the whole party, as he meant to rest for the afternoon\r\nwhere he was; to which one of his servants replied that the sumpter\r\nmule, which by this time ought to have reached the inn, carried\r\nprovisions enough to make it unnecessary to get anything from the inn\r\nexcept barley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said the canon, \xe2\x80\x9ctake all the beasts there, and bring\r\nthe sumpter mule back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, Sancho, perceiving that he could speak to his\r\nmaster without having the curate and the barber, of whom he had his\r\nsuspicions, present all the time, approached the cage in which Don\r\nQuixote was placed, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, to ease my conscience I want to\r\ntell you the state of the case as to your enchantment, and that is that\r\nthese two here, with their faces covered, are the curate of our village\r\nand the barber; and I suspect they have hit upon this plan of carrying\r\nyou off in this fashion, out of pure envy because your worship\r\nsurpasses them in doing famous deeds; and if this be the truth it\r\nfollows that you are not enchanted, but hoodwinked and made a fool of.\r\nAnd to prove this I want to ask you one thing; and if you answer me as\r\nI believe you will answer, you will be able to lay your finger on the\r\ntrick, and you will see that you are not enchanted but gone wrong in\r\nyour wits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk what thou wilt, Sancho my son,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I will\r\nsatisfy thee and answer all thou requirest. As to what thou sayest,\r\nthat these who accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber, our\r\nneighbours and acquaintances, it is very possible that they may seem to\r\nbe those same persons; but that they are so in reality and in fact,\r\nbelieve it not on any account; what thou art to believe and think is\r\nthat, if they look like them, as thou sayest, it must be that those who\r\nhave enchanted me have taken this shape and likeness; for it is easy\r\nfor enchanters to take any form they please, and they may have taken\r\nthose of our friends in order to make thee think as thou dost, and lead\r\nthee into a labyrinth of fancies from which thou wilt find no escape\r\nthough thou hadst the cord of Theseus; and they may also have done it\r\nto make me uncertain in my mind, and unable to conjecture whence this\r\nevil comes to me; for if on the one hand thou dost tell me that the\r\nbarber and curate of our village are here in company with us, and on\r\nthe other I find myself shut up in a cage, and know in my heart that no\r\npower on earth that was not supernatural would have been able to shut\r\nme in, what wouldst thou have me say or think, but that my enchantment\r\nis of a sort that transcends all I have ever read of in all the\r\nhistories that deal with knights-errant that have been enchanted? So\r\nthou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that they are what thou\r\nsayest, for they are as much so as I am a Turk. But touching thy desire\r\nto ask me something, say on, and I will answer thee, though thou\r\nshouldst ask questions from this till to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay Our Lady be good to me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, lifting up his voice; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nis it possible that your worship is so thick of skull and so short of\r\nbrains that you cannot see that what I say is the simple truth, and\r\nthat malice has more to do with your imprisonment and misfortune than\r\nenchantment? But as it is so, I will prove plainly to you that you are\r\nnot enchanted. Now tell me, so may God deliver you from this\r\naffliction, and so may you find yourself when you least expect it in\r\nthe arms of my lady Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave off conjuring me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand ask what thou wouldst\r\nknow; I have already told thee I will answer with all possible\r\nprecision.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I want,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand what I would know, and have\r\nyou tell me, without adding or leaving out anything, but telling the\r\nwhole truth as one expects it to be told, and as it is told, by all who\r\nprofess arms, as your worship professes them, under the title of\r\nknights-errant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell thee I will not lie in any particular,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfinish thy question; for in truth thou weariest me with all these\r\nasseverations, requirements, and precautions, Sancho.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I rely on the goodness and truth of my master,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand so, because it bears upon what we are talking about, I would ask,\r\nspeaking with all reverence, whether since your worship has been shut\r\nup and, as you think, enchanted in this cage, you have felt any desire\r\nor inclination to go anywhere, as the saying is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand \xe2\x80\x98going anywhere,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cexplain\r\nthyself more clearly, Sancho, if thou wouldst have me give an answer to\r\nthe point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your worship does not understand\r\n\xe2\x80\x98going anywhere\xe2\x80\x99? Why, the schoolboys know that from the time they were\r\nbabes. Well then, you must know I mean have you had any desire to do\r\nwhat cannot be avoided?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! now I understand thee, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cyes, often, and\r\neven this minute; get me out of this strait, or all will not go right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc48e.jpg (32K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF THE SHREWD CONVERSATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH\r\nHIS MASTER DON QUIXOTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc49a.jpg (181K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha, I have caught you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is what in my heart and\r\nsoul I was longing to know. Come now, se\xc3\xb1or, can you deny what is\r\ncommonly said around us, when a person is out of humour, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat ails so-and-so, that he neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor\r\ngives a proper answer to any question; one would think he was\r\nenchanted\xe2\x80\x99? From which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat,\r\nor drink, or sleep, or do any of the natural acts I am speaking of\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nsuch persons are enchanted; but not those that have the desire your\r\nworship has, and drink when drink is given them, and eat when there is\r\nanything to eat, and answer every question that is asked them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat thou sayest is true, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have\r\nalready told thee there are many sorts of enchantments, and it may be\r\nthat in the course of time they have been changed one for another, and\r\nthat now it may be the way with enchanted people to do all that I do,\r\nthough they did not do so before; so it is vain to argue or draw\r\ninferences against the usage of the time. I know and feel that I am\r\nenchanted, and that is enough to ease my conscience; for it would weigh\r\nheavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted, and that in a\r\nfaint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage,\r\ndefrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in need\r\nand distress, who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and\r\nprotection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill for all that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI say that, for your greater and\r\nfuller satisfaction, it would be well if your worship were to try to\r\nget out of this prison (and I promise to do all in my power to help,\r\nand even to take you out of it), and see if you could once more mount\r\nyour good Rocinante, who seems to be enchanted too, he is so melancholy\r\nand dejected; and then we might try our chance in looking for\r\nadventures again; and if we have no luck there will be time enough to\r\ngo back to the cage; in which, on the faith of a good and loyal squire,\r\nI promise to shut myself up along with your worship, if so be you are\r\nso unfortunate, or I so stupid, as not to be able to carry out my\r\nplan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am content to do as thou sayest, brother Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand when thou seest an opportunity for effecting my release I will\r\nobey thee absolutely; but thou wilt see, Sancho, how mistaken thou art\r\nin thy conception of my misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversation\r\ntill they reached the place where the curate, the canon, and the\r\nbarber, who had already dismounted, were waiting for them. The carter\r\nat once unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the\r\npleasant green spot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, not\r\nenchanted people like Don Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like\r\nhis squire, who begged the curate to allow his master to leave the cage\r\nfor a little; for if they did not let him out, the prison might not be\r\nas clean as the propriety of such a gentleman as his master required.\r\nThe curate understood him, and said he would very gladly comply with\r\nhis request, only that he feared his master, finding himself at\r\nliberty, would take to his old courses and make off where nobody could\r\never find him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will answer for his not running away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I also,\xe2\x80\x9d said the canon, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially if he gives me his word as a\r\nknight not to leave us without our consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote, who was listening to all this, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI give it;\xe2\x80\x94moreover\r\none who is enchanted as I am cannot do as he likes with himself; for he\r\nwho had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one place for three\r\nages, and if he attempted to escape would bring him back flying.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94And\r\nthat being so, they might as well release him, particularly as it would\r\nbe to the advantage of all; for, if they did not let him out, he\r\nprotested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless\r\nthey kept their distance.\r\n\r\nThe canon took his hand, tied together as they both were, and on his\r\nword and promise they unbound him, and rejoiced beyond measure he was\r\nto find himself out of the cage. The first thing he did was to stretch\r\nhimself all over, and then he went to where Rocinante was standing and\r\ngiving him a couple of slaps on the haunches said, \xe2\x80\x9cI still trust in\r\nGod and in his blessed mother, O flower and mirror of steeds, that we\r\nshall soon see ourselves, both of us, as we wish to be, thou with thy\r\nmaster on thy back, and I mounted upon thee, following the calling for\r\nwhich God sent me into the world.\xe2\x80\x9d And so saying, accompanied by\r\nSancho, he withdrew to a retired spot, from which he came back much\r\nrelieved and more eager than ever to put his squire\xe2\x80\x99s scheme into\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nThe canon gazed at him, wondering at the extraordinary nature of his\r\nmadness, and that in all his remarks and replies he should show such\r\nexcellent sense, and only lose his stirrups, as has been already said,\r\nwhen the subject of chivalry was broached. And so, moved by compassion,\r\nhe said to him, as they all sat on the green grass awaiting the arrival\r\nof the provisions:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible, gentle sir, that the nauseous and idle reading of\r\nbooks of chivalry can have had such an effect on your worship as to\r\nupset your reason so that you fancy yourself enchanted, and the like,\r\nall as far from the truth as falsehood itself is? How can there be any\r\nhuman understanding that can persuade itself there ever was all that\r\ninfinity of Amadises in the world, or all that multitude of famous\r\nknights, all those emperors of Trebizond, all those Felixmartes of\r\nHircania, all those palfreys, and damsels-errant, and serpents, and\r\nmonsters, and giants, and marvellous adventures, and enchantments of\r\nevery kind, and battles, and prodigious encounters, splendid costumes,\r\nlove-sick princesses, squires made counts, droll dwarfs, love letters,\r\nbillings and cooings, swashbuckler women, and, in a word, all that\r\nnonsense the books of chivalry contain? For myself, I can only say that\r\nwhen I read them, so long as I do not stop to think that they are all\r\nlies and frivolity, they give me a certain amount of pleasure; but when\r\nI come to consider what they are, I fling the very best of them at the\r\nwall, and would fling it into the fire if there were one at hand, as\r\nrichly deserving such punishment as cheats and impostors out of the\r\nrange of ordinary toleration, and as founders of new sects and modes of\r\nlife, and teachers that lead the ignorant public to believe and accept\r\nas truth all the folly they contain. And such is their audacity, they\r\neven dare to unsettle the wits of gentlemen of birth and intelligence,\r\nas is shown plainly by the way they have served your worship, when they\r\nhave brought you to such a pass that you have to be shut up in a cage\r\nand carried on an ox-cart as one would carry a lion or a tiger from\r\nplace to place to make money by showing it. Come, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\r\nhave some compassion for yourself, return to the bosom of common sense,\r\nand make use of the liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to\r\nbestow upon you, employing your abundant gifts of mind in some other\r\nreading that may serve to benefit your conscience and add to your\r\nhonour. And if, still led away by your natural bent, you desire to read\r\nbooks of achievements and of chivalry, read the Book of Judges in the\r\nHoly Scriptures, for there you will find grand reality, and deeds as\r\ntrue as they are heroic. Lusitania had a Viriatus, Rome a C\xc3\xa6sar,\r\nCarthage a Hannibal, Greece an Alexander, Castile a Count Fernan\r\nGonzalez, Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a Gonzalo Fernandez, Estremadura a\r\nDiego Garc\xc3\xada de Paredes, Jerez a Garci Perez de Vargas, Toledo a\r\nGarcilaso, Seville a Don Manuel de Leon, to read of whose valiant deeds\r\nwill entertain and instruct the loftiest minds and fill them with\r\ndelight and wonder. Here, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, will be reading worthy of\r\nyour sound understanding; from which you will rise learned in history,\r\nin love with virtue, strengthened in goodness, improved in manners,\r\nbrave without rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to the\r\nhonour of God, your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, I\r\nam informed, your worship derives your birth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote listened with the greatest attention to the canon\xe2\x80\x99s words,\r\nand when he found he had finished, after regarding him for some time,\r\nhe replied to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears to me, gentle sir, that your worship\xe2\x80\x99s discourse is\r\nintended to persuade me that there never were any knights-errant in the\r\nworld, and that all the books of chivalry are false, lying, mischievous\r\nand useless to the State, and that I have done wrong in reading them,\r\nand worse in believing them, and still worse in imitating them, when I\r\nundertook to follow the arduous calling of knight-errantry which they\r\nset forth; for you deny that there ever were Amadises of Gaul or of\r\nGreece, or any other of the knights of whom the books are full.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all exactly as you state it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the canon; to which Don\r\nQuixote returned, \xe2\x80\x9cYou also went on to say that books of this kind had\r\ndone me much harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me up\r\nin a cage, and that it would be better for me to reform and change my\r\nstudies, and read other truer books which would afford more pleasure\r\nand instruction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the canon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cto my mind it is you who are the\r\none that is out of his wits and enchanted, as you have ventured to\r\nutter such blasphemies against a thing so universally acknowledged and\r\naccepted as true that whoever denies it, as you do, deserves the same\r\npunishment which you say you inflict on the books that irritate you\r\nwhen you read them. For to try to persuade anybody that Amadis, and all\r\nthe other knights-adventurers with whom the books are filled, never\r\nexisted, would be like trying to persuade him that the sun does not\r\nyield light, or ice cold, or earth nourishment. What wit in the world\r\ncan persuade another that the story of the Princess Floripes and Guy of\r\nBurgundy is not true, or that of Fierabras and the bridge of Mantible,\r\nwhich happened in the time of Charlemagne? For by all that is good it\r\nis as true as that it is daylight now; and if it be a lie, it must be a\r\nlie too that there was a Hector, or Achilles, or Trojan war, or Twelve\r\nPeers of France, or Arthur of England, who still lives changed into a\r\nraven, and is unceasingly looked for in his kingdom. One might just as\r\nwell try to make out that the history of Guarino Mezquino, or of the\r\nquest of the Holy Grail, is false, or that the loves of Tristram and\r\nthe Queen Yseult are apocryphal, as well as those of Guinevere and\r\nLancelot, when there are persons who can almost remember having seen\r\nthe Dame Quinta\xc3\xb1ona, who was the best cupbearer in Great Britain. And\r\nso true is this, that I recollect a grandmother of mine on the father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside, whenever she saw any dame in a venerable hood, used to say to me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Grandson, that one is like Dame Quinta\xc3\xb1ona,\xe2\x80\x99 from which I conclude\r\nthat she must have known her, or at least had managed to see some\r\nportrait of her. Then who can deny that the story of Pierres and the\r\nfair Magalona is true, when even to this day may be seen in the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narmoury the pin with which the valiant Pierres guided the wooden horse\r\nhe rode through the air, and it is a trifle bigger than the pole of a\r\ncart? And alongside of the pin is Babieca\xe2\x80\x99s saddle, and at Roncesvalles\r\nthere is Roland\xe2\x80\x99s horn, as large as a large beam; whence we may infer\r\nthat there were Twelve Peers, and a Pierres, and a Cid, and other\r\nknights like them, of the sort people commonly call adventurers. Or\r\nperhaps I shall be told, too, that there was no such knight-errant as\r\nthe valiant Lusitanian Juan de Merlo, who went to Burgundy and in the\r\ncity of Arras fought with the famous lord of Charny, Mosen Pierres by\r\nname, and afterwards in the city of Basle with Mosen Enrique de\r\nRemesten, coming out of both encounters covered with fame and honour;\r\nor adventures and challenges achieved and delivered, also in Burgundy,\r\nby the valiant Spaniards Pedro Barba and Gutierre Quixada (of whose\r\nfamily I come in the direct male line), when they vanquished the sons\r\nof the Count of San Polo. I shall be told, too, that Don Fernando de\r\nGuevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germany, where he engaged\r\nin combat with Micer George, a knight of the house of the Duke of\r\nAustria. I shall be told that the jousts of Suero de Qui\xc3\xb1ones, him of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Paso,\xe2\x80\x99 and the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against the\r\nCastilian knight, Don Gonzalo de Guzman, were mere mockeries; as well\r\nas many other achievements of Christian knights of these and foreign\r\nrealms, which are so authentic and true, that, I repeat, he who denies\r\nthem must be totally wanting in reason and good sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe canon was amazed to hear the medley of truth and fiction Don\r\nQuixote uttered, and to see how well acquainted he was with everything\r\nrelating or belonging to the achievements of his knight-errantry; so he\r\nsaid in reply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot deny, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, that there is some truth in what you\r\nsay, especially as regards the Spanish knights-errant; and I am willing\r\nto grant too that the Twelve Peers of France existed, but I am not\r\ndisposed to believe that they did all the things that the Archbishop\r\nTurpin relates of them. For the truth of the matter is they were\r\nknights chosen by the kings of France, and called \xe2\x80\x98Peers\xe2\x80\x99 because they\r\nwere all equal in worth, rank and prowess (at least if they were not\r\nthey ought to have been), and it was a kind of religious order like\r\nthose of Santiago and Calatrava in the present day, in which it is\r\nassumed that those who take it are valiant knights of distinction and\r\ngood birth; and just as we say now a Knight of St. John, or of\r\nAlc\xc3\xa1ntara, they used to say then a Knight of the Twelve Peers, because\r\ntwelve equals were chosen for that military order. That there was a\r\nCid, as well as a Bernardo del Carpio, there can be no doubt; but that\r\nthey did the deeds people say they did, I hold to be very doubtful. In\r\nthat other matter of the pin of Count Pierres that you speak of, and\r\nsay is near Babieca\xe2\x80\x99s saddle in the Armoury, I confess my sin; for I am\r\neither so stupid or so short-sighted, that, though I have seen the\r\nsaddle, I have never been able to see the pin, in spite of it being as\r\nbig as your worship says it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that it is there, without any manner of doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand more by token they say it is inclosed in a sheath of\r\ncowhide to keep it from rusting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that may be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the canon; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, by the orders I have\r\nreceived, I do not remember seeing it. However, granting it is there,\r\nthat is no reason why I am bound to believe the stories of all those\r\nAmadises and of all that multitude of knights they tell us about, nor\r\nis it reasonable that a man like your worship, so worthy, and with so\r\nmany good qualities, and endowed with such a good understanding, should\r\nallow himself to be persuaded that such wild crazy things as are\r\nwritten in those absurd books of chivalry are really true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc49e.jpg (22K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\nOF THE SHREWD CONTROVERSY WHICH DON QUIXOTE AND THE CANON HELD,\r\nTOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc50a.jpg (160K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good joke, that!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cBooks that have been\r\nprinted with the king\xe2\x80\x99s licence, and with the approbation of those to\r\nwhom they have been submitted, and read with universal delight, and\r\nextolled by great and small, rich and poor, learned and ignorant,\r\ngentle and simple, in a word by people of every sort, of whatever rank\r\nor condition they may be\xe2\x80\x94that these should be lies! And above all when\r\nthey carry such an appearance of truth with them; for they tell us the\r\nfather, mother, country, kindred, age, place, and the achievements,\r\nstep by step, and day by day, performed by such a knight or knights!\r\nHush, sir; utter not such blasphemy; trust me I am advising you now to\r\nact as a sensible man should; only read them, and you will see the\r\npleasure you will derive from them. For, come, tell me, can there be\r\nanything more delightful than to see, as it were, here now displayed\r\nbefore us a vast lake of bubbling pitch with a host of snakes and\r\nserpents and lizards, and ferocious and terrible creatures of all sorts\r\nswimming about in it, while from the middle of the lake there comes a\r\nplaintive voice saying: \xe2\x80\x98Knight, whosoever thou art who beholdest this\r\ndread lake, if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden beneath\r\nthese dusky waves, prove the valour of thy stout heart and cast thyself\r\ninto the midst of its dark burning waters, else thou shalt not be\r\nworthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the seven castles of the\r\nseven Fays that lie beneath this black expanse;\xe2\x80\x99 and then the knight,\r\nalmost ere the awful voice has ceased, without stopping to consider,\r\nwithout pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he is exposing\r\nhimself, without even relieving himself of the weight of his massive\r\narmour, commending himself to God and to his lady, plunges into the\r\nmidst of the boiling lake, and when he little looks for it, or knows\r\nwhat his fate is to be, he finds himself among flowery meadows, with\r\nwhich the Elysian fields are not to be compared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc50b.jpg (344K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sky seems more transparent there, and the sun shines with a\r\nstrange brilliancy, and a delightful grove of green leafy trees\r\npresents itself to the eyes and charms the sight with its verdure,\r\nwhile the ear is soothed by the sweet untutored melody of the countless\r\nbirds of gay plumage that flit to and fro among the interlacing\r\nbranches. Here he sees a brook whose limpid waters, like liquid\r\ncrystal, ripple over fine sands and white pebbles that look like sifted\r\ngold and purest pearls. There he perceives a cunningly wrought fountain\r\nof many-coloured jasper and polished marble; here another of rustic\r\nfashion where the little mussel-shells and the spiral white and yellow\r\nmansions of the snail disposed in studious disorder, mingled with\r\nfragments of glittering crystal and mock emeralds, make up a work of\r\nvaried aspect, where art, imitating nature, seems to have outdone it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc50c.jpg (334K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly there is presented to his sight a strong castle or gorgeous\r\npalace with walls of massy gold, turrets of diamond and gates of\r\njacinth; in short, so marvellous is its structure that though the\r\nmaterials of which it is built are nothing less than diamonds,\r\ncarbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds, the workmanship is\r\nstill more rare. And after having seen all this, what can be more\r\ncharming than to see how a bevy of damsels comes forth from the gate of\r\nthe castle in gay and gorgeous attire, such that, were I to set myself\r\nnow to depict it as the histories describe it to us, I should never\r\nhave done; and then how she who seems to be the first among them all\r\ntakes the bold knight who plunged into the boiling lake by the hand,\r\nand without addressing a word to him leads him into the rich palace or\r\ncastle, and strips him as naked as when his mother bore him, and bathes\r\nhim in lukewarm water, and anoints him all over with sweet-smelling\r\nunguents, and clothes him in a shirt of the softest sendal, all scented\r\nand perfumed, while another damsel comes and throws over his shoulders\r\na mantle which is said to be worth at the very least a city, and even\r\nmore? How charming it is, then, when they tell us how, after all this,\r\nthey lead him to another chamber where he finds the tables set out in\r\nsuch style that he is filled with amazement and wonder; to see how they\r\npour out water for his hands distilled from amber and sweet-scented\r\nflowers; how they seat him on an ivory chair; to see how the damsels\r\nwait on him all in profound silence; how they bring him such a variety\r\nof dainties so temptingly prepared that the appetite is at a loss which\r\nto select; to hear the music that resounds while he is at table, by\r\nwhom or whence produced he knows not. And then when the repast is over\r\nand the tables removed, for the knight to recline in the chair, picking\r\nhis teeth perhaps as usual, and a damsel, much lovelier than any of the\r\nothers, to enter unexpectedly by the chamber door, and herself by his\r\nside, and begin to tell him what the castle is, and how she is held\r\nenchanted there, and other things that amaze the knight and astonish\r\nthe readers who are perusing his history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc50d.jpg (433K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I will not expatiate any further upon this, as it may be gathered\r\nfrom it that whatever part of whatever history of a knight-errant one\r\nreads, it will fill the reader, whoever he be, with delight and wonder;\r\nand take my advice, sir, and, as I said before, read these books and\r\nyou will see how they will banish any melancholy you may feel and raise\r\nyour spirits should they be depressed. For myself I can say that since\r\nI have been a knight-errant I have become valiant, polite, generous,\r\nwell-bred, magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have\r\nlearned to bear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and though\r\nit be such a short time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like\r\na madman, I hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune\r\nthwart me not, to see myself king of some kingdom where I may be able\r\nto show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by my\r\nfaith, se\xc3\xb1or, the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of\r\ngenerosity to anyone, though he may possess it in the highest degree;\r\nand gratitude that consists of disposition only is a dead thing, just\r\nas faith without works is dead. For this reason I should be glad were\r\nfortune soon to offer me some opportunity of making myself an emperor,\r\nso as to show my heart in doing good to my friends, particularly to\r\nthis poor Sancho Panza, my squire, who is the best fellow in the world;\r\nand I would gladly give him a county I have promised him this ever so\r\nlong, only that I am afraid he has not the capacity to govern his\r\nrealm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho partly heard these last words of his master, and said to him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrive hard you, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, to give me that county so often\r\npromised by you and so long looked for by me, for I promise you there\r\nwill be no want of capacity in me to govern it; and even if there is, I\r\nhave heard say there are men in the world who farm seigniories, paying\r\nso much a year, and they themselves taking charge of the government,\r\nwhile the lord, with his legs stretched out, enjoys the revenue they\r\npay him, without troubling himself about anything else. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do, and not stand haggling over trifles, but wash my hands at once\r\nof the whole business, and enjoy my rents like a duke, and let things\r\ngo their own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, brother Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the canon, \xe2\x80\x9conly holds good as far as the\r\nenjoyment of the revenue goes; but the lord of the seigniory must\r\nattend to the administration of justice, and here capacity and sound\r\njudgment come in, and above all a firm determination to find out the\r\ntruth; for if this be wanting in the beginning, the middle and the end\r\nwill always go wrong; and God as commonly aids the honest intentions of\r\nthe simple as he frustrates the evil designs of the crafty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand those philosophies,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho Panza; \xe2\x80\x9call I\r\nknow is I would I had the county as soon as I shall know how to govern\r\nit; for I have as much soul as another, and as much body as anyone, and\r\nI shall be as much king of my realm as any other of his; and being so I\r\nshould do as I liked, and doing as I liked I should please myself, and\r\npleasing myself I should be content, and when one is content he has\r\nnothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire there\r\nis an end of it; so let the county come, and God be with you, and let\r\nus see one another, as one blind man said to the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not bad philosophy thou art talking, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the canon;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut for all that there is a good deal to be said on this matter of\r\ncounties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Don Quixote returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI know not what more there is to be\r\nsaid; I only guide myself by the example set me by the great Amadis of\r\nGaul, when he made his squire count of the Insula Firme; and so,\r\nwithout any scruples of conscience, I can make a count of Sancho Panza,\r\nfor he is one of the best squires that ever knight-errant had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense be\r\ncapable of method) that Don Quixote uttered, at the way in which he had\r\ndescribed the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impression\r\nthat the deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, and\r\nlastly he marvelled at the simplicity of Sancho, who desired so eagerly\r\nto obtain the county his master had promised him.\r\n\r\nBy this time the canon\xe2\x80\x99s servants, who had gone to the inn to fetch the\r\nsumpter mule, had returned, and making a carpet and the green grass of\r\nthe meadow serve as a table, they seated themselves in the shade of\r\nsome trees and made their repast there, that the carter might not be\r\ndeprived of the advantage of the spot, as has been already said. As\r\nthey were eating they suddenly heard a loud noise and the sound of a\r\nbell that seemed to come from among some brambles and thick bushes that\r\nwere close by, and the same instant they observed a beautiful goat,\r\nspotted all over black, white, and brown, spring out of the thicket\r\nwith a goatherd after it, calling to it and uttering the usual cries to\r\nmake it stop or turn back to the fold. The fugitive goat, scared and\r\nfrightened, ran towards the company as if seeking their protection and\r\nthen stood still, and the goatherd coming up seized it by the horns and\r\nbegan to talk to it as if it were possessed of reason and\r\nunderstanding: \xe2\x80\x9cAh wanderer, wanderer, Spotty, Spotty; how have you\r\ngone limping all this time? What wolves have frightened you, my\r\ndaughter? Won\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me what is the matter, my beauty? But what\r\nelse can it be except that you are a she, and cannot keep quiet? A\r\nplague on your humours and the humours of those you take after! Come\r\nback, come back, my darling; and if you will not be so happy, at any\r\nrate you will be safe in the fold or with your companions; for if you\r\nwho ought to keep and lead them, go wandering astray, what will become\r\nof them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe goatherd\xe2\x80\x99s talk amused all who heard it, but especially the canon,\r\nwho said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cAs you live, brother, take it easy, and be not in\r\nsuch a hurry to drive this goat back to the fold; for, being a female,\r\nas you say, she will follow her natural instinct in spite of all you\r\ncan do to prevent it. Take this morsel and drink a sup, and that will\r\nsoothe your irritation, and in the meantime the goat will rest\r\nherself,\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying, he handed him the loins of a cold rabbit on a\r\nfork.\r\n\r\nThe goatherd took it with thanks, and drank and calmed himself, and\r\nthen said, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be sorry if your worships were to take me for a\r\nsimpleton for having spoken so seriously as I did to this animal; but\r\nthe truth is there is a certain mystery in the words I used. I am a\r\nclown, but not so much of one but that I know how to behave to men and\r\nto beasts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I can well believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I know already by\r\nexperience that the woods breed men of learning, and shepherds\xe2\x80\x99 huts\r\nharbour philosophers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt all events, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the goatherd, \xe2\x80\x9cthey shelter men of\r\nexperience; and that you may see the truth of this and grasp it, though\r\nI may seem to put myself forward without being asked, I will, if it\r\nwill not tire you, gentlemen, and you will give me your attention for a\r\nlittle, tell you a true story which will confirm this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s word\r\n(and he pointed to the curate) as well as my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Don Quixote replied, \xe2\x80\x9cSeeing that this affair has a certain\r\ncolour of chivalry about it, I for my part, brother, will hear you most\r\ngladly, and so will all these gentlemen, from the high intelligence\r\nthey possess and their love of curious novelties that interest, charm,\r\nand entertain the mind, as I feel quite sure your story will do. So\r\nbegin, friend, for we are all prepared to listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI draw my stakes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand will retreat with this pasty to\r\nthe brook there, where I mean to victual myself for three days; for I\r\nhave heard my lord, Don Quixote, say that a knight-errant\xe2\x80\x99s squire\r\nshould eat until he can hold no more, whenever he has the chance,\r\nbecause it often happens them to get by accident into a wood so thick\r\nthat they cannot find a way out of it for six days; and if the man is\r\nnot well filled or his alforjas well stored, there he may stay, as very\r\noften he does, turned into a dried mummy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art in the right of it, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cgo where thou\r\nwilt and eat all thou canst, for I have had enough, and only want to\r\ngive my mind its refreshment, as I shall by listening to this good\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99s story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is what we shall all do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the canon; and then begged the\r\ngoatherd to begin the promised tale.\r\n\r\nThe goatherd gave the goat which he held by the horns a couple of slaps\r\non the back, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLie down here beside me, Spotty, for we have time\r\nenough to return to our fold.\xe2\x80\x9d The goat seemed to understand him, for\r\nas her master seated himself, she stretched herself quietly beside him\r\nand looked up in his face to show him she was all attention to what he\r\nwas going to say, and then in these words he began his story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc50e.jpg (27K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\nWHICH DEALS WITH WHAT THE GOATHERD TOLD THOSE WHO WERE CARRYING OFF DON\r\nQUIXOTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc51a.jpg (115K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree leagues from this valley there is a village which, though small,\r\nis one of the richest in all this neighbourhood, and in it there lived\r\na farmer, a very worthy man, and so much respected that, although to be\r\nso is the natural consequence of being rich, he was even more respected\r\nfor his virtue than for the wealth he had acquired. But what made him\r\nstill more fortunate, as he said himself, was having a daughter of such\r\nexceeding beauty, rare intelligence, gracefulness, and virtue, that\r\neveryone who knew her and beheld her marvelled at the extraordinary\r\ngifts with which heaven and nature had endowed her. As a child she was\r\nbeautiful, she continued to grow in beauty, and at the age of sixteen\r\nshe was most lovely. The fame of her beauty began to spread abroad\r\nthrough all the villages around\xe2\x80\x94but why do I say the villages around,\r\nmerely, when it spread to distant cities, and even made its way into\r\nthe halls of royalty and reached the ears of people of every class, who\r\ncame from all sides to see her as if to see something rare and curious,\r\nor some wonder-working image?\r\n\r\nHer father watched over her and she watched over herself; for there are\r\nno locks, or guards, or bolts that can protect a young girl better than\r\nher own modesty. The wealth of the father and the beauty of the\r\ndaughter led many neighbours as well as strangers to seek her for a\r\nwife; but he, as one might well be who had the disposal of so rich a\r\njewel, was perplexed and unable to make up his mind to which of her\r\ncountless suitors he should entrust her. I was one among the many who\r\nfelt a desire so natural, and, as her father knew who I was, and I was\r\nof the same town, of pure blood, in the bloom of life, and very rich in\r\npossessions, I had great hopes of success. There was another of the\r\nsame place and qualifications who also sought her, and this made her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s choice hang in the balance, for he felt that on either of us\r\nhis daughter would be well bestowed; so to escape from this state of\r\nperplexity he resolved to refer the matter to Leandra (for that is the\r\nname of the rich damsel who has reduced me to misery), reflecting that\r\nas we were both equal it would be best to leave it to his dear daughter\r\nto choose according to her inclination\xe2\x80\x94a course that is worthy of\r\nimitation by all fathers who wish to settle their children in life. I\r\ndo not mean that they ought to leave them to make a choice of what is\r\ncontemptible and bad, but that they should place before them what is\r\ngood and then allow them to make a good choice as they please. I do not\r\nknow which Leandra chose; I only know her father put us both off with\r\nthe tender age of his daughter and vague words that neither bound him\r\nnor dismissed us. My rival is called Anselmo and I myself Eugenio\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nyou may know the names of the personages that figure in this tragedy,\r\nthe end of which is still in suspense, though it is plain to see it\r\nmust be disastrous.\r\n\r\nAbout this time there arrived in our town one Vicente de la Roca, the\r\nson of a poor peasant of the same town, the said Vicente having\r\nreturned from service as a soldier in Italy and divers other parts. A\r\ncaptain who chanced to pass that way with his company had carried him\r\noff from our village when he was a boy of about twelve years, and now\r\ntwelve years later the young man came back in a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s uniform,\r\narrayed in a thousand colours, and all over glass trinkets and fine\r\nsteel chains. To-day he would appear in one gay dress, to-morrow in\r\nanother; but all flimsy and gaudy, of little substance and less worth.\r\nThe peasant folk, who are naturally malicious, and when they have\r\nnothing to do can be malice itself, remarked all this, and took note of\r\nhis finery and jewellery, piece by piece, and discovered that he had\r\nthree suits of different colours, with garters and stockings to match;\r\nbut he made so many arrangements and combinations out of them, that if\r\nthey had not counted them, anyone would have sworn that he had made a\r\ndisplay of more than ten suits of clothes and twenty plumes. Do not\r\nlook upon all this that I am telling you about the clothes as uncalled\r\nfor or spun out, for they have a great deal to do with the story. He\r\nused to seat himself on a bench under the great poplar in our plaza,\r\nand there he would keep us all hanging open-mouthed on the stories he\r\ntold us of his exploits. There was no country on the face of the globe\r\nhe had not seen, nor battle he had not been engaged in; he had killed\r\nmore Moors than there are in Morocco and Tunis, and fought more single\r\ncombats, according to his own account, than Garcilaso, Diego Garc\xc3\xada de\r\nParedes and a thousand others he named, and out of all he had come\r\nvictorious without losing a drop of blood. On the other hand he showed\r\nmarks of wounds, which, though they could not be made out, he said were\r\ngunshot wounds received in divers encounters and actions. Lastly, with\r\nmonstrous impudence he used to say \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x9d to his equals and even those\r\nwho knew what he was, and declare that his arm was his father and his\r\ndeeds his pedigree, and that being a soldier he was as good as the king\r\nhimself. And to add to these swaggering ways he was a trifle of a\r\nmusician, and played the guitar with such a flourish that some said he\r\nmade it speak; nor did his accomplishments end here, for he was\r\nsomething of a poet too, and on every trifle that happened in the town\r\nhe made a ballad a league long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc51b.jpg (372K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis soldier, then, that I have described, this Vicente de la Roca,\r\nthis bravo, gallant, musician, poet, was often seen and watched by\r\nLeandra from a window of her house which looked out on the plaza. The\r\nglitter of his showy attire took her fancy, his ballads bewitched her\r\n(for he gave away twenty copies of every one he made), the tales of his\r\nexploits which he told about himself came to her ears; and in short, as\r\nthe devil no doubt had arranged it, she fell in love with him before\r\nthe presumption of making love to her had suggested itself to him; and\r\nas in love-affairs none are more easily brought to an issue than those\r\nwhich have the inclination of the lady for an ally, Leandra and Vicente\r\ncame to an understanding without any difficulty; and before any of her\r\nnumerous suitors had any suspicion of her design, she had already\r\ncarried it into effect, having left the house of her dearly beloved\r\nfather (for mother she had none), and disappeared from the village with\r\nthe soldier, who came more triumphantly out of this enterprise than out\r\nof any of the large number he laid claim to. All the village and all\r\nwho heard of it were amazed at the affair; I was aghast, Anselmo\r\nthunderstruck, her father full of grief, her relations indignant, the\r\nauthorities all in a ferment, the officers of the Brotherhood in arms.\r\nThey scoured the roads, they searched the woods and all quarters, and\r\nat the end of three days they found the flighty Leandra in a mountain\r\ncave, stript to her shift, and robbed of all the money and precious\r\njewels she had carried away from home with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc51c.jpg (275K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey brought her back to her unhappy father, and questioned her as to\r\nher misfortune, and she confessed without pressure that Vicente de la\r\nRoca had deceived her, and under promise of marrying her had induced\r\nher to leave her father\xe2\x80\x99s house, as he meant to take her to the richest\r\nand most delightful city in the whole world, which was Naples; and that\r\nshe, ill-advised and deluded, had believed him, and robbed her father,\r\nand handed over all to him the night she disappeared; and that he had\r\ncarried her away to a rugged mountain and shut her up in the cave where\r\nthey had found her. She said, moreover, that the soldier, without\r\nrobbing her of her honour, had taken from her everything she had, and\r\nmade off, leaving her in the cave, a thing that still further surprised\r\neverybody. It was not easy for us to credit the young man\xe2\x80\x99s continence,\r\nbut she asserted it with such earnestness that it helped to console her\r\ndistressed father, who thought nothing of what had been taken since the\r\njewel that once lost can never be recovered had been left to his\r\ndaughter. The same day that Leandra made her appearance her father\r\nremoved her from our sight and took her away to shut her up in a\r\nconvent in a town near this, in the hope that time may wear away some\r\nof the disgrace she has incurred. Leandra\xe2\x80\x99s youth furnished an excuse\r\nfor her fault, at least with those to whom it was of no consequence\r\nwhether she was good or bad; but those who knew her shrewdness and\r\nintelligence did not attribute her misdemeanour to ignorance but to\r\nwantonness and the natural disposition of women, which is for the most\r\npart flighty and ill-regulated.\r\n\r\nLeandra withdrawn from sight, Anselmo\xe2\x80\x99s eyes grew blind, or at any rate\r\nfound nothing to look at that gave them any pleasure, and mine were in\r\ndarkness without a ray of light to direct them to anything enjoyable\r\nwhile Leandra was away. Our melancholy grew greater, our patience grew\r\nless; we cursed the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s finery and railed at the carelessness of\r\nLeandra\xe2\x80\x99s father. At last Anselmo and I agreed to leave the village and\r\ncome to this valley; and, he feeding a great flock of sheep of his own,\r\nand I a large herd of goats of mine, we pass our life among the trees,\r\ngiving vent to our sorrows, together singing the fair Leandra\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npraises, or upbraiding her, or else sighing alone, and to heaven\r\npouring forth our complaints in solitude. Following our example, many\r\nmore of Leandra\xe2\x80\x99s lovers have come to these rude mountains and adopted\r\nour mode of life, and they are so numerous that one would fancy the\r\nplace had been turned into the pastoral Arcadia, so full is it of\r\nshepherds and sheep-folds; nor is there a spot in it where the name of\r\nthe fair Leandra is not heard. Here one curses her and calls her\r\ncapricious, fickle, and immodest, there another condemns her as frail\r\nand frivolous; this pardons and absolves her, that spurns and reviles\r\nher; one extols her beauty, another assails her character, and in short\r\nall abuse her, and all adore her, and to such a pitch has this general\r\ninfatuation gone that there are some who complain of her scorn without\r\never having exchanged a word with her, and even some that bewail and\r\nmourn the raging fever of jealousy, for which she never gave anyone\r\ncause, for, as I have already said, her misconduct was known before her\r\npassion. There is no nook among the rocks, no brookside, no shade\r\nbeneath the trees that is not haunted by some shepherd telling his woes\r\nto the breezes; wherever there is an echo it repeats the name of\r\nLeandra; the mountains ring with \xe2\x80\x9cLeandra,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLeandra\xe2\x80\x9d murmur the\r\nbrooks, and Leandra keeps us all bewildered and bewitched, hoping\r\nwithout hope and fearing without knowing what we fear. Of all this\r\nsilly set the one that shows the least and also the most sense is my\r\nrival Anselmo, for having so many other things to complain of, he only\r\ncomplains of separation, and to the accompaniment of a rebeck, which he\r\nplays admirably, he sings his complaints in verses that show his\r\ningenuity. I follow another, easier, and to my mind wiser course, and\r\nthat is to rail at the frivolity of women, at their inconstancy, their\r\ndouble dealing, their broken promises, their unkept pledges, and in\r\nshort the want of reflection they show in fixing their affections and\r\ninclinations. This, sirs, was the reason of words and expressions I\r\nmade use of to this goat when I came up just now; for as she is a\r\nfemale I have a contempt for her, though she is the best in all my\r\nfold. This is the story I promised to tell you, and if I have been\r\ntedious in telling it, I will not be slow to serve you; my hut is close\r\nby, and I have fresh milk and dainty cheese there, as well as a variety\r\nof toothsome fruit, no less pleasing to the eye than to the palate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc51e.jpg (14K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\nOF THE QUARREL THAT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE GOATHERD, TOGETHER WITH\r\nTHE RARE ADVENTURE OF THE PENITENTS, WHICH WITH AN EXPENDITURE OF SWEAT\r\nHE BROUGHT TO A HAPPY CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc52a.jpg (40K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goatherd\xe2\x80\x99s tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers, and the\r\ncanon especially enjoyed it, for he had remarked with particular\r\nattention the manner in which it had been told, which was as unlike the\r\nmanner of a clownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished city\r\nwit; and he observed that the curate had been quite right in saying\r\nthat the woods bred men of learning. They all offered their services to\r\nEugenio but he who showed himself most liberal in this way was Don\r\nQuixote, who said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cMost assuredly, brother goatherd, if I found\r\nmyself in a position to attempt any adventure, I would, this very\r\ninstant, set out on your behalf, and would rescue Leandra from that\r\nconvent (where no doubt she is kept against her will), in spite of the\r\nabbess and all who might try to prevent me, and would place her in your\r\nhands to deal with her according to your will and pleasure, observing,\r\nhowever, the laws of chivalry which lay down that no violence of any\r\nkind is to be offered to any damsel. But I trust in God our Lord that\r\nthe might of one malignant enchanter may not prove so great but that\r\nthe power of another better disposed may prove superior to it, and then\r\nI promise you my support and assistance, as I am bound to do by my\r\nprofession, which is none other than to give aid to the weak and\r\nneedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe goatherd eyed him, and noticing Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s sorry appearance and\r\nlooks, he was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was next\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such\r\na strain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho should it be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the famous Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha, the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protector\r\nof damsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the goatherd, \xe2\x80\x9csounds like what one reads in the books of\r\nthe knights-errant, who did all that you say this man does; though it\r\nis my belief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman has\r\nempty lodgings in his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a great scoundrel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is you who are\r\nempty and a fool. I am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that\r\nbore you;\xe2\x80\x9d and passing from words to deeds, he caught up a loaf that\r\nwas near him and sent it full in the goatherd\xe2\x80\x99s face, with such force\r\nthat he flattened his nose; but the goatherd, who did not understand\r\njokes, and found himself roughly handled in such good earnest, paying\r\nno respect to carpet, tablecloth, or diners, sprang upon Don Quixote,\r\nand seizing him by the throat with both hands would no doubt have\r\nthrottled him, had not Sancho Panza that instant come to the rescue,\r\nand grasping him by the shoulders flung him down on the table, smashing\r\nplates, breaking glasses, and upsetting and scattering everything on\r\nit. Don Quixote, finding himself free, strove to get on top of the\r\ngoatherd, who, with his face covered with blood, and soundly kicked by\r\nSancho, was on all fours feeling about for one of the table-knives to\r\ntake a bloody revenge with. The canon and the curate, however,\r\nprevented him, but the barber so contrived it that he got Don Quixote\r\nunder him, and rained down upon him such a shower of fisticuffs that\r\nthe poor knight\xe2\x80\x99s face streamed with blood as freely as his own. The\r\ncanon and the curate were bursting with laughter, the officers were\r\ncapering with delight, and both the one and the other hissed them on as\r\nthey do dogs that are worrying one another in a fight. Sancho alone was\r\nfrantic, for he could not free himself from the grasp of one of the\r\ncanon\xe2\x80\x99s servants, who kept him from going to his master\xe2\x80\x99s assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc52b.jpg (348K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last, while they were all, with the exception of the two bruisers\r\nwho were mauling each other, in high glee and enjoyment, they heard a\r\ntrumpet sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the\r\ndirection whence the sound seemed to come. But the one that was most\r\nexcited by hearing it was Don Quixote, who though sorely against his\r\nwill he was under the goatherd, and something more than pretty well\r\npummelled, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cBrother devil (for it is impossible but that\r\nthou must be one since thou hast had might and strength enough to\r\novercome mine), I ask thee to agree to a truce for but one hour for the\r\nsolemn note of yonder trumpet that falls on our ears seems to me to\r\nsummon me to some new adventure.\xe2\x80\x9d The goatherd, who was by this time\r\ntired of pummelling and being pummelled, released him at once, and Don\r\nQuixote rising to his feet and turning his eyes to the quarter where\r\nthe sound had been heard, suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill\r\nseveral men clad in white like penitents.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture from\r\nthe earth, and in all the villages of the district they were organising\r\nprocessions, rogations, and penances, imploring God to open the hands\r\nof his mercy and send the rain; and to this end the people of a village\r\nthat was hard by were going in procession to a holy hermitage there was\r\non one side of that valley. Don Quixote when he saw the strange garb of\r\nthe penitents, without reflecting how often he had seen it before, took\r\nit into his head that this was a case of adventure, and that it fell to\r\nhim alone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the more\r\nconfirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black\r\nthey had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and\r\ndiscourteous thieves were carrying off by force. As soon as this\r\noccurred to him he ran with all speed to Rocinante who was grazing at\r\nlarge, and taking the bridle and the buckler from the saddle-bow, he\r\nhad him bridled in an instant, and calling to Sancho for his sword he\r\nmounted Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, and in a loud voice\r\nexclaimed to those who stood by, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, noble company, ye shall see how\r\nimportant it is that there should be knights in the world professing\r\nthe order of knight-errantry; now, I say, ye shall see, by the\r\ndeliverance of that worthy lady who is borne captive there, whether\r\nknights-errant deserve to be held in estimation,\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying he\r\nbrought his legs to bear on Rocinante\xe2\x80\x94for he had no spurs\xe2\x80\x94and at a full\r\ncanter (for in all this veracious history we never read of Rocinante\r\nfairly galloping) set off to encounter the penitents, though the\r\ncurate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent him. But it was out of\r\ntheir power, nor did he even stop for the shouts of Sancho calling\r\nafter him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote? What devils have\r\npossessed you to set you on against our Catholic faith? Plague take me!\r\nmind, that is a procession of penitents, and the lady they are carrying\r\non that stand there is the blessed image of the immaculate Virgin. Take\r\ncare what you are doing, se\xc3\xb1or, for this time it may be safely said you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what you are about.\xe2\x80\x9d Sancho laboured in vain, for his master\r\nwas so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted figures and\r\nreleasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word; and even had\r\nhe heard, he would not have turned back if the king had ordered him. He\r\ncame up with the procession and reined in Rocinante, who was already\r\nanxious enough to slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse, excited\r\nvoice he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cYou who hide your faces, perhaps because you are\r\nnot good subjects, pay attention and listen to what I am about to say\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d The first to halt were those who were carrying the image, and\r\none of the four ecclesiastics who were chanting the Litany, struck by\r\nthe strange figure of Don Quixote, the leanness of Rocinante, and the\r\nother ludicrous peculiarities he observed, said in reply to him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother, if you have anything to say to us say it quickly, for these\r\nbrethren are whipping themselves, and we cannot stop, nor is it\r\nreasonable we should stop to hear anything, unless indeed it is short\r\nenough to be said in two words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say it in one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is this; that at\r\nonce, this very instant, ye release that fair lady whose tears and sad\r\naspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her will, and\r\nthat ye have committed some scandalous outrage against her; and I, who\r\nwas born into the world to redress all such like wrongs, will not\r\npermit you to advance another step until you have restored to her the\r\nliberty she pines for and deserves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman,\r\nand began to laugh heartily, and their laughter acted like gunpowder on\r\nDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s fury, for drawing his sword without another word he made\r\na rush at the stand. One of those who supported it, leaving the burden\r\nto his comrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing a forked stick that\r\nhe had for propping up the stand when resting, and with this he caught\r\na mighty cut Don Quixote made at him that severed it in two; but with\r\nthe portion that remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the\r\nshoulder of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s sword arm (which the buckler could not\r\nprotect against the clownish assault) that poor Don Quixote came to the\r\nground in a sad plight.\r\n\r\nSancho Panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing,\r\nseeing him fall, cried out to his assailant not to strike him again,\r\nfor he was a poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the\r\ndays of his life; but what checked the clown was, not Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshouting, but seeing that Don Quixote did not stir hand or foot; and\r\nso, fancying he had killed him, he hastily hitched up his tunic under\r\nhis girdle and took to his heels across the country like a deer.\r\n\r\nBy this time all Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s companions had come up to where he lay;\r\nbut the processionists seeing them come running, and with them the\r\nofficers of the Brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended mischief,\r\nand clustering round the image, raised their hoods, and grasped their\r\nscourges, as the priests did their tapers, and awaited the attack,\r\nresolved to defend themselves and even to take the offensive against\r\ntheir assailants if they could. Fortune, however, arranged the matter\r\nbetter than they expected, for all Sancho did was to fling himself on\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s body, raising over him the most doleful and laughable\r\nlamentation that ever was heard, for he believed he was dead. The\r\ncurate was known to another curate who walked in the procession, and\r\ntheir recognition of one another set at rest the apprehensions of both\r\nparties; the first then told the other in two words who Don Quixote\r\nwas, and he and the whole troop of penitents went to see if the poor\r\ngentleman was dead, and heard Sancho Panza saying, with tears in his\r\neyes, \xe2\x80\x9cOh flower of chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hast ended\r\nthe course of thy well-spent life! Oh pride of thy race, honour and\r\nglory of all La Mancha, nay, of all the world, that for want of thee\r\nwill be full of evil-doers, no longer in fear of punishment for their\r\nmisdeeds! Oh thou, generous above all the Alexanders, since for only\r\neight months of service thou hast given me the best island the sea\r\ngirds or surrounds! Humble with the proud, haughty with the humble,\r\nencounterer of dangers, endurer of outrages, enamoured without reason,\r\nimitator of the good, scourge of the wicked, enemy of the mean, in\r\nshort, knight-errant, which is all that can be said!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc52c.jpg (325K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to himself, and the\r\nfirst word he said was, \xe2\x80\x9cHe who lives separated from you, sweetest\r\nDulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. Aid me, friend\r\nSancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a condition to\r\npress the saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to\r\npieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will do with all my heart, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand let us\r\nreturn to our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and\r\nthere we will prepare for making another sally, which may turn out more\r\nprofitable and creditable to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art right, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be wise to let\r\nthe malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely\r\nin doing as he said; and so, highly amused at Sancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsimplicities, they placed Don Quixote in the cart as before. The\r\nprocession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road;\r\nthe goatherd took his leave of the party; the officers of the\r\nBrotherhood declined to go any farther, and the curate paid them what\r\nwas due to them; the canon begged the curate to let him know how Don\r\nQuixote did, whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from\r\nit, and then begged leave to continue his journey; in short, they all\r\nseparated and went their ways, leaving to themselves the curate and the\r\nbarber, Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and the good Rocinante, who regarded\r\neverything with as great resignation as his master. The carter yoked\r\nhis oxen and made Don Quixote comfortable on a truss of hay, and at his\r\nusual deliberate pace took the road the curate directed, and at the end\r\nof six days they reached Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s village, and entered it about\r\nthe middle of the day, which it so happened was a Sunday, and the\r\npeople were all in the plaza, through which Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s cart passed.\r\nThey all flocked to see what was in the cart, and when they recognised\r\ntheir townsman they were filled with amazement, and a boy ran off to\r\nbring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that their master and\r\nuncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay\r\non an ox-cart. It was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies\r\nraised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions\r\non those accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when they\r\nsaw Don Quixote coming in at the gate.\r\n\r\nAt the news of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s arrival Sancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s wife came running,\r\nfor she by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him as\r\nhis squire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she asked him was if\r\nthe ass was well. Sancho replied that he was, better than his master\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks be to God,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cfor being so good to me; but now tell\r\nme, my friend, what have you made by your squirings? What gown have you\r\nbrought me back? What shoes for your children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bring nothing of that sort, wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cthough I bring\r\nother things of more consequence and value.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad of that,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his wife; \xe2\x80\x9cshow me these things of\r\nmore value and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheer\r\nmy heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have\r\nbeen away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will show them to you at home, wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbe content for\r\nthe present; for if it please God that we should again go on our\r\ntravels in search of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or\r\ngovernor of an island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but the\r\nbest that is to be had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven grant it, husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cfor indeed we have need of it.\r\nBut tell me, what\xe2\x80\x99s this about islands, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoney is not for the mouth of the ass,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9call in good\r\ntime thou shalt see, wife\xe2\x80\x94nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear thyself\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x98your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99 by all thy vassals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and\r\nvassals?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Teresa Panza\xe2\x80\x94for so Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s wife was called, though\r\nthey were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wives to\r\ntake their husbands\xe2\x80\x99 surnames.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nis enough that I am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth. But I\r\nmay tell you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world\r\nmore delightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to a\r\nknight-errant, and a seeker of adventures. To be sure most of those one\r\nfinds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred,\r\nninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary. I know it by experience,\r\nfor out of some I came blanketed, and out of others belaboured. Still,\r\nfor all that, it is a fine thing to be on the look-out for what may\r\nhappen, crossing mountains, searching woods, climbing rocks, visiting\r\ncastles, putting up at inns, all at free quarters, and devil take the\r\nmaravedi to pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeper and niece took him in and undressed him and laid\r\nhim in his old bed. He eyed them askance, and could not make out where\r\nhe was. The curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her\r\nuncle comfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make his\r\nescape from them again, telling her what they had been obliged to do to\r\nbring him home. On this the pair once more lifted up their voices and\r\nrenewed their maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and implored\r\nheaven to plunge the authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst\r\nof the bottomless pit. They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dread\r\nlest their uncle and master should give them the slip the moment he\r\nfound himself somewhat better, and as they feared so it fell out.\r\n\r\nBut the author of this history, though he has devoted research and\r\nindustry to the discovery of the deeds achieved by Don Quixote in his\r\nthird sally, has been unable to obtain any information respecting them,\r\nat any rate derived from authentic documents; tradition has merely\r\npreserved in the memory of La Mancha the fact that Don Quixote, the\r\nthird time he sallied forth from his home, betook himself to Saragossa,\r\nwhere he was present at some famous jousts which came off in that city,\r\nand that he had adventures there worthy of his valour and high\r\nintelligence. Of his end and death he could learn no particulars, nor\r\nwould he have ascertained it or known of it, if good fortune had not\r\nproduced an old physician for him who had in his possession a leaden\r\nbox, which, according to his account, had been discovered among the\r\ncrumbling foundations of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt;\r\nin which box were found certain parchment manuscripts in Gothic\r\ncharacter, but in Castilian verse, containing many of his achievements,\r\nand setting forth the beauty of Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the\r\nfidelity of Sancho Panza, and the burial of Don Quixote himself,\r\ntogether with sundry epitaphs and eulogies on his life and character;\r\nbut all that could be read and deciphered were those which the\r\ntrustworthy author of this new and unparalleled history here presents.\r\nAnd the said author asks of those that shall read it nothing in return\r\nfor the vast toil which it has cost him in examining and searching the\r\nManchegan archives in order to bring it to light, save that they give\r\nhim the same credit that people of sense give to the books of chivalry\r\nthat pervade the world and are so popular; for with this he will\r\nconsider himself amply paid and fully satisfied, and will be encouraged\r\nto seek out and produce other histories, if not as truthful, at least\r\nequal in invention and not less entertaining. The first words written\r\non the parchment found in the leaden box were these:\r\n\r\nTHE ACADEMICIANS OF ARGAMASILLA,\r\nA VILLAGE OF LA MANCHA,\r\nON THE LIFE AND DEATH OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA,\r\nHOC SCRIPSERUNT\r\nMONICONGO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\r\nON THE TOMB OF DON QUIXOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nEPITAPH\r\n\r\nThe scatterbrain that gave La Mancha more\r\nRich spoils than Jason\xe2\x80\x99s; who a point so keen\r\nHad to his wit, and happier far had been\r\nIf his wit\xe2\x80\x99s weathercock a blunter bore;\r\nThe arm renowned far as Gaeta\xe2\x80\x99s shore,\r\nCathay, and all the lands that lie between;\r\nThe muse discreet and terrible in mien\r\nAs ever wrote on brass in days of yore;\r\nHe who surpassed the Amadises all,\r\nAnd who as naught the Galaors accounted,\r\nSupported by his love and gallantry:\r\nWho made the Belianises sing small,\r\nAnd sought renown on Rocinante mounted;\r\nHere, underneath this cold stone, doth he lie.\r\n\r\n\r\nPANIAGUADO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\r\nIN LAUDEM DULCINEAE DEL TOBOSO\r\n\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\nShe, whose full features may be here descried,\r\nHigh-bosomed, with a bearing of disdain,\r\nIs Dulcinea, she for whom in vain\r\nThe great Don Quixote of La Mancha sighed.\r\nFor her, Toboso\xe2\x80\x99s queen, from side to side\r\nHe traversed the grim sierra, the champaign\r\nOf Aranjuez, and Montiel\xe2\x80\x99s famous plain:\r\nOn Rocinante oft a weary ride.\r\nMalignant planets, cruel destiny,\r\nPursued them both, the fair Manchegan dame,\r\nAnd the unconquered star of chivalry.\r\nNor youth nor beauty saved her from the claim\r\nOf death; he paid love\xe2\x80\x99s bitter penalty,\r\nAnd left the marble to preserve his name.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPRICHOSO, A MOST ACUTE ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\r\nIN PRAISE OF ROCINANTE, STEED OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA\r\n\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\nOn that proud throne of diamantine sheen,\r\nWhich the blood-reeking feet of Mars degrade,\r\nThe mad Manchegan\xe2\x80\x99s banner now hath been\r\nBy him in all its bravery displayed.\r\nThere hath he hung his arms and trenchant blade\r\nWherewith, achieving deeds till now unseen,\r\nHe slays, lays low, cleaves, hews; but art hath made\r\nA novel style for our new paladin.\r\nIf Amadis be the proud boast of Gaul,\r\nIf by his progeny the fame of Greece\r\nThrough all the regions of the earth be spread,\r\nGreat Quixote crowned in grim Bellona\xe2\x80\x99s hall\r\nTo-day exalts La Mancha over these,\r\nAnd above Greece or Gaul she holds her head.\r\nNor ends his glory here, for his good steed\r\nDoth Brillador and Bayard far exceed;\r\nAs mettled steeds compared with Rocinante,\r\nThe reputation they have won is scanty.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURLADOR, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\r\nON SANCHO PANZA\r\n\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\nThe worthy Sancho Panza here you see;\r\nA great soul once was in that body small,\r\nNor was there squire upon this earthly ball\r\nSo plain and simple, or of guile so free.\r\nWithin an ace of being Count was he,\r\nAnd would have been but for the spite and gall\r\nOf this vile age, mean and illiberal,\r\nThat cannot even let a donkey be.\r\nFor mounted on an ass (excuse the word),\r\nBy Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s side this gentle squire\r\nWas wont his wandering master to attend.\r\nDelusive hopes that lure the common herd\r\nWith promises of ease, the heart\xe2\x80\x99s desire,\r\nIn shadows, dreams, and smoke ye always end.\r\n\r\n\r\nCACHIDIABLO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\r\nON THE TOMB OF DON QUIXOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nEPITAPH\r\n\r\nThe knight lies here below,\r\nIll-errant and bruised sore,\r\nWhom Rocinante bore\r\nIn his wanderings to and fro.\r\nBy the side of the knight is laid\r\nStolid man Sancho too,\r\nThan whom a squire more true\r\nWas not in the esquire trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIQUITOC, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\r\nON THE TOMB OF DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO\r\n\r\n\r\nEPITAPH\r\n\r\nHere Dulcinea lies.\r\nPlump was she and robust:\r\nNow she is ashes and dust:\r\nThe end of all flesh that dies.\r\nA lady of high degree,\r\nWith the port of a lofty dame,\r\nAnd the great Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s flame,\r\nAnd the pride of her village was she.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were all the verses that could be deciphered; the rest, the\r\nwriting being worm-eaten, were handed over to one of the Academicians\r\nto make out their meaning conjecturally.

Now I say that \xe2\x80\x9cwith his spurs, he is\r\non his way.\xe2\x80\x9d Should he reach destination methinks I shall have rendered\r\nsome service to Your Excellency, as from many parts I am urged to send\r\nhim off, so as to dispel the loathing and disgust caused by another Don\r\nQuixote who, under the name of Second Part, has run masquerading\r\nthrough the whole world. And he who has shown the greatest longing for\r\nhim has been the great Emperor of China, who wrote me a letter in\r\nChinese a month ago and sent it by a special courier. He asked me, or\r\nto be truthful, he begged me to send him Don Quixote, for he intended\r\nto found a college where the Spanish tongue would be taught, and it was\r\nhis wish that the book to be read should be the History of Don Quixote.\r\nHe also added that I should go and be the rector of this college. I\r\nasked the bearer if His Majesty had afforded a sum in aid of my travel\r\nexpenses. He answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not even in thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can return to your China, post haste\r\nor at whatever haste you are bound to go, as I am not fit for so long a\r\ntravel and, besides being ill, I am very much without money, while\r\nEmperor for Emperor and Monarch for Monarch, I have at Naples the great\r\nCount of Lemos, who, without so many petty titles of colleges and\r\nrectorships, sustains me, protects me and does me more favour than I\r\ncan wish for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus I gave him his leave and I beg mine from you, offering Your\r\nExcellency the \xe2\x80\x9cTrabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda,\xe2\x80\x9d a book I shall\r\nfinish within four months, Deo volente, and which will be either the\r\nworst or the best that has been composed in our language, I mean of\r\nthose intended for entertainment; at which I repent of having called it\r\nthe worst, for, in the opinion of friends, it is bound to attain the\r\nsummit of possible quality. May Your Excellency return in such health\r\nthat is wished you; Persiles will be ready to kiss your hand and I your\r\nfeet, being as I am, Your Excellency\xe2\x80\x99s most humble servant.\r\n\r\nFrom Madrid, this last day of October of the year one thousand six\r\nhundred and fifteen.\r\n\r\nAt the service of Your Excellency:\r\n\r\nMIGUEL DE CERVANTES SAAVEDRA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR\xe2\x80\x99S PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npart2.jpg (130K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGod bless me, gentle (or it may be plebeian) reader, how eagerly must\r\nthou be looking forward to this preface, expecting to find there\r\nretaliation, scolding, and abuse against the author of the second Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x94I mean him who was, they say, begotten at Tordesillas and born\r\nat Tarragona! Well then, the truth is, I am not going to give thee that\r\nsatisfaction; for, though injuries stir up anger in humbler breasts, in\r\nmine the rule must admit of an exception. Thou wouldst have me call him\r\nass, fool, and malapert, but I have no such intention; let his offence\r\nbe his punishment, with his bread let him eat it, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of\r\nit. What I cannot help taking amiss is that he charges me with being\r\nold and one-handed, as if it had been in my power to keep time from\r\npassing over me, or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about in\r\nsome tavern, and not on the grandest occasion the past or present has\r\nseen, or the future can hope to see. If my wounds have no beauty to the\r\nbeholder\xe2\x80\x99s eye, they are, at least, honourable in the estimation of\r\nthose who know where they were received; for the soldier shows to\r\ngreater advantage dead in battle than alive in flight; and so strongly\r\nis this my feeling, that if now it were proposed to perform an\r\nimpossibility for me, I would rather have had my share in that mighty\r\naction, than be free from my wounds this minute without having been\r\npresent at it. Those the soldier shows on his face and breast are stars\r\nthat direct others to the heaven of honour and ambition of merited\r\npraise; and moreover it is to be observed that it is not with grey\r\nhairs that one writes, but with the understanding, and that commonly\r\nimproves with years. I take it amiss, too, that he calls me envious,\r\nand explains to me, as if I were ignorant, what envy is; for really and\r\ntruly, of the two kinds there are, I only know that which is holy,\r\nnoble, and high-minded; and if that be so, as it is, I am not likely to\r\nattack a priest, above all if, in addition, he holds the rank of\r\nfamiliar of the Holy Office. And if he said what he did on account of\r\nhim on whose behalf it seems he spoke, he is entirely mistaken; for I\r\nworship the genius of that person, and admire his works and his\r\nunceasing and strenuous industry. After all, I am grateful to this\r\ngentleman, the author, for saying that my novels are more satirical\r\nthan exemplary, but that they are good; for they could not be that\r\nunless there was a little of everything in them.\r\n\r\nI suspect thou wilt say that I am taking a very humble line, and\r\nkeeping myself too much within the bounds of my moderation, from a\r\nfeeling that additional suffering should not be inflicted upon a\r\nsufferer, and that what this gentleman has to endure must doubtless be\r\nvery great, as he does not dare to come out into the open field and\r\nbroad daylight, but hides his name and disguises his country as if he\r\nhad been guilty of some lese majesty. If perchance thou shouldst come\r\nto know him, tell him from me that I do not hold myself aggrieved; for\r\nI know well what the temptations of the devil are, and that one of the\r\ngreatest is putting it into a man\xe2\x80\x99s head that he can write and print a\r\nbook by which he will get as much fame as money, and as much money as\r\nfame; and to prove it I will beg of you, in your own sprightly,\r\npleasant way, to tell him this story.\r\n\r\nThere was a madman in Seville who took to one of the drollest\r\nabsurdities and vagaries that ever madman in the world gave way to. It\r\nwas this: he made a tube of reed sharp at one end, and catching a dog\r\nin the street, or wherever it might be, he with his foot held one of\r\nits legs fast, and with his hand lifted up the other, and as best he\r\ncould fixed the tube where, by blowing, he made the dog as round as a\r\nball; then holding it in this position, he gave it a couple of slaps on\r\nthe belly, and let it go, saying to the bystanders (and there were\r\nalways plenty of them): \xe2\x80\x9cDo your worships think, now, that it is an\r\neasy thing to blow up a dog?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Does your worship think now, that it is\r\nan easy thing to write a book?\r\n\r\nAnd if this story does not suit him, you may, dear reader, tell him\r\nthis one, which is likewise of a madman and a dog.\r\n\r\nIn Cordova there was another madman, whose way it was to carry a piece\r\nof marble slab or a stone, not of the lightest, on his head, and when\r\nhe came upon any unwary dog he used to draw close to him and let the\r\nweight fall right on top of him; on which the dog in a rage, barking\r\nand howling, would run three streets without stopping. It so happened,\r\nhowever, that one of the dogs he discharged his load upon was a\r\ncap-maker\xe2\x80\x99s dog, of which his master was very fond. The stone came down\r\nhitting it on the head, the dog raised a yell at the blow, the master\r\nsaw the affair and was wroth, and snatching up a measuring-yard rushed\r\nout at the madman and did not leave a sound bone in his body, and at\r\nevery stroke he gave him he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou dog, you thief! my lurcher!\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see, you brute, that my dog is a lurcher?\xe2\x80\x9d and so, repeating\r\nthe word \xe2\x80\x9clurcher\xe2\x80\x9d again and again, he sent the madman away beaten to a\r\njelly. The madman took the lesson to heart, and vanished, and for more\r\nthan a month never once showed himself in public; but after that he\r\ncame out again with his old trick and a heavier load than ever. He came\r\nup to where there was a dog, and examining it very carefully without\r\nventuring to let the stone fall, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a lurcher; ware!\xe2\x80\x9d In\r\nshort, all the dogs he came across, be they mastiffs or terriers, he\r\nsaid were lurchers; and he discharged no more stones. Maybe it will be\r\nthe same with this historian; that he will not venture another time to\r\ndischarge the weight of his wit in books, which, being bad, are harder\r\nthan stones. Tell him, too, that I do not care a farthing for the\r\nthreat he holds out to me of depriving me of my profit by means of his\r\nbook; for, to borrow from the famous interlude of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Perendenga,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsay in answer to him, \xe2\x80\x9cLong life to my lord the Veintiquatro, and\r\nChrist be with us all.\xe2\x80\x9d Long life to the great Conde de Lemos, whose\r\nChristian charity and well-known generosity support me against all the\r\nstrokes of my curst fortune; and long life to the supreme benevolence\r\nof His Eminence of Toledo, Don Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas; and what\r\nmatter if there be no printing-presses in the world, or if they print\r\nmore books against me than there are letters in the verses of Mingo\r\nRevulgo! These two princes, unsought by any adulation or flattery of\r\nmine, of their own goodness alone, have taken it upon them to show me\r\nkindness and protect me, and in this I consider myself happier and\r\nricher than if Fortune had raised me to her greatest height in the\r\nordinary way. The poor man may retain honour, but not the vicious;\r\npoverty may cast a cloud over nobility, but cannot hide it altogether;\r\nand as virtue of itself sheds a certain light, even though it be\r\nthrough the straits and chinks of penury, it wins the esteem of lofty\r\nand noble spirits, and in consequence their protection. Thou needst say\r\nno more to him, nor will I say anything more to thee, save to tell thee\r\nto bear in mind that this Second Part of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d which I offer\r\nthee is cut by the same craftsman and from the same cloth as the First,\r\nand that in it I present thee Don Quixote continued, and at length dead\r\nand buried, so that no one may dare to bring forward any further\r\nevidence against him, for that already produced is sufficient; and\r\nsuffice it, too, that some reputable person should have given an\r\naccount of all these shrewd lunacies of his without going into the\r\nmatter again; for abundance, even of good things, prevents them from\r\nbeing valued; and scarcity, even in the case of what is bad, confers a\r\ncertain value. I was forgetting to tell thee that thou mayest expect\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cPersiles,\xe2\x80\x9d which I am now finishing, and also the Second Part of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGalatea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npart2e.jpg (37K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nOF THE INTERVIEW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER HAD WITH DON QUIXOTE ABOUT\r\nHIS MALADY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np01a.jpg (156K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCide Hamete Benengeli, in the Second Part of this history, and third\r\nsally of Don Quixote, says that the curate and the barber remained\r\nnearly a month without seeing him, lest they should recall or bring\r\nback to his recollection what had taken place. They did not, however,\r\nomit to visit his niece and housekeeper, and charge them to be careful\r\nto treat him with attention, and give him comforting things to eat, and\r\nsuch as were good for the heart and the brain, whence, it was plain to\r\nsee, all his misfortune proceeded. The niece and housekeeper replied\r\nthat they did so, and meant to do so with all possible care and\r\nassiduity, for they could perceive that their master was now and then\r\nbeginning to show signs of being in his right mind. This gave great\r\nsatisfaction to the curate and the barber, for they concluded they had\r\ntaken the right course in carrying him off enchanted on the ox-cart, as\r\nhas been described in the First Part of this great as well as accurate\r\nhistory, in the last chapter thereof. So they resolved to pay him a\r\nvisit and test the improvement in his condition, although they thought\r\nit almost impossible that there could be any; and they agreed not to\r\ntouch upon any point connected with knight-errantry so as not to run\r\nthe risk of reopening wounds which were still so tender.\r\n\r\nThey came to see him consequently, and found him sitting up in bed in a\r\ngreen baize waistcoat and a red Toledo cap, and so withered and dried\r\nup that he looked as if he had been turned into a mummy. They were very\r\ncordially received by him; they asked him after his health, and he\r\ntalked to them about himself very naturally and in very well-chosen\r\nlanguage. In the course of their conversation they fell to discussing\r\nwhat they call State-craft and systems of government, correcting this\r\nabuse and condemning that, reforming one practice and abolishing\r\nanother, each of the three setting up for a new legislator, a modern\r\nLycurgus, or a brand-new Solon; and so completely did they remodel the\r\nState, that they seemed to have thrust it into a furnace and taken out\r\nsomething quite different from what they had put in; and on all the\r\nsubjects they dealt with, Don Quixote spoke with such good sense that\r\nthe pair of examiners were fully convinced that he was quite recovered\r\nand in his full senses.\r\n\r\nThe niece and housekeeper were present at the conversation and could\r\nnot find words enough to express their thanks to God at seeing their\r\nmaster so clear in his mind; the curate, however, changing his original\r\nplan, which was to avoid touching upon matters of chivalry, resolved to\r\ntest Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s recovery thoroughly, and see whether it were genuine\r\nor not; and so, from one subject to another, he came at last to talk of\r\nthe news that had come from the capital, and, among other things, he\r\nsaid it was considered certain that the Turk was coming down with a\r\npowerful fleet, and that no one knew what his purpose was, or when the\r\ngreat storm would burst; and that all Christendom was in apprehension\r\nof this, which almost every year calls us to arms, and that his Majesty\r\nhad made provision for the security of the coasts of Naples and Sicily\r\nand the island of Malta.\r\n\r\nTo this Don Quixote replied, \xe2\x80\x9cHis Majesty has acted like a prudent\r\nwarrior in providing for the safety of his realms in time, so that the\r\nenemy may not find him unprepared; but if my advice were taken I would\r\nrecommend him to adopt a measure which at present, no doubt, his\r\nMajesty is very far from thinking of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moment the curate heard this he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cGod keep thee in\r\nhis hand, poor Don Quixote, for it seems to me thou art precipitating\r\nthyself from the height of thy madness into the profound abyss of thy\r\nsimplicity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the barber, who had the same suspicion as the curate, asked Don\r\nQuixote what would be his advice as to the measures that he said ought\r\nto be adopted; for perhaps it might prove to be one that would have to\r\nbe added to the list of the many impertinent suggestions that people\r\nwere in the habit of offering to princes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine, master shaver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwill not be impertinent, but,\r\non the contrary, pertinent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that experience has shown\r\nthat all or most of the expedients which are proposed to his Majesty\r\nare either impossible, or absurd, or injurious to the King and to the\r\nkingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine, however,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cis neither impossible nor\r\nabsurd, but the easiest, the most reasonable, the readiest and most\r\nexpeditious that could suggest itself to any projector\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take a long time to tell it, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t choose to tell it here, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand have it\r\nreach the ears of the lords of the council to-morrow morning, and some\r\nother carry off the thanks and rewards of my trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cI give my word here and before God\r\nthat I will not repeat what your worship says, to King, Rook or earthly\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94an oath I learned from the ballad of the curate, who, in the\r\nprelude, told the king of the thief who had robbed him of the hundred\r\ngold crowns and his pacing mule.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not versed in stories,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know the oath is\r\na good one, because I know the barber to be an honest fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven if he were not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cI will go bail and answer for\r\nhim that in this matter he will be as silent as a dummy, under pain of\r\npaying any penalty that may be pronounced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who will be security for you, se\xc3\xb1or curate?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy profession,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is to keep secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOds body!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote at this, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat more has his Majesty to do\r\nbut to command, by public proclamation, all the knights-errant that are\r\nscattered over Spain to assemble on a fixed day in the capital, for\r\neven if no more than half a dozen come, there may be one among them who\r\nalone will suffice to destroy the entire might of the Turk. Give me\r\nyour attention and follow me. Is it, pray, any new thing for a single\r\nknight-errant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men, as if\r\nthey all had but one throat or were made of sugar paste? Nay, tell me,\r\nhow many histories are there filled with these marvels? If only (in an\r\nevil hour for me: I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak for anyone else) the famous Don\r\nBelianis were alive now, or anyone of the innumerable progeny of Amadis\r\nof Gaul! If any these were alive to-day, and were to come face to face\r\nwith the Turk, by my faith, I would not give much for the Turk\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchance. But God will have regard for his people, and will provide\r\nsomeone, who, if not so valiant as the knights-errant of yore, at least\r\nwill not be inferior to them in spirit; but God knows what I mean, and\r\nI say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the niece at this, \xe2\x80\x9cmay I die if my master does not\r\nwant to turn knight-errant again;\xe2\x80\x9d to which Don Quixote replied, \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nknight-errant I shall die, and let the Turk come down or go up when he\r\nlikes, and in as strong force as he can, once more I say, God knows\r\nwhat I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d But here the barber said, \xe2\x80\x9cI ask your worships to give me\r\nleave to tell a short story of something that happened in Seville,\r\nwhich comes so pat to the purpose just now that I should like greatly\r\nto tell it.\xe2\x80\x9d Don Quixote gave him leave, and the rest prepared to\r\nlisten, and he began thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the madhouse at Seville there was a man whom his relations had\r\nplaced there as being out of his mind. He was a graduate of Osuna in\r\ncanon law; but even if he had been of Salamanca, it was the opinion of\r\nmost people that he would have been mad all the same. This graduate,\r\nafter some years of confinement, took it into his head that he was sane\r\nand in his full senses, and under this impression wrote to the\r\nArchbishop, entreating him earnestly, and in very correct language, to\r\nhave him released from the misery in which he was living; for by God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmercy he had now recovered his lost reason, though his relations, in\r\norder to enjoy his property, kept him there, and, in spite of the\r\ntruth, would make him out to be mad until his dying day. The\r\nArchbishop, moved by repeated sensible, well-written letters, directed\r\none of his chaplains to make inquiry of the madhouse as to the truth of\r\nthe licentiate\xe2\x80\x99s statements, and to have an interview with the madman\r\nhimself, and, if it should appear that he was in his senses, to take\r\nhim out and restore him to liberty. The chaplain did so, and the\r\ngovernor assured him that the man was still mad, and that though he\r\noften spoke like a highly intelligent person, he would in the end break\r\nout into nonsense that in quantity and quality counterbalanced all the\r\nsensible things he had said before, as might be easily tested by\r\ntalking to him. The chaplain resolved to try the experiment, and\r\nobtaining access to the madman conversed with him for an hour or more,\r\nduring the whole of which time he never uttered a word that was\r\nincoherent or absurd, but, on the contrary, spoke so rationally that\r\nthe chaplain was compelled to believe him to be sane. Among other\r\nthings, he said the governor was against him, not to lose the presents\r\nhis relations made him for reporting him still mad but with lucid\r\nintervals; and that the worst foe he had in his misfortune was his\r\nlarge property; for in order to enjoy it his enemies disparaged and\r\nthrew doubts upon the mercy our Lord had shown him in turning him from\r\na brute beast into a man. In short, he spoke in such a way that he cast\r\nsuspicion on the governor, and made his relations appear covetous and\r\nheartless, and himself so rational that the chaplain determined to take\r\nhim away with him that the Archbishop might see him, and ascertain for\r\nhimself the truth of the matter. Yielding to this conviction, the\r\nworthy chaplain begged the governor to have the clothes in which the\r\nlicentiate had entered the house given to him. The governor again bade\r\nhim beware of what he was doing, as the licentiate was beyond a doubt\r\nstill mad; but all his cautions and warnings were unavailing to\r\ndissuade the chaplain from taking him away. The governor, seeing that\r\nit was the order of the Archbishop, obeyed, and they dressed the\r\nlicentiate in his own clothes, which were new and decent. He, as soon\r\nas he saw himself clothed like one in his senses, and divested of the\r\nappearance of a madman, entreated the chaplain to permit him in charity\r\nto go and take leave of his comrades the madmen. The chaplain said he\r\nwould go with him to see what madmen there were in the house; so they\r\nwent upstairs, and with them some of those who were present.\r\nApproaching a cage in which there was a furious madman, though just at\r\nthat moment calm and quiet, the licentiate said to him, \xe2\x80\x98Brother, think\r\nif you have any commands for me, for I am going home, as God has been\r\npleased, in his infinite goodness and mercy, without any merit of mine,\r\nto restore me my reason. I am now cured and in my senses, for with\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s power nothing is impossible. Have strong hope and trust in him,\r\nfor as he has restored me to my original condition, so likewise he will\r\nrestore you if you trust in him. I will take care to send you some good\r\nthings to eat; and be sure you eat them; for I would have you know I am\r\nconvinced, as one who has gone through it, that all this madness of\r\nours comes of having the stomach empty and the brains full of wind.\r\nTake courage! take courage! for despondency in misfortune breaks down\r\nhealth and brings on death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cage opposite\r\nthat of the furious one was listening; and raising himself up from an\r\nold mat on which he lay stark naked, he asked in a loud voice who it\r\nwas that was going away cured and in his senses. The licentiate\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x98It is I, brother, who am going; I have now no need to remain\r\nhere any longer, for which I return infinite thanks to Heaven that has\r\nhad so great mercy upon me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mind what you are saying, licentiate; don\xe2\x80\x99t let the devil deceive\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the madman. \xe2\x80\x98Keep quiet, stay where you are, and you will\r\nsave yourself the trouble of coming back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I know I am cured,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the licentiate, \xe2\x80\x98and that I shall not\r\nhave to go stations again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You cured!\xe2\x80\x99 said the madman; \xe2\x80\x98well, we shall see; God be with you;\r\nbut I swear to you by Jupiter, whose majesty I represent on earth, that\r\nfor this crime alone, which Seville is committing to-day in releasing\r\nyou from this house, and treating you as if you were in your senses, I\r\nshall have to inflict such a punishment on it as will be remembered for\r\nages and ages, amen. Dost thou not know, thou miserable little\r\nlicentiate, that I can do it, being, as I say, Jupiter the Thunderer,\r\nwho hold in my hands the fiery bolts with which I am able and am wont\r\nto threaten and lay waste the world? But in one way only will I punish\r\nthis ignorant town, and that is by not raining upon it, nor on any part\r\nof its district or territory, for three whole years, to be reckoned\r\nfrom the day and moment when this threat is pronounced. Thou free, thou\r\ncured, thou in thy senses! and I mad, I disordered, I bound! I will as\r\nsoon think of sending rain as of hanging myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose present stood listening to the words and exclamations of the\r\nmadman; but our licentiate, turning to the chaplain and seizing him by\r\nthe hands, said to him, \xe2\x80\x98Be not uneasy, se\xc3\xb1or; attach no importance to\r\nwhat this madman has said; for if he is Jupiter and will not send rain,\r\nI, who am Neptune, the father and god of the waters, will rain as often\r\nas it pleases me and may be needful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe governor and the bystanders laughed, and at their laughter the\r\nchaplain was half ashamed, and he replied, \xe2\x80\x98For all that, Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nNeptune, it will not do to vex Se\xc3\xb1or Jupiter; remain where you are, and\r\nsome other day, when there is a better opportunity and more time, we\r\nwill come back for you.\xe2\x80\x99 So they stripped the licentiate, and he was\r\nleft where he was; and that\xe2\x80\x99s the end of the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the story, master barber,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich came in\r\nso pat to the purpose that you could not help telling it? Master\r\nshaver, master shaver! how blind is he who cannot see through a sieve.\r\nIs it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit,\r\nvalour with valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are always\r\nodious and unwelcome? I, master barber, am not Neptune, the god of the\r\nwaters, nor do I try to make anyone take me for an astute man, for I am\r\nnot one. My only endeavour is to convince the world of the mistake it\r\nmakes in not reviving in itself the happy time when the order of\r\nknight-errantry was in the field. But our depraved age does not deserve\r\nto enjoy such a blessing as those ages enjoyed when knights-errant took\r\nupon their shoulders the defence of kingdoms, the protection of\r\ndamsels, the succour of orphans and minors, the chastisement of the\r\nproud, and the recompense of the humble. With the knights of these\r\ndays, for the most part, it is the damask, brocade, and rich stuffs\r\nthey wear, that rustle as they go, not the chain mail of their armour;\r\nno knight now-a-days sleeps in the open field exposed to the inclemency\r\nof heaven, and in full panoply from head to foot; no one now takes a\r\nnap, as they call it, without drawing his feet out of the stirrups, and\r\nleaning upon his lance, as the knights-errant used to do; no one now,\r\nissuing from the wood, penetrates yonder mountains, and then treads the\r\nbarren, lonely shore of the sea\xe2\x80\x94mostly a tempestuous and stormy one\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nfinding on the beach a little bark without oars, sail, mast, or\r\ntackling of any kind, in the intrepidity of his heart flings himself\r\ninto it and commits himself to the wrathful billows of the deep sea,\r\nthat one moment lift him up to heaven and the next plunge him into the\r\ndepths; and opposing his breast to the irresistible gale, finds\r\nhimself, when he least expects it, three thousand leagues and more away\r\nfrom the place where he embarked; and leaping ashore in a remote and\r\nunknown land has adventures that deserve to be written, not on\r\nparchment, but on brass. But now sloth triumphs over energy, indolence\r\nover exertion, vice over virtue, arrogance over courage, and theory\r\nover practice in arms, which flourished and shone only in the golden\r\nages and in knights-errant. For tell me, who was more virtuous and more\r\nvaliant than the famous Amadis of Gaul? Who more discreet than Palmerin\r\nof England? Who more gracious and easy than Tirante el Blanco? Who more\r\ncourtly than Lisuarte of Greece? Who more slashed or slashing than Don\r\nBelianis? Who more intrepid than Perion of Gaul? Who more ready to face\r\ndanger than Felixmarte of Hircania? Who more sincere than Esplandian?\r\nWho more impetuous than Don Cirongilio of Thrace? Who more bold than\r\nRodamonte? Who more prudent than King Sobrino? Who more daring than\r\nReinaldos? Who more invincible than Roland? and who more gallant and\r\ncourteous than Ruggiero, from whom the dukes of Ferrara of the present\r\nday are descended, according to Turpin in his \xe2\x80\x98Cosmography.\xe2\x80\x99 All these\r\nknights, and many more that I could name, se\xc3\xb1or curate, were\r\nknights-errant, the light and glory of chivalry. These, or such as\r\nthese, I would have to carry out my plan, and in that case his Majesty\r\nwould find himself well served and would save great expense, and the\r\nTurk would be left tearing his beard. And so I will stay where I am, as\r\nthe chaplain does not take me away; and if Jupiter, as the barber has\r\ntold us, will not send rain, here am I, and I will rain when I please.\r\nI say this that Master Basin may know that I understand him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not mean it in\r\nthat way, and, so help me God, my intention was good, and your worship\r\nought not to be vexed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to whether I ought to be vexed or not,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmyself am the best judge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHereupon the curate observed, \xe2\x80\x9cI have hardly said a word as yet; and I\r\nwould gladly be relieved of a doubt, arising from what Don Quixote has\r\nsaid, that worries and works my conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe se\xc3\xb1or curate has leave for more than that,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cso he may declare his doubt, for it is not pleasant to have a doubt on\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, with that permission,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cI say my doubt is\r\nthat, all I can do, I cannot persuade myself that the whole pack of\r\nknights-errant you, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, have mentioned, were really and\r\ntruly persons of flesh and blood, that ever lived in the world; on the\r\ncontrary, I suspect it to be all fiction, fable, and falsehood, and\r\ndreams told by men awakened from sleep, or rather still half asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is another mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cinto which many have\r\nfallen who do not believe that there ever were such knights in the\r\nworld, and I have often, with divers people and on divers occasions,\r\ntried to expose this almost universal error to the light of truth.\r\nSometimes I have not been successful in my purpose, sometimes I have,\r\nsupporting it upon the shoulders of the truth; which truth is so clear\r\nthat I can almost say I have with my own eyes seen Amadis of Gaul, who\r\nwas a man of lofty stature, fair complexion, with a handsome though\r\nblack beard, of a countenance between gentle and stern in expression,\r\nsparing of words, slow to anger, and quick to put it away from him; and\r\nas I have depicted Amadis, so I could, I think, portray and describe\r\nall the knights-errant that are in all the histories in the world; for\r\nby the perception I have that they were what their histories describe,\r\nand by the deeds they did and the dispositions they displayed, it is\r\npossible, with the aid of sound philosophy, to deduce their features,\r\ncomplexion, and stature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow big, in your worship\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, may the giant Morgante have been,\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the barber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith regard to giants,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9copinions differ as to\r\nwhether there ever were any or not in the world; but the Holy\r\nScripture, which cannot err by a jot from the truth, shows us that\r\nthere were, when it gives us the history of that big Philistine,\r\nGoliath, who was seven cubits and a half in height, which is a huge\r\nsize. Likewise, in the island of Sicily, there have been found\r\nleg-bones and arm-bones so large that their size makes it plain that\r\ntheir owners were giants, and as tall as great towers; geometry puts\r\nthis fact beyond a doubt. But, for all that, I cannot speak with\r\ncertainty as to the size of Morgante, though I suspect he cannot have\r\nbeen very tall; and I am inclined to be of this opinion because I find\r\nin the history in which his deeds are particularly mentioned, that he\r\nfrequently slept under a roof and as he found houses to contain him, it\r\nis clear that his bulk could not have been anything excessive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, and yielding to the enjoyment of\r\nhearing such nonsense, he asked him what was his notion of the features\r\nof Reinaldos of Montalban, and Don Roland and the rest of the Twelve\r\nPeers of France, for they were all knights-errant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for Reinaldos,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI venture to say that he was\r\nbroad-faced, of ruddy complexion, with roguish and somewhat prominent\r\neyes, excessively punctilious and touchy, and given to the society of\r\nthieves and scapegraces. With regard to Roland, or Rotolando, or\r\nOrlando (for the histories call him by all these names), I am of\r\nopinion, and hold, that he was of middle height, broad-shouldered,\r\nrather bow-legged, swarthy-complexioned, red-bearded, with a hairy body\r\nand a severe expression of countenance, a man of few words, but very\r\npolite and well-bred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Roland was not a more graceful person than your worship has\r\ndescribed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cit is no wonder that the fair Lady\r\nAngelica rejected him and left him for the gaiety, liveliness, and\r\ngrace of that budding-bearded little Moor to whom she surrendered\r\nherself; and she showed her sense in falling in love with the gentle\r\nsoftness of Medoro rather than the roughness of Roland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Angelica, se\xc3\xb1or curate,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwas a giddy\r\ndamsel, flighty and somewhat wanton, and she left the world as full of\r\nher vagaries as of the fame of her beauty. She treated with scorn a\r\nthousand gentlemen, men of valour and wisdom, and took up with a\r\nsmooth-faced sprig of a page, without fortune or fame, except such\r\nreputation for gratitude as the affection he bore his friend got for\r\nhim. The great poet who sang her beauty, the famous Ariosto, not caring\r\nto sing her adventures after her contemptible surrender (which probably\r\nwere not over and above creditable), dropped her where he says:\r\n\r\nHow she received the sceptre of Cathay,\r\nSome bard of defter quill may sing some day;\r\n\r\n\r\nand this was no doubt a kind of prophecy, for poets are also called\r\n_vates_, that is to say diviners; and its truth was made plain; for\r\nsince then a famous Andalusian poet has lamented and sung her tears,\r\nand another famous and rare poet, a Castilian, has sung her beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber here, \xe2\x80\x9camong all those\r\nwho praised her, has there been no poet to write a satire on this Lady\r\nAngelica?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can well believe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if Sacripante or\r\nRoland had been poets they would have given the damsel a trimming; for\r\nit is naturally the way with poets who have been scorned and rejected\r\nby their ladies, whether fictitious or not, in short by those whom they\r\nselect as the ladies of their thoughts, to avenge themselves in satires\r\nand libels\xe2\x80\x94a vengeance, to be sure, unworthy of generous hearts; but up\r\nto the present I have not heard of any defamatory verse against the\r\nLady Angelica, who turned the world upside down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; but at this moment they heard the\r\nhousekeeper and the niece, who had previously withdrawn from the\r\nconversation, exclaiming aloud in the courtyard, and at the noise they\r\nall ran out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np01e.jpg (15K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF THE NOTABLE ALTERCATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HAD WITH DON\r\nQUIXOTE\xe2\x80\x99S NIECE, AND HOUSEKEEPER, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DROLL MATTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np02a.jpg (159K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history relates that the outcry Don Quixote, the curate, and the\r\nbarber heard came from the niece and the housekeeper exclaiming to\r\nSancho, who was striving to force his way in to see Don Quixote while\r\nthey held the door against him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does the vagabond want in this\r\nhouse? Be off to your own, brother, for it is you, and no one else,\r\nthat delude my master, and lead him astray, and take him tramping about\r\nthe country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Sancho replied, \xe2\x80\x9cDevil\xe2\x80\x99s own housekeeper! it is I who am\r\ndeluded, and led astray, and taken tramping about the country, and not\r\nthy master! He has carried me all over the world, and you are mightily\r\nmistaken. He enticed me away from home by a trick, promising me an\r\nisland, which I am still waiting for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay evil islands choke thee, thou detestable Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the niece;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are islands? Is it something to eat, glutton and gormandiser that\r\nthou art?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not something to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut something to govern\r\nand rule, and better than four cities or four judgeships at court.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the housekeeper, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t enter here, you bag of\r\nmischief and sack of knavery; go govern your house and dig your\r\nseed-patch, and give over looking for islands or shylands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe curate and the barber listened with great amusement to the words of\r\nthe three; but Don Quixote, uneasy lest Sancho should blab and blurt\r\nout a whole heap of mischievous stupidities, and touch upon points that\r\nmight not be altogether to his credit, called to him and made the other\r\ntwo hold their tongues and let him come in. Sancho entered, and the\r\ncurate and the barber took their leave of Don Quixote, of whose\r\nrecovery they despaired when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy\r\nideas, and how saturated with the nonsense of his unlucky chivalry; and\r\nsaid the curate to the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cYou will see, gossip, that when we are\r\nleast thinking of it, our gentleman will be off once more for another\r\nflight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the barber; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not wonder so\r\nmuch at the madness of the knight as at the simplicity of the squire,\r\nwho has such a firm belief in all that about the island, that I suppose\r\nall the exposures that could be imagined would not get it out of his\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod help them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cand let us be on the look-out to see\r\nwhat comes of all these absurdities of the knight and squire, for it\r\nseems as if they had both been cast in the same mould, and the madness\r\nof the master without the simplicity of the man would not be worth a\r\nfarthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cand I should like very much to know\r\nwhat the pair are talking about at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cthe niece or the housekeeper will\r\ntell us by-and-by, for they are not the ones to forget to listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Don Quixote shut himself up in his room with Sancho, and when\r\nthey were alone he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIt grieves me greatly, Sancho, that\r\nthou shouldst have said, and sayest, that I took thee out of thy\r\ncottage, when thou knowest I did not remain in my house. We sallied\r\nforth together, we took the road together, we wandered abroad together;\r\nwe have had the same fortune and the same luck; if they blanketed thee\r\nonce, they belaboured me a hundred times, and that is the only\r\nadvantage I have of thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was only reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor, by what your worship\r\nsays, misfortunes belong more properly to knights-errant than to their\r\nsquires.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art mistaken, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9caccording to the maxim\r\n_quando caput dolet_, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand any language but my own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when the head suffers all the\r\nmembers suffer; and so, being thy lord and master, I am thy head, and\r\nthou a part of me as thou art my servant; and therefore any evil that\r\naffects or shall affect me should give thee pain, and what affects thee\r\ngive pain to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt should be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when I was blanketed as a member,\r\nmy head was on the other side of the wall, looking on while I was\r\nflying through the air, and did not feel any pain whatever; and if the\r\nmembers are obliged to feel the suffering of the head, it should be\r\nobliged to feel their sufferings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDost thou mean to say now, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I did not\r\nfeel when they were blanketing thee? If thou dost, thou must not say so\r\nor think so, for I felt more pain then in spirit than thou didst in\r\nbody. But let us put that aside for the present, for we shall have\r\nopportunities enough for considering and settling the point; tell me,\r\nSancho my friend, what do they say about me in the village here? What\r\ndo the common people think of me? What do the hidalgos? What do the\r\ncaballeros? What do they say of my valour; of my achievements; of my\r\ncourtesy? How do they treat the task I have undertaken in reviving and\r\nrestoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry? In short,\r\nSancho, I would have thee tell me all that has come to thine ears on\r\nthis subject; and thou art to tell me, without adding anything to the\r\ngood or taking away anything from the bad; for it is the duty of loyal\r\nvassals to tell the truth to their lords just as it is and in its\r\nproper shape, not allowing flattery to add to it or any idle deference\r\nto lessen it. And I would have thee know, Sancho, that if the naked\r\ntruth, undisguised by flattery, came to the ears of princes, times\r\nwould be different, and other ages would be reckoned iron ages more\r\nthan ours, which I hold to be the golden of these latter days. Profit\r\nby this advice, Sancho, and report to me clearly and faithfully the\r\ntruth of what thou knowest touching what I have demanded of thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will do with all my heart, master,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cprovided\r\nyour worship will not be vexed at what I say, as you wish me to say it\r\nout in all its nakedness, without putting any more clothes on it than\r\nit came to my knowledge in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not be vexed at all,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthou mayest speak\r\nfreely, Sancho, and without any beating about the bush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cfirst of all, I have to tell you that the common\r\npeople consider your worship a mighty great madman, and me no less a\r\nfool. The hidalgos say that, not keeping within the bounds of your\r\nquality of gentleman, you have assumed the \xe2\x80\x98Don,\xe2\x80\x99 and made a knight of\r\nyourself at a jump, with four vine-stocks and a couple of acres of\r\nland, and never a shirt to your back. The caballeros say they do not\r\nwant to have hidalgos setting up in opposition to them, particularly\r\nsquire hidalgos who polish their own shoes and darn their black\r\nstockings with green silk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not apply to me, for I always go well\r\ndressed and never patched; ragged I may be, but ragged more from the\r\nwear and tear of arms than of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to your worship\xe2\x80\x99s valour, courtesy, accomplishments, and task,\r\nthere is a variety of opinions. Some say, \xe2\x80\x98mad but droll;\xe2\x80\x99 others,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98valiant but unlucky;\xe2\x80\x99 others, \xe2\x80\x98courteous but meddling,\xe2\x80\x99 and then they\r\ngo into such a number of things that they don\xe2\x80\x99t leave a whole bone\r\neither in your worship or in myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecollect, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat wherever virtue exists in\r\nan eminent degree it is persecuted. Few or none of the famous men that\r\nhave lived escaped being calumniated by malice. Julius C\xc3\xa6sar, the\r\nboldest, wisest, and bravest of captains, was charged with being\r\nambitious, and not particularly cleanly in his dress, or pure in his\r\nmorals. Of Alexander, whose deeds won him the name of Great, they say\r\nthat he was somewhat of a drunkard. Of Hercules, him of the many\r\nlabours, it is said that he was lewd and luxurious. Of Don Galaor, the\r\nbrother of Amadis of Gaul, it was whispered that he was\r\nover-quarrelsome, and of his brother that he was lachrymose. So that, O\r\nSancho, amongst all these calumnies against good men, mine may be let\r\npass, since they are no more than thou hast said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just where it is, body of my father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there more, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the tail to be skinned yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9call so far is cakes\r\nand fancy bread; but if your worship wants to know all about the\r\ncalumnies they bring against you, I will fetch you one this instant who\r\ncan tell you the whole of them without missing an atom; for last night\r\nthe son of Bartholomew Carrasco, who has been studying at Salamanca,\r\ncame home after having been made a bachelor, and when I went to welcome\r\nhim, he told me that your worship\xe2\x80\x99s history is already abroad in books,\r\nwith the title of THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA; and\r\nhe says they mention me in it by my own name of Sancho Panza, and the\r\nlady Dulcinea del Toboso too, and divers things that happened to us\r\nwhen we were alone; so that I crossed myself in my wonder how the\r\nhistorian who wrote them down could have known them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise thee, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe author of our history\r\nwill be some sage enchanter; for to such nothing that they choose to\r\nwrite about is hidden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9ca sage and an enchanter! Why, the bachelor Samson\r\nCarrasco (that is the name of him I spoke of) says the author of the\r\nhistory is called Cide Hamete Berengena.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a Moorish name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay be so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have heard say that the Moors are\r\nmostly great lovers of berengenas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou must have mistaken the surname of this \xe2\x80\x98Cide\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94which means in\r\nArabic \xe2\x80\x98Lord\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if your worship wishes me to fetch\r\nthe bachelor I will go for him in a twinkling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt do me a great pleasure, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nwhat thou hast told me has amazed me, and I shall not eat a morsel that\r\nwill agree with me until I have heard all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I am off for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; and leaving his master he went in\r\nquest of the bachelor, with whom he returned in a short time, and, all\r\nthree together, they had a very droll colloquy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np02e.jpg (23K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nOF THE LAUGHABLE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE, SANCHO\r\nPANZA, AND THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np03a.jpg (131K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote remained very deep in thought, waiting for the bachelor\r\nCarrasco, from whom he was to hear how he himself had been put into a\r\nbook as Sancho said; and he could not persuade himself that any such\r\nhistory could be in existence, for the blood of the enemies he had\r\nslain was not yet dry on the blade of his sword, and now they wanted to\r\nmake out that his mighty achievements were going about in print. For\r\nall that, he fancied some sage, either a friend or an enemy, might, by\r\nthe aid of magic, have given them to the press; if a friend, in order\r\nto magnify and exalt them above the most famous ever achieved by any\r\nknight-errant; if an enemy, to bring them to naught and degrade them\r\nbelow the meanest ever recorded of any low squire, though as he said to\r\nhimself, the achievements of squires never were recorded. If, however,\r\nit were the fact that such a history were in existence, it must\r\nnecessarily, being the story of a knight-errant, be grandiloquent,\r\nlofty, imposing, grand and true. With this he comforted himself\r\nsomewhat, though it made him uncomfortable to think that the author was\r\na Moor, judging by the title of \xe2\x80\x9cCide;\xe2\x80\x9d and that no truth was to be\r\nlooked for from Moors, as they are all impostors, cheats, and schemers.\r\nHe was afraid he might have dealt with his love affairs in some\r\nindecorous fashion, that might tend to the discredit and prejudice of\r\nthe purity of his lady Dulcinea del Toboso; he would have had him set\r\nforth the fidelity and respect he had always observed towards her,\r\nspurning queens, empresses, and damsels of all sorts, and keeping in\r\ncheck the impetuosity of his natural impulses. Absorbed and wrapped up\r\nin these and divers other cogitations, he was found by Sancho and\r\nCarrasco, whom Don Quixote received with great courtesy.\r\n\r\nThe bachelor, though he was called Samson, was of no great bodily size,\r\nbut he was a very great wag; he was of a sallow complexion, but very\r\nsharp-witted, somewhere about four-and-twenty years of age, with a\r\nround face, a flat nose, and a large mouth, all indications of a\r\nmischievous disposition and a love of fun and jokes; and of this he\r\ngave a sample as soon as he saw Don Quixote, by falling on his knees\r\nbefore him and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me kiss your mightiness\xe2\x80\x99s hand, Se\xc3\xb1or Don\r\nQuixote of La Mancha, for, by the habit of St. Peter that I wear,\r\nthough I have no more than the first four orders, your worship is one\r\nof the most famous knights-errant that have ever been, or will be, all\r\nthe world over. A blessing on Cide Hamete Benengeli, who has written\r\nthe history of your great deeds, and a double blessing on that\r\nconnoisseur who took the trouble of having it translated out of the\r\nArabic into our Castilian vulgar tongue for the universal entertainment\r\nof the people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote made him rise, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSo, then, it is true that there\r\nis a history of me, and that it was a Moor and a sage who wrote it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo true is it, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samson, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my belief is there are more\r\nthan twelve thousand volumes of the said history in print this very\r\nday. Only ask Portugal, Barcelona, and Valencia, where they have been\r\nprinted, and moreover there is a report that it is being printed at\r\nAntwerp, and I am persuaded there will not be a country or language in\r\nwhich there will not be a translation of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the things,\xe2\x80\x9d here observed Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat ought to give\r\nmost pleasure to a virtuous and eminent man is to find himself in his\r\nlifetime in print and in type, familiar in people\xe2\x80\x99s mouths with a good\r\nname; I say with a good name, for if it be the opposite, then there is\r\nno death to be compared to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it goes by good name and fame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bachelor, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship\r\nalone bears away the palm from all the knights-errant; for the Moor in\r\nhis own language, and the Christian in his, have taken care to set\r\nbefore us your gallantry, your high courage in encountering dangers,\r\nyour fortitude in adversity, your patience under misfortunes as well as\r\nwounds, the purity and continence of the platonic loves of your worship\r\nand my lady Do\xc3\xb1a Dulcinea del Toboso\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard my lady Dulcinea called Do\xc3\xb1a,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Sancho here;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnothing more than the lady Dulcinea del Toboso; so here already the\r\nhistory is wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not an objection of any importance,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Carrasco.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut tell me, se\xc3\xb1or bachelor, what\r\ndeeds of mine are they that are made most of in this history?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn that point,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the bachelor, \xe2\x80\x9copinions differ, as tastes do;\r\nsome swear by the adventure of the windmills that your worship took to\r\nbe Briareuses and giants; others by that of the fulling mills; one\r\ncries up the description of the two armies that afterwards took the\r\nappearance of two droves of sheep; another that of the dead body on its\r\nway to be buried at Segovia; a third says the liberation of the galley\r\nslaves is the best of all, and a fourth that nothing comes up to the\r\naffair with the Benedictine giants, and the battle with the valiant\r\nBiscayan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, se\xc3\xb1or bachelor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho at this point, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes the\r\nadventure with the Yanguesans come in, when our good Rocinante went\r\nhankering after dainties?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sage has left nothing in the ink-bottle,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Samson; \xe2\x80\x9che\r\ntells all and sets down everything, even to the capers that worthy\r\nSancho cut in the blanket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cut no capers in the blanket,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cin the air I did,\r\nand more of them than I liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no human history in the world, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat has not its ups and downs, but more than others such as deal with\r\nchivalry, for they can never be entirely made up of prosperous\r\nadventures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the bachelor, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are those who have read\r\nthe history who say they would have been glad if the author had left\r\nout some of the countless cudgellings that were inflicted on Se\xc3\xb1or Don\r\nQuixote in various encounters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where the truth of the history comes in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time they might fairly have passed them over in silence,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor there is no need of recording events which\r\ndo not change or affect the truth of a history, if they tend to bring\r\nthe hero of it into contempt. \xc3\x86neas was not in truth and earnest so\r\npious as Virgil represents him, nor Ulysses so wise as Homer describes\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samson; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is one thing to write as a poet,\r\nanother to write as a historian; the poet may describe or sing things,\r\nnot as they were, but as they ought to have been; but the historian has\r\nto write them down, not as they ought to have been, but as they were,\r\nwithout adding anything to the truth or taking anything from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif this se\xc3\xb1or Moor goes in for telling the\r\ntruth, no doubt among my master\xe2\x80\x99s drubbings mine are to be found; for\r\nthey never took the measure of his worship\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders without doing\r\nthe same for my whole body; but I have no right to wonder at that, for,\r\nas my master himself says, the members must share the pain of the\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a sly dog, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9ci\xe2\x80\x99 faith, you have no\r\nwant of memory when you choose to remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to try to forget the thwacks they gave me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\nweals would not let me, for they are still fresh on my ribs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt the bachelor,\r\nwhom I entreat to go on and tell all that is said about me in this\r\nhistory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd about me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor they say, too, that I am one of the\r\nprincipal presonages in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPersonages, not presonages, friend Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Another word-catcher!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cif that\xe2\x80\x99s to be the way we\r\nshall not make an end in a lifetime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay God shorten mine, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the bachelor, \xe2\x80\x9cif you are not\r\nthe second person in the history, and there are even some who would\r\nrather hear you talk than the cleverest in the whole book; though there\r\nare some, too, who say you showed yourself over-credulous in believing\r\nthere was any possibility in the government of that island offered you\r\nby Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is still sunshine on the wall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand when\r\nSancho is somewhat more advanced in life, with the experience that\r\nyears bring, he will be fitter and better qualified for being a\r\ngovernor than he is at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, master,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthe island that I cannot govern with\r\nthe years I have, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not be able to govern with the years of\r\nMethuselah; the difficulty is that the said island keeps its distance\r\nsomewhere, I know not where; and not that there is any want of head in\r\nme to govern it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it to God, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor all will be and\r\nperhaps better than you think; no leaf on the tree stirs but by God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samson; \xe2\x80\x9cand if it be God\xe2\x80\x99s will, there will not\r\nbe any want of a thousand islands, much less one, for Sancho to\r\ngovern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen governors in these parts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat are not to\r\nbe compared to my shoe-sole; and for all that they are called \xe2\x80\x98your\r\nlordship\xe2\x80\x99 and served on silver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are not governors of islands,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Samson, \xe2\x80\x9cbut of other\r\ngovernments of an easier kind: those that govern islands must at least\r\nknow grammar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could manage the gram well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut for the mar I\r\nhave neither leaning nor liking, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is; but\r\nleaving this matter of the government in God\xe2\x80\x99s hands, to send me\r\nwherever it may be most to his service, I may tell you, se\xc3\xb1or bachelor\r\nSamson Carrasco, it has pleased me beyond measure that the author of\r\nthis history should have spoken of me in such a way that what is said\r\nof me gives no offence; for, on the faith of a true squire, if he had\r\nsaid anything about me that was at all unbecoming an old Christian,\r\nsuch as I am, the deaf would have heard of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be working miracles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiracles or no miracles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9clet everyone mind how he\r\nspeaks or writes about people, and not set down at random the first\r\nthing that comes into his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the faults they find with this history,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bachelor, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nthat its author inserted in it a novel called \xe2\x80\x98The Ill-advised\r\nCuriosity;\xe2\x80\x99 not that it is bad or ill-told, but that it is out of place\r\nand has nothing to do with the history of his worship Se\xc3\xb1or Don\r\nQuixote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will bet the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages and the baskets,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, I say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe author of my history was no sage,\r\nbut some ignorant chatterer, who, in a haphazard and heedless way, set\r\nabout writing it, let it turn out as it might, just as Orbaneja, the\r\npainter of \xc3\x9abeda, used to do, who, when they asked him what he was\r\npainting, answered, \xe2\x80\x98What it may turn out.\xe2\x80\x99 Sometimes he would paint a\r\ncock in such a fashion, and so unlike, that he had to write alongside\r\nof it in Gothic letters, \xe2\x80\x98This is a cock; and so it will be with my\r\nhistory, which will require a commentary to make it intelligible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fear of that,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Samson, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is so plain that there is\r\nnothing in it to puzzle over; the children turn its leaves, the young\r\npeople read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk praise it; in\r\na word, it is so thumbed, and read, and got by heart by people of all\r\nsorts, that the instant they see any lean hack, they say, \xe2\x80\x98There goes\r\nRocinante.\xe2\x80\x99 And those that are most given to reading it are the pages,\r\nfor there is not a lord\xe2\x80\x99s ante-chamber where there is not a \xe2\x80\x98Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99 to be found; one takes it up if another lays it down; this one\r\npounces upon it, and that begs for it. In short, the said history is\r\nthe most delightful and least injurious entertainment that has been\r\nhitherto seen, for there is not to be found in the whole of it even the\r\nsemblance of an immodest word, or a thought that is other than\r\nCatholic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo write in any other way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwould not be to write\r\ntruth, but falsehood, and historians who have recourse to falsehood\r\nought to be burned, like those who coin false money; and I know not\r\nwhat could have led the author to have recourse to novels and\r\nirrelevant stories, when he had so much to write about in mine; no\r\ndoubt he must have gone by the proverb \xe2\x80\x98with straw or with hay, etc,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfor by merely setting forth my thoughts, my sighs, my tears, my lofty\r\npurposes, my enterprises, he might have made a volume as large, or\r\nlarger than all the works of El Tostado would make up. In fact, the\r\nconclusion I arrive at, se\xc3\xb1or bachelor, is, that to write histories, or\r\nbooks of any kind, there is need of great judgment and a ripe\r\nunderstanding. To give expression to humour, and write in a strain of\r\ngraceful pleasantry, is the gift of great geniuses. The cleverest\r\ncharacter in comedy is the clown, for he who would make people take him\r\nfor a fool, must not be one. History is in a measure a sacred thing,\r\nfor it should be true, and where the truth is, there God is; but\r\nnotwithstanding this, there are some who write and fling books\r\nbroadcast on the world as if they were fritters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no book so bad but it has something good in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nbachelor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt of that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it often happens that\r\nthose who have acquired and attained a well-deserved reputation by\r\ntheir writings, lose it entirely, or damage it in some degree, when\r\nthey give them to the press.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samson, \xe2\x80\x9cis, that as printed works are\r\nexamined leisurely, their faults are easily seen; and the greater the\r\nfame of the writer, the more closely are they scrutinised. Men famous\r\nfor their genius, great poets, illustrious historians, are always, or\r\nmost commonly, envied by those who take a particular delight and\r\npleasure in criticising the writings of others, without having produced\r\nany of their own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is no wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor there are many divines who\r\nare no good for the pulpit, but excellent in detecting the defects or\r\nexcesses of those who preach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that is true, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carrasco; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wish such\r\nfault-finders were more lenient and less exacting, and did not pay so\r\nmuch attention to the spots on the bright sun of the work they grumble\r\nat; for if _aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus_, they should remember how\r\nlong he remained awake to shed the light of his work with as little\r\nshade as possible; and perhaps it may be that what they find fault with\r\nmay be moles, that sometimes heighten the beauty of the face that bears\r\nthem; and so I say very great is the risk to which he who prints a book\r\nexposes himself, for of all impossibilities the greatest is to write\r\none that will satisfy and please all readers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat which treats of me must have pleased few,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bachelor; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, as _stultorum infinitum\r\nest numerus_, innumerable are those who have relished the said history;\r\nbut some have brought a charge against the author\xe2\x80\x99s memory, inasmuch as\r\nhe forgot to say who the thief was who stole Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s Dapple; for it is\r\nnot stated there, but only to be inferred from what is set down, that\r\nhe was stolen, and a little farther on we see Sancho mounted on the\r\nsame ass, without any reappearance of it. They say, too, that he forgot\r\nto state what Sancho did with those hundred crowns that he found in the\r\nvalise in the Sierra Morena, as he never alludes to them again, and\r\nthere are many who would be glad to know what he did with them, or what\r\nhe spent them on, for it is one of the serious omissions of the work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or Samson, I am not in a humour now for going into accounts or\r\nexplanations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor there\xe2\x80\x99s a sinking of the stomach come\r\nover me, and unless I doctor it with a couple of sups of the old stuff\r\nit will put me on the thorn of Santa Lucia. I have it at home, and my\r\nold woman is waiting for me; after dinner I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back, and will\r\nanswer you and all the world every question you may choose to ask, as\r\nwell about the loss of the ass as about the spending of the hundred\r\ncrowns;\xe2\x80\x9d and without another word or waiting for a reply he made off\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote begged and entreated the bachelor to stay and do penance\r\nwith him. The bachelor accepted the invitation and remained, a couple\r\nof young pigeons were added to the ordinary fare, at dinner they talked\r\nchivalry, Carrasco fell in with his host\xe2\x80\x99s humour, the banquet came to\r\nan end, they took their afternoon sleep, Sancho returned, and their\r\nconversation was resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np03e.jpg (49K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nIN WHICH SANCHO PANZA GIVES A SATISFACTORY REPLY TO THE DOUBTS AND\r\nQUESTIONS OF THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS\r\nWORTH KNOWING AND TELLING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np04a.jpg (143K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSancho came back to Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s house, and returning to the late\r\nsubject of conversation, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAs to what Se\xc3\xb1or Samson said, that\r\nhe would like to know by whom, or how, or when my ass was stolen, I say\r\nin reply that the same night we went into the Sierra Morena, flying\r\nfrom the Holy Brotherhood after that unlucky adventure of the galley\r\nslaves, and the other of the corpse that was going to Segovia, my\r\nmaster and I ensconced ourselves in a thicket, and there, my master\r\nleaning on his lance, and I seated on my Dapple, battered and weary\r\nwith the late frays we fell asleep as if it had been on four feather\r\nmattresses; and I in particular slept so sound, that, whoever he was,\r\nhe was able to come and prop me up on four stakes, which he put under\r\nthe four corners of the pack-saddle in such a way that he left me\r\nmounted on it, and took away Dapple from under me without my feeling\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np04b.jpg (270K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is an easy matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is no new\r\noccurrence, for the same thing happened to Sacripante at the siege of\r\nAlbracca; the famous thief, Brunello, by the same contrivance, took his\r\nhorse from between his legs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDay came,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand the moment I stirred the stakes gave\r\nway and I fell to the ground with a mighty come down; I looked about\r\nfor the ass, but could not see him; the tears rushed to my eyes and I\r\nraised such a lamentation that, if the author of our history has not\r\nput it in, he may depend upon it he has left out a good thing. Some\r\ndays after, I know not how many, travelling with her ladyship the\r\nPrincess Micomicona, I saw my ass, and mounted upon him, in the dress\r\nof a gipsy, was that Gines de Pasamonte, the great rogue and rascal\r\nthat my master and I freed from the chain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not where the mistake is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Samson; \xe2\x80\x9cit is, that before\r\nthe ass has turned up, the author speaks of Sancho as being mounted on\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cunless that the\r\nhistorian made a mistake, or perhaps it might be a blunder of the\r\nprinter\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt that\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samson; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what became of the hundred\r\ncrowns? Did they vanish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Sancho answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI spent them for my own good, and my wife\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand my children\xe2\x80\x99s, and it is they that have made my wife bear so\r\npatiently all my wanderings on highways and byways, in the service of\r\nmy master, Don Quixote; for if after all this time I had come back to\r\nthe house without a rap and without the ass, it would have been a poor\r\nlook-out for me; and if anyone wants to know anything more about me,\r\nhere I am, ready to answer the king himself in person; and it is no\r\naffair of anyone\xe2\x80\x99s whether I took or did not take, whether I spent or\r\ndid not spend; for the whacks that were given me in these journeys were\r\nto be paid for in money, even if they were valued at no more than four\r\nmaravedis apiece, another hundred crowns would not pay me for half of\r\nthem. Let each look to himself and not try to make out white black, and\r\nblack white; for each of us is as God made him, aye, and often worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carrasco, \xe2\x80\x9cto impress upon the author of the\r\nhistory that, if he prints it again, he must not forget what worthy\r\nSancho has said, for it will raise it a good span higher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything else to correct in the history, se\xc3\xb1or bachelor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt there is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut not anything that will be of the\r\nsame importance as those I have mentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the author promise a second part at all?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does promise one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Samson; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he says he has not found\r\nit, nor does he know who has got it; and we cannot say whether it will\r\nappear or not; and so, on that head, as some say that no second part\r\nhas ever been good, and others that enough has been already written\r\nabout Don Quixote, it is thought there will be no second part; though\r\nsome, who are jovial rather than saturnine, say, \xe2\x80\x98Let us have more\r\nQuixotades, let Don Quixote charge and Sancho chatter, and no matter\r\nwhat it may turn out, we shall be satisfied with that.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does the author mean to do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Samson; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, as soon as he has found the history which\r\nhe is now searching for with extraordinary diligence, he will at once\r\ngive it to the press, moved more by the profit that may accrue to him\r\nfrom doing so than by any thought of praise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereat Sancho observed, \xe2\x80\x9cThe author looks for money and profit, does\r\nhe? It will be a wonder if he succeeds, for it will be only hurry,\r\nhurry, with him, like the tailor on Easter Eve; and works done in a\r\nhurry are never finished as perfectly as they ought to be. Let master\r\nMoor, or whatever he is, pay attention to what he is doing, and I and\r\nmy master will give him as much grouting ready to his hand, in the way\r\nof adventures and accidents of all sorts, as would make up not only one\r\nsecond part, but a hundred. The good man fancies, no doubt, that we are\r\nfast asleep in the straw here, but let him hold up our feet to be shod\r\nand he will see which foot it is we go lame on. All I say is, that if\r\nmy master would take my advice, we would be now afield, redressing\r\noutrages and righting wrongs, as is the use and custom of good\r\nknights-errant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho had hardly uttered these words when the neighing of Rocinante\r\nfell upon their ears, which neighing Don Quixote accepted as a happy\r\nomen, and he resolved to make another sally in three or four days from\r\nthat time. Announcing his intention to the bachelor, he asked his\r\nadvice as to the quarter in which he ought to commence his expedition,\r\nand the bachelor replied that in his opinion he ought to go to the\r\nkingdom of Aragon, and the city of Saragossa, where there were to be\r\ncertain solemn joustings at the festival of St. George, at which he\r\nmight win renown above all the knights of Aragon, which would be\r\nwinning it above all the knights of the world. He commended his very\r\npraiseworthy and gallant resolution, but admonished him to proceed with\r\ngreater caution in encountering dangers, because his life did not\r\nbelong to him, but to all those who had need of him to protect and aid\r\nthem in their misfortunes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s where it is, what I abominate, Se\xc3\xb1or Samson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho\r\nhere; \xe2\x80\x9cmy master will attack a hundred armed men as a greedy boy would\r\nhalf a dozen melons. Body of the world, se\xc3\xb1or bachelor! there is a time\r\nto attack and a time to retreat, and it is not to be always \xe2\x80\x98Santiago,\r\nand close Spain!\xe2\x80\x99 Moreover, I have heard it said (and I think by my\r\nmaster himself, if I remember rightly) that the mean of valour lies\r\nbetween the extremes of cowardice and rashness; and if that be so, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want him to fly without having good reason, or to attack when the\r\nodds make it better not. But, above all things, I warn my master that\r\nif he is to take me with him it must be on the condition that he is to\r\ndo all the fighting, and that I am not to be called upon to do anything\r\nexcept what concerns keeping him clean and comfortable; in this I will\r\ndance attendance on him readily; but to expect me to draw sword, even\r\nagainst rascally churls of the hatchet and hood, is idle. I don\xe2\x80\x99t set\r\nup to be a fighting man, Se\xc3\xb1or Samson, but only the best and most loyal\r\nsquire that ever served knight-errant; and if my master Don Quixote, in\r\nconsideration of my many faithful services, is pleased to give me some\r\nisland of the many his worship says one may stumble on in these parts,\r\nI will take it as a great favour; and if he does not give it to me, I\r\nwas born like everyone else, and a man must not live in dependence on\r\nanyone except God; and what is more, my bread will taste as well, and\r\nperhaps even better, without a government than if I were a governor;\r\nand how do I know but that in these governments the devil may have\r\nprepared some trip for me, to make me lose my footing and fall and\r\nknock my grinders out? Sancho I was born and Sancho I mean to die. But\r\nfor all that, if heaven were to make me a fair offer of an island or\r\nsomething else of the kind, without much trouble and without much risk,\r\nI am not such a fool as to refuse it; for they say, too, \xe2\x80\x98when they\r\noffer thee a heifer, run with a halter; and \xe2\x80\x98when good luck comes to\r\nthee, take it in.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carrasco, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have spoken like a professor;\r\nbut, for all that, put your trust in God and in Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, for\r\nhe will give you a kingdom, not to say an island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all the same, be it more or be it less,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cthough\r\nI can tell Se\xc3\xb1or Carrasco that my master would not throw the kingdom he\r\nmight give me into a sack all in holes; for I have felt my own pulse\r\nand I find myself sound enough to rule kingdoms and govern islands; and\r\nI have before now told my master as much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samson; \xe2\x80\x9chonours change manners, and perhaps\r\nwhen you find yourself a governor you won\xe2\x80\x99t know the mother that bore\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may hold good of those that are born in the ditches,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSancho, \xe2\x80\x9cnot of those who have the fat of an old Christian four fingers\r\ndeep on their souls, as I have. Nay, only look at my disposition, is\r\nthat likely to show ingratitude to anyone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall see when the government\r\ncomes; and I seem to see it already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then begged the bachelor, if he were a poet, to do him the favour of\r\ncomposing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to take\r\nof his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and to see that a letter of her name\r\nwas placed at the beginning of each line, so that, at the end of the\r\nverses, \xe2\x80\x9cDulcinea del Toboso\xe2\x80\x9d might be read by putting together the\r\nfirst letters. The bachelor replied that although he was not one of the\r\nfamous poets of Spain, who were, they said, only three and a half, he\r\nwould not fail to compose the required verses; though he saw a great\r\ndifficulty in the task, as the letters which made up the name were\r\nseventeen; so, if he made four ballad stanzas of four lines each, there\r\nwould be a letter over, and if he made them of five, what they called\r\ndecimas or redondillas, there were three letters short; nevertheless he\r\nwould try to drop a letter as well as he could, so that the name\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDulcinea del Toboso\xe2\x80\x9d might be got into four ballad stanzas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be, by some means or other,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor unless the\r\nname stands there plain and manifest, no woman would believe the verses\r\nwere made for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey agreed upon this, and that the departure should take place in\r\nthree days from that time. Don Quixote charged the bachelor to keep it\r\na secret, especially from the curate and Master Nicholas, and from his\r\nniece and the housekeeper, lest they should prevent the execution of\r\nhis praiseworthy and valiant purpose. Carrasco promised all, and then\r\ntook his leave, charging Don Quixote to inform him of his good or evil\r\nfortunes whenever he had an opportunity; and thus they bade each other\r\nfarewell, and Sancho went away to make the necessary preparations for\r\ntheir expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np04e.jpg (55K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nOF THE SHREWD AND DROLL CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN SANCHO PANZA\r\nAND HIS WIFE TERESA PANZA, AND OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF BEING DULY\r\nRECORDED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np05a.jpg (129K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe translator of this history, when he comes to write this fifth\r\nchapter, says that he considers it apocryphal, because in it Sancho\r\nPanza speaks in a style unlike that which might have been expected from\r\nhis limited intelligence, and says things so subtle that he does not\r\nthink it possible he could have conceived them; however, desirous of\r\ndoing what his task imposed upon him, he was unwilling to leave it\r\nuntranslated, and therefore he went on to say:\r\n\r\nSancho came home in such glee and spirits that his wife noticed his\r\nhappiness a bowshot off, so much so that it made her ask him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nhave you got, Sancho friend, that you are so glad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWife, if it were God\xe2\x80\x99s will, I should be very\r\nglad not to be so well pleased as I show myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\r\nmean by saying you would be glad, if it were God\xe2\x80\x99s will, not to be well\r\npleased; for, fool as I am, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how one can find pleasure in\r\nnot having it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark ye, Teresa,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad because I have made up my\r\nmind to go back to the service of my master Don Quixote, who means to\r\ngo out a third time to seek for adventures; and I am going with him\r\nagain, for my necessities will have it so, and also the hope that\r\ncheers me with the thought that I may find another hundred crowns like\r\nthose we have spent; though it makes me sad to have to leave thee and\r\nthe children; and if God would be pleased to let me have my daily\r\nbread, dry-shod and at home, without taking me out into the byways and\r\ncross-roads\xe2\x80\x94and he could do it at small cost by merely willing it\xe2\x80\x94it is\r\nclear my happiness would be more solid and lasting, for the happiness I\r\nhave is mingled with sorrow at leaving thee; so that I was right in\r\nsaying I would be glad, if it were God\xe2\x80\x99s will, not to be well pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa; \xe2\x80\x9cever since you joined on to a\r\nknight-errant you talk in such a roundabout way that there is no\r\nunderstanding you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough that God understands me, wife,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor he\r\nis the understander of all things; that will do; but mind, sister, you\r\nmust look to Dapple carefully for the next three days, so that he may\r\nbe fit to take arms; double his feed, and see to the pack-saddle and\r\nother harness, for it is not to a wedding we are bound, but to go round\r\nthe world, and play at give and take with giants and dragons and\r\nmonsters, and hear hissings and roarings and bellowings and howlings;\r\nand even all this would be lavender, if we had not to reckon with\r\nYanguesans and enchanted Moors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know well enough, husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa, \xe2\x80\x9cthat squires-errant don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neat their bread for nothing, and so I will be always praying to our\r\nLord to deliver you speedily from all that hard fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you, wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif I did not expect to see myself\r\ngovernor of an island before long, I would drop down dead on the spot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, then, husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa; \xe2\x80\x9clet the hen live, though it be with\r\nher pip, live, and let the devil take all the governments in the world;\r\nyou came out of your mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb without a government, you have lived\r\nuntil now without a government, and when it is God\xe2\x80\x99s will you will go,\r\nor be carried, to your grave without a government. How many there are\r\nin the world who live without a government, and continue to live all\r\nthe same, and are reckoned in the number of the people. The best sauce\r\nin the world is hunger, and as the poor are never without that, they\r\nalways eat with a relish. But mind, Sancho, if by good luck you should\r\nfind yourself with some government, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget me and your children.\r\nRemember that Sanchico is now full fifteen, and it is right he should\r\ngo to school, if his uncle the abbot has a mind to have him trained for\r\nthe Church. Consider, too, that your daughter Mari-Sancha will not die\r\nof grief if we marry her; for I have my suspicions that she is as eager\r\nto get a husband as you to get a government; and, after all, a daughter\r\nlooks better ill married than well whored.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my faith,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif God brings me to get any sort of a\r\ngovernment, I intend, wife, to make such a high match for Mari-Sancha\r\nthat there will be no approaching her without calling her \xe2\x80\x98my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Teresa; \xe2\x80\x9cmarry her to her equal, that is the\r\nsafest plan; for if you put her out of wooden clogs into high-heeled\r\nshoes, out of her grey flannel petticoat into hoops and silk gowns, out\r\nof the plain \xe2\x80\x98Marica\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98thou,\xe2\x80\x99 into \xe2\x80\x98Do\xc3\xb1a So-and-so\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98my lady,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe girl won\xe2\x80\x99t know where she is, and at every turn she will fall into\r\na thousand blunders that will show the thread of her coarse homespun\r\nstuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut, you fool,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cit will be only to practise it for two\r\nor three years; and then dignity and decorum will fit her as easily as\r\na glove; and if not, what matter? Let her be \xe2\x80\x98my lady,\xe2\x80\x99 and never mind\r\nwhat happens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep to your own station, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Teresa; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t try to raise\r\nyourself higher, and bear in mind the proverb that says, \xe2\x80\x98wipe the nose\r\nof your neigbbour\xe2\x80\x99s son, and take him into your house.\xe2\x80\x99 A fine thing it\r\nwould be, indeed, to marry our Maria to some great count or grand\r\ngentleman, who, when the humour took him, would abuse her and call her\r\nclown-bred and clodhopper\xe2\x80\x99s daughter and spinning wench. I have not\r\nbeen bringing up my daughter for that all this time, I can tell you,\r\nhusband. Do you bring home money, Sancho, and leave marrying her to my\r\ncare; there is Lope Tocho, Juan Tocho\xe2\x80\x99s son, a stout, sturdy young\r\nfellow that we know, and I can see he does not look sour at the girl;\r\nand with him, one of our own sort, she will be well married, and we\r\nshall have her always under our eyes, and be all one family, parents\r\nand children, grandchildren and sons-in-law, and the peace and blessing\r\nof God will dwell among us; so don\xe2\x80\x99t you go marrying her in those\r\ncourts and grand palaces where they won\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make of her, or\r\nshe what to make of herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you idiot and wife for Barabbas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you mean\r\nby trying, without why or wherefore, to keep me from marrying my\r\ndaughter to one who will give me grandchildren that will be called\r\n\xe2\x80\x98your lordship\xe2\x80\x99? Look ye, Teresa, I have always heard my elders say\r\nthat he who does not know how to take advantage of luck when it comes\r\nto him, has no right to complain if it gives him the go-by; and now\r\nthat it is knocking at our door, it will not do to shut it out; let us\r\ngo with the favouring breeze that blows upon us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is this sort of talk, and what Sancho says lower down, that made the\r\ntranslator of the history say he considered this chapter apocryphal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see, you animal,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it will be well\r\nfor me to drop into some profitable government that will lift us out of\r\nthe mire, and marry Mari-Sancha to whom I like; and you yourself will\r\nfind yourself called \xe2\x80\x98Do\xc3\xb1a Teresa Panza,\xe2\x80\x99 and sitting in church on a\r\nfine carpet and cushions and draperies, in spite and in defiance of all\r\nthe born ladies of the town? No, stay as you are, growing neither\r\ngreater nor less, like a tapestry figure\xe2\x80\x94Let us say no more about it,\r\nfor Sanchica shall be a countess, say what you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of all you say, husband?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Teresa. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, for all\r\nthat, I am afraid this rank of countess for my daughter will be her\r\nruin. You do as you like, make a duchess or a princess of her, but I\r\ncan tell you it will not be with my will and consent. I was always a\r\nlover of equality, brother, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see people give\r\nthemselves airs without any right. They called me Teresa at my baptism,\r\na plain, simple name, without any additions or tags or fringes of Dons\r\nor Do\xc3\xb1as; Cascajo was my father\xe2\x80\x99s name, and as I am your wife, I am\r\ncalled Teresa Panza, though by right I ought to be called Teresa\r\nCascajo; but \xe2\x80\x98kings go where laws like,\xe2\x80\x99 and I am content with this\r\nname without having the \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99 put on top of it to make it so heavy that\r\nI cannot carry it; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make people talk about me when\r\nthey see me go dressed like a countess or governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife; for they\r\nwill say at once, \xe2\x80\x98See what airs the slut gives herself! Only yesterday\r\nshe was always spinning flax, and used to go to mass with the tail of\r\nher petticoat over her head instead of a mantle, and there she goes\r\nto-day in a hooped gown with her broaches and airs, as if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow her!\xe2\x80\x99 If God keeps me in my seven senses, or five, or whatever\r\nnumber I have, I am not going to bring myself to such a pass; go you,\r\nbrother, and be a government or an island man, and swagger as much as\r\nyou like; for by the soul of my mother, neither my daughter nor I are\r\ngoing to stir a step from our village; a respectable woman should have\r\na broken leg and keep at home; and to be busy at something is a\r\nvirtuous damsel\xe2\x80\x99s holiday; be off to your adventures along with your\r\nDon Quixote, and leave us to our misadventures, for God will mend them\r\nfor us according as we deserve it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, who fixed\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99 to him, what neither his father nor grandfather ever had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare thou hast a devil of some sort in thy body!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod help thee, what a lot of things thou hast strung together, one\r\nafter the other, without head or tail! What have Cascajo, and the\r\nbroaches and the proverbs and the airs, to do with what I say? Look\r\nhere, fool and dolt (for so I may call you, when you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nmy words, and run away from good fortune), if I had said that my\r\ndaughter was to throw herself down from a tower, or go roaming the\r\nworld, as the Infanta Do\xc3\xb1a Urraca wanted to do, you would be right in\r\nnot giving way to my will; but if in an instant, in less than the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, I put the \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98my lady\xe2\x80\x99 on her back, and\r\ntake her out of the stubble, and place her under a canopy, on a dais,\r\nand on a couch, with more velvet cushions than all the Almohades of\r\nMorocco ever had in their family, why won\xe2\x80\x99t you consent and fall in\r\nwith my wishes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know why, husband?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Teresa; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the proverb\r\nthat says \xe2\x80\x98who covers thee, discovers thee.\xe2\x80\x99 At the poor man people\r\nonly throw a hasty glance; on the rich man they fix their eyes; and if\r\nthe said rich man was once on a time poor, it is then there is the\r\nsneering and the tattle and spite of backbiters; and in the streets\r\nhere they swarm as thick as bees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Teresa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand listen to what I am now going to\r\nsay to you; maybe you never heard it in all your life; and I do not\r\ngive my own notions, for what I am about to say are the opinions of his\r\nreverence the preacher, who preached in this town last Lent, and who\r\nsaid, if I remember rightly, that all things present that our eyes\r\nbehold, bring themselves before us, and remain and fix themselves on\r\nour memory much better and more forcibly than things past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese observations which Sancho makes here are the other ones on\r\naccount of which the translator says he regards this chapter as\r\napocryphal, inasmuch as they are beyond Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s capacity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhence it arises,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when we see any person well\r\ndressed and making a figure with rich garments and retinue of servants,\r\nit seems to lead and impel us perforce to respect him, though memory\r\nmay at the same moment recall to us some lowly condition in which we\r\nhave seen him, but which, whether it may have been poverty or low\r\nbirth, being now a thing of the past, has no existence; while the only\r\nthing that has any existence is what we see before us; and if this\r\nperson whom fortune has raised from his original lowly state (these\r\nwere the very words the padre used) to his present height of\r\nprosperity, be well bred, generous, courteous to all, without seeking\r\nto vie with those whose nobility is of ancient date, depend upon it,\r\nTeresa, no one will remember what he was, and everyone will respect\r\nwhat he is, except indeed the envious, from whom no fair fortune is\r\nsafe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand you, husband,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Teresa; \xe2\x80\x9cdo as you like,\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t break my head with any more speechifying and rethoric; and if\r\nyou have revolved to do what you say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cResolved, you should say, woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cnot revolved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t set yourself to wrangle with me, husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa; \xe2\x80\x9cI speak\r\nas God pleases, and don\xe2\x80\x99t deal in out-of-the-way phrases; and I say if\r\nyou are bent upon having a government, take your son Sancho with you,\r\nand teach him from this time on how to hold a government; for sons\r\nought to inherit and learn the trades of their fathers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I have the government,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI will send for him\r\nby post, and I will send thee money, of which I shall have no lack, for\r\nthere is never any want of people to lend it to governors when they\r\nhave not got it; and do thou dress him so as to hide what he is and\r\nmake him look what he is to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou send the money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll dress him up for you as\r\nfine as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we are agreed that our daughter is to be a countess,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day that I see her a countess,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Teresa, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be the\r\nsame to me as if I was burying her; but once more I say do as you\r\nplease, for we women are born to this burden of being obedient to our\r\nhusbands, though they be dogs;\xe2\x80\x9d and with this she began to weep in\r\nearnest, as if she already saw Sanchica dead and buried.\r\n\r\nSancho consoled her by saying that though he must make her a countess,\r\nhe would put it off as long as possible. Here their conversation came\r\nto an end, and Sancho went back to see Don Quixote, and make\r\narrangements for their departure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np05e.jpg (49K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nOF WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS NIECE AND HOUSEKEEPER;\r\nONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTERS IN THE WHOLE HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np06a.jpg (93K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Sancho Panza and his wife, Teresa Cascajo, held the above\r\nirrelevant conversation, Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s niece and housekeeper were not\r\nidle, for by a thousand signs they began to perceive that their uncle\r\nand master meant to give them the slip the third time, and once more\r\nbetake himself to his, for them, ill-errant chivalry. They strove by\r\nall the means in their power to divert him from such an unlucky scheme;\r\nbut it was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron.\r\nNevertheless, among many other representations made to him, the\r\nhousekeeper said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, master, if you do not keep still\r\nand stay quiet at home, and give over roaming mountains and valleys\r\nlike a troubled spirit, looking for what they say are called\r\nadventures, but what I call misfortunes, I shall have to make complaint\r\nto God and the king with loud supplication to send some remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat answer God will give to your\r\ncomplaints, housekeeper, I know not, nor what his Majesty will answer\r\neither; I only know that if I were king I should decline to answer the\r\nnumberless silly petitions they present every day; for one of the\r\ngreatest among the many troubles kings have is being obliged to listen\r\nto all and answer all, and therefore I should be sorry that any affairs\r\nof mine should worry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereupon the housekeeper said, \xe2\x80\x9cTell us, se\xc3\xb1or, at his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s court\r\nare there no knights?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand plenty of them; and it is right\r\nthere should be, to set off the dignity of the prince, and for the\r\ngreater glory of the king\xe2\x80\x99s majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen might not your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cbe one of those that, without\r\nstirring a step, serve their king and lord in his court?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecollect, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9call knights cannot be\r\ncourtiers, nor can all courtiers be knights-errant, nor need they be.\r\nThere must be all sorts in the world; and though we may be all knights,\r\nthere is a great difference between one and another; for the courtiers,\r\nwithout quitting their chambers, or the threshold of the court, range\r\nthe world over by looking at a map, without its costing them a\r\nfarthing, and without suffering heat or cold, hunger or thirst; but we,\r\nthe true knights-errant, measure the whole earth with our own feet,\r\nexposed to the sun, to the cold, to the air, to the inclemencies of\r\nheaven, by day and night, on foot and on horseback; nor do we only know\r\nenemies in pictures, but in their own real shapes; and at all risks and\r\non all occasions we attack them, without any regard to childish points\r\nor rules of single combat, whether one has or has not a shorter lance\r\nor sword, whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about\r\nhim, whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out, and\r\nother niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to\r\nman, that you know nothing about, but I do. And you must know besides,\r\nthat the true knight-errant, though he may see ten giants, that not\r\nonly touch the clouds with their heads but pierce them, and that go,\r\neach of them, on two tall towers by way of legs, and whose arms are\r\nlike the masts of mighty ships, and each eye like a great mill-wheel,\r\nand glowing brighter than a glass furnace, must not on any account be\r\ndismayed by them. On the contrary, he must attack and fall upon them\r\nwith a gallant bearing and a fearless heart, and, if possible, vanquish\r\nand destroy them, even though they have for armour the shells of a\r\ncertain fish, that they say are harder than diamonds, and in place of\r\nswords wield trenchant blades of Damascus steel, or clubs studded with\r\nspikes also of steel, such as I have more than once seen. All this I\r\nsay, housekeeper, that you may see the difference there is between the\r\none sort of knight and the other; and it would be well if there were no\r\nprince who did not set a higher value on this second, or more properly\r\nspeaking first, kind of knights-errant; for, as we read in their\r\nhistories, there have been some among them who have been the salvation,\r\nnot merely of one kingdom, but of many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d here exclaimed the niece, \xe2\x80\x9cremember that all this you are\r\nsaying about knights-errant is fable and fiction; and their histories,\r\nif indeed they were not burned, would deserve, each of them, to have a\r\nsambenito put on it, or some mark by which it might be known as\r\ninfamous and a corrupter of good manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the God that gives me life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif thou wert not my\r\nfull niece, being daughter of my own sister, I would inflict a\r\nchastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the\r\nworld should ring with. What! can it be that a young hussy that hardly\r\nknows how to handle a dozen lace-bobbins dares to wag her tongue and\r\ncriticise the histories of knights-errant? What would Se\xc3\xb1or Amadis say\r\nif he heard of such a thing? He, however, no doubt would forgive thee,\r\nfor he was the most humble-minded and courteous knight of his time, and\r\nmoreover a great protector of damsels; but some there are that might\r\nhave heard thee, and it would not have been well for thee in that case;\r\nfor they are not all courteous or mannerly; some are ill-conditioned\r\nscoundrels; nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman, that is\r\nso in all respects; some are gold, others pinchbeck, and all look like\r\ngentlemen, but not all can stand the touchstone of truth. There are men\r\nof low rank who strain themselves to bursting to pass for gentlemen,\r\nand high gentlemen who, one would fancy, were dying to pass for men of\r\nlow rank; the former raise themselves by their ambition or by their\r\nvirtues, the latter debase themselves by their lack of spirit or by\r\ntheir vices; and one has need of experience and discernment to\r\ndistinguish these two kinds of gentlemen, so much alike in name and so\r\ndifferent in conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the niece, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you should know so much,\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x94enough, if need be, to get up into a pulpit and go preach in the\r\nstreets\xe2\x80\x94and yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and a\r\nfolly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are\r\nold, strong when you are sickly, able to put straight what is crooked\r\nwhen you yourself are bent by age, and, above all, a caballero when you\r\nare not one; for though gentlefolk may be so, poor men are nothing of\r\nthe kind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a great deal of truth in what you say, niece,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don\r\nQuixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand I could tell you somewhat about birth that would astonish\r\nyou; but, not to mix up things human and divine, I refrain. Look you,\r\nmy dears, all the lineages in the world (attend to what I am saying)\r\ncan be reduced to four sorts, which are these: those that had humble\r\nbeginnings, and went on spreading and extending themselves until they\r\nattained surpassing greatness; those that had great beginnings and\r\nmaintained them, and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their\r\norigin; those, again, that from a great beginning have ended in a point\r\nlike a pyramid, having reduced and lessened their original greatness\r\ntill it has come to nought, like the point of a pyramid, which,\r\nrelatively to its base or foundation, is nothing; and then there are\r\nthose\xe2\x80\x94and it is they that are the most numerous\xe2\x80\x94that have had neither\r\nan illustrious beginning nor a remarkable mid-course, and so will have\r\nan end without a name, like an ordinary plebeian line. Of the first,\r\nthose that had an humble origin and rose to the greatness they still\r\npreserve, the Ottoman house may serve as an example, which from an\r\nhumble and lowly shepherd, its founder, has reached the height at which\r\nwe now see it. For examples of the second sort of lineage, that began\r\nwith greatness and maintains it still without adding to it, there are\r\nthe many princes who have inherited the dignity, and maintain\r\nthemselves in their inheritance, without increasing or diminishing it,\r\nkeeping peacefully within the limits of their states. Of those that\r\nbegan great and ended in a point, there are thousands of examples, for\r\nall the Pharaohs and Ptolemies of Egypt, the C\xc3\xa6sars of Rome, and the\r\nwhole herd (if I may apply such a word to them) of countless princes,\r\nmonarchs, lords, Medes, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and barbarians,\r\nall these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and come to\r\nnothing, they themselves as well as their founders, for it would be\r\nimpossible now to find one of their descendants, and, even should we\r\nfind one, it would be in some lowly and humble condition. Of plebeian\r\nlineages I have nothing to say, save that they merely serve to swell\r\nthe number of those that live, without any eminence to entitle them to\r\nany fame or praise beyond this. From all I have said I would have you\r\ngather, my poor innocents, that great is the confusion among lineages,\r\nand that only those are seen to be great and illustrious that show\r\nthemselves so by the virtue, wealth, and generosity of their\r\npossessors. I have said virtue, wealth, and generosity, because a great\r\nman who is vicious will be a great example of vice, and a rich man who\r\nis not generous will be merely a miserly beggar; for the possessor of\r\nwealth is not made happy by possessing it, but by spending it, and not\r\nby spending as he pleases, but by knowing how to spend it well. The\r\npoor gentleman has no way of showing that he is a gentleman but by\r\nvirtue, by being affable, well-bred, courteous, gentle-mannered, and\r\nkindly, not haughty, arrogant, or censorious, but above all by being\r\ncharitable; for by two maravedis given with a cheerful heart to the\r\npoor, he will show himself as generous as he who distributes alms with\r\nbell-ringing, and no one that perceives him to be endowed with the\r\nvirtues I have named, even though he know him not, will fail to\r\nrecognise and set him down as one of good blood; and it would be\r\nstrange were it not so; praise has ever been the reward of virtue, and\r\nthose who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation. There are\r\ntwo roads, my daughters, by which men may reach wealth and honours; one\r\nis that of letters, the other that of arms. I have more of arms than of\r\nletters in my composition, and, judging by my inclination to arms, was\r\nborn under the influence of the planet Mars. I am, therefore, in a\r\nmeasure constrained to follow that road, and by it I must travel in\r\nspite of all the world, and it will be labour in vain for you to urge\r\nme to resist what heaven wills, fate ordains, reason requires, and,\r\nabove all, my own inclination favours; for knowing as I do the\r\ncountless toils that are the accompaniments of knight-errantry, I know,\r\ntoo, the infinite blessings that are attained by it; I know that the\r\npath of virtue is very narrow, and the road of vice broad and spacious;\r\nI know their ends and goals are different, for the broad and easy road\r\nof vice ends in death, and the narrow and toilsome one of virtue in\r\nlife, and not transitory life, but in that which has no end; I know, as\r\nour great Castilian poet says, that-\r\n\r\nIt is by rugged paths like these they go\r\nThat scale the heights of immortality,\r\nUnreached by those that falter here below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoe is me!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the niece, \xe2\x80\x9cmy lord is a poet, too! He knows\r\neverything, and he can do everything; I will bet, if he chose to turn\r\nmason, he could make a house as easily as a cage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you, niece,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif these chivalrous\r\nthoughts did not engage all my faculties, there would be nothing that I\r\ncould not do, nor any sort of knickknack that would not come from my\r\nhands, particularly cages and tooth-picks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment there came a knocking at the door, and when they asked\r\nwho was there, Sancho Panza made answer that it was he. The instant the\r\nhousekeeper knew who it was, she ran to hide herself so as not to see\r\nhim; in such abhorrence did she hold him. The niece let him in, and his\r\nmaster Don Quixote came forward to receive him with open arms, and the\r\npair shut themselves up in his room, where they had another\r\nconversation not inferior to the previous one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np06e.jpg (19K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nOF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE, TOGETHER WITH OTHER\r\nVERY NOTABLE INCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np07a.jpg (140K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instant the housekeeper saw Sancho Panza shut himself in with her\r\nmaster, she guessed what they were about; and suspecting that the\r\nresult of the consultation would be a resolve to undertake a third\r\nsally, she seized her mantle, and in deep anxiety and distress, ran to\r\nfind the bachelor Samson Carrasco, as she thought that, being a\r\nwell-spoken man, and a new friend of her master\xe2\x80\x99s, he might be able to\r\npersuade him to give up any such crazy notion. She found him pacing the\r\npatio of his house, and, perspiring and flurried, she fell at his feet\r\nthe moment she saw him.\r\n\r\nCarrasco, seeing how distressed and overcome she was, said to her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this, mistress housekeeper? What has happened to you? One\r\nwould think you heart-broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, Se\xc3\xb1or Samson,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9conly that my master is breaking\r\nout, plainly breaking out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhereabouts is he breaking out, se\xc3\xb1ora?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Samson; \xe2\x80\x9chas any part\r\nof his body burst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is only breaking out at the door of his madness,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmean, dear se\xc3\xb1or bachelor, that he is going to break out again (and\r\nthis will be the third time) to hunt all over the world for what he\r\ncalls ventures, though I can\xe2\x80\x99t make out why he gives them that name.\r\nThe first time he was brought back to us slung across the back of an\r\nass, and belaboured all over; and the second time he came in an\r\nox-cart, shut up in a cage, in which he persuaded himself he was\r\nenchanted, and the poor creature was in such a state that the mother\r\nthat bore him would not have known him; lean, yellow, with his eyes\r\nsunk deep in the cells of his skull; so that to bring him round again,\r\never so little, cost me more than six hundred eggs, as God knows, and\r\nall the world, and my hens too, that won\xe2\x80\x99t let me tell a lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I can well believe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the bachelor, \xe2\x80\x9cfor they are so good\r\nand so fat, and so well-bred, that they would not say one thing for\r\nanother, though they were to burst for it. In short then, mistress\r\nhousekeeper, that is all, and there is nothing the matter, except what\r\nit is feared Don Quixote may do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the bachelor, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be uneasy, but go home in\r\npeace; get me ready something hot for breakfast, and while you are on\r\nthe way say the prayer of Santa Apollonia, that is if you know it; for\r\nI will come presently and you will see miracles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoe is me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the housekeeper, \xe2\x80\x9cis it the prayer of Santa\r\nApollonia you would have me say? That would do if it was the toothache\r\nmy master had; but it is in the brains, what he has got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what I am saying, mistress housekeeper; go, and don\xe2\x80\x99t set\r\nyourself to argue with me, for you know I am a bachelor of Salamanca,\r\nand one can\xe2\x80\x99t be more of a bachelor than that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Carrasco; and\r\nwith this the housekeeper retired, and the bachelor went to look for\r\nthe curate, and arrange with him what will be told in its proper place.\r\n\r\nWhile Don Quixote and Sancho were shut up together, they had a\r\ndiscussion which the history records with great precision and\r\nscrupulous exactness. Sancho said to his master, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, I have educed\r\nmy wife to let me go with your worship wherever you choose to take me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInduced, you should say, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cnot educed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce or twice, as well as I remember,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI have begged\r\nof your worship not to mend my words, if so be as you understand what I\r\nmean by them; and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand them to say \xe2\x80\x98Sancho,\xe2\x80\x99 or\r\n\xe2\x80\x98devil,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand thee; and if I don\xe2\x80\x99t make my meaning\r\nplain, then you may correct me, for I am so focile\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand thee, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote at once; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\r\nknow not what \xe2\x80\x98I am so focile\xe2\x80\x99 means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98So focile\xe2\x80\x99 means I am so much that way,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand thee still less now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to\r\nput it; I know no more, God help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, now I have hit it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthou wouldst say thou art\r\nso docile, tractable, and gentle that thou wilt take what I say to\r\nthee, and submit to what I teach thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would bet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat from the very first you understood\r\nme, and knew what I meant, but you wanted to put me out that you might\r\nhear me make another couple of dozen blunders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay be so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut to come to the point, what does\r\nTeresa say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeresa says,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should make sure with your\r\nworship, and \xe2\x80\x98let papers speak and beards be still,\xe2\x80\x99 for \xe2\x80\x98he who binds\r\ndoes not wrangle,\xe2\x80\x99 since one \xe2\x80\x98take\xe2\x80\x99 is better than two \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll give\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x99s;\xe2\x80\x99 and I say a woman\xe2\x80\x99s advice is no great thing, and he who won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake it is a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so say I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9ccontinue, Sancho my friend; go on;\r\nyou talk pearls to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, as your worship knows better\r\nthan I do, we are all of us liable to death, and to-day we are, and\r\nto-morrow we are not, and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep, and\r\nnobody can promise himself more hours of life in this world than God\r\nmay be pleased to give him; for death is deaf, and when it comes to\r\nknock at our life\xe2\x80\x99s door, it is always urgent, and neither prayers, nor\r\nstruggles, nor sceptres, nor mitres, can keep it back, as common talk\r\nand report say, and as they tell us from the pulpits every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that is very true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I cannot make out what\r\nthou art driving at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I am driving at,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cis that your worship settle some\r\nfixed wages for me, to be paid monthly while I am in your service, and\r\nthat the same be paid me out of your estate; for I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to stand\r\non rewards which either come late, or ill, or never at all; God help me\r\nwith my own. In short, I would like to know what I am to get, be it\r\nmuch or little; for the hen will lay on one egg, and many littles make\r\na much, and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost. To be\r\nsure, if it should happen (what I neither believe nor expect) that your\r\nworship were to give me that island you have promised me, I am not so\r\nungrateful nor so grasping but that I would be willing to have the\r\nrevenue of such island valued and stopped out of my wages in due\r\npromotion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSancho, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9csometimes proportion may be\r\nas good as promotion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet I ought to have said proportion, and\r\nnot promotion; but it is no matter, as your worship has understood me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so well understood,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have seen into\r\nthe depths of thy thoughts, and know the mark thou art shooting at with\r\nthe countless shafts of thy proverbs. Look here, Sancho, I would\r\nreadily fix thy wages if I had ever found any instance in the histories\r\nof the knights-errant to show or indicate, by the slightest hint, what\r\ntheir squires used to get monthly or yearly; but I have read all or the\r\nbest part of their histories, and I cannot remember reading of any\r\nknight-errant having assigned fixed wages to his squire; I only know\r\nthat they all served on reward, and that when they least expected it,\r\nif good luck attended their masters, they found themselves recompensed\r\nwith an island or something equivalent to it, or at the least they were\r\nleft with a title and lordship. If with these hopes and additional\r\ninducements you, Sancho, please to return to my service, well and good;\r\nbut to suppose that I am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usage\r\nof knight-errantry, is all nonsense. And so, my Sancho, get you back to\r\nyour house and explain my intentions to your Teresa, and if she likes\r\nand you like to be on reward with me, _bene quidem;_ if not, we remain\r\nfriends; for if the pigeon-house does not lack food, it will not lack\r\npigeons; and bear in mind, my son, that a good hope is better than a\r\nbad holding, and a good grievance better than a bad compensation. I\r\nspeak in this way, Sancho, to show you that I can shower down proverbs\r\njust as well as yourself; and in short, I mean to say, and I do say,\r\nthat if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like to come on reward with me, and run the same\r\nchance that I run, God be with you and make a saint of you; for I shall\r\nfind plenty of squires more obedient and painstaking, and not so\r\nthickheaded or talkative as you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Sancho heard his master\xe2\x80\x99s firm, resolute language, a cloud came\r\nover the sky with him and the wings of his heart drooped, for he had\r\nmade sure that his master would not go without him for all the wealth\r\nof the world; and as he stood there dumbfoundered and moody, Samson\r\nCarrasco came in with the housekeeper and niece, who were anxious to\r\nhear by what arguments he was about to dissuade their master from going\r\nto seek adventures. The arch wag Samson came forward, and embracing him\r\nas he had done before, said with a loud voice, \xe2\x80\x9cO flower of\r\nknight-errantry! O shining light of arms! O honour and mirror of the\r\nSpanish nation! may God Almighty in his infinite power grant that any\r\nperson or persons, who would impede or hinder thy third sally, may find\r\nno way out of the labyrinth of their schemes, nor ever accomplish what\r\nthey most desire!\xe2\x80\x9d And then, turning to the housekeeper, he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMistress housekeeper may just as well give over saying the prayer of\r\nSanta Apollonia, for I know it is the positive determination of the\r\nspheres that Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote shall proceed to put into execution his\r\nnew and lofty designs; and I should lay a heavy burden on my conscience\r\ndid I not urge and persuade this knight not to keep the might of his\r\nstrong arm and the virtue of his valiant spirit any longer curbed and\r\nchecked, for by his inactivity he is defrauding the world of the\r\nredress of wrongs, of the protection of orphans, of the honour of\r\nvirgins, of the aid of widows, and of the support of wives, and other\r\nmatters of this kind appertaining, belonging, proper and peculiar to\r\nthe order of knight-errantry. On, then, my lord Don Quixote, beautiful\r\nand brave, let your worship and highness set out to-day rather than\r\nto-morrow; and if anything be needed for the execution of your purpose,\r\nhere am I ready in person and purse to supply the want; and were it\r\nrequisite to attend your magnificence as squire, I should esteem it the\r\nhappiest good fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this, Don Quixote, turning to Sancho, said, \xe2\x80\x9cDid I not tell thee,\r\nSancho, there would be squires enough and to spare for me? See now who\r\noffers to become one; no less than the illustrious bachelor Samson\r\nCarrasco, the perpetual joy and delight of the courts of the Salamancan\r\nschools, sound in body, discreet, patient under heat or cold, hunger or\r\nthirst, with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight-errant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsquire! But heaven forbid that, to gratify my own inclination, I should\r\nshake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences, and\r\ncut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts. Let this new\r\nSamson remain in his own country, and, bringing honour to it, bring\r\nhonour at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents; for\r\nI will be content with any squire that comes to hand, as Sancho does\r\nnot deign to accompany me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do deign,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nshall not be said of me, master mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98the bread eaten\r\nand the company dispersed.\xe2\x80\x99 Nay, I come of no ungrateful stock, for all\r\nthe world knows, but particularly my own town, who the Panzas from whom\r\nI am descended were; and, what is more, I know and have learned, by\r\nmany good words and deeds, your worship\xe2\x80\x99s desire to show me favour; and\r\nif I have been bargaining more or less about my wages, it was only to\r\nplease my wife, who, when she sets herself to press a point, no hammer\r\ndrives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants; but,\r\nafter all, a man must be a man, and a woman a woman; and as I am a man\r\nanyhow, which I can\xe2\x80\x99t deny, I will be one in my own house too, let who\r\nwill take it amiss; and so there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more to do but for your\r\nworship to make your will with its codicil in such a way that it can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe provoked, and let us set out at once, to save Se\xc3\xb1or Samson\xe2\x80\x99s soul\r\nfrom suffering, as he says his conscience obliges him to persuade your\r\nworship to sally out upon the world a third time; so I offer again to\r\nserve your worship faithfully and loyally, as well and better than all\r\nthe squires that served knights-errant in times past or present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bachelor was filled with amazement when he heard Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nphraseology and style of talk, for though he had read the first part of\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s history he never thought that he could be so droll as he\r\nwas there described; but now, hearing him talk of a \xe2\x80\x9cwill and codicil\r\nthat could not be provoked,\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cwill and codicil that could\r\nnot be revoked,\xe2\x80\x9d he believed all he had read of him, and set him down\r\nas one of the greatest simpletons of modern times; and he said to\r\nhimself that two such lunatics as master and man the world had never\r\nseen. In fine, Don Quixote and Sancho embraced one another and made\r\nfriends, and by the advice and with the approval of the great Carrasco,\r\nwho was now their oracle, it was arranged that their departure should\r\ntake place three days thence, by which time they could have all that\r\nwas requisite for the journey ready, and procure a closed helmet, which\r\nDon Quixote said he must by all means take. Samson offered him one, as\r\nhe knew a friend of his who had it would not refuse it to him, though\r\nit was more dingy with rust and mildew than bright and clean like\r\nburnished steel.\r\n\r\nThe curses which both housekeeper and niece poured out on the bachelor\r\nwere past counting; they tore their hair, they clawed their faces, and\r\nin the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion, they\r\nraised a lamentation over the departure of their master and uncle, as\r\nif it had been his death. Samson\xe2\x80\x99s intention in persuading him to sally\r\nforth once more was to do what the history relates farther on; all by\r\nthe advice of the curate and barber, with whom he had previously\r\ndiscussed the subject. Finally, then, during those three days, Don\r\nQuixote and Sancho provided themselves with what they considered\r\nnecessary, and Sancho having pacified his wife, and Don Quixote his\r\nniece and housekeeper, at nightfall, unseen by anyone except the\r\nbachelor, who thought fit to accompany them half a league out of the\r\nvillage, they set out for El Toboso, Don Quixote on his good Rocinante\r\nand Sancho on his old Dapple, his alforjas furnished with certain\r\nmatters in the way of victuals, and his purse with money that Don\r\nQuixote gave him to meet emergencies. Samson embraced him, and\r\nentreated him to let him hear of his good or evil fortunes, so that he\r\nmight rejoice over the former or condole with him over the latter, as\r\nthe laws of friendship required. Don Quixote promised him he would do\r\nso, and Samson returned to the village, and the other two took the road\r\nfor the great city of El Toboso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np07e.jpg (24K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nWHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE ON HIS WAY TO SEE HIS LADY\r\nDULCINEA DEL TOBOSO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np08a.jpg (65K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlessed be Allah the all-powerful!\xe2\x80\x9d says Hamete Benengeli on beginning\r\nthis eighth chapter; \xe2\x80\x9cblessed be Allah!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeats three times; and he\r\nsays he utters these thanksgivings at seeing that he has now got Don\r\nQuixote and Sancho fairly afield, and that the readers of his\r\ndelightful history may reckon that the achievements and humours of Don\r\nQuixote and his squire are now about to begin; and he urges them to\r\nforget the former chivalries of the ingenious gentleman and to fix\r\ntheir eyes on those that are to come, which now begin on the road to El\r\nToboso, as the others began on the plains of Montiel; nor is it much\r\nthat he asks in consideration of all he promises, and so he goes on to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\nDon Quixote and Sancho were left alone, and the moment Samson took his\r\ndeparture, Rocinante began to neigh, and Dapple to sigh, which, by both\r\nknight and squire, was accepted as a good sign and a very happy omen;\r\nthough, if the truth is to be told, the sighs and brays of Dapple were\r\nlouder than the neighings of the hack, from which Sancho inferred that\r\nhis good fortune was to exceed and overtop that of his master,\r\nbuilding, perhaps, upon some judicial astrology that he may have known,\r\nthough the history says nothing about it; all that can be said is, that\r\nwhen he stumbled or fell, he was heard to say he wished he had not come\r\nout, for by stumbling or falling there was nothing to be got but a\r\ndamaged shoe or a broken rib; and, fool as he was, he was not much\r\nastray in this.\r\n\r\nSaid Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho, my friend, night is drawing on upon us as we\r\ngo, and more darkly than will allow us to reach El Toboso by daylight;\r\nfor there I am resolved to go before I engage in another adventure, and\r\nthere I shall obtain the blessing and generous permission of the\r\npeerless Dulcinea, with which permission I expect and feel assured that\r\nI shall conclude and bring to a happy termination every perilous\r\nadventure; for nothing in life makes knights-errant more valorous than\r\nfinding themselves favoured by their ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np08b.jpg (283K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think it will be difficult for\r\nyour worship to speak with her or see her, at any rate where you will\r\nbe able to receive her blessing; unless, indeed, she throws it over the\r\nwall of the yard where I saw her the time before, when I took her the\r\nletter that told of the follies and mad things your worship was doing\r\nin the heart of Sierra Morena.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidst thou take that for a yard wall, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhere or at which thou sawest that never sufficiently extolled grace\r\nand beauty? It must have been the gallery, corridor, or portico of some\r\nrich and royal palace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might have been all that,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut to me it looked\r\nlike a wall, unless I am short of memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt all events, let us go there, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, so\r\nthat I see her, it is the same to me whether it be over a wall, or at a\r\nwindow, or through the chink of a door, or the grate of a garden; for\r\nany beam of the sun of her beauty that reaches my eyes will give light\r\nto my reason and strength to my heart, so that I shall be unmatched and\r\nunequalled in wisdom and valour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to tell the truth, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I saw that sun of\r\nthe lady Dulcinea del Toboso, it was not bright enough to throw out\r\nbeams at all; it must have been, that as her grace was sifting that\r\nwheat I told you of, the thick dust she raised came before her face\r\nlike a cloud and dimmed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! dost thou still persist, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cin saying,\r\nthinking, believing, and maintaining that my lady Dulcinea was sifting\r\nwheat, that being an occupation and task entirely at variance with what\r\nis and should be the employment of persons of distinction, who are\r\nconstituted and reserved for other avocations and pursuits that show\r\ntheir rank a bowshot off? Thou hast forgotten, O Sancho, those lines of\r\nour poet wherein he paints for us how, in their crystal abodes, those\r\nfour nymphs employed themselves who rose from their loved Tagus and\r\nseated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those tissues which\r\nthe ingenious poet there describes to us, how they were worked and\r\nwoven with gold and silk and pearls; and something of this sort must\r\nhave been the employment of my lady when thou sawest her, only that the\r\nspite which some wicked enchanter seems to have against everything of\r\nmine changes all those things that give me pleasure, and turns them\r\ninto shapes unlike their own; and so I fear that in that history of my\r\nachievements which they say is now in print, if haply its author was\r\nsome sage who is an enemy of mine, he will have put one thing for\r\nanother, mingling a thousand lies with one truth, and amusing himself\r\nby relating transactions which have nothing to do with the sequence of\r\na true history. O envy, root of all countless evils, and cankerworm of\r\nthe virtues! All the vices, Sancho, bring some kind of pleasure with\r\nthem; but envy brings nothing but irritation, bitterness, and rage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I say too,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand I suspect in that legend or\r\nhistory of us that the bachelor Samson Carrasco told us he saw, my\r\nhonour goes dragged in the dirt, knocked about, up and down, sweeping\r\nthe streets, as they say. And yet, on the faith of an honest man, I\r\nnever spoke ill of any enchanter, and I am not so well off that I am to\r\nbe envied; to be sure, I am rather sly, and I have a certain spice of\r\nthe rogue in me; but all is covered by the great cloak of my\r\nsimplicity, always natural and never acted; and if I had no other merit\r\nsave that I believe, as I always do, firmly and truly in God, and all\r\nthe holy Roman Catholic Church holds and believes, and that I am a\r\nmortal enemy of the Jews, the historians ought to have mercy on me and\r\ntreat me well in their writings. But let them say what they like; naked\r\nwas I born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor gain; nay, while I\r\nsee myself put into a book and passed on from hand to hand over the\r\nworld, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a fig, let them say what they like of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9creminds me of what happened to a\r\nfamous poet of our own day, who, having written a bitter satire against\r\nall the courtesan ladies, did not insert or name in it a certain lady\r\nof whom it was questionable whether she was one or not. She, seeing she\r\nwas not in the list of the poet, asked him what he had seen in her that\r\nhe did not include her in the number of the others, telling him he must\r\nadd to his satire and put her in the new part, or else look out for the\r\nconsequences. The poet did as she bade him, and left her without a\r\nshred of reputation, and she was satisfied by getting fame though it\r\nwas infamy. In keeping with this is what they relate of that shepherd\r\nwho set fire to the famous temple of Diana, by repute one of the seven\r\nwonders of the world, and burned it with the sole object of making his\r\nname live in after ages; and, though it was forbidden to name him, or\r\nmention his name by word of mouth or in writing, lest the object of his\r\nambition should be attained, nevertheless it became known that he was\r\ncalled Erostratus. And something of the same sort is what happened in\r\nthe case of the great emperor Charles V. and a gentleman in Rome. The\r\nemperor was anxious to see that famous temple of the Rotunda, called in\r\nancient times the temple \xe2\x80\x98of all the gods,\xe2\x80\x99 but now-a-days, by a better\r\nnomenclature, \xe2\x80\x98of all the saints,\xe2\x80\x99 which is the best preserved building\r\nof all those of pagan construction in Rome, and the one which best\r\nsustains the reputation of mighty works and magnificence of its\r\nfounders. It is in the form of a half orange, of enormous dimensions,\r\nand well lighted, though no light penetrates it save that which is\r\nadmitted by a window, or rather round skylight, at the top; and it was\r\nfrom this that the emperor examined the building. A Roman gentleman\r\nstood by his side and explained to him the skilful construction and\r\ningenuity of the vast fabric and its wonderful architecture, and when\r\nthey had left the skylight he said to the emperor, \xe2\x80\x98A thousand times,\r\nyour Sacred Majesty, the impulse came upon me to seize your Majesty in\r\nmy arms and fling myself down from yonder skylight, so as to leave\r\nbehind me in the world a name that would last for ever.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I am thankful\r\nto you for not carrying such an evil thought into effect,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nemperor, \xe2\x80\x98and I shall give you no opportunity in future of again\r\nputting your loyalty to the test; and I therefore forbid you ever to\r\nspeak to me or to be where I am; and he followed up these words by\r\nbestowing a liberal bounty upon him. My meaning is, Sancho, that the\r\ndesire of acquiring fame is a very powerful motive. What, thinkest\r\nthou, was it that flung Horatius in full armour down from the bridge\r\ninto the depths of the Tiber? What burned the hand and arm of Mutius?\r\nWhat impelled Curtius to plunge into the deep burning gulf that opened\r\nin the midst of Rome? What, in opposition to all the omens that\r\ndeclared against him, made Julius C\xc3\xa6sar cross the Rubicon? And to come\r\nto more modern examples, what scuttled the ships, and left stranded and\r\ncut off the gallant Spaniards under the command of the most courteous\r\nCort\xc3\xa9s in the New World? All these and a variety of other great\r\nexploits are, were and will be, the work of fame that mortals desire as\r\na reward and a portion of the immortality their famous deeds deserve;\r\nthough we Catholic Christians and knights-errant look more to that\r\nfuture glory that is everlasting in the ethereal regions of heaven than\r\nto the vanity of the fame that is to be acquired in this present\r\ntransitory life; a fame that, however long it may last, must after all\r\nend with the world itself, which has its own appointed end. So that, O\r\nSancho, in what we do we must not overpass the bounds which the\r\nChristian religion we profess has assigned to us. We have to slay pride\r\nin giants, envy by generosity and nobleness of heart, anger by calmness\r\nof demeanour and equanimity, gluttony and sloth by the spareness of our\r\ndiet and the length of our vigils, lust and lewdness by the loyalty we\r\npreserve to those whom we have made the mistresses of our thoughts,\r\nindolence by traversing the world in all directions seeking\r\nopportunities of making ourselves, besides Christians, famous knights.\r\nSuch, Sancho, are the means by which we reach those extremes of praise\r\nthat fair fame carries with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that your worship has said so far,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nunderstood quite well; but still I would be glad if your worship would\r\ndissolve a doubt for me, which has just this minute come into my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSolve, thou meanest, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9csay on, in God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname, and I will answer as well as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d Sancho went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cthose Julys or Augusts, and\r\nall those venturous knights that you say are now dead\xe2\x80\x94where are they\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe heathens,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9care, no doubt, in hell; the\r\nChristians, if they were good Christians, are either in purgatory or in\r\nheaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut now I want to know\xe2\x80\x94the tombs where the\r\nbodies of those great lords are, have they silver lamps before them, or\r\nare the walls of their chapels ornamented with crutches,\r\nwinding-sheets, tresses of hair, legs and eyes in wax? Or what are they\r\nornamented with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Don Quixote made answer: \xe2\x80\x9cThe tombs of the heathens were\r\ngenerally sumptuous temples; the ashes of Julius C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s body were\r\nplaced on the top of a stone pyramid of vast size, which they now call\r\nin Rome Saint Peter\xe2\x80\x99s needle. The emperor Hadrian had for a tomb a\r\ncastle as large as a good-sized village, which they called the _Moles\r\nAdriani_, and is now the castle of St. Angelo in Rome. The queen\r\nArtemisia buried her husband Mausolus in a tomb which was reckoned one\r\nof the seven wonders of the world; but none of these tombs, or of the\r\nmany others of the heathens, were ornamented with winding-sheets or any\r\nof those other offerings and tokens that show that they who are buried\r\nthere are saints.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the point I\xe2\x80\x99m coming to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand now tell me, which\r\nis the greater work, to bring a dead man to life or to kill a giant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe answer is easy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cit is a greater work to\r\nbring to life a dead man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I have got you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cin that case the fame of them who\r\nbring the dead to life, who give sight to the blind, cure cripples,\r\nrestore health to the sick, and before whose tombs there are lamps\r\nburning, and whose chapels are filled with devout folk on their knees\r\nadoring their relics be a better fame in this life and in the other\r\nthan that which all the heathen emperors and knights-errant that have\r\never been in the world have left or may leave behind them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I grant, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen this fame, these favours, these privileges, or whatever you call\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbelong to the bodies and relics of the saints who,\r\nwith the approbation and permission of our holy mother Church, have\r\nlamps, tapers, winding-sheets, crutches, pictures, eyes and legs, by\r\nmeans of which they increase devotion and add to their own Christian\r\nreputation. Kings carry the bodies or relics of saints on their\r\nshoulders, and kiss bits of their bones, and enrich and adorn their\r\noratories and favourite altars with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy meaning is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9clet us set about becoming saints, and we\r\nshall obtain more quickly the fair fame we are striving after; for you\r\nknow, se\xc3\xb1or, yesterday or the day before yesterday (for it is so lately\r\none may say so) they canonised and beatified two little barefoot\r\nfriars, and it is now reckoned the greatest good luck to kiss or touch\r\nthe iron chains with which they girt and tortured their bodies, and\r\nthey are held in greater veneration, so it is said, than the sword of\r\nRoland in the armoury of our lord the King, whom God preserve. So that,\r\nse\xc3\xb1or, it is better to be an humble little friar of no matter what\r\norder, than a valiant knight-errant; with God a couple of dozen of\r\npenance lashings are of more avail than two thousand lance-thrusts, be\r\nthey given to giants, or monsters, or dragons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that is true,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we cannot all be friars,\r\nand many are the ways by which God takes his own to heaven; chivalry is\r\na religion, there are sainted knights in glory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have heard say that there are more friars in\r\nheaven than knights-errant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cis because those in religious orders are\r\nmore numerous than knights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe errants are many,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut few they who deserve the name of\r\nknights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these, and other discussions of the same sort, they passed that\r\nnight and the following day, without anything worth mention happening\r\nto them, whereat Don Quixote was not a little dejected; but at length\r\nthe next day, at daybreak, they descried the great city of El Toboso,\r\nat the sight of which Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s spirits rose and Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s fell, for\r\nhe did not know Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s house, nor in all his life had he ever seen\r\nher, any more than his master; so that they were both uneasy, the one\r\nto see her, the other at not having seen her, and Sancho was at a loss\r\nto know what he was to do when his master sent him to El Toboso. In the\r\nend, Don Quixote made up his mind to enter the city at nightfall, and\r\nthey waited until the time came among some oak trees that were near El\r\nToboso; and when the moment they had agreed upon arrived, they made\r\ntheir entrance into the city, where something happened them that may\r\nfairly be called something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np08e.jpg (49K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nWHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT WILL BE SEEN THERE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np09a.jpg (79K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas at the very midnight hour\xe2\x80\x94more or less\xe2\x80\x94when Don Quixote and\r\nSancho quitted the wood and entered El Toboso. The town was in deep\r\nsilence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the\r\nbroad of their backs, as the saying is. The night was darkish, though\r\nSancho would have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find in\r\nthe darkness an excuse for his blundering. All over the place nothing\r\nwas to be heard except the barking of dogs, which deafened the ears of\r\nDon Quixote and troubled the heart of Sancho. Now and then an ass\r\nbrayed, pigs grunted, cats mewed, and the various noises they made\r\nseemed louder in the silence of the night; all which the enamoured\r\nknight took to be of evil omen; nevertheless he said to Sancho,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSancho, my son, lead on to the palace of Dulcinea, it may be that we\r\nshall find her awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBody of the sun! what palace am I to lead to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen what\r\nI saw her highness in was only a very little house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost likely she had then withdrawn into some small apartment of her\r\npalace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cto amuse herself with damsels, as great\r\nladies and princesses are accustomed to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif your worship will have it in spite of me that\r\nthe house of my lady Dulcinea is a palace, is this an hour, think you,\r\nto find the door open; and will it be right for us to go knocking till\r\nthey hear us and open the door; making a disturbance and confusion all\r\nthrough the household? Are we going, do you fancy, to the house of our\r\nwenches, like gallants who come and knock and go in at any hour,\r\nhowever late it may be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us first of all find out the palace for certain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don\r\nQuixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand then I will tell thee, Sancho, what we had best do; but\r\nlook, Sancho, for either I see badly, or that dark mass that one sees\r\nfrom here should be Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s palace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let your worship lead the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps it may be\r\nso; though I see it with my eyes and touch it with my hands, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbelieve it as much as I believe it is daylight now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote took the lead, and having gone a matter of two hundred\r\npaces he came upon the mass that produced the shade, and found it was a\r\ngreat tower, and then he perceived that the building in question was no\r\npalace, but the chief church of the town, and said he, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the church\r\nwe have lit upon, Sancho.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand God grant we may not light upon our\r\ngraves; it is no good sign to find oneself wandering in a graveyard at\r\nthis time of night; and that, after my telling your worship, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmistake, that the house of this lady will be in an alley without an\r\noutlet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe curse of God on thee for a blockhead!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\r\nhast thou ever heard of castles and royal palaces being built in alleys\r\nwithout an outlet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cevery country has a way of its own; perhaps\r\nhere in El Toboso it is the way to build palaces and grand buildings in\r\nalleys; so I entreat your worship to let me search about among these\r\nstreets or alleys before me, and perhaps, in some corner or other, I\r\nmay stumble on this palace\xe2\x80\x94and I wish I saw the dogs eating it for\r\nleading us such a dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak respectfully of what belongs to my lady, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote; \xe2\x80\x9clet us keep the feast in peace, and not throw the rope after\r\nthe bucket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll hold my tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut how am I to take it patiently\r\nwhen your worship wants me, with only once seeing the house of our\r\nmistress, to know always, and find it in the middle of the night, when\r\nyour worship can\xe2\x80\x99t find it, who must have seen it thousands of times?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt drive me to desperation, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cLook\r\nhere, heretic, have I not told thee a thousand times that I have never\r\nonce in my life seen the peerless Dulcinea or crossed the threshold of\r\nher palace, and that I am enamoured solely by hearsay and by the great\r\nreputation she bears for beauty and discretion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear it now,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand I may tell you that if you have\r\nnot seen her, no more have I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat cannot be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor, at any rate, thou saidst, on\r\nbringing back the answer to the letter I sent by thee, that thou sawest\r\nher sifting wheat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind that, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI must tell you that my seeing\r\nher and the answer I brought you back were by hearsay too, for I can no\r\nmore tell who the lady Dulcinea is than I can hit the sky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSancho, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are times for jests and\r\ntimes when jests are out of place; if I tell thee that I have neither\r\nseen nor spoken to the lady of my heart, it is no reason why thou\r\nshouldst say thou hast not spoken to her or seen her, when the contrary\r\nis the case, as thou well knowest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the two were engaged in this conversation, they perceived someone\r\nwith a pair of mules approaching the spot where they stood, and from\r\nthe noise the plough made, as it dragged along the ground, they guessed\r\nhim to be some labourer who had got up before daybreak to go to his\r\nwork, and so it proved to be. He came along singing the ballad that\r\nsays-\r\n\r\nIll did ye fare, ye men of France,\r\nIn Roncesvalles chase-\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I die, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, when he heard him, \xe2\x80\x9cif any good\r\nwill come to us to-night! Dost thou not hear what that clown is\r\nsinging?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what has Roncesvalles chase to do with what\r\nwe have in hand? He might just as well be singing the ballad of\r\nCalainos, for any good or ill that can come to us in our business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time the labourer had come up, and Don Quixote asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cCan\r\nyou tell me, worthy friend, and God speed you, whereabouts here is the\r\npalace of the peerless princess Do\xc3\xb1a Dulcinea del Toboso?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lad, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a stranger, and I have been only a few\r\ndays in the town, doing farm work for a rich farmer. In that house\r\nopposite there live the curate of the village and the sacristan, and\r\nboth or either of them will be able to give your worship some account\r\nof this lady princess, for they have a list of all the people of El\r\nToboso; though it is my belief there is not a princess living in the\r\nwhole of it; many ladies there are, of quality, and in her own house\r\neach of them may be a princess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, she I am inquiring for will be one of these, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay be so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lad; \xe2\x80\x9cGod be with you, for here comes the\r\ndaylight;\xe2\x80\x9d and without waiting for any more of his questions, he\r\nwhipped on his mules.\r\n\r\nSancho, seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied, said to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, daylight will be here before long, and it will not do for\r\nus to let the sun find us in the street; it will be better for us to\r\nquit the city, and for your worship to hide in some forest in the\r\nneighbourhood, and I will come back in the daytime, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t leave a\r\nnook or corner of the whole village that I won\xe2\x80\x99t search for the house,\r\ncastle, or palace, of my lady, and it will be hard luck for me if I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t find it; and as soon as I have found it I will speak to her\r\ngrace, and tell her where and how your worship is waiting for her to\r\narrange some plan for you to see her without any damage to her honour\r\nand reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast delivered a thousand sentences\r\ncondensed in the compass of a few words; I thank thee for the advice\r\nthou hast given me, and take it most gladly. Come, my son, let us go\r\nlook for some place where I may hide, while thou dost return, as thou\r\nsayest, to seek, and speak with my lady, from whose discretion and\r\ncourtesy I look for favours more than miraculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho was in a fever to get his master out of the town, lest he should\r\ndiscover the falsehood of the reply he had brought to him in the Sierra\r\nMorena on behalf of Dulcinea; so he hastened their departure, which\r\nthey took at once, and two miles out of the village they found a forest\r\nor thicket wherein Don Quixote ensconced himself, while Sancho returned\r\nto the city to speak to Dulcinea, in which embassy things befell him\r\nwhich demand fresh attention and a new chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np09e.jpg (34K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE CRAFTY DEVICE SANCHO ADOPTED TO ENCHANT THE LADY\r\nDULCINEA, AND OTHER INCIDENTS AS LUDICROUS AS THEY ARE TRUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np10a.jpg (142K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the author of this great history comes to relate what is set down\r\nin this chapter he says he would have preferred to pass it over in\r\nsilence, fearing it would not be believed, because here Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmadness reaches the confines of the greatest that can be conceived, and\r\neven goes a couple of bowshots beyond the greatest. But after all,\r\nthough still under the same fear and apprehension, he has recorded it\r\nwithout adding to the story or leaving out a particle of the truth, and\r\nentirely disregarding the charges of falsehood that might be brought\r\nagainst him; and he was right, for the truth may run fine but will not\r\nbreak, and always rises above falsehood as oil above water; and so,\r\ngoing on with his story, he says that as soon as Don Quixote had\r\nensconced himself in the forest, oak grove, or wood near El Toboso, he\r\nbade Sancho return to the city, and not come into his presence again\r\nwithout having first spoken on his behalf to his lady, and begged of\r\nher that it might be her good pleasure to permit herself to be seen by\r\nher enslaved knight, and deign to bestow her blessing upon him, so that\r\nhe might thereby hope for a happy issue in all his encounters and\r\ndifficult enterprises. Sancho undertook to execute the task according\r\nto the instructions, and to bring back an answer as good as the one he\r\nbrought back before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand be not dazed when thou findest\r\nthyself exposed to the light of that sun of beauty thou art going to\r\nseek. Happy thou, above all the squires in the world! Bear in mind, and\r\nlet it not escape thy memory, how she receives thee; if she changes\r\ncolour while thou art giving her my message; if she is agitated and\r\ndisturbed at hearing my name; if she cannot rest upon her cushion,\r\nshouldst thou haply find her seated in the sumptuous state chamber\r\nproper to her rank; and should she be standing, observe if she poises\r\nherself now on one foot, now on the other; if she repeats two or three\r\ntimes the reply she gives thee; if she passes from gentleness to\r\nausterity, from asperity to tenderness; if she raises her hand to\r\nsmooth her hair though it be not disarranged. In short, my son, observe\r\nall her actions and motions, for if thou wilt report them to me as they\r\nwere, I will gather what she hides in the recesses of her heart as\r\nregards my love; for I would have thee know, Sancho, if thou knowest it\r\nnot, that with lovers the outward actions and motions they give way to\r\nwhen their loves are in question are the faithful messengers that carry\r\nthe news of what is going on in the depths of their hearts. Go, my\r\nfriend, may better fortune than mine attend thee, and bring thee a\r\nhappier issue than that which I await in dread in this dreary\r\nsolitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go and return quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9ccheer up that little\r\nheart of yours, master mine, for at the present moment you seem to have\r\ngot one no bigger than a hazel nut; remember what they say, that a\r\nstout heart breaks bad luck, and that where there are no fletches there\r\nare no pegs; and moreover they say, the hare jumps up where it\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nlooked for. I say this because, if we could not find my lady\xe2\x80\x99s palaces\r\nor castles to-night, now that it is daylight I count upon finding them\r\nwhen I least expect it, and once found, leave it to me to manage her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerily, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthou dost always bring in thy\r\nproverbs happily, whatever we deal with; may God give me better luck in\r\nwhat I am anxious about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this, Sancho wheeled about and gave Dapple the stick, and Don\r\nQuixote remained behind, seated on his horse, resting in his stirrups\r\nand leaning on the end of his lance, filled with sad and troubled\r\nforebodings; and there we will leave him, and accompany Sancho, who\r\nwent off no less serious and troubled than he left his master; so much\r\nso, that as soon as he had got out of the thicket, and looking round\r\nsaw that Don Quixote was not within sight, he dismounted from his ass,\r\nand seating himself at the foot of a tree began to commune with\r\nhimself, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, brother Sancho, let us know where your worship\r\nis going. Are you going to look for some ass that has been lost? Not at\r\nall. Then what are you going to look for? I am going to look for a\r\nprincess, that\xe2\x80\x99s all; and in her for the sun of beauty and the whole\r\nheaven at once. And where do you expect to find all this, Sancho?\r\nWhere? Why, in the great city of El Toboso. Well, and for whom are you\r\ngoing to look for her? For the famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha,\r\nwho rights wrongs, gives food to those who thirst and drink to the\r\nhungry. That\xe2\x80\x99s all very well, but do you know her house, Sancho? My\r\nmaster says it will be some royal palace or grand castle. And have you\r\never seen her by any chance? Neither I nor my master ever saw her. And\r\ndoes it strike you that it would be just and right if the El Toboso\r\npeople, finding out that you were here with the intention of going to\r\ntamper with their princesses and trouble their ladies, were to come and\r\ncudgel your ribs, and not leave a whole bone in you? They would,\r\nindeed, have very good reason, if they did not see that I am under\r\norders, and that \xe2\x80\x98you are a messenger, my friend, no blame belongs to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you trust to that, Sancho, for the Manchegan folk are as\r\nhot-tempered as they are honest, and won\xe2\x80\x99t put up with liberties from\r\nanybody. By the Lord, if they get scent of you, it will be worse for\r\nyou, I promise you. Be off, you scoundrel! Let the bolt fall. Why\r\nshould I go looking for three feet on a cat, to please another man; and\r\nwhat is more, when looking for Dulcinea will be looking for Marica in\r\nRavena, or the bachelor in Salamanca? The devil, the devil and nobody\r\nelse, has mixed me up in this business!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the soliloquy Sancho held with himself, and all the conclusion\r\nhe could come to was to say to himself again, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s remedy for\r\neverything except death, under whose yoke we have all to pass, whether\r\nwe like it or not, when life\xe2\x80\x99s finished. I have seen by a thousand\r\nsigns that this master of mine is a madman fit to be tied, and for that\r\nmatter, I too, am not behind him; for I\xe2\x80\x99m a greater fool than he is\r\nwhen I follow him and serve him, if there\xe2\x80\x99s any truth in the proverb\r\nthat says, \xe2\x80\x98Tell me what company thou keepest, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell thee what\r\nthou art,\xe2\x80\x99 or in that other, \xe2\x80\x98Not with whom thou art bred, but with\r\nwhom thou art fed.\xe2\x80\x99 Well then, if he be mad, as he is, and with a\r\nmadness that mostly takes one thing for another, and white for black,\r\nand black for white, as was seen when he said the windmills were\r\ngiants, and the monks\xe2\x80\x99 mules dromedaries, flocks of sheep armies of\r\nenemies, and much more to the same tune, it will not be very hard to\r\nmake him believe that some country girl, the first I come across here,\r\nis the lady Dulcinea; and if he does not believe it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear it; and\r\nif he should swear, I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear again; and if he persists I\xe2\x80\x99ll persist\r\nstill more, so as, come what may, to have my quoit always over the peg.\r\nMaybe, by holding out in this way, I may put a stop to his sending me\r\non messages of this kind another time; or maybe he will think, as I\r\nsuspect he will, that one of those wicked enchanters, who he says have\r\na spite against him, has changed her form for the sake of doing him an\r\nill turn and injuring him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this reflection Sancho made his mind easy, counting the business\r\nas good as settled, and stayed there till the afternoon so as to make\r\nDon Quixote think he had time enough to go to El Toboso and return; and\r\nthings turned out so luckily for him that as he got up to mount Dapple,\r\nhe spied, coming from El Toboso towards the spot where he stood, three\r\npeasant girls on three colts, or fillies\xe2\x80\x94for the author does not make\r\nthe point clear, though it is more likely they were she-asses, the\r\nusual mount with village girls; but as it is of no great consequence,\r\nwe need not stop to prove it.\r\n\r\nTo be brief, the instant Sancho saw the peasant girls, he returned full\r\nspeed to seek his master, and found him sighing and uttering a thousand\r\npassionate lamentations. When Don Quixote saw him he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nnews, Sancho, my friend? Am I to mark this day with a white stone or a\r\nblack?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour worship,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9chad better mark it with ruddle, like\r\nthe inscriptions on the walls of class rooms, that those who see it may\r\nsee it plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen thou bringest good news,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo good,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your worship has only to spur\r\nRocinante and get out into the open field to see the lady Dulcinea del\r\nToboso, who, with two others, damsels of hers, is coming to see your\r\nworship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly God! what art thou saying, Sancho, my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Don\r\nQuixote. \xe2\x80\x9cTake care thou art not deceiving me, or seeking by false joy\r\nto cheer my real sadness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could I get by deceiving your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cespecially when it will so soon be shown whether I tell the truth or\r\nnot? Come, se\xc3\xb1or, push on, and you will see the princess our mistress\r\ncoming, robed and adorned\xe2\x80\x94in fact, like what she is. Her damsels and\r\nshe are all one glow of gold, all bunches of pearls, all diamonds, all\r\nrubies, all cloth of brocade of more than ten borders; with their hair\r\nloose on their shoulders like so many sunbeams playing with the wind;\r\nand moreover, they come mounted on three piebald cackneys, the finest\r\nsight ever you saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHackneys, you mean, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is not much difference between cackneys and hackneys,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut no matter what they come on, there they are, the finest\r\nladies one could wish for, especially my lady the princess Dulcinea,\r\nwho staggers one\xe2\x80\x99s senses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go, Sancho, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand in guerdon of this\r\nnews, as unexpected as it is good, I bestow upon thee the best spoil I\r\nshall win in the first adventure I may have; or if that does not\r\nsatisfy thee, I promise thee the foals I shall have this year from my\r\nthree mares that thou knowest are in foal on our village common.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take the foals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is not quite certain that\r\nthe spoils of the first adventure will be good ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time they had cleared the wood, and saw the three village\r\nlasses close at hand. Don Quixote looked all along the road to El\r\nToboso, and as he could see nobody except the three peasant girls, he\r\nwas completely puzzled, and asked Sancho if it was outside the city he\r\nhad left them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow outside the city?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cAre your worship\xe2\x80\x99s eyes in\r\nthe back of your head, that you can\xe2\x80\x99t see that they are these who are\r\ncoming here, shining like the very sun at noonday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see nothing, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut three country girls on\r\nthree jackasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, may God deliver me from the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand can it be\r\nthat your worship takes three hackneys\xe2\x80\x94or whatever they\xe2\x80\x99re called\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nwhite as the driven snow, for jackasses? By the Lord, I could tear my\r\nbeard if that was the case!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can only say, Sancho, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it\r\nis as plain they are jackasses\xe2\x80\x94or jennyasses\xe2\x80\x94as that I am Don Quixote,\r\nand thou Sancho Panza: at any rate, they seem to me to be so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t talk that way, but open your eyes,\r\nand come and pay your respects to the lady of your thoughts, who is\r\nclose upon us now;\xe2\x80\x9d and with these words he advanced to receive the\r\nthree village lasses, and dismounting from Dapple, caught hold of one\r\nof the asses of the three country girls by the halter, and dropping on\r\nboth knees on the ground, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cQueen and princess and duchess of\r\nbeauty, may it please your haughtiness and greatness to receive into\r\nyour favour and good-will your captive knight who stands there turned\r\ninto marble stone, and quite stupefied and benumbed at finding himself\r\nin your magnificent presence. I am Sancho Panza, his squire, and he the\r\nvagabond knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called \xe2\x80\x98The Knight\r\nof the Rueful Countenance.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote had by this time placed himself on his knees beside Sancho,\r\nand, with eyes starting out of his head and a puzzled gaze, was\r\nregarding her whom Sancho called queen and lady; and as he could see\r\nnothing in her except a village lass, and not a very well-favoured one,\r\nfor she was platter-faced and snub-nosed, he was perplexed and\r\nbewildered, and did not venture to open his lips. The country girls, at\r\nthe same time, were astonished to see these two men, so different in\r\nappearance, on their knees, preventing their companion from going on.\r\nShe, however, who had been stopped, breaking silence, said angrily and\r\ntestily, \xe2\x80\x9cGet out of the way, bad luck to you, and let us pass, for we\r\nare in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np10b.jpg (319K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which Sancho returned, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, princess and universal lady of El\r\nToboso, is not your magnanimous heart softened by seeing the pillar and\r\nprop of knight-errantry on his knees before your sublimated presence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, one of the others exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWoa then! why, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nrubbing thee down, she-ass of my father-in-law! See how the lordlings\r\ncome to make game of the village girls now, as if we here could not\r\nchaff as well as themselves. Go your own way, and let us go ours, and\r\nit will be better for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote at this; \xe2\x80\x9cI see that fortune, \xe2\x80\x98with\r\nevil done to me unsated still,\xe2\x80\x99 has taken possession of all the roads\r\nby which any comfort may reach \xe2\x80\x98this wretched soul\xe2\x80\x99 that I carry in my\r\nflesh. And thou, highest perfection of excellence that can be desired,\r\nutmost limit of grace in human shape, sole relief of this afflicted\r\nheart that adores thee, though the malign enchanter that persecutes me\r\nhas brought clouds and cataracts on my eyes, and to them, and them\r\nonly, transformed thy unparagoned beauty and changed thy features into\r\nthose of a poor peasant girl, if so be he has not at the same time\r\nchanged mine into those of some monster to render them loathsome in thy\r\nsight, refuse not to look upon me with tenderness and love; seeing in\r\nthis submission that I make on my knees to thy transformed beauty the\r\nhumility with which my soul adores thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey-day! My grandfather!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl, \xe2\x80\x9cmuch I care for your\r\nlove-making! Get out of the way and let us pass, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho stood aside and let her go, very well pleased to have got so\r\nwell out of the hobble he was in. The instant the village lass who had\r\ndone duty for Dulcinea found herself free, prodding her \xe2\x80\x9ccackney\xe2\x80\x9d with\r\na spike she had at the end of a stick, she set off at full speed across\r\nthe field. The she-ass, however, feeling the point more acutely than\r\nusual, began cutting such capers, that it flung the lady Dulcinea to\r\nthe ground; seeing which, Don Quixote ran to raise her up, and Sancho\r\nto fix and girth the pack-saddle, which also had slipped under the\r\nass\xe2\x80\x99s belly. The pack-saddle being secured, as Don Quixote was about to\r\nlift up his enchanted mistress in his arms and put her upon her beast,\r\nthe lady, getting up from the ground, saved him the trouble, for, going\r\nback a little, she took a short run, and putting both hands on the\r\ncroup of the ass she dropped into the saddle more lightly than a\r\nfalcon, and sat astride like a man, whereat Sancho said, \xe2\x80\x9cRogue! but\r\nour lady is lighter than a lanner, and might teach the cleverest\r\nCordovan or Mexican how to mount; she cleared the back of the saddle in\r\none jump, and without spurs she is making the hackney go like a zebra;\r\nand her damsels are no way behind her, for they all fly like the wind;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich was the truth, for as soon as they saw Dulcinea mounted, they\r\npushed on after her, and sped away without looking back, for more than\r\nhalf a league.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote followed them with his eyes, and when they were no longer\r\nin sight, he turned to Sancho and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow now, Sancho? thou seest\r\nhow I am hated by enchanters! And see to what a length the malice and\r\nspite they bear me go, when they seek to deprive me of the happiness it\r\nwould give me to see my lady in her own proper form. The fact is I was\r\nborn to be an example of misfortune, and the target and mark at which\r\nthe arrows of adversity are aimed and directed. Observe too, Sancho,\r\nthat these traitors were not content with changing and transforming my\r\nDulcinea, but they transformed and changed her into a shape as mean and\r\nill-favoured as that of the village girl yonder; and at the same time\r\nthey robbed her of that which is such a peculiar property of ladies of\r\ndistinction, that is to say, the sweet fragrance that comes of being\r\nalways among perfumes and flowers. For I must tell thee, Sancho, that\r\nwhen I approached to put Dulcinea upon her hackney (as thou sayest it\r\nwas, though to me it appeared a she-ass), she gave me a whiff of raw\r\ngarlic that made my head reel, and poisoned my very heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO scum of the earth!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sancho at this, \xe2\x80\x9cO miserable, spiteful\r\nenchanters! O that I could see you all strung by the gills, like\r\nsardines on a twig! Ye know a great deal, ye can do a great deal, and\r\nye do a great deal more. It ought to have been enough for you, ye\r\nscoundrels, to have changed the pearls of my lady\xe2\x80\x99s eyes into oak\r\ngalls, and her hair of purest gold into the bristles of a red ox\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntail, and in short, all her features from fair to foul, without\r\nmeddling with her smell; for by that we might somehow have found out\r\nwhat was hidden underneath that ugly rind; though, to tell the truth, I\r\nnever perceived her ugliness, but only her beauty, which was raised to\r\nthe highest pitch of perfection by a mole she had on her right lip,\r\nlike a moustache, with seven or eight red hairs like threads of gold,\r\nand more than a palm long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the correspondence which exists between those of the face and\r\nthose of the body,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cDulcinea must have another mole\r\nresembling that on the thick of the thigh on that side on which she has\r\nthe one on her face; but hairs of the length thou hast mentioned are\r\nvery long for moles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all I can say is there they were as plain as could be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nSancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor nature bestowed\r\nnothing on Dulcinea that was not perfect and well-finished; and so, if\r\nshe had a hundred moles like the one thou hast described, in her they\r\nwould not be moles, but moons and shining stars. But tell me, Sancho,\r\nthat which seemed to me to be a pack-saddle as thou wert fixing it, was\r\nit a flat-saddle or a side-saddle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was neither,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a jineta saddle, with a field\r\ncovering worth half a kingdom, so rich is it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that I could not see all this, Sancho!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9conce\r\nmore I say, and will say a thousand times, I am the most unfortunate of\r\nmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho, the rogue, had enough to do to hide his laughter, at hearing\r\nthe simplicity of the master he had so nicely befooled. At length,\r\nafter a good deal more conversation had passed between them, they\r\nremounted their beasts, and followed the road to Saragossa, which they\r\nexpected to reach in time to take part in a certain grand festival\r\nwhich is held every year in that illustrious city; but before they got\r\nthere things happened to them, so many, so important, and so strange,\r\nthat they deserve to be recorded and read, as will be seen farther on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np10e.jpg (56K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nOF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE CAR\r\nOR CART OF \xe2\x80\x9cTHE CORTES OF DEATH\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np11a.jpg (172K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDejected beyond measure did Don Quixote pursue his journey, turning\r\nover in his mind the cruel trick the enchanters had played him in\r\nchanging his lady Dulcinea into the vile shape of the village lass, nor\r\ncould he think of any way of restoring her to her original form; and\r\nthese reflections so absorbed him, that without being aware of it he\r\nlet go Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s bridle, and he, perceiving the liberty that was\r\ngranted him, stopped at every step to crop the fresh grass with which\r\nthe plain abounded.\r\n\r\nSancho recalled him from his reverie. \xe2\x80\x9cMelancholy, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwas made, not for beasts, but for men; but if men give way to it\r\novermuch they turn to beasts; control yourself, your worship; be\r\nyourself again; gather up Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s reins; cheer up, rouse yourself\r\nand show that gallant spirit that knights-errant ought to have. What\r\nthe devil is this? What weakness is this? Are we here or in France? The\r\ndevil fly away with all the Dulcineas in the world; for the well-being\r\nof a single knight-errant is of more consequence than all the\r\nenchantments and transformations on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote in a weak and faint voice, \xe2\x80\x9chush and\r\nutter no blasphemies against that enchanted lady; for I alone am to\r\nblame for her misfortune and hard fate; her calamity has come of the\r\nhatred the wicked bear me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo say I,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9chis heart rend in twain, I trow, who saw\r\nher once, to see her now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou mayest well say that, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cas thou\r\nsawest her in the full perfection of her beauty; for the enchantment\r\ndoes not go so far as to pervert thy vision or hide her loveliness from\r\nthee; against me alone and against my eyes is the strength of its venom\r\ndirected. Nevertheless, there is one thing which has occurred to me,\r\nand that is that thou didst ill describe her beauty to me, for, as well\r\nas I recollect, thou saidst that her eyes were pearls; but eyes that\r\nare like pearls are rather the eyes of a sea-bream than of a lady, and\r\nI am persuaded that Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s must be green emeralds, full and soft,\r\nwith two rainbows for eyebrows; take away those pearls from her eyes\r\nand transfer them to her teeth; for beyond a doubt, Sancho, thou hast\r\ntaken the one for the other, the eyes for the teeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor her beauty bewildered me as much as\r\nher ugliness did your worship; but let us leave it all to God, who\r\nalone knows what is to happen in this vale of tears, in this evil world\r\nof ours, where there is hardly a thing to be found without some mixture\r\nof wickedness, roguery, and rascality. But one thing, se\xc3\xb1or, troubles\r\nme more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be done when\r\nyour worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders him\r\nto go and present himself before the beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Where\r\nis this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find\r\nher? I think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso, looking like\r\nnoddies, and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her in\r\nthe middle of the street they won\xe2\x80\x99t know her any more than they would\r\nmy father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe enchantment does not go\r\nso far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the\r\npower of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or\r\ntwo of the first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or\r\nnot, by commanding them to return and give me an account of what\r\nhappened to them in this respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know;\r\nand if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the\r\nmisfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady\r\nDulcinea is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it,\r\nand get on as well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time\r\nto take his own course; for he is the best physician for these and\r\ngreater ailments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by\r\na cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange\r\npersonages and figures that could be imagined. He who led the mules and\r\nacted as carter was a hideous demon; the cart was open to the sky,\r\nwithout a tilt or cane roof, and the first figure that presented itself\r\nto Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s eyes was that of Death itself with a human face; next\r\nto it was an angel with large painted wings, and at one side an\r\nemperor, with a crown, to all appearance of gold, on his head. At the\r\nfeet of Death was the god called Cupid, without his bandage, but with\r\nhis bow, quiver, and arrows; there was also a knight in full armour,\r\nexcept that he had no morion or helmet, but only a hat decked with\r\nplumes of divers colours; and along with these there were others with a\r\nvariety of costumes and faces. All this, unexpectedly encountered, took\r\nDon Quixote somewhat aback, and struck terror into the heart of Sancho;\r\nbut the next instant Don Quixote was glad of it, believing that some\r\nnew perilous adventure was presenting itself to him, and under this\r\nimpression, and with a spirit prepared to face any danger, he planted\r\nhimself in front of the cart, and in a loud and menacing tone,\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cCarter, or coachman, or devil, or whatever thou art, tell\r\nme at once who thou art, whither thou art going, and who these folk are\r\nthou carriest in thy wagon, which looks more like Charon\xe2\x80\x99s boat than an\r\nordinary cart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which the devil, stopping the cart, answered quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, we are\r\nplayers of Angulo el Malo\xe2\x80\x99s company; we have been acting the play of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Cort\xc3\xa9s of Death\xe2\x80\x99 this morning, which is the octave of Corpus\r\nChristi, in a village behind that hill, and we have to act it this\r\nafternoon in that village which you can see from this; and as it is so\r\nnear, and to save the trouble of undressing and dressing again, we go\r\nin the costumes in which we perform. That lad there appears as Death,\r\nthat other as an angel, that woman, the manager\xe2\x80\x99s wife, plays the\r\nqueen, this one the soldier, that the emperor, and I the devil; and I\r\nam one of the principal characters of the play, for in this company I\r\ntake the leading parts. If you want to know anything more about us, ask\r\nme and I will answer with the utmost exactitude, for as I am a devil I\r\nam up to everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the faith of a knight-errant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I saw\r\nthis cart I fancied some great adventure was presenting itself to me;\r\nbut I declare one must touch with the hand what appears to the eye, if\r\nillusions are to be avoided. God speed you, good people; keep your\r\nfestival, and remember, if you demand of me ought wherein I can render\r\nyou a service, I will do it gladly and willingly, for from a child I\r\nwas fond of the play, and in my youth a keen lover of the actor\xe2\x80\x99s art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile they were talking, fate so willed it that one of the company in a\r\nmummers\xe2\x80\x99 dress with a great number of bells, and armed with three blown\r\nox-bladders at the end of a stick, joined them, and this merry-andrew\r\napproaching Don Quixote, began flourishing his stick and banging the\r\nground with the bladders and cutting capers with great jingling of the\r\nbells, which untoward apparition so startled Rocinante that, in spite\r\nof Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to hold him in, taking the bit between his\r\nteeth he set off across the plain with greater speed than the bones of\r\nhis anatomy ever gave any promise of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np11b.jpg (327K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSancho, who thought his master was in danger of being thrown, jumped\r\noff Dapple, and ran in all haste to help him; but by the time he\r\nreached him he was already on the ground, and beside him was Rocinante,\r\nwho had come down with his master, the usual end and upshot of\r\nRocinante\xe2\x80\x99s vivacity and high spirits. But the moment Sancho quitted\r\nhis beast to go and help Don Quixote, the dancing devil with the\r\nbladders jumped up on Dapple, and beating him with them, more by the\r\nfright and the noise than by the pain of the blows, made him fly across\r\nthe fields towards the village where they were going to hold their\r\nfestival. Sancho witnessed Dapple\xe2\x80\x99s career and his master\xe2\x80\x99s fall, and\r\ndid not know which of the two cases of need he should attend to first;\r\nbut in the end, like a good squire and good servant, he let his love\r\nfor his master prevail over his affection for his ass; though every\r\ntime he saw the bladders rise in the air and come down on the hind\r\nquarters of his Dapple he felt the pains and terrors of death, and he\r\nwould have rather had the blows fall on the apples of his own eyes than\r\non the least hair of his ass\xe2\x80\x99s tail. In this trouble and perplexity he\r\ncame to where Don Quixote lay in a far sorrier plight than he liked,\r\nand having helped him to mount Rocinante, he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, the\r\ndevil has carried off my Dapple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat devil?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one with the bladders,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will recover him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if he be shut up\r\nwith him in the deepest and darkest dungeons of hell. Follow me,\r\nSancho, for the cart goes slowly, and with the mules of it I will make\r\ngood the loss of Dapple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not take the trouble, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9ckeep cool, for as\r\nI now see, the devil has let Dapple go and he is coming back to his old\r\nquarters;\xe2\x80\x9d and so it turned out, for, having come down with Dapple, in\r\nimitation of Don Quixote and Rocinante, the devil made off on foot to\r\nthe town, and the ass came back to his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be well to visit the\r\ndiscourtesy of that devil upon some of those in the cart, even if it\r\nwere the emperor himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think of it, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9ctake my advice and\r\nnever meddle with actors, for they are a favoured class; I myself have\r\nknown an actor taken up for two murders, and yet come off scot-free;\r\nremember that, as they are merry folk who give pleasure, everyone\r\nfavours and protects them, and helps and makes much of them, above all\r\nwhen they are those of the royal companies and under patent, all or\r\nmost of whom in dress and appearance look like princes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, for all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe player devil must not go\r\noff boasting, even if the whole human race favours him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he made for the cart, which was now very near the town,\r\nshouting out as he went, \xe2\x80\x9cStay! halt! ye merry, jovial crew! I want to\r\nteach you how to treat asses and animals that serve the squires of\r\nknights-errant for steeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo loud were the shouts of Don Quixote, that those in the cart heard\r\nand understood them, and, guessing by the words what the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintention was, Death in an instant jumped out of the cart, and the\r\nemperor, the devil carter and the angel after him, nor did the queen or\r\nthe god Cupid stay behind; and all armed themselves with stones and\r\nformed in line, prepared to receive Don Quixote on the points of their\r\npebbles. Don Quixote, when he saw them drawn up in such a gallant array\r\nwith uplifted arms ready for a mighty discharge of stones, checked\r\nRocinante and began to consider in what way he could attack them with\r\nthe least danger to himself. As he halted Sancho came up, and seeing\r\nhim disposed to attack this well-ordered squadron, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwould be the height of madness to attempt such an enterprise; remember,\r\nse\xc3\xb1or, that against sops from the brook, and plenty of them, there is\r\nno defensive armour in the world, except to stow oneself away under a\r\nbrass bell; and besides, one should remember that it is rashness, and\r\nnot valour, for a single man to attack an army that has Death in it,\r\nand where emperors fight in person, with angels, good and bad, to help\r\nthem; and if this reflection will not make you keep quiet, perhaps it\r\nwill to know for certain that among all these, though they look like\r\nkings, princes, and emperors, there is not a single knight-errant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow indeed thou hast hit the point, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich\r\nmay and should turn me from the resolution I had already formed. I\r\ncannot and must not draw sword, as I have many a time before told thee,\r\nagainst anyone who is not a dubbed knight; it is for thee, Sancho, if\r\nthou wilt, to take vengeance for the wrong done to thy Dapple; and I\r\nwill help thee from here by shouts and salutary counsels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no occasion to take vengeance on anyone, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nSancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is not the part of good Christians to revenge wrongs;\r\nand besides, I will arrange it with my ass to leave his grievance to my\r\ngood-will and pleasure, and that is to live in peace as long as heaven\r\ngrants me life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif that be thy determination, good Sancho,\r\nsensible Sancho, Christian Sancho, honest Sancho, let us leave these\r\nphantoms alone and turn to the pursuit of better and worthier\r\nadventures; for, from what I see of this country, we cannot fail to\r\nfind plenty of marvellous ones in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe at once wheeled about, Sancho ran to take possession of his Dapple,\r\nDeath and his flying squadron returned to their cart and pursued their\r\njourney, and thus the dread adventure of the cart of Death ended\r\nhappily, thanks to the advice Sancho gave his master; who had, the\r\nfollowing day, a fresh adventure, of no less thrilling interest than\r\nthe last, with an enamoured knight-errant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np11e.jpg (20K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nOF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH BEFELL THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE WITH THE\r\nBOLD KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np12a.jpg (98K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night succeeding the day of the encounter with Death, Don Quixote\r\nand his squire passed under some tall shady trees, and Don Quixote at\r\nSancho\xe2\x80\x99s persuasion ate a little from the store carried by Dapple, and\r\nover their supper Sancho said to his master, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, what a fool I\r\nshould have looked if I had chosen for my reward the spoils of the\r\nfirst adventure your worship achieved, instead of the foals of the\r\nthree mares. After all, \xe2\x80\x98a sparrow in the hand is better than a vulture\r\non the wing.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif thou hadst let me\r\nattack them as I wanted, at the very least the emperor\xe2\x80\x99s gold crown and\r\nCupid\xe2\x80\x99s painted wings would have fallen to thee as spoils, for I should\r\nhave taken them by force and given them into thy hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sceptres and crowns of those play-actor emperors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwere never yet pure gold, but only brass foil or tin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it would not be right that the\r\naccessories of the drama should be real, instead of being mere fictions\r\nand semblances, like the drama itself; towards which, Sancho\xe2\x80\x94and, as a\r\nnecessary consequence, towards those who represent and produce it\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwould that thou wert favourably disposed, for they are all instruments\r\nof great good to the State, placing before us at every step a mirror in\r\nwhich we may see vividly displayed what goes on in human life; nor is\r\nthere any similitude that shows us more faithfully what we are and\r\nought to be than the play and the players. Come, tell me, hast thou not\r\nseen a play acted in which kings, emperors, pontiffs, knights, ladies,\r\nand divers other personages were introduced? One plays the villain,\r\nanother the knave, this one the merchant, that the soldier, one the\r\nsharp-witted fool, another the foolish lover; and when the play is\r\nover, and they have put off the dresses they wore in it, all the actors\r\nbecome equal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have seen that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe same thing happens in the comedy\r\nand life of this world, where some play emperors, others popes, and, in\r\nshort, all the characters that can be brought into a play; but when it\r\nis over, that is to say when life ends, death strips them all of the\r\ngarments that distinguish one from the other, and all are equal in the\r\ngrave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine comparison!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cthough not so new but that I have\r\nheard it many and many a time, as well as that other one of the game of\r\nchess; how, so long as the game lasts, each piece has its own\r\nparticular office, and when the game is finished they are all mixed,\r\njumbled up and shaken together, and stowed away in the bag, which is\r\nmuch like ending life in the grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art growing less doltish and more shrewd every day, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDon Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cit must be that some of your worship\xe2\x80\x99s shrewdness\r\nsticks to me; land that, of itself, is barren and dry, will come to\r\nyield good fruit if you dung it and till it; what I mean is that your\r\nworship\xe2\x80\x99s conversation has been the dung that has fallen on the barren\r\nsoil of my dry wit, and the time I have been in your service and\r\nsociety has been the tillage; and with the help of this I hope to yield\r\nfruit in abundance that will not fall away or slide from those paths of\r\ngood breeding that your worship has made in my parched understanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote laughed at Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s affected phraseology, and perceived\r\nthat what he said about his improvement was true, for now and then he\r\nspoke in a way that surprised him; though always, or mostly, when\r\nSancho tried to talk fine and attempted polite language, he wound up by\r\ntoppling over from the summit of his simplicity into the abyss of his\r\nignorance; and where he showed his culture and his memory to the\r\ngreatest advantage was in dragging in proverbs, no matter whether they\r\nhad any bearing or not upon the subject in hand, as may have been seen\r\nalready and will be noticed in the course of this history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np12b.jpg (298K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conversation of this kind they passed a good part of the night, but\r\nSancho felt a desire to let down the curtains of his eyes, as he used\r\nto say when he wanted to go to sleep; and stripping Dapple he left him\r\nat liberty to graze his fill. He did not remove Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s saddle, as\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s express orders were, that so long as they were in the\r\nfield or not sleeping under a roof Rocinante was not to be stripped\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nancient usage established and observed by knights-errant being to take\r\noff the bridle and hang it on the saddle-bow, but to remove the saddle\r\nfrom the horse\xe2\x80\x94never! Sancho acted accordingly, and gave him the same\r\nliberty he had given Dapple, between whom and Rocinante there was a\r\nfriendship so unequalled and so strong, that it is handed down by\r\ntradition from father to son, that the author of this veracious history\r\ndevoted some special chapters to it, which, in order to preserve the\r\npropriety and decorum due to a history so heroic, he did not insert\r\ntherein; although at times he forgets this resolution of his and\r\ndescribes how eagerly the two beasts would scratch one another when\r\nthey were together and how, when they were tired or full, Rocinante\r\nwould lay his neck across Dapple\xe2\x80\x99s, stretching half a yard or more on\r\nthe other side, and the pair would stand thus, gazing thoughtfully on\r\nthe ground, for three days, or at least so long as they were left\r\nalone, or hunger did not drive them to go and look for food. I may add\r\nthat they say the author left it on record that he likened their\r\nfriendship to that of Nisus and Euryalus, and Pylades and Orestes; and\r\nif that be so, it may be perceived, to the admiration of mankind, how\r\nfirm the friendship must have been between these two peaceful animals,\r\nshaming men, who preserve friendships with one another so badly. This\r\nwas why it was said-\r\n\r\nFor friend no longer is there friend;\r\nThe reeds turn lances now.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd someone else has sung\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFriend to friend the bug, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nand let no one fancy that the author was at all astray when he compared\r\nthe friendship of these animals to that of men; for men have received\r\nmany lessons from beasts, and learned many important things, as, for\r\nexample, the clyster from the stork, vomit and gratitude from the dog,\r\nwatchfulness from the crane, foresight from the ant, modesty from the\r\nelephant, and loyalty from the horse.\r\n\r\nSancho at last fell asleep at the foot of a cork tree, while Don\r\nQuixote dozed at that of a sturdy oak; but a short time only had\r\nelapsed when a noise he heard behind him awoke him, and rising up\r\nstartled, he listened and looked in the direction the noise came from,\r\nand perceived two men on horseback, one of whom, letting himself drop\r\nfrom the saddle, said to the other, \xe2\x80\x9cDismount, my friend, and take the\r\nbridles off the horses, for, so far as I can see, this place will\r\nfurnish grass for them, and the solitude and silence my love-sick\r\nthoughts need of.\xe2\x80\x9d As he said this he stretched himself upon the\r\nground, and as he flung himself down, the armour in which he was clad\r\nrattled, whereby Don Quixote perceived that he must be a knight-errant;\r\nand going over to Sancho, who was asleep, he shook him by the arm and\r\nwith no small difficulty brought him back to his senses, and said in a\r\nlow voice to him, \xe2\x80\x9cBrother Sancho, we have got an adventure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod send us a good one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand where may her ladyship the\r\nadventure be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cturn thine eyes and look, and\r\nthou wilt see stretched there a knight-errant, who, it strikes me, is\r\nnot over and above happy, for I saw him fling himself off his horse and\r\nthrow himself on the ground with a certain air of dejection, and his\r\narmour rattled as he fell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9chow does your worship make out that to be an\r\nadventure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not mean to say,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it is a complete\r\nadventure, but that it is the beginning of one, for it is in this way\r\nadventures begin. But listen, for it seems he is tuning a lute or\r\nguitar, and from the way he is spitting and clearing his chest he must\r\nbe getting ready to sing something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, you are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand no doubt he is some enamoured\r\nknight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no knight-errant that is not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut let us\r\nlisten to him, for, if he sings, by that thread we shall extract the\r\nball of his thoughts; because out of the abundance of the heart the\r\nmouth speaketh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho was about to reply to his master, but the Knight of the Grove\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice, which was neither very bad nor very good, stopped him, and\r\nlistening attentively the pair heard him sing this\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\nYour pleasure, prithee, lady mine, unfold;\r\nDeclare the terms that I am to obey;\r\nMy will to yours submissively I mould,\r\nAnd from your law my feet shall never stray.\r\nWould you I die, to silent grief a prey?\r\nThen count me even now as dead and cold;\r\nWould you I tell my woes in some new way?\r\nThen shall my tale by Love itself be told.\r\nThe unison of opposites to prove,\r\nOf the soft wax and diamond hard am I;\r\nBut still, obedient to the laws of love,\r\nHere, hard or soft, I offer you my breast,\r\nWhate\xe2\x80\x99er you grave or stamp thereon shall rest\r\nIndelible for all eternity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith an \xe2\x80\x9cAh me!\xe2\x80\x9d that seemed to be drawn from the inmost recesses of\r\nhis heart, the Knight of the Grove brought his lay to an end, and\r\nshortly afterwards exclaimed in a melancholy and piteous voice, \xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nfairest and most ungrateful woman on earth! What! can it be, most\r\nserene Casildea de Vandalia, that thou wilt suffer this thy captive\r\nknight to waste away and perish in ceaseless wanderings and rude and\r\narduous toils? It is not enough that I have compelled all the knights\r\nof Navarre, all the Leonese, all the Tartesians, all the Castilians,\r\nand finally all the knights of La Mancha, to confess thee the most\r\nbeautiful in the world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote at this, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am of La Mancha, and I have\r\nnever confessed anything of the sort, nor could I nor should I confess\r\na thing so much to the prejudice of my lady\xe2\x80\x99s beauty; thou seest how\r\nthis knight is raving, Sancho. But let us listen, perhaps he will tell\r\nus more about himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he will,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he seems in a mood to bewail\r\nhimself for a month at a stretch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this was not the case, for the Knight of the Grove, hearing voices\r\nnear him, instead of continuing his lamentation, stood up and exclaimed\r\nin a distinct but courteous tone, \xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there? What are you? Do you\r\nbelong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the miserable,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen come to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove, \xe2\x80\x9cand rest assured that it is\r\nto woe itself and affliction itself you come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote, finding himself answered in such a soft and courteous\r\nmanner, went over to him, and so did Sancho.\r\n\r\nThe doleful knight took Don Quixote by the arm, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSit down here,\r\nsir knight; for, that you are one, and of those that profess\r\nknight-errantry, it is to me a sufficient proof to have found you in\r\nthis place, where solitude and night, the natural couch and proper\r\nretreat of knights-errant, keep you company.\xe2\x80\x9d To which Don made answer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA knight I am of the profession you mention, and though sorrows,\r\nmisfortunes, and calamities have made my heart their abode, the\r\ncompassion I feel for the misfortunes of others has not been thereby\r\nbanished from it. From what you have just now sung I gather that yours\r\nspring from love, I mean from the love you bear that fair ingrate you\r\nnamed in your lament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, they had seated themselves together on the hard ground\r\npeaceably and sociably, just as if, as soon as day broke, they were not\r\ngoing to break one another\xe2\x80\x99s heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you, sir knight, in love perchance?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he of the Grove of Don\r\nQuixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy mischance I am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthough the ills arising from\r\nwell-bestowed affections should be esteemed favours rather than\r\nmisfortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d returned he of the Grove, \xe2\x80\x9cif scorn did not unsettle\r\nour reason and understanding, for if it be excessive it looks like\r\nrevenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was never scorned by my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, who stood close by, \xe2\x80\x9cfor my lady is as a\r\nlamb, and softer than a roll of butter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this your squire?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he of the Grove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never yet saw a squire,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove, \xe2\x80\x9cwho ventured to\r\nspeak when his master was speaking; at least, there is mine, who is as\r\nbig as his father, and it cannot be proved that he has ever opened his\r\nlips when I am speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my faith then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI have spoken, and am fit to speak,\r\nin the presence of one as much, or even\xe2\x80\x94but never mind\xe2\x80\x94it only makes it\r\nworse to stir it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe squire of the Grove took Sancho by the arm, saying to him, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us\r\ntwo go where we can talk in squire style as much as we please, and\r\nleave these gentlemen our masters to fight it out over the story of\r\ntheir loves; and, depend upon it, daybreak will find them at it without\r\nhaving made an end of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand I will tell your worship who\r\nI am, that you may see whether I am to be reckoned among the number of\r\nthe most talkative squires.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this the two squires withdrew to one side, and between them there\r\npassed a conversation as droll as that which passed between their\r\nmasters was serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np12e.jpg (15K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nIN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVE,\r\nTOGETHER WITH THE SENSIBLE, ORIGINAL, AND TRANQUIL COLLOQUY THAT PASSED\r\nBETWEEN THE TWO SQUIRES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np13a.jpg (126K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe knights and the squires made two parties, these telling the story\r\nof their lives, the others the story of their loves; but the history\r\nrelates first of all the conversation of the servants, and afterwards\r\ntakes up that of the masters; and it says that, withdrawing a little\r\nfrom the others, he of the Grove said to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cA hard life it is we\r\nlead and live, se\xc3\xb1or, we that are squires to knights-errant; verily, we\r\neat our bread in the sweat of our faces, which is one of the curses God\r\nlaid on our first parents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be said, too,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we eat it in the chill of\r\nour bodies; for who gets more heat and cold than the miserable squires\r\nof knight-errantry? Even so it would not be so bad if we had something\r\nto eat, for woes are lighter if there\xe2\x80\x99s bread; but sometimes we go a\r\nday or two without breaking our fast, except with the wind that blows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove, \xe2\x80\x9cmay be endured and put up with when\r\nwe have hopes of reward; for, unless the knight-errant he serves is\r\nexcessively unlucky, after a few turns the squire will at least find\r\nhimself rewarded with a fine government of some island or some fair\r\ncounty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9chave already told my master that I shall be content\r\nwith the government of some island, and he is so noble and generous\r\nthat he has promised it to me ever so many times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove, \xe2\x80\x9cshall be satisfied with a canonry for my\r\nservices, and my master has already assigned me one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour master,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cno doubt is a knight in the Church line,\r\nand can bestow rewards of that sort on his good squire; but mine is\r\nonly a layman; though I remember some clever, but, to my mind,\r\ndesigning people, strove to persuade him to try and become an\r\narchbishop. He, however, would not be anything but an emperor; but I\r\nwas trembling all the time lest he should take a fancy to go into the\r\nChurch, not finding myself fit to hold office in it; for I may tell\r\nyou, though I seem a man, I am no better than a beast for the Church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you are wrong there,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove; \xe2\x80\x9cfor those\r\nisland governments are not all satisfactory; some are awkward, some are\r\npoor, some are dull, and, in short, the highest and choicest brings\r\nwith it a heavy burden of cares and troubles which the unhappy wight to\r\nwhose lot it has fallen bears upon his shoulders. Far better would it\r\nbe for us who have adopted this accursed service to go back to our own\r\nhouses, and there employ ourselves in pleasanter occupations\xe2\x80\x94in hunting\r\nor fishing, for instance; for what squire in the world is there so poor\r\nas not to have a hack and a couple of greyhounds and a fishingrod to\r\namuse himself with in his own village?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not in want of any of those things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cto be sure I\r\nhave no hack, but I have an ass that is worth my master\xe2\x80\x99s horse twice\r\nover; God send me a bad Easter, and that the next one I am to see, if I\r\nwould swap, even if I got four bushels of barley to boot. You will\r\nlaugh at the value I put on my Dapple\xe2\x80\x94for dapple is the colour of my\r\nbeast. As to greyhounds, I can\xe2\x80\x99t want for them, for there are enough\r\nand to spare in my town; and, moreover, there is more pleasure in sport\r\nwhen it is at other people\xe2\x80\x99s expense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth and earnest, sir squire,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove, \xe2\x80\x9cI have made\r\nup my mind and determined to have done with these drunken vagaries of\r\nthese knights, and go back to my village, and bring up my children; for\r\nI have three, like three Oriental pearls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat might be presented before the Pope\r\nhimself, especially a girl whom I am breeding up for a countess, please\r\nGod, though in spite of her mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how old is this lady that is being bred up for a countess?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nhe of the Grove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen, a couple of years more or less,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she is\r\nas tall as a lance, and as fresh as an April morning, and as strong as\r\na porter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are gifts to fit her to be not only a countess but a nymph of\r\nthe greenwood,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove; \xe2\x80\x9cwhoreson strumpet! what pith the\r\nrogue must have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Sancho made answer, somewhat sulkily, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s no strumpet, nor\r\nwas her mother, nor will either of them be, please God, while I live;\r\nspeak more civilly; for one bred up among knights-errant, who are\r\ncourtesy itself, your words don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to me to be very becoming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO how little you know about compliments, sir squire,\xe2\x80\x9d returned he of\r\nthe Grove. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that when a horseman delivers a good\r\nlance thrust at the bull in the plaza, or when anyone does anything\r\nvery well, the people are wont to say, \xe2\x80\x98Ha, whoreson rip! how well he\r\nhas done it!\xe2\x80\x99 and that what seems to be abuse in the expression is high\r\npraise? Disown sons and daughters, se\xc3\xb1or, who don\xe2\x80\x99t do what deserves\r\nthat compliments of this sort should be paid to their parents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do disown them,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand in this way, and by the same\r\nreasoning, you might call me and my children and my wife all the\r\nstrumpets in the world, for all they do and say is of a kind that in\r\nthe highest degree deserves the same praise; and to see them again I\r\npray God to deliver me from mortal sin, or, what comes to the same\r\nthing, to deliver me from this perilous calling of squire into which I\r\nhave fallen a second time, decayed and beguiled by a purse with a\r\nhundred ducats that I found one day in the heart of the Sierra Morena;\r\nand the devil is always putting a bag full of doubloons before my eyes,\r\nhere, there, everywhere, until I fancy at every stop I am putting my\r\nhand on it, and hugging it, and carrying it home with me, and making\r\ninvestments, and getting interest, and living like a prince; and so\r\nlong as I think of this I make light of all the hardships I endure with\r\nthis simpleton of a master of mine, who, I well know, is more of a\r\nmadman than a knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s why they say that \xe2\x80\x98covetousness bursts the bag,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said he of\r\nthe Grove; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you come to talk of that sort, there is not a\r\ngreater one in the world than my master, for he is one of those of whom\r\nthey say, \xe2\x80\x98the cares of others kill the ass;\xe2\x80\x99 for, in order that\r\nanother knight may recover the senses he has lost, he makes a madman of\r\nhimself and goes looking for what, when found, may, for all I know, fly\r\nin his own face.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd is he in love perchance?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is,\xe2\x80\x9d said of the Grove, \xe2\x80\x9cwith one Casildea de Vandalia, the rawest\r\nand best roasted lady the whole world could produce; but that rawness\r\nis not the only foot he limps on, for he has greater schemes rumbling\r\nin his bowels, as will be seen before many hours are over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no road so smooth but it has some hole or hindrance in it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cin other houses they cook beans, but in mine it\xe2\x80\x99s by the\r\npotful; madness will have more followers and hangers-on than sound\r\nsense; but if there be any truth in the common saying, that to have\r\ncompanions in trouble gives some relief, I may take consolation from\r\nyou, inasmuch as you serve a master as crazy as my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrazy but valiant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he of the Grove, \xe2\x80\x9cand more roguish than\r\ncrazy or valiant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine is not that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI mean he has nothing of the rogue in\r\nhim; on the contrary, he has the soul of a pitcher; he has no thought\r\nof doing harm to anyone, only good to all, nor has he any malice\r\nwhatever in him; a child might persuade him that it is night at\r\nnoonday; and for this simplicity I love him as the core of my heart,\r\nand I can\xe2\x80\x99t bring myself to leave him, let him do ever such foolish\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that, brother and se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove, \xe2\x80\x9cif the blind\r\nlead the blind, both are in danger of falling into the pit. It is\r\nbetter for us to beat a quiet retreat and get back to our own quarters;\r\nfor those who seek adventures don\xe2\x80\x99t always find good ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho kept spitting from time to time, and his spittle seemed somewhat\r\nropy and dry, observing which the compassionate squire of the Grove\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that with all this talk of ours our tongues are\r\nsticking to the roofs of our mouths; but I have a pretty good loosener\r\nhanging from the saddle-bow of my horse,\xe2\x80\x9d and getting up he came back\r\nthe next minute with a large bota of wine and a pasty half a yard\r\nacross; and this is no exaggeration, for it was made of a house rabbit\r\nso big that Sancho, as he handled it, took it to be made of a goat, not\r\nto say a kid, and looking at it he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you carry this with\r\nyou, se\xc3\xb1or?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what are you thinking about?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you take me for\r\nsome paltry squire? I carry a better larder on my horse\xe2\x80\x99s croup than a\r\ngeneral takes with him when he goes on a march.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho ate without requiring to be pressed, and in the dark bolted\r\nmouthfuls like the knots on a tether, and said he, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a proper\r\ntrusty squire, one of the right sort, sumptuous and grand, as this\r\nbanquet shows, which, if it has not come here by magic art, at any rate\r\nhas the look of it; not like me, unlucky beggar, that have nothing more\r\nin my alforjas than a scrap of cheese, so hard that one might brain a\r\ngiant with it, and, to keep it company, a few dozen carobs and as many\r\nmore filberts and walnuts; thanks to the austerity of my master, and\r\nthe idea he has and the rule he follows, that knights-errant must not\r\nlive or sustain themselves on anything except dried fruits and the\r\nherbs of the field.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my faith, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove, \xe2\x80\x9cmy stomach is not made\r\nfor thistles, or wild pears, or roots of the woods; let our masters do\r\nas they like, with their chivalry notions and laws, and eat what those\r\nenjoin; I carry my prog-basket and this bota hanging to the saddle-bow,\r\nwhatever they may say; and it is such an object of worship with me, and\r\nI love it so, that there is hardly a moment but I am kissing and\r\nembracing it over and over again;\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying he thrust it into\r\nSancho\xe2\x80\x99s hands, who raising it aloft pointed to his mouth, gazed at the\r\nstars for a quarter of an hour; and when he had done drinking let his\r\nhead fall on one side, and giving a deep sigh, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, whoreson\r\nrogue, how catholic it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove, hearing Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s exclamation,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow you have called this wine whoreson by way of praise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI own it, and I grant it is no dishonour to call\r\nanyone whoreson when it is to be understood as praise. But tell me,\r\nse\xc3\xb1or, by what you love best, is this Ciudad Real wine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO rare wine-taster!\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove; \xe2\x80\x9cnowhere else indeed does\r\nit come from, and it has some years\xe2\x80\x99 age too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cnever fear but I\xe2\x80\x99ll hit upon\r\nthe place it came from somehow. What would you say, sir squire, to my\r\nhaving such a great natural instinct in judging wines that you have\r\nonly to let me smell one and I can tell positively its country, its\r\nkind, its flavour and soundness, the changes it will undergo, and\r\neverything that appertains to a wine? But it is no wonder, for I have\r\nhad in my family, on my father\xe2\x80\x99s side, the two best wine-tasters that\r\nhave been known in La Mancha for many a long year, and to prove it I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you now a thing that happened them. They gave the two of them some\r\nwine out of a cask, to try, asking their opinion as to the condition,\r\nquality, goodness or badness of the wine. One of them tried it with the\r\ntip of his tongue, the other did no more than bring it to his nose. The\r\nfirst said the wine had a flavour of iron, the second said it had a\r\nstronger flavour of cordovan. The owner said the cask was clean, and\r\nthat nothing had been added to the wine from which it could have got a\r\nflavour of either iron or leather. Nevertheless, these two great\r\nwine-tasters held to what they had said. Time went by, the wine was\r\nsold, and when they came to clean out the cask, they found in it a\r\nsmall key hanging to a thong of cordovan; see now if one who comes of\r\nthe same stock has not a right to give his opinion in such like cases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, I say,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove, \xe2\x80\x9clet us give up going in\r\nquest of adventures, and as we have loaves let us not go looking for\r\ncakes, but return to our cribs, for God will find us there if it be his\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil my master reaches Saragossa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll remain in his\r\nservice; after that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe end of it was that the two squires talked so much and drank so much\r\nthat sleep had to tie their tongues and moderate their thirst, for to\r\nquench it was impossible; and so the pair of them fell asleep clinging\r\nto the now nearly empty bota and with half-chewed morsels in their\r\nmouths; and there we will leave them for the present, to relate what\r\npassed between the Knight of the Grove and him of the Rueful\r\nCountenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np13e.jpg (43K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nWHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np14a.jpg (120K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the things that passed between Don Quixote and the Knight of the\r\nWood, the history tells us he of the Grove said to Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nfine, sir knight, I would have you know that my destiny, or, more\r\nproperly speaking, my choice led me to fall in love with the peerless\r\nCasildea de Vandalia. I call her peerless because she has no peer,\r\nwhether it be in bodily stature or in the supremacy of rank and beauty.\r\nThis same Casildea, then, that I speak of, requited my honourable\r\npassion and gentle aspirations by compelling me, as his stepmother did\r\nHercules, to engage in many perils of various sorts, at the end of each\r\npromising me that, with the end of the next, the object of my hopes\r\nshould be attained; but my labours have gone on increasing link by link\r\nuntil they are past counting, nor do I know what will be the last one\r\nthat is to be the beginning of the accomplishment of my chaste desires.\r\nOn one occasion she bade me go and challenge the famous giantess of\r\nSeville, La Giralda by name, who is as mighty and strong as if made of\r\nbrass, and though never stirring from one spot, is the most restless\r\nand changeable woman in the world. I came, I saw, I conquered, and I\r\nmade her stay quiet and behave herself, for nothing but north winds\r\nblew for more than a week. Another time I was ordered to lift those\r\nancient stones, the mighty bulls of Guisando, an enterprise that might\r\nmore fitly be entrusted to porters than to knights. Again, she bade me\r\nfling myself into the cavern of Cabra\xe2\x80\x94an unparalleled and awful\r\nperil\xe2\x80\x94and bring her a minute account of all that is concealed in those\r\ngloomy depths. I stopped the motion of the Giralda, I lifted the bulls\r\nof Guisando, I flung myself into the cavern and brought to light the\r\nsecrets of its abyss; and my hopes are as dead as dead can be, and her\r\nscorn and her commands as lively as ever. To be brief, last of all she\r\nhas commanded me to go through all the provinces of Spain and compel\r\nall the knights-errant wandering therein to confess that she surpasses\r\nall women alive to-day in beauty, and that I am the most valiant and\r\nthe most deeply enamoured knight on earth; in support of which claim I\r\nhave already travelled over the greater part of Spain, and have there\r\nvanquished several knights who have dared to contradict me; but what I\r\nmost plume and pride myself upon is having vanquished in single combat\r\nthat so famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, and made him confess\r\nthat my Casildea is more beautiful than his Dulcinea; and in this one\r\nvictory I hold myself to have conquered all the knights in the world;\r\nfor this Don Quixote that I speak of has vanquished them all, and I\r\nhaving vanquished him, his glory, his fame, and his honour have passed\r\nand are transferred to my person; for\r\n\r\nThe more the vanquished hath of fair renown,\r\nThe greater glory gilds the victor\xe2\x80\x99s crown.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the innumerable achievements of the said Don Quixote are now set\r\ndown to my account and have become mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was amazed when he heard the Knight of the Grove, and was a\r\nthousand times on the point of telling him he lied, and had the lie\r\ndirect already on the tip of his tongue; but he restrained himself as\r\nwell as he could, in order to force him to confess the lie with his own\r\nlips; so he said to him quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cAs to what you say, sir knight, about\r\nhaving vanquished most of the knights of Spain, or even of the whole\r\nworld, I say nothing; but that you have vanquished Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha I consider doubtful; it may have been some other that resembled\r\nhim, although there are few like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! not vanquished?\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove; \xe2\x80\x9cby the heaven that is\r\nabove us I fought Don Quixote and overcame him and made him yield; and\r\nhe is a man of tall stature, gaunt features, long, lank limbs, with\r\nhair turning grey, an aquiline nose rather hooked, and large black\r\ndrooping moustaches; he does battle under the name of \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nCountenance,\xe2\x80\x99 and he has for squire a peasant called Sancho Panza; he\r\npresses the loins and rules the reins of a famous steed called\r\nRocinante; and lastly, he has for the mistress of his will a certain\r\nDulcinea del Toboso, once upon a time called Aldonza Lorenzo, just as I\r\ncall mine Casildea de Vandalia because her name is Casilda and she is\r\nof Andalusia. If all these tokens are not enough to vindicate the truth\r\nof what I say, here is my sword, that will compel incredulity itself to\r\ngive credence to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalm yourself, sir knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand give ear to what I\r\nam about to say to you. I would have you know that this Don Quixote you\r\nspeak of is the greatest friend I have in the world; so much so that I\r\nmay say I regard him in the same light as my own person; and from the\r\nprecise and clear indications you have given I cannot but think that he\r\nmust be the very one you have vanquished. On the other hand, I see with\r\nmy eyes and feel with my hands that it is impossible it can have been\r\nthe same; unless indeed it be that, as he has many enemies who are\r\nenchanters, and one in particular who is always persecuting him,\r\nsomeone of these may have taken his shape in order to allow himself to\r\nbe vanquished, so as to defraud him of the fame that his exalted\r\nachievements as a knight have earned and acquired for him throughout\r\nthe known world. And in confirmation of this, I must tell you, too,\r\nthat it is but ten hours since these said enchanters his enemies\r\ntransformed the shape and person of the fair Dulcinea del Toboso into a\r\nfoul and mean village lass, and in the same way they must have\r\ntransformed Don Quixote; and if all this does not suffice to convince\r\nyou of the truth of what I say, here is Don Quixote himself, who will\r\nmaintain it by arms, on foot or on horseback or in any way you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so saying he stood up and laid his hand on his sword, waiting to\r\nsee what the Knight of the Grove would do, who in an equally calm voice\r\nsaid in reply, \xe2\x80\x9cPledges don\xe2\x80\x99t distress a good payer; he who has\r\nsucceeded in vanquishing you once when transformed, Sir Don Quixote,\r\nmay fairly hope to subdue you in your own proper shape; but as it is\r\nnot becoming for knights to perform their feats of arms in the dark,\r\nlike highwaymen and bullies, let us wait till daylight, that the sun\r\nmay behold our deeds; and the conditions of our combat shall be that\r\nthe vanquished shall be at the victor\xe2\x80\x99s disposal, to do all that he may\r\nenjoin, provided the injunction be such as shall be becoming a knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am more than satisfied with these conditions and terms,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don\r\nQuixote; and so saying, they betook themselves to where their squires\r\nlay, and found them snoring, and in the same posture they were in when\r\nsleep fell upon them. They roused them up, and bade them get the horses\r\nready, as at sunrise they were to engage in a bloody and arduous single\r\ncombat; at which intelligence Sancho was aghast and thunderstruck,\r\ntrembling for the safety of his master because of the mighty deeds he\r\nhad heard the squire of the Grove ascribe to his; but without a word\r\nthe two squires went in quest of their cattle; for by this time the\r\nthree horses and the ass had smelt one another out, and were all\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nOn the way, he of the Grove said to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must know, brother,\r\nthat it is the custom with the fighting men of Andalusia, when they are\r\ngodfathers in any quarrel, not to stand idle with folded arms while\r\ntheir godsons fight; I say so to remind you that while our masters are\r\nfighting, we, too, have to fight, and knock one another to shivers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat custom, sir squire,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cmay hold good among those\r\nbullies and fighting men you talk of, but certainly not among the\r\nsquires of knights-errant; at least, I have never heard my master speak\r\nof any custom of the sort, and he knows all the laws of knight-errantry\r\nby heart; but granting it true that there is an express law that\r\nsquires are to fight while their masters are fighting, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to\r\nobey it, but to pay the penalty that may be laid on peacefully minded\r\nsquires like myself; for I am sure it cannot be more than two pounds of\r\nwax, and I would rather pay that, for I know it will cost me less than\r\nthe lint I shall be at the expense of to mend my head, which I look\r\nupon as broken and split already; there\xe2\x80\x99s another thing that makes it\r\nimpossible for me to fight, that I have no sword, for I never carried\r\none in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know a good remedy for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove; \xe2\x80\x9cI have here two\r\nlinen bags of the same size; you shall take one, and I the other, and\r\nwe will fight at bag blows with equal arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s the way, so be it with all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor that\r\nsort of battle will serve to knock the dust out of us instead of\r\nhurting us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will not do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we must put into the bags, to\r\nkeep the wind from blowing them away, half a dozen nice smooth pebbles,\r\nall of the same weight; and in this way we shall be able to baste one\r\nanother without doing ourselves any harm or mischief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBody of my father!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9csee what marten and sable, and pads\r\nof carded cotton he is putting into the bags, that our heads may not be\r\nbroken and our bones beaten to jelly! But even if they are filled with\r\ntoss silk, I can tell you, se\xc3\xb1or, I am not going to fight; let our\r\nmasters fight, that\xe2\x80\x99s their lookout, and let us drink and live; for\r\ntime will take care to ease us of our lives, without our going to look\r\nfor fillips so that they may be finished off before their proper time\r\ncomes and they drop from ripeness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d returned he of the Grove, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must fight, if it be only for\r\nhalf an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to be so discourteous or so\r\nungrateful as to have any quarrel, be it ever so small, with one I have\r\neaten and drunk with; besides, who the devil could bring himself to\r\nfight in cold blood, without anger or provocation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can remedy that entirely,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove, \xe2\x80\x9cand in this way:\r\nbefore we begin the battle, I will come up to your worship fair and\r\nsoftly, and give you three or four buffets, with which I shall stretch\r\nyou at my feet and rouse your anger, though it were sleeping sounder\r\nthan a dormouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo match that plan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI have another that is not a whit\r\nbehind it; I will take a cudgel, and before your worship comes near\r\nenough to waken my anger I will send yours so sound to sleep with\r\nwhacks, that it won\xe2\x80\x99t waken unless it be in the other world, where it\r\nis known that I am not a man to let my face be handled by anyone; let\r\neach look out for the arrow\xe2\x80\x94though the surer way would be to let\r\neveryone\xe2\x80\x99s anger sleep, for nobody knows the heart of anyone, and a man\r\nmay come for wool and go back shorn; God gave his blessing to peace and\r\nhis curse to quarrels; if a hunted cat, surrounded and hard pressed,\r\nturns into a lion, God knows what I, who am a man, may turn into; and\r\nso from this time forth I warn you, sir squire, that all the harm and\r\nmischief that may come of our quarrel will be put down to your\r\naccount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Grove; \xe2\x80\x9cGod will send the dawn and we shall\r\nbe all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now gay-plumaged birds of all sorts began to warble in the trees,\r\nand with their varied and gladsome notes seemed to welcome and salute\r\nthe fresh morn that was beginning to show the beauty of her countenance\r\nat the gates and balconies of the east, shaking from her locks a\r\nprofusion of liquid pearls; in which dulcet moisture bathed, the\r\nplants, too, seemed to shed and shower down a pearly spray, the willows\r\ndistilled sweet manna, the fountains laughed, the brooks babbled, the\r\nwoods rejoiced, and the meadows arrayed themselves in all their glory\r\nat her coming. But hardly had the light of day made it possible to see\r\nand distinguish things, when the first object that presented itself to\r\nthe eyes of Sancho Panza was the squire of the Grove\xe2\x80\x99s nose, which was\r\nso big that it almost overshadowed his whole body. It is, in fact,\r\nstated, that it was of enormous size, hooked in the middle, covered\r\nwith warts, and of a mulberry colour like an egg-plant; it hung down\r\ntwo fingers\xe2\x80\x99 length below his mouth, and the size, the colour, the\r\nwarts, and the bend of it, made his face so hideous, that Sancho, as he\r\nlooked at him, began to tremble hand and foot like a child in\r\nconvulsions, and he vowed in his heart to let himself be given two\r\nhundred buffets, sooner than be provoked to fight that monster. Don\r\nQuixote examined his adversary, and found that he already had his\r\nhelmet on and visor lowered, so that he could not see his face; he\r\nobserved, however, that he was a sturdily built man, but not very tall\r\nin stature. Over his armour he wore a surcoat or cassock of what seemed\r\nto be the finest cloth of gold, all bespangled with glittering mirrors\r\nlike little moons, which gave him an extremely gallant and splendid\r\nappearance; above his helmet fluttered a great quantity of plumes,\r\ngreen, yellow, and white, and his lance, which was leaning against a\r\ntree, was very long and stout, and had a steel point more than a palm\r\nin length.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote observed all, and took note of all, and from what he saw\r\nand observed he concluded that the said knight must be a man of great\r\nstrength, but he did not for all that give way to fear, like Sancho\r\nPanza; on the contrary, with a composed and dauntless air, he said to\r\nthe Knight of the Mirrors, \xe2\x80\x9cIf, sir knight, your great eagerness to\r\nfight has not banished your courtesy, by it I would entreat you to\r\nraise your visor a little, in order that I may see if the comeliness of\r\nyour countenance corresponds with that of your equipment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether you come victorious or vanquished out of this emprise, sir\r\nknight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he of the Mirrors, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will have more than enough\r\ntime and leisure to see me; and if now I do not comply with your\r\nrequest, it is because it seems to me I should do a serious wrong to\r\nthe fair Casildea de Vandalia in wasting time while I stopped to raise\r\nmy visor before compelling you to confess what you are already aware I\r\nmaintain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile we are mounting you can at least\r\ntell me if I am that Don Quixote whom you said you vanquished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo that we answer you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the Mirrors, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are as like\r\nthe very knight I vanquished as one egg is like another, but as you say\r\nenchanters persecute you, I will not venture to say positively whether\r\nyou are the said person or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cis enough to convince me that you are under\r\na deception; however, entirely to relieve you of it, let our horses be\r\nbrought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your visor,\r\nif God, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, I shall see your\r\nface, and you shall see that I am not the vanquished Don Quixote you\r\ntake me to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and Don Quixote\r\nwheeled Rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to charge\r\nback upon his adversary, and he of the Mirrors did the same; but Don\r\nQuixote had not moved away twenty paces when he heard himself called by\r\nthe other, and, each returning half-way, he of the Mirrors said to him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that the\r\nvanquished, as I said before, shall be at the victor\xe2\x80\x99s disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am aware of it already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cprovided what is\r\ncommanded and imposed upon the vanquished be things that do not\r\ntransgress the limits of chivalry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is understood,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he of the Mirrors.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the extraordinary nose of the squire presented itself to\r\nDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s view, and he was no less amazed than Sancho at the sight;\r\ninsomuch that he set him down as a monster of some kind, or a human\r\nbeing of some new species or unearthly breed. Sancho, seeing his master\r\nretiring to run his course, did not like to be left alone with the nosy\r\nman, fearing that with one flap of that nose on his own the battle\r\nwould be all over for him and he would be left stretched on the ground,\r\neither by the blow or with fright; so he ran after his master, holding\r\non to Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s stirrup-leather, and when it seemed to him time to\r\nturn about, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI implore of your worship, se\xc3\xb1or, before you turn\r\nto charge, to help me up into this cork tree, from which I will be able\r\nto witness the gallant encounter your worship is going to have with\r\nthis knight, more to my taste and better than from the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me rather, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat thou wouldst\r\nmount a scaffold in order to see the bulls without danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthe monstrous nose of that\r\nsquire has filled me with fear and terror, and I dare not stay near\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9csuch a one that were I not what I am it\r\nwould terrify me too; so, come, I will help thee up where thou wilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Don Quixote waited for Sancho to mount into the cork tree he of\r\nthe Mirrors took as much ground as he considered requisite, and,\r\nsupposing Don Quixote to have done the same, without waiting for any\r\nsound of trumpet or other signal to direct them, he wheeled his horse,\r\nwhich was not more agile or better-looking than Rocinante, and at his\r\ntop speed, which was an easy trot, he proceeded to charge his enemy;\r\nseeing him, however, engaged in putting Sancho up, he drew rein, and\r\nhalted in mid career, for which his horse was very grateful, as he was\r\nalready unable to go. Don Quixote, fancying that his foe was coming\r\ndown upon him flying, drove his spurs vigorously into Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s lean\r\nflanks and made him scud along in such style that the history tells us\r\nthat on this occasion only was he known to make something like running,\r\nfor on all others it was a simple trot with him; and with this\r\nunparalleled fury he bore down where he of the Mirrors stood digging\r\nhis spurs into his horse up to buttons, without being able to make him\r\nstir a finger\xe2\x80\x99s length from the spot where he had come to a standstill\r\nin his course. At this lucky moment and crisis, Don Quixote came upon\r\nhis adversary, in trouble with his horse, and embarrassed with his\r\nlance, which he either could not manage, or had no time to lay in rest.\r\nDon Quixote, however, paid no attention to these difficulties, and in\r\nperfect safety to himself and without any risk encountered him of the\r\nMirrors with such force that he brought him to the ground in spite of\r\nhimself over the haunches of his horse, and with so heavy a fall that\r\nhe lay to all appearance dead, not stirring hand or foot. The instant\r\nSancho saw him fall he slid down from the cork tree, and made all haste\r\nto where his master was, who, dismounting from Rocinante, went and\r\nstood over him of the Mirrors, and unlacing his helmet to see if he was\r\ndead, and to give him air if he should happen to be alive, he saw\xe2\x80\x94who\r\ncan say what he saw, without filling all who hear it with astonishment,\r\nwonder, and awe? He saw, the history says, the very countenance, the\r\nvery face, the very look, the very physiognomy, the very effigy, the\r\nvery image of the bachelor Samson Carrasco! As soon as he saw it he\r\ncalled out in a loud voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMake haste here, Sancho, and behold what\r\nthou art to see but not to believe; quick, my son, and learn what magic\r\ncan do, and wizards and enchanters are capable of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho came up, and when he saw the countenance of the bachelor\r\nCarrasco, he fell to crossing himself a thousand times, and blessing\r\nhimself as many more. All this time the prostrate knight showed no\r\nsigns of life, and Sancho said to Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my opinion,\r\nse\xc3\xb1or, that in any case your worship should take and thrust your sword\r\ninto the mouth of this one here that looks like the bachelor Samson\r\nCarrasco; perhaps in him you will kill one of your enemies, the\r\nenchanters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy advice is not bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor of enemies the fewer\r\nthe better;\xe2\x80\x9d and he was drawing his sword to carry into effect Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncounsel and suggestion, when the squire of the Mirrors came up, now\r\nwithout the nose which had made him so hideous, and cried out in a loud\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cMind what you are about, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote; that is your\r\nfriend, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, you have at your feet, and I am\r\nhis squire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the nose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, seeing him without the hideous feature he\r\nhad before; to which he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI have it here in my pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nputting his hand into his right pocket, he pulled out a masquerade nose\r\nof varnished pasteboard of the make already described; and Sancho,\r\nexamining him more and more closely, exclaimed aloud in a voice of\r\namazement, \xe2\x80\x9cHoly Mary be good to me! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it Tom Cecial, my neighbour\r\nand gossip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to be sure I am!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the now unnosed squire; \xe2\x80\x9cTom Cecial I\r\nam, gossip and friend Sancho Panza; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you presently the\r\nmeans and tricks and falsehoods by which I have been brought here; but\r\nin the meantime, beg and entreat of your master not to touch, maltreat,\r\nwound, or slay the Knight of the Mirrors whom he has at his feet;\r\nbecause, beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised bachelor\r\nSamson Carrasco, our fellow townsman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment he of the Mirrors came to himself, and Don Quixote\r\nperceiving it, held the naked point of his sword over his face, and\r\nsaid to him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a dead man, knight, unless you confess that the\r\npeerless Dulcinea del Toboso excels your Casildea de Vandalia in\r\nbeauty; and in addition to this you must promise, if you should survive\r\nthis encounter and fall, to go to the city of El Toboso and present\r\nyourself before her on my behalf, that she deal with you according to\r\nher good pleasure; and if she leaves you free to do yours, you are in\r\nlike manner to return and seek me out (for the trail of my mighty deeds\r\nwill serve you as a guide to lead you to where I may be), and tell me\r\nwhat may have passed between you and her\xe2\x80\x94conditions which, in\r\naccordance with what we stipulated before our combat, do not transgress\r\nthe just limits of knight-errantry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fallen knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the dirty tattered shoe of\r\nthe lady Dulcinea del Toboso is better than the ill-combed though clean\r\nbeard of Casildea; and I promise to go and to return from her presence\r\nto yours, and to give you a full and particular account of all you\r\ndemand of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must also confess and believe,\xe2\x80\x9d added Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the\r\nknight you vanquished was not and could not be Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha, but someone else in his likeness, just as I confess and believe\r\nthat you, though you seem to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, are not\r\nso, but some other resembling him, whom my enemies have here put before\r\nme in his shape, in order that I may restrain and moderate the\r\nvehemence of my wrath, and make a gentle use of the glory of my\r\nvictory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess, hold, and think everything to be as you believe, hold, and\r\nthink it,\xe2\x80\x9d the crippled knight; \xe2\x80\x9clet me rise, I entreat you; if,\r\nindeed, the shock of my fall will allow me, for it has left me in a\r\nsorry plight enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote helped him to rise, with the assistance of his squire Tom\r\nCecial; from whom Sancho never took his eyes, and to whom he put\r\nquestions, the replies to which furnished clear proof that he was\r\nreally and truly the Tom Cecial he said; but the impression made on\r\nSancho\xe2\x80\x99s mind by what his master said about the enchanters having\r\nchanged the face of the Knight of the Mirrors into that of the bachelor\r\nSamson Carrasco, would not permit him to believe what he saw with his\r\neyes. In fine, both master and man remained under the delusion; and,\r\ndown in the mouth, and out of luck, he of the Mirrors and his squire\r\nparted from Don Quixote and Sancho, he meaning to go look for some\r\nvillage where he could plaster and strap his ribs. Don Quixote and\r\nSancho resumed their journey to Saragossa, and on it the history leaves\r\nthem in order that it may tell who the Knight of the Mirrors and his\r\nlong-nosed squire were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np14e.jpg (56K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nWHEREIN IT IS TOLD AND KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS AND HIS\r\nSQUIRE WERE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np15a.jpg (122K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote went off satisfied, elated, and vain-glorious in the\r\nhighest degree at having won a victory over such a valiant knight as he\r\nfancied him of the Mirrors to be, and one from whose knightly word he\r\nexpected to learn whether the enchantment of his lady still continued;\r\ninasmuch as the said vanquished knight was bound, under the penalty of\r\nceasing to be one, to return and render him an account of what took\r\nplace between him and her. But Don Quixote was of one mind, he of the\r\nMirrors of another, for he just then had no thought of anything but\r\nfinding some village where he could plaster himself, as has been said\r\nalready. The history goes on to say, then, that when the bachelor\r\nSamson Carrasco recommended Don Quixote to resume his knight-errantry\r\nwhich he had laid aside, it was in consequence of having been\r\npreviously in conclave with the curate and the barber on the means to\r\nbe adopted to induce Don Quixote to stay at home in peace and quiet\r\nwithout worrying himself with his ill-starred adventures; at which\r\nconsultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of all, and on the\r\nspecial advice of Carrasco, that Don Quixote should be allowed to go,\r\nas it seemed impossible to restrain him, and that Samson should sally\r\nforth to meet him as a knight-errant, and do battle with him, for there\r\nwould be no difficulty about a cause, and vanquish him, that being\r\nlooked upon as an easy matter; and that it should be agreed and settled\r\nthat the vanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor. Then, Don\r\nQuixote being vanquished, the bachelor knight was to command him to\r\nreturn to his village and his house, and not quit it for two years, or\r\nuntil he received further orders from him; all which it was clear Don\r\nQuixote would unhesitatingly obey, rather than contravene or fail to\r\nobserve the laws of chivalry; and during the period of his seclusion he\r\nmight perhaps forget his folly, or there might be an opportunity of\r\ndiscovering some ready remedy for his madness. Carrasco undertook the\r\ntask, and Tom Cecial, a gossip and neighbour of Sancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s, a\r\nlively, feather-headed fellow, offered himself as his squire. Carrasco\r\narmed himself in the fashion described, and Tom Cecial, that he might\r\nnot be known by his gossip when they met, fitted on over his own\r\nnatural nose the false masquerade one that has been mentioned; and so\r\nthey followed the same route Don Quixote took, and almost came up with\r\nhim in time to be present at the adventure of the cart of Death and\r\nfinally encountered them in the grove, where all that the sagacious\r\nreader has been reading about took place; and had it not been for the\r\nextraordinary fancies of Don Quixote, and his conviction that the\r\nbachelor was not the bachelor, se\xc3\xb1or bachelor would have been\r\nincapacitated for ever from taking his degree of licentiate, all\r\nthrough not finding nests where he thought to find birds.\r\n\r\nTom Cecial, seeing how ill they had succeeded, and what a sorry end\r\ntheir expedition had come to, said to the bachelor, \xe2\x80\x9cSure enough, Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nSamson Carrasco, we are served right; it is easy enough to plan and set\r\nabout an enterprise, but it is often a difficult matter to come well\r\nout of it. Don Quixote a madman, and we sane; he goes off laughing,\r\nsafe, and sound, and you are left sore and sorry! I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know now\r\nwhich is the madder, he who is so because he cannot help it, or he who\r\nis so of his own choice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Samson replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThe difference between the two sorts of\r\nmadmen is, that he who is so will he nil he, will be one always, while\r\nhe who is so of his own accord can leave off being one whenever he\r\nlikes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Cecial, \xe2\x80\x9cI was a madman of my own accord when\r\nI volunteered to become your squire, and, of my own accord, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave\r\noff being one and go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s your affair,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Samson, \xe2\x80\x9cbut to suppose that I am going\r\nhome until I have given Don Quixote a thrashing is absurd; and it is\r\nnot any wish that he may recover his senses that will make me hunt him\r\nout now, but a wish for the sore pain I am in with my ribs won\xe2\x80\x99t let me\r\nentertain more charitable thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus discoursing, the pair proceeded until they reached a town where it\r\nwas their good luck to find a bone-setter, with whose help the\r\nunfortunate Samson was cured. Tom Cecial left him and went home, while\r\nhe stayed behind meditating vengeance; and the history will return to\r\nhim again at the proper time, so as not to omit making merry with Don\r\nQuixote now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np15e.jpg (17K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nOF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH A DISCREET GENTLEMAN OF LA MANCHA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np16a.jpg (85K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote pursued his journey in the high spirits, satisfaction, and\r\nself-complacency already described, fancying himself the most valorous\r\nknight-errant of the age in the world because of his late victory. All\r\nthe adventures that could befall him from that time forth he regarded\r\nas already done and brought to a happy issue; he made light of\r\nenchantments and enchanters; he thought no more of the countless\r\ndrubbings that had been administered to him in the course of his\r\nknight-errantry, nor of the volley of stones that had levelled half his\r\nteeth, nor of the ingratitude of the galley slaves, nor of the audacity\r\nof the Yanguesans and the shower of stakes that fell upon him; in\r\nshort, he said to himself that could he discover any means, mode, or\r\nway of disenchanting his lady Dulcinea, he would not envy the highest\r\nfortune that the most fortunate knight-errant of yore ever reached or\r\ncould reach.\r\n\r\nHe was going along entirely absorbed in these fancies, when Sancho said\r\nto him, \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it odd, se\xc3\xb1or, that I have still before my eyes that\r\nmonstrous enormous nose of my gossip, Tom Cecial?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd dost thou, then, believe, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the\r\nKnight of the Mirrors was the bachelor Carrasco, and his squire Tom\r\nCecial thy gossip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say to that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9call I know is that\r\nthe tokens he gave me about my own house, wife and children, nobody\r\nelse but himself could have given me; and the face, once the nose was\r\noff, was the very face of Tom Cecial, as I have seen it many a time in\r\nmy town and next door to my own house; and the sound of the voice was\r\njust the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us reason the matter, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cCome now, by\r\nwhat process of thinking can it be supposed that the bachelor Samson\r\nCarrasco would come as a knight-errant, in arms offensive and\r\ndefensive, to fight with me? Have I ever been by any chance his enemy?\r\nHave I ever given him any occasion to owe me a grudge? Am I his rival,\r\nor does he profess arms, that he should envy the fame I have acquired\r\nin them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but what are we to say, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cabout that\r\nknight, whoever he is, being so like the bachelor Carrasco, and his\r\nsquire so like my gossip, Tom Cecial? And if that be enchantment, as\r\nyour worship says, was there no other pair in the world for them to\r\ntake the likeness of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9ca scheme and plot of the malignant\r\nmagicians that persecute me, who, foreseeing that I was to be\r\nvictorious in the conflict, arranged that the vanquished knight should\r\ndisplay the countenance of my friend the bachelor, in order that the\r\nfriendship I bear him should interpose to stay the edge of my sword and\r\nmight of my arm, and temper the just wrath of my heart; so that he who\r\nsought to take my life by fraud and falsehood should save his own. And\r\nto prove it, thou knowest already, Sancho, by experience which cannot\r\nlie or deceive, how easy it is for enchanters to change one countenance\r\ninto another, turning fair into foul, and foul into fair; for it is not\r\ntwo days since thou sawest with thine own eyes the beauty and elegance\r\nof the peerless Dulcinea in all its perfection and natural harmony,\r\nwhile I saw her in the repulsive and mean form of a coarse country\r\nwench, with cataracts in her eyes and a foul smell in her mouth; and\r\nwhen the perverse enchanter ventured to effect so wicked a\r\ntransformation, it is no wonder if he effected that of Samson Carrasco\r\nand thy gossip in order to snatch the glory of victory out of my grasp.\r\nFor all that, however, I console myself, because, after all, in\r\nwhatever shape he may have been, I have been victorious over my enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows what\xe2\x80\x99s the truth of it all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; and knowing as he\r\ndid that the transformation of Dulcinea had been a device and\r\nimposition of his own, his master\xe2\x80\x99s illusions were not satisfactory to\r\nhim; but he did not like to reply lest he should say something that\r\nmight disclose his trickery.\r\n\r\nAs they were engaged in this conversation they were overtaken by a man\r\nwho was following the same road behind them, mounted on a very handsome\r\nflea-bitten mare, and dressed in a gaban of fine green cloth, with\r\ntawny velvet facings, and a montera of the same velvet. The trappings\r\nof the mare were of the field and jineta fashion, and of mulberry\r\ncolour and green. He carried a Moorish cutlass hanging from a broad\r\ngreen and gold baldric; the buskins were of the same make as the\r\nbaldric; the spurs were not gilt, but lacquered green, and so brightly\r\npolished that, matching as they did the rest of his apparel, they\r\nlooked better than if they had been of pure gold.\r\n\r\nWhen the traveller came up with them he saluted them courteously, and\r\nspurring his mare was passing them without stopping, but Don Quixote\r\ncalled out to him, \xe2\x80\x9cGallant sir, if so be your worship is going our\r\nroad, and has no occasion for speed, it would be a pleasure to me if we\r\nwere to join company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he on the mare, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not pass you so hastily\r\nbut for fear that horse might turn restive in the company of my mare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may safely hold in your mare, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho in reply to\r\nthis, \xe2\x80\x9cfor our horse is the most virtuous and well-behaved horse in the\r\nworld; he never does anything wrong on such occasions, and the only\r\ntime he misbehaved, my master and I suffered for it sevenfold; I say\r\nagain your worship may pull up if you like; for if she was offered to\r\nhim between two plates the horse would not hanker after her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe traveller drew rein, amazed at the trim and features of Don\r\nQuixote, who rode without his helmet, which Sancho carried like a\r\nvalise in front of Dapple\xe2\x80\x99s pack-saddle; and if the man in green\r\nexamined Don Quixote closely, still more closely did Don Quixote\r\nexamine the man in green, who struck him as being a man of\r\nintelligence. In appearance he was about fifty years of age, with but\r\nfew grey hairs, an aquiline cast of features, and an expression between\r\ngrave and gay; and his dress and accoutrements showed him to be a man\r\nof good condition. What he in green thought of Don Quixote of La Mancha\r\nwas that a man of that sort and shape he had never yet seen; he\r\nmarvelled at the length of his hair, his lofty stature, the lankness\r\nand sallowness of his countenance, his armour, his bearing and his\r\ngravity\xe2\x80\x94a figure and picture such as had not been seen in those regions\r\nfor many a long day.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote saw very plainly the attention with which the traveller was\r\nregarding him, and read his curiosity in his astonishment; and\r\ncourteous as he was and ready to please everybody, before the other\r\ncould ask him any question he anticipated him by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nappearance I present to your worship being so strange and so out of the\r\ncommon, I should not be surprised if it filled you with wonder; but you\r\nwill cease to wonder when I tell you, as I do, that I am one of those\r\nknights who, as people say, go seeking adventures. I have left my home,\r\nI have mortgaged my estate, I have given up my comforts, and committed\r\nmyself to the arms of Fortune, to bear me whithersoever she may please.\r\nMy desire was to bring to life again knight-errantry, now dead, and for\r\nsome time past, stumbling here, falling there, now coming down\r\nheadlong, now raising myself up again, I have carried out a great\r\nportion of my design, succouring widows, protecting maidens, and giving\r\naid to wives, orphans, and minors, the proper and natural duty of\r\nknights-errant; and, therefore, because of my many valiant and\r\nChristian achievements, I have been already found worthy to make my way\r\nin print to well-nigh all, or most, of the nations of the earth. Thirty\r\nthousand volumes of my history have been printed, and it is on the\r\nhigh-road to be printed thirty thousand thousands of times, if heaven\r\ndoes not put a stop to it. In short, to sum up all in a few words, or\r\nin a single one, I may tell you I am Don Quixote of La Mancha,\r\notherwise called \xe2\x80\x98The Knight of the Rueful Countenance;\xe2\x80\x99 for though\r\nself-praise is degrading, I must perforce sound my own sometimes, that\r\nis to say, when there is no one at hand to do it for me. So that,\r\ngentle sir, neither this horse, nor this lance, nor this shield, nor\r\nthis squire, nor all these arms put together, nor the sallowness of my\r\ncountenance, nor my gaunt leanness, will henceforth astonish you, now\r\nthat you know who I am and what profession I follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words Don Quixote held his peace, and, from the time he took\r\nto answer, the man in green seemed to be at a loss for a reply; after a\r\nlong pause, however, he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou were right when you saw\r\ncuriosity in my amazement, sir knight; but you have not succeeded in\r\nremoving the astonishment I feel at seeing you; for although you say,\r\nse\xc3\xb1or, that knowing who you are ought to remove it, it has not done so;\r\non the contrary, now that I know, I am left more amazed and astonished\r\nthan before. What! is it possible that there are knights-errant in the\r\nworld in these days, and histories of real chivalry printed? I cannot\r\nrealise the fact that there can be anyone on earth now-a-days who aids\r\nwidows, or protects maidens, or defends wives, or succours orphans; nor\r\nshould I believe it had I not seen it in your worship with my own eyes.\r\nBlessed be heaven! for by means of this history of your noble and\r\ngenuine chivalrous deeds, which you say has been printed, the countless\r\nstories of fictitious knights-errant with which the world is filled, so\r\nmuch to the injury of morality and the prejudice and discredit of good\r\nhistories, will have been driven into oblivion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a good deal to be said on that point,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nto whether the histories of the knights-errant are fiction or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, is there anyone who doubts that those histories are false?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe man in green.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut never mind that just now; if our\r\njourney lasts long enough, I trust in God I shall show your worship\r\nthat you do wrong in going with the stream of those who regard it as a\r\nmatter of certainty that they are not true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom this last observation of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s, the traveller began to\r\nhave a suspicion that he was some crazy being, and was waiting for him\r\nto confirm it by something further; but before they could turn to any\r\nnew subject Don Quixote begged him to tell him who he was, since he\r\nhimself had rendered account of his station and life. To this, he in\r\nthe green gaban replied \xe2\x80\x9cI, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, am a\r\ngentleman by birth, native of the village where, please God, we are\r\ngoing to dine to-day; I am more than fairly well off, and my name is\r\nDon Diego de Miranda. I pass my life with my wife, children, and\r\nfriends; my pursuits are hunting and fishing, but I keep neither hawks\r\nnor greyhounds, nothing but a tame partridge or a bold ferret or two; I\r\nhave six dozen or so of books, some in our mother tongue, some Latin,\r\nsome of them history, others devotional; those of chivalry have not as\r\nyet crossed the threshold of my door; I am more given to turning over\r\nthe profane than the devotional, so long as they are books of honest\r\nentertainment that charm by their style and attract and interest by the\r\ninvention they display, though of these there are very few in Spain.\r\nSometimes I dine with my neighbours and friends, and often invite them;\r\nmy entertainments are neat and well served without stint of anything. I\r\nhave no taste for tattle, nor do I allow tattling in my presence; I pry\r\nnot into my neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 lives, nor have I lynx-eyes for what others do.\r\nI hear mass every day; I share my substance with the poor, making no\r\ndisplay of good works, lest I let hypocrisy and vainglory, those\r\nenemies that subtly take possession of the most watchful heart, find an\r\nentrance into mine. I strive to make peace between those whom I know to\r\nbe at variance; I am the devoted servant of Our Lady, and my trust is\r\never in the infinite mercy of God our Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho listened with the greatest attention to the account of the\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s life and occupation; and thinking it a good and a holy\r\nlife, and that he who led it ought to work miracles, he threw himself\r\noff Dapple, and running in haste seized his right stirrup and kissed\r\nhis foot again and again with a devout heart and almost with tears.\r\n\r\nSeeing this the gentleman asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you about, brother? What\r\nare these kisses for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me kiss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I think your worship is the first\r\nsaint in the saddle I ever saw all the days of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no saint,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a great sinner; but you\r\nare, brother, for you must be a good fellow, as your simplicity shows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho went back and regained his pack-saddle, having extracted a laugh\r\nfrom his master\xe2\x80\x99s profound melancholy, and excited fresh amazement in\r\nDon Diego. Don Quixote then asked him how many children he had, and\r\nobserved that one of the things wherein the ancient philosophers, who\r\nwere without the true knowledge of God, placed the _summum bonum_ was\r\nin the gifts of nature, in those of fortune, in having many friends,\r\nand many and good children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9chave one son, without\r\nwhom, perhaps, I should count myself happier than I am, not because he\r\nis a bad son, but because he is not so good as I could wish. He is\r\neighteen years of age; he has been for six at Salamanca studying Latin\r\nand Greek, and when I wished him to turn to the study of other sciences\r\nI found him so wrapped up in that of poetry (if that can be called a\r\nscience) that there is no getting him to take kindly to the law, which\r\nI wished him to study, or to theology, the queen of them all. I would\r\nlike him to be an honour to his family, as we live in days when our\r\nkings liberally reward learning that is virtuous and worthy; for\r\nlearning without virtue is a pearl on a dunghill. He spends the whole\r\nday in settling whether Homer expressed himself correctly or not in\r\nsuch and such a line of the Iliad, whether Martial was indecent or not\r\nin such and such an epigram, whether such and such lines of Virgil are\r\nto be understood in this way or in that; in short, all his talk is of\r\nthe works of these poets, and those of Horace, Perseus, Juvenal, and\r\nTibullus; for of the moderns in our own language he makes no great\r\naccount; but with all his seeming indifference to Spanish poetry, just\r\nnow his thoughts are absorbed in making a gloss on four lines that have\r\nbeen sent him from Salamanca, which I suspect are for some poetical\r\ntournament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo all this Don Quixote said in reply, \xe2\x80\x9cChildren, se\xc3\xb1or, are portions\r\nof their parents\xe2\x80\x99 bowels, and therefore, be they good or bad, are to be\r\nloved as we love the souls that give us life; it is for the parents to\r\nguide them from infancy in the ways of virtue, propriety, and worthy\r\nChristian conduct, so that when grown up they may be the staff of their\r\nparents\xe2\x80\x99 old age, and the glory of their posterity; and to force them\r\nto study this or that science I do not think wise, though it may be no\r\nharm to persuade them; and when there is no need to study for the sake\r\nof _pane lucrando_, and it is the student\xe2\x80\x99s good fortune that heaven\r\nhas given him parents who provide him with it, it would be my advice to\r\nthem to let him pursue whatever science they may see him most inclined\r\nto; and though that of poetry is less useful than pleasurable, it is\r\nnot one of those that bring discredit upon the possessor. Poetry,\r\ngentle sir, is, as I take it, like a tender young maiden of supreme\r\nbeauty, to array, bedeck, and adorn whom is the task of several other\r\nmaidens, who are all the rest of the sciences; and she must avail\r\nherself of the help of all, and all derive their lustre from her. But\r\nthis maiden will not bear to be handled, nor dragged through the\r\nstreets, nor exposed either at the corners of the market-places, or in\r\nthe closets of palaces. She is the product of an Alchemy of such virtue\r\nthat he who is able to practise it, will turn her into pure gold of\r\ninestimable worth. He that possesses her must keep her within bounds,\r\nnot permitting her to break out in ribald satires or soulless sonnets.\r\nShe must on no account be offered for sale, unless, indeed, it be in\r\nheroic poems, moving tragedies, or sprightly and ingenious comedies.\r\nShe must not be touched by the buffoons, nor by the ignorant vulgar,\r\nincapable of comprehending or appreciating her hidden treasures. And do\r\nnot suppose, se\xc3\xb1or, that I apply the term vulgar here merely to\r\nplebeians and the lower orders; for everyone who is ignorant, be he\r\nlord or prince, may and should be included among the vulgar. He, then,\r\nwho shall embrace and cultivate poetry under the conditions I have\r\nnamed, shall become famous, and his name honoured throughout all the\r\ncivilised nations of the earth. And with regard to what you say, se\xc3\xb1or,\r\nof your son having no great opinion of Spanish poetry, I am inclined to\r\nthink that he is not quite right there, and for this reason: the great\r\npoet Homer did not write in Latin, because he was a Greek, nor did\r\nVirgil write in Greek, because he was a Latin; in short, all the\r\nancient poets wrote in the language they imbibed with their mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmilk, and never went in quest of foreign ones to express their sublime\r\nconceptions; and that being so, the usage should in justice extend to\r\nall nations, and the German poet should not be undervalued because he\r\nwrites in his own language, nor the Castilian, nor even the Biscayan,\r\nfor writing in his. But your son, se\xc3\xb1or, I suspect, is not prejudiced\r\nagainst Spanish poetry, but against those poets who are mere Spanish\r\nverse writers, without any knowledge of other languages or sciences to\r\nadorn and give life and vigour to their natural inspiration; and yet\r\neven in this he may be wrong; for, according to a true belief, a poet\r\nis born one; that is to say, the poet by nature comes forth a poet from\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb; and following the bent that heaven has bestowed upon\r\nhim, without the aid of study or art, he produces things that show how\r\ntruly he spoke who said, \xe2\x80\x98_Est Deus in nobis_,\xe2\x80\x99 etc. At the same time,\r\nI say that the poet by nature who calls in art to his aid will be a far\r\nbetter poet, and will surpass him who tries to be one relying upon his\r\nknowledge of art alone. The reason is, that art does not surpass\r\nnature, but only brings it to perfection; and thus, nature combined\r\nwith art, and art with nature, will produce a perfect poet. To bring my\r\nargument to a close, I would say then, gentle sir, let your son go on\r\nas his star leads him, for being so studious as he seems to be, and\r\nhaving already successfully surmounted the first step of the sciences,\r\nwhich is that of the languages, with their help he will by his own\r\nexertions reach the summit of polite literature, which so well becomes\r\nan independent gentleman, and adorns, honours, and distinguishes him,\r\nas much as the mitre does the bishop, or the gown the learned\r\ncounsellor. If your son write satires reflecting on the honour of\r\nothers, chide and correct him, and tear them up; but if he compose\r\ndiscourses in which he rebukes vice in general, in the style of Horace,\r\nand with elegance like his, commend him; for it is legitimate for a\r\npoet to write against envy and lash the envious in his verse, and the\r\nother vices too, provided he does not single out individuals; there\r\nare, however, poets who, for the sake of saying something spiteful,\r\nwould run the risk of being banished to the coast of Pontus. If the\r\npoet be pure in his morals, he will be pure in his verses too; the pen\r\nis the tongue of the mind, and as the thought engendered there, so will\r\nbe the things that it writes down. And when kings and princes observe\r\nthis marvellous science of poetry in wise, virtuous, and thoughtful\r\nsubjects, they honour, value, exalt them, and even crown them with the\r\nleaves of that tree which the thunderbolt strikes not, as if to show\r\nthat they whose brows are honoured and adorned with such a crown are\r\nnot to be assailed by anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe of the green gaban was filled with astonishment at Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nargument, so much so that he began to abandon the notion he had taken\r\nup about his being crazy. But in the middle of the discourse, it being\r\nnot very much to his taste, Sancho had turned aside out of the road to\r\nbeg a little milk from some shepherds, who were milking their ewes hard\r\nby; and just as the gentleman, highly pleased, was about to renew the\r\nconversation, Don Quixote, raising his head, perceived a cart covered\r\nwith royal flags coming along the road they were travelling; and\r\npersuaded that this must be some new adventure, he called aloud to\r\nSancho to come and bring him his helmet. Sancho, hearing himself\r\ncalled, quitted the shepherds, and, prodding Dapple vigorously, came up\r\nto his master, to whom there fell a terrific and desperate adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np16e.jpg (49K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nWHEREIN IS SHOWN THE FURTHEST AND HIGHEST POINT WHICH THE UNEXAMPLED\r\nCOURAGE OF DON QUIXOTE REACHED OR COULD REACH; TOGETHER WITH THE\r\nHAPPILY ACHIEVED ADVENTURE OF THE LIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np17a.jpg (137K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history tells that when Don Quixote called out to Sancho to bring\r\nhim his helmet, Sancho was buying some curds the shepherds agreed to\r\nsell him, and flurried by the great haste his master was in did not\r\nknow what to do with them or what to carry them in; so, not to lose\r\nthem, for he had already paid for them, he thought it best to throw\r\nthem into his master\xe2\x80\x99s helmet, and acting on this bright idea he went\r\nto see what his master wanted with him. He, as he approached, exclaimed\r\nto him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me that helmet, my friend, for either I know little of\r\nadventures, or what I observe yonder is one that will, and does, call\r\nupon me to arm myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe of the green gaban, on hearing this, looked in all directions, but\r\ncould perceive nothing, except a cart coming towards them with two or\r\nthree small flags, which led him to conclude it must be carrying\r\ntreasure of the King\xe2\x80\x99s, and he said so to Don Quixote. He, however,\r\nwould not believe him, being always persuaded and convinced that all\r\nthat happened to him must be adventures and still more adventures; so\r\nhe replied to the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cHe who is prepared has his battle half\r\nfought; nothing is lost by my preparing myself, for I know by\r\nexperience that I have enemies, visible and invisible, and I know not\r\nwhen, or where, or at what moment, or in what shapes they will attack\r\nme;\xe2\x80\x9d and turning to Sancho, he called for his helmet; and Sancho, as he\r\nhad no time to take out the curds, had to give it just as it was. Don\r\nQuixote took it, and without perceiving what was in it thrust it down\r\nin hot haste upon his head; but as the curds were pressed and squeezed\r\nthe whey began to run all over his face and beard, whereat he was so\r\nstartled that he cried out to Sancho:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSancho, what\xe2\x80\x99s this? I think my head is softening, or my brains are\r\nmelting, or I am sweating from head to foot! If I am sweating it is not\r\nindeed from fear. I am convinced beyond a doubt that the adventure\r\nwhich is about to befall me is a terrible one. Give me something to\r\nwipe myself with, if thou hast it, for this profuse sweat is blinding\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho held his tongue, and gave him a cloth, and gave thanks to God at\r\nthe same time that his master had not found out what was the matter.\r\nDon Quixote then wiped himself, and took off his helmet to see what it\r\nwas that made his head feel so cool, and seeing all that white mash\r\ninside his helmet he put it to his nose, and as soon as he had smelt it\r\nhe exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the life of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, but it is curds thou hast\r\nput here, thou treacherous, impudent, ill-mannered squire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which, with great composure and pretended innocence, Sancho replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they are curds let me have them, your worship, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll eat them;\r\nbut let the devil eat them, for it must have been he who put them\r\nthere. I dare to dirty your helmet! You have guessed the offender\r\nfinely! Faith, sir, by the light God gives me, it seems I must have\r\nenchanters too, that persecute me as a creature and limb of your\r\nworship, and they must have put that nastiness there in order to\r\nprovoke your patience to anger, and make you baste my ribs as you are\r\nwont to do. Well, this time, indeed, they have missed their aim, for I\r\ntrust to my master\xe2\x80\x99s good sense to see that I have got no curds or\r\nmilk, or anything of the sort; and that if I had it is in my stomach I\r\nwould put it and not in the helmet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote. All this the gentleman was observing,\r\nand with astonishment, more especially when, after having wiped himself\r\nclean, his head, face, beard, and helmet, Don Quixote put it on, and\r\nsettling himself firmly in his stirrups, easing his sword in the\r\nscabbard, and grasping his lance, he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, come who will, here\r\nam I, ready to try conclusions with Satan himself in person!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time the cart with the flags had come up, unattended by anyone\r\nexcept the carter on a mule, and a man sitting in front. Don Quixote\r\nplanted himself before it and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhither are you going, brothers?\r\nWhat cart is this? What have you got in it? What flags are those?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this the carter replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThe cart is mine; what is in it is a pair\r\nof wild caged lions, which the governor of Oran is sending to court as\r\na present to his Majesty; and the flags are our lord the King\xe2\x80\x99s, to\r\nshow that what is here is his property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are the lions large?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo large,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man who sat at the door of the cart, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nlarger, or as large, have never crossed from Africa to Spain; I am the\r\nkeeper, and I have brought over others, but never any like these. They\r\nare male and female; the male is in that first cage and the female in\r\nthe one behind, and they are hungry now, for they have eaten nothing\r\nto-day, so let your worship stand aside, for we must make haste to the\r\nplace where we are to feed them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHereupon, smiling slightly, Don Quixote exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cLion-whelps to me!\r\nto me whelps of lions, and at such a time! Then, by God! those\r\ngentlemen who send them here shall see if I am a man to be frightened\r\nby lions. Get down, my good fellow, and as you are the keeper open the\r\ncages, and turn me out those beasts, and in the midst of this plain I\r\nwill let them know who Don Quixote of La Mancha is, in spite and in the\r\nteeth of the enchanters who send them to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman to himself at this; \xe2\x80\x9cour worthy knight has\r\nshown of what sort he is; the curds, no doubt, have softened his skull\r\nand brought his brains to a head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this instant Sancho came up to him, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake\r\ndo something to keep my master, Don Quixote, from tackling these lions;\r\nfor if he does they\xe2\x80\x99ll tear us all to pieces here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your master then so mad,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you believe\r\nand are afraid he will engage such fierce animals?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not mad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he is venturesome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will prevent it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman; and going over to Don Quixote,\r\nwho was insisting upon the keeper\xe2\x80\x99s opening the cages, he said to him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir knight, knights-errant should attempt adventures which encourage\r\nthe hope of a successful issue, not those which entirely withhold it;\r\nfor valour that trenches upon temerity savours rather of madness than\r\nof courage; moreover, these lions do not come to oppose you, nor do\r\nthey dream of such a thing; they are going as presents to his Majesty,\r\nand it will not be right to stop them or delay their journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentle sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cyou go and mind your tame partridge\r\nand your bold ferret, and leave everyone to manage his own business;\r\nthis is mine, and I know whether these gentlemen the lions come to me\r\nor not;\xe2\x80\x9d and then turning to the keeper he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cBy all that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood, sir scoundrel, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t open the cages this very instant,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll pin you to the cart with this lance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe carter, seeing the determination of this apparition in armour, said\r\nto him, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease your worship, for charity\xe2\x80\x99s sake, se\xc3\xb1or, let me unyoke\r\nthe mules and place myself in safety along with them before the lions\r\nare turned out; for if they kill them on me I am ruined for life, for\r\nall I possess is this cart and mules.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO man of little faith,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cget down and unyoke; you\r\nwill soon see that you are exerting yourself for nothing, and that you\r\nmight have spared yourself the trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe carter got down and with all speed unyoked the mules, and the\r\nkeeper called out at the top of his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI call all here to witness\r\nthat against my will and under compulsion I open the cages and let the\r\nlions loose, and that I warn this gentleman that he will be accountable\r\nfor all the harm and mischief which these beasts may do, and for my\r\nsalary and dues as well. You, gentlemen, place yourselves in safety\r\nbefore I open, for I know they will do me no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more the gentleman strove to persuade Don Quixote not to do such a\r\nmad thing, as it was tempting God to engage in such a piece of folly.\r\nTo this, Don Quixote replied that he knew what he was about. The\r\ngentleman in return entreated him to reflect, for he knew he was under\r\na delusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif you do not like to be a\r\nspectator of this tragedy, as in your opinion it will be, spur your\r\nflea-bitten mare, and place yourself in safety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing this, Sancho with tears in his eyes entreated him to give up an\r\nenterprise compared with which the one of the windmills, and the awful\r\none of the fulling mills, and, in fact, all the feats he had attempted\r\nin the whole course of his life, were cakes and fancy bread. \xe2\x80\x9cLook ye,\r\nse\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no enchantment here, nor anything of the\r\nsort, for between the bars and chinks of the cage I have seen the paw\r\nof a real lion, and judging by that I reckon the lion such a paw could\r\nbelong to must be bigger than a mountain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFear at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwill make him look bigger to\r\nthee than half the world. Retire, Sancho, and leave me; and if I die\r\nhere thou knowest our old compact; thou wilt repair to Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x94I say\r\nno more.\xe2\x80\x9d To these he added some further words that banished all hope\r\nof his giving up his insane project. He of the green gaban would have\r\noffered resistance, but he found himself ill-matched as to arms, and\r\ndid not think it prudent to come to blows with a madman, for such Don\r\nQuixote now showed himself to be in every respect; and the latter,\r\nrenewing his commands to the keeper and repeating his threats, gave\r\nwarning to the gentleman to spur his mare, Sancho his Dapple, and the\r\ncarter his mules, all striving to get away from the cart as far as they\r\ncould before the lions broke loose. Sancho was weeping over his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s death, for this time he firmly believed it was in store for\r\nhim from the claws of the lions; and he cursed his fate and called it\r\nan unlucky hour when he thought of taking service with him again; but\r\nwith all his tears and lamentations he did not forget to thrash Dapple\r\nso as to put a good space between himself and the cart. The keeper,\r\nseeing that the fugitives were now some distance off, once more\r\nentreated and warned him as before; but he replied that he heard him,\r\nand that he need not trouble himself with any further warnings or\r\nentreaties, as they would be fruitless, and bade him make haste.\r\n\r\nDuring the delay that occurred while the keeper was opening the first\r\ncage, Don Quixote was considering whether it would not be well to do\r\nbattle on foot, instead of on horseback, and finally resolved to fight\r\non foot, fearing that Rocinante might take fright at the sight of the\r\nlions; he therefore sprang off his horse, flung his lance aside, braced\r\nhis buckler on his arm, and drawing his sword, advanced slowly with\r\nmarvellous intrepidity and resolute courage, to plant himself in front\r\nof the cart, commending himself with all his heart to God and to his\r\nlady Dulcinea.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, that on coming to this passage, the author of\r\nthis veracious history breaks out into exclamations. \xe2\x80\x9cO doughty Don\r\nQuixote! high-mettled past extolling! Mirror, wherein all the heroes of\r\nthe world may see themselves! Second modern Don Manuel de Leon, once\r\nthe glory and honour of Spanish knighthood! In what words shall I\r\ndescribe this dread exploit, by what language shall I make it credible\r\nto ages to come, what eulogies are there unmeet for thee, though they\r\nbe hyperboles piled on hyperboles! On foot, alone, undaunted,\r\nhigh-souled, with but a simple sword, and that no trenchant blade of\r\nthe Perrillo brand, a shield, but no bright polished steel one, there\r\nstoodst thou, biding and awaiting the two fiercest lions that Africa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforests ever bred! Thy own deeds be thy praise, valiant Manchegan, and\r\nhere I leave them as they stand, wanting the words wherewith to glorify\r\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np17b.jpg (352K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the author\xe2\x80\x99s outburst came to an end, and he proceeded to take up\r\nthe thread of his story, saying that the keeper, seeing that Don\r\nQuixote had taken up his position, and that it was impossible for him\r\nto avoid letting out the male without incurring the enmity of the fiery\r\nand daring knight, flung open the doors of the first cage, containing,\r\nas has been said, the lion, which was now seen to be of enormous size,\r\nand grim and hideous mien. The first thing he did was to turn round in\r\nthe cage in which he lay, and protrude his claws, and stretch himself\r\nthoroughly; he next opened his mouth, and yawned very leisurely, and\r\nwith near two palms\xe2\x80\x99 length of tongue that he had thrust forth, he\r\nlicked the dust out of his eyes and washed his face; having done this,\r\nhe put his head out of the cage and looked all round with eyes like\r\nglowing coals, a spectacle and demeanour to strike terror into temerity\r\nitself. Don Quixote merely observed him steadily, longing for him to\r\nleap from the cart and come to close quarters with him, when he hoped\r\nto hew him in pieces.\r\n\r\nSo far did his unparalleled madness go; but the noble lion, more\r\ncourteous than arrogant, not troubling himself about silly bravado,\r\nafter having looked all round, as has been said, turned about and\r\npresented his hind-quarters to Don Quixote, and very coolly and\r\ntranquilly lay down again in the cage. Seeing this, Don Quixote ordered\r\nthe keeper to take a stick to him and provoke him to make him come out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said the keeper; \xe2\x80\x9cfor if I anger him, the first he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntear in pieces will be myself. Be satisfied, sir knight, with what you\r\nhave done, which leaves nothing more to be said on the score of\r\ncourage, and do not seek to tempt fortune a second time. The lion has\r\nthe door open; he is free to come out or not to come out; but as he has\r\nnot come out so far, he will not come out to-day. Your worship\xe2\x80\x99s great\r\ncourage has been fully manifested already; no brave champion, so it\r\nstrikes me, is bound to do more than challenge his enemy and wait for\r\nhim on the field; if his adversary does not come, on him lies the\r\ndisgrace, and he who waits for him carries off the crown of victory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cclose the door, my friend, and let\r\nme have, in the best form thou canst, what thou hast seen me do, by way\r\nof certificate; to wit, that thou didst open for the lion, that I\r\nwaited for him, that he did not come out, that I still waited for him,\r\nand that still he did not come out, and lay down again. I am not bound\r\nto do more; enchantments avaunt, and God uphold the right, the truth,\r\nand true chivalry! Close the door as I bade thee, while I make signals\r\nto the fugitives that have left us, that they may learn this exploit\r\nfrom thy lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe keeper obeyed, and Don Quixote, fixing on the point of his lance\r\nthe cloth he had wiped his face with after the deluge of curds,\r\nproceeded to recall the others, who still continued to fly, looking\r\nback at every step, all in a body, the gentleman bringing up the rear.\r\nSancho, however, happening to observe the signal of the white cloth,\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cMay I die, if my master has not overcome the wild beasts,\r\nfor he is calling to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all stopped, and perceived that it was Don Quixote who was making\r\nsignals, and shaking off their fears to some extent, they approached\r\nslowly until they were near enough to hear distinctly Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice calling to them. They returned at length to the cart, and as they\r\ncame up, Don Quixote said to the carter, \xe2\x80\x9cPut your mules to once more,\r\nbrother, and continue your journey; and do thou, Sancho, give him two\r\ngold crowns for himself and the keeper, to compensate for the delay\r\nthey have incurred through me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will I give with all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what has become\r\nof the lions? Are they dead or alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe keeper, then, in full detail, and bit by bit, described the end of\r\nthe contest, exalting to the best of his power and ability the valour\r\nof Don Quixote, at the sight of whom the lion quailed, and would not\r\nand dared not come out of the cage, although he had held the door open\r\never so long; and showing how, in consequence of his having represented\r\nto the knight that it was tempting God to provoke the lion in order to\r\nforce him out, which he wished to have done, he very reluctantly, and\r\naltogether against his will, had allowed the door to be closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost thou think of this, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cAre there\r\nany enchantments that can prevail against true valour? The enchanters\r\nmay be able to rob me of good fortune, but of fortitude and courage\r\nthey cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho paid the crowns, the carter put to, the keeper kissed Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s hands for the bounty bestowed upon him, and promised to give\r\nan account of the valiant exploit to the King himself, as soon as he\r\nsaw him at court.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif his Majesty should happen to ask who\r\nperformed it, you must say THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS; for it is my desire\r\nthat into this the name I have hitherto borne of Knight of the Rueful\r\nCountenance be from this time forward changed, altered, transformed,\r\nand turned; and in this I follow the ancient usage of knights-errant,\r\nwho changed their names when they pleased, or when it suited their\r\npurpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cart went its way, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and he of the green\r\ngaban went theirs. All this time, Don Diego de Miranda had not spoken a\r\nword, being entirely taken up with observing and noting all that Don\r\nQuixote did and said, and the opinion he formed was that he was a man\r\nof brains gone mad, and a madman on the verge of rationality. The first\r\npart of his history had not yet reached him, for, had he read it, the\r\namazement with which his words and deeds filled him would have\r\nvanished, as he would then have understood the nature of his madness;\r\nbut knowing nothing of it, he took him to be rational one moment, and\r\ncrazy the next, for what he said was sensible, elegant, and well\r\nexpressed, and what he did, absurd, rash, and foolish; and said he to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could be madder than putting on a helmet full of curds,\r\nand then persuading oneself that enchanters are softening one\xe2\x80\x99s skull;\r\nor what could be greater rashness and folly than wanting to fight lions\r\ntooth and nail?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote roused him from these reflections and this soliloquy by\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Diego de Miranda, you set me down in your\r\nmind as a fool and a madman, and it would be no wonder if you did, for\r\nmy deeds do not argue anything else. But for all that, I would have you\r\ntake notice that I am neither so mad nor so foolish as I must have\r\nseemed to you. A gallant knight shows to advantage bringing his lance\r\nto bear adroitly upon a fierce bull under the eyes of his sovereign, in\r\nthe midst of a spacious plaza; a knight shows to advantage arrayed in\r\nglittering armour, pacing the lists before the ladies in some joyous\r\ntournament, and all those knights show to advantage that entertain,\r\ndivert, and, if we may say so, honour the courts of their princes by\r\nwarlike exercises, or what resemble them; but to greater advantage than\r\nall these does a knight-errant show when he traverses deserts,\r\nsolitudes, cross-roads, forests, and mountains, in quest of perilous\r\nadventures, bent on bringing them to a happy and successful issue, all\r\nto win a glorious and lasting renown. To greater advantage, I maintain,\r\ndoes the knight-errant show bringing aid to some widow in some lonely\r\nwaste, than the court knight dallying with some city damsel. All\r\nknights have their own special parts to play; let the courtier devote\r\nhimself to the ladies, let him add lustre to his sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s court by\r\nhis liveries, let him entertain poor gentlemen with the sumptuous fare\r\nof his table, let him arrange joustings, marshal tournaments, and prove\r\nhimself noble, generous, and magnificent, and above all a good\r\nChristian, and so doing he will fulfil the duties that are especially\r\nhis; but let the knight-errant explore the corners of the earth and\r\npenetrate the most intricate labyrinths, at each step let him attempt\r\nimpossibilities, on desolate heaths let him endure the burning rays of\r\nthe midsummer sun, and the bitter inclemency of the winter winds and\r\nfrosts; let no lions daunt him, no monsters terrify him, no dragons\r\nmake him quail; for to seek these, to attack those, and to vanquish\r\nall, are in truth his main duties. I, then, as it has fallen to my lot\r\nto be a member of knight-errantry, cannot avoid attempting all that to\r\nme seems to come within the sphere of my duties; thus it was my bounden\r\nduty to attack those lions that I just now attacked, although I knew it\r\nto be the height of rashness; for I know well what valour is, that it\r\nis a virtue that occupies a place between two vicious extremes,\r\ncowardice and temerity; but it will be a lesser evil for him who is\r\nvaliant to rise till he reaches the point of rashness, than to sink\r\nuntil he reaches the point of cowardice; for, as it is easier for the\r\nprodigal than for the miser to become generous, so it is easier for a\r\nrash man to prove truly valiant than for a coward to rise to true\r\nvalour; and believe me, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Diego, in attempting adventures it is\r\nbetter to lose by a card too many than by a card too few; for to hear\r\nit said, \xe2\x80\x98such a knight is rash and daring,\xe2\x80\x99 sounds better than \xe2\x80\x98such a\r\nknight is timid and cowardly.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI protest, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Diego, \xe2\x80\x9ceverything you have\r\nsaid and done is proved correct by the test of reason itself; and I\r\nbelieve, if the laws and ordinances of knight-errantry should be lost,\r\nthey might be found in your worship\xe2\x80\x99s breast as in their own proper\r\ndepository and muniment-house; but let us make haste, and reach my\r\nvillage, where you shall take rest after your late exertions; for if\r\nthey have not been of the body they have been of the spirit, and these\r\nsometimes tend to produce bodily fatigue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take the invitation as a great favour and honour, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Diego,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Don Quixote; and pressing forward at a better pace than before,\r\nat about two in the afternoon they reached the village and house of Don\r\nDiego, or, as Don Quixote called him, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Knight of the Green Gaban.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np17e.jpg (76K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nOF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE IN THE CASTLE OR HOUSE OF THE KNIGHT OF\r\nTHE GREEN GABAN, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS OUT OF THE COMMON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np18a.jpg (133K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote found Don Diego de Miranda\xe2\x80\x99s house built in village style,\r\nwith his arms in rough stone over the street door; in the patio was the\r\nstore-room, and at the entrance the cellar, with plenty of wine-jars\r\nstanding round, which, coming from El Toboso, brought back to his\r\nmemory his enchanted and transformed Dulcinea; and with a sigh, and not\r\nthinking of what he was saying, or in whose presence he was, he\r\nexclaimed-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO ye sweet treasures, to my sorrow found!\r\nOnce sweet and welcome when \xe2\x80\x99twas heaven\xe2\x80\x99s good-will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO ye Tobosan jars, how ye bring back to my memory the\r\nsweet object of my bitter regrets!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np18b.jpg (300K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe student poet, Don Diego\xe2\x80\x99s son, who had come out with his mother to\r\nreceive him, heard this exclamation, and both mother and son were\r\nfilled with amazement at the extraordinary figure he presented; he,\r\nhowever, dismounting from Rocinante, advanced with great politeness to\r\nask permission to kiss the lady\xe2\x80\x99s hand, while Don Diego said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1ora,\r\npray receive with your wonted kindness Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote of La Mancha,\r\nwhom you see before you, a knight-errant, and the bravest and wisest in\r\nthe world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady, whose name was Do\xc3\xb1a Christina, received him with every sign\r\nof good-will and great courtesy, and Don Quixote placed himself at her\r\nservice with an abundance of well-chosen and polished phrases. Almost\r\nthe same civilities were exchanged between him and the student, who\r\nlistening to Don Quixote, took him to be a sensible, clear-headed\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nHere the author describes minutely everything belonging to Don Diego\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmansion, putting before us in his picture the whole contents of a rich\r\ngentleman-farmer\xe2\x80\x99s house; but the translator of the history thought it\r\nbest to pass over these and other details of the same sort in silence,\r\nas they are not in harmony with the main purpose of the story, the\r\nstrong point of which is truth rather than dull digressions.\r\n\r\nThey led Don Quixote into a room, and Sancho removed his armour,\r\nleaving him in loose Walloon breeches and chamois-leather doublet, all\r\nstained with the rust of his armour; his collar was a falling one of\r\nscholastic cut, without starch or lace, his buskins buff-coloured, and\r\nhis shoes polished. He wore his good sword, which hung in a baldric of\r\nsea-wolf\xe2\x80\x99s skin, for he had suffered for many years, they say, from an\r\nailment of the kidneys; and over all he threw a long cloak of good grey\r\ncloth. But first of all, with five or six buckets of water (for as\r\nregard the number of buckets there is some dispute), he washed his head\r\nand face, and still the water remained whey-coloured, thanks to\r\nSancho\xe2\x80\x99s greediness and purchase of those unlucky curds that turned his\r\nmaster so white. Thus arrayed, and with an easy, sprightly, and gallant\r\nair, Don Quixote passed out into another room, where the student was\r\nwaiting to entertain him while the table was being laid; for on the\r\narrival of so distinguished a guest, Do\xc3\xb1a Christina was anxious to show\r\nthat she knew how and was able to give a becoming reception to those\r\nwho came to her house.\r\n\r\nWhile Don Quixote was taking off his armour, Don Lorenzo (for so Don\r\nDiego\xe2\x80\x99s son was called) took the opportunity to say to his father,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we to make of this gentleman you have brought home to us,\r\nsir? For his name, his appearance, and your describing him as a\r\nknight-errant have completely puzzled my mother and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d replied. Don Diego; \xe2\x80\x9call I can tell\r\nthee is that I have seen him act the acts of the greatest madman in the\r\nworld, and heard him make observations so sensible that they efface and\r\nundo all he does; do thou talk to him and feel the pulse of his wits,\r\nand as thou art shrewd, form the most reasonable conclusion thou canst\r\nas to his wisdom or folly; though, to tell the truth, I am more\r\ninclined to take him to be mad than sane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this Don Lorenzo went away to entertain Don Quixote as has been\r\nsaid, and in the course of the conversation that passed between them\r\nDon Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, \xe2\x80\x9cYour father, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Diego de\r\nMiranda, has told me of the rare abilities and subtle intellect you\r\npossess, and, above all, that you are a great poet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA poet, it may be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Lorenzo, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a great one, by no\r\nmeans. It is true that I am somewhat given to poetry and to reading\r\ngood poets, but not so much so as to justify the title of \xe2\x80\x98great\xe2\x80\x99 which\r\nmy father gives me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not dislike that modesty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor there is no\r\npoet who is not conceited and does not think he is the best poet in the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no rule without an exception,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Lorenzo; \xe2\x80\x9cthere may\r\nbe some who are poets and yet do not think they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery few,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut tell me, what verses are those which\r\nyou have now in hand, and which your father tells me keep you somewhat\r\nrestless and absorbed? If it be some gloss, I know something about\r\nglosses, and I should like to hear them; and if they are for a poetical\r\ntournament, contrive to carry off the second prize; for the first\r\nalways goes by favour or personal standing, the second by simple\r\njustice; and so the third comes to be the second, and the first,\r\nreckoning in this way, will be third, in the same way as licentiate\r\ndegrees are conferred at the universities; but, for all that, the title\r\nof first is a great distinction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Lorenzo to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI should not take you to be a\r\nmadman; but let us go on.\xe2\x80\x9d So he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cYour worship has\r\napparently attended the schools; what sciences have you studied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat of knight-errantry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is as good as that\r\nof poetry, and even a finger or two above it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know what science that is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Lorenzo, \xe2\x80\x9cand until now\r\nI have never heard of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a science,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat comprehends in itself all or\r\nmost of the sciences in the world, for he who professes it must be a\r\njurist, and must know the rules of justice, distributive and equitable,\r\nso as to give to each one what belongs to him and is due to him. He\r\nmust be a theologian, so as to be able to give a clear and distinctive\r\nreason for the Christian faith he professes, wherever it may be asked\r\nof him. He must be a physician, and above all a herbalist, so as in\r\nwastes and solitudes to know the herbs that have the property of\r\nhealing wounds, for a knight-errant must not go looking for someone to\r\ncure him at every step. He must be an astronomer, so as to know by the\r\nstars how many hours of the night have passed, and what clime and\r\nquarter of the world he is in. He must know mathematics, for at every\r\nturn some occasion for them will present itself to him; and, putting it\r\naside that he must be adorned with all the virtues, cardinal and\r\ntheological, to come down to minor particulars, he must, I say, be able\r\nto swim as well as Nicholas or Nicolao the Fish could, as the story\r\ngoes; he must know how to shoe a horse, and repair his saddle and\r\nbridle; and, to return to higher matters, he must be faithful to God\r\nand to his lady; he must be pure in thought, decorous in words,\r\ngenerous in works, valiant in deeds, patient in suffering,\r\ncompassionate towards the needy, and, lastly, an upholder of the truth\r\nthough its defence should cost him his life. Of all these qualities,\r\ngreat and small, is a true knight-errant made up; judge then, Se\xc3\xb1or Don\r\nLorenzo, whether it be a contemptible science which the knight who\r\nstudies and professes it has to learn, and whether it may not compare\r\nwith the very loftiest that are taught in the schools.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that be so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Lorenzo, \xe2\x80\x9cthis science, I protest,\r\nsurpasses all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, if that be so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I mean to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Lorenzo, \xe2\x80\x9cis, that I doubt whether there\r\nare now, or ever were, any knights-errant, and adorned with such\r\nvirtues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany a time,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9chave I said what I now say once\r\nmore, that the majority of the world are of opinion that there never\r\nwere any knights-errant in it; and as it is my opinion that, unless\r\nheaven by some miracle brings home to them the truth that there were\r\nand are, all the pains one takes will be in vain (as experience has\r\noften proved to me), I will not now stop to disabuse you of the error\r\nyou share with the multitude. All I shall do is to pray to heaven to\r\ndeliver you from it, and show you how beneficial and necessary\r\nknights-errant were in days of yore, and how useful they would be in\r\nthese days were they but in vogue; but now, for the sins of the people,\r\nsloth and indolence, gluttony and luxury are triumphant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur guest has broken out on our hands,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Lorenzo to himself at\r\nthis point; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, for all that, he is a glorious madman, and I should\r\nbe a dull blockhead to doubt it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere, being summoned to dinner, they brought their colloquy to a close.\r\nDon Diego asked his son what he had been able to make out as to the\r\nwits of their guest. To which he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAll the doctors and clever\r\nscribes in the world will not make sense of the scrawl of his madness;\r\nhe is a madman full of streaks, full of lucid intervals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went in to dinner, and the repast was such as Don Diego said on\r\nthe road he was in the habit of giving to his guests, neat, plentiful,\r\nand tasty; but what pleased Don Quixote most was the marvellous silence\r\nthat reigned throughout the house, for it was like a Carthusian\r\nmonastery.\r\n\r\nWhen the cloth had been removed, grace said and their hands washed, Don\r\nQuixote earnestly pressed Don Lorenzo to repeat to him his verses for\r\nthe poetical tournament, to which he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNot to be like those\r\npoets who, when they are asked to recite their verses, refuse, and when\r\nthey are not asked for them vomit them up, I will repeat my gloss, for\r\nwhich I do not expect any prize, having composed it merely as an\r\nexercise of ingenuity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA discerning friend of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwas of opinion that\r\nno one ought to waste labour in glossing verses; and the reason he gave\r\nwas that the gloss can never come up to the text, and that often or\r\nmost frequently it wanders away from the meaning and purpose aimed at\r\nin the glossed lines; and besides, that the laws of the gloss were too\r\nstrict, as they did not allow interrogations, nor \xe2\x80\x98said he,\xe2\x80\x99 nor \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nsay,\xe2\x80\x99 nor turning verbs into nouns, or altering the construction, not\r\nto speak of other restrictions and limitations that fetter\r\ngloss-writers, as you no doubt know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerily, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Lorenzo, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could catch\r\nyour worship tripping at a stretch, but I cannot, for you slip through\r\nmy fingers like an eel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you say, or mean by slipping,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will explain myself another time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Lorenzo; \xe2\x80\x9cfor the\r\npresent pray attend to the glossed verses and the gloss, which run\r\nthus:\r\n\r\nCould \xe2\x80\x98was\xe2\x80\x99 become an \xe2\x80\x98is\xe2\x80\x99 for me,\r\nThen would I ask no more than this;\r\nOr could, for me, the time that is\r\nBecome the time that is to be!\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSS\r\n\r\nDame Fortune once upon a day\r\nTo me was bountiful and kind;\r\nBut all things change; she changed her mind,\r\nAnd what she gave she took away.\r\nO Fortune, long I\xe2\x80\x99ve sued to thee;\r\nThe gifts thou gavest me restore,\r\nFor, trust me, I would ask no more,\r\nCould \xe2\x80\x98was\xe2\x80\x99 become an \xe2\x80\x98is\xe2\x80\x99 for me.\r\n\r\nNo other prize I seek to gain,\r\nNo triumph, glory, or success,\r\nOnly the long-lost happiness,\r\nThe memory whereof is pain.\r\nOne taste, methinks, of bygone bliss\r\nThe heart-consuming fire might stay;\r\nAnd, so it come without delay,\r\nThen would I ask no more than this.\r\n\r\nI ask what cannot be, alas!\r\nThat time should ever be, and then\r\nCome back to us, and be again,\r\nNo power on earth can bring to pass;\r\nFor fleet of foot is he, I wis,\r\nAnd idly, therefore, do we pray\r\nThat what for aye hath left us may\r\nBecome for us the time that is.\r\n\r\nPerplexed, uncertain, to remain\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twixt hope and fear, is death, not life;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twere better, sure, to end the strife,\r\nAnd dying, seek release from pain.\r\nAnd yet, thought were the best for me.\r\nAnon the thought aside I fling,\r\nAnd to the present fondly cling,\r\nAnd dread the time that is to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Don Lorenzo had finished reciting his gloss, Don Quixote stood up,\r\nand in a loud voice, almost a shout, exclaimed as he grasped Don\r\nLorenzo\xe2\x80\x99s right hand in his, \xe2\x80\x9cBy the highest heavens, noble youth, but\r\nyou are the best poet on earth, and deserve to be crowned with laurel,\r\nnot by Cyprus or by Gaeta\xe2\x80\x94as a certain poet, God forgive him, said\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nby the Academies of Athens, if they still flourished, and by those that\r\nflourish now, Paris, Bologna, Salamanca. Heaven grant that the judges\r\nwho rob you of the first prize\xe2\x80\x94that Ph\xc5\x93bus may pierce them with his\r\narrows, and the Muses never cross the thresholds of their doors. Repeat\r\nme some of your long-measure verses, se\xc3\xb1or, if you will be so good, for\r\nI want thoroughly to feel the pulse of your rare genius.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIs there any need to say that Don Lorenzo enjoyed hearing himself\r\npraised by Don Quixote, albeit he looked upon him as a madman? power of\r\nflattery, how far-reaching art thou, and how wide are the bounds of thy\r\npleasant jurisdiction! Don Lorenzo gave a proof of it, for he complied\r\nwith Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s request and entreaty, and repeated to him this\r\nsonnet on the fable or story of Pyramus and Thisbe.\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\nThe lovely maid, she pierces now the wall;\r\nHeart-pierced by her young Pyramus doth lie;\r\nAnd Love spreads wing from Cyprus isle to fly,\r\nA chink to view so wondrous great and small.\r\nThere silence speaketh, for no voice at all\r\nCan pass so strait a strait; but love will ply\r\nWhere to all other power \xe2\x80\x99twere vain to try;\r\nFor love will find a way whate\xe2\x80\x99er befall.\r\nImpatient of delay, with reckless pace\r\nThe rash maid wins the fatal spot where she\r\nSinks not in lover\xe2\x80\x99s arms but death\xe2\x80\x99s embrace.\r\nSo runs the strange tale, how the lovers twain\r\nOne sword, one sepulchre, one memory,\r\nSlays, and entombs, and brings to life again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlessed be God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote when he had heard Don Lorenzo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsonnet, \xe2\x80\x9cthat among the hosts there are of irritable poets I have found\r\none consummate one, which, se\xc3\xb1or, the art of this sonnet proves to me\r\nthat you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor four days was Don Quixote most sumptuously entertained in Don\r\nDiego\xe2\x80\x99s house, at the end of which time he asked his permission to\r\ndepart, telling him he thanked him for the kindness and hospitality he\r\nhad received in his house, but that, as it did not become\r\nknights-errant to give themselves up for long to idleness and luxury,\r\nhe was anxious to fulfill the duties of his calling in seeking\r\nadventures, of which he was informed there was an abundance in that\r\nneighbourhood, where he hoped to employ his time until the day came\r\nround for the jousts at Saragossa, for that was his proper destination;\r\nand that, first of all, he meant to enter the cave of Montesinos, of\r\nwhich so many marvellous things were reported all through the country,\r\nand at the same time to investigate and explore the origin and true\r\nsource of the seven lakes commonly called the lakes of Ruidera.\r\n\r\nDon Diego and his son commended his laudable resolution, and bade him\r\nfurnish himself with all he wanted from their house and belongings, as\r\nthey would most gladly be of service to him; which, indeed, his\r\npersonal worth and his honourable profession made incumbent upon them.\r\n\r\nThe day of his departure came at length, as welcome to Don Quixote as\r\nit was sad and sorrowful to Sancho Panza, who was very well satisfied\r\nwith the abundance of Don Diego\xe2\x80\x99s house, and objected to return to the\r\nstarvation of the woods and wilds and the short-commons of his\r\nill-stocked alforjas; these, however, he filled and packed with what he\r\nconsidered needful. On taking leave, Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not whether I have told you already, but if I have I tell you\r\nonce more, that if you wish to spare yourself fatigue and toil in\r\nreaching the inaccessible summit of the temple of fame, you have\r\nnothing to do but to turn aside out of the somewhat narrow path of\r\npoetry and take the still narrower one of knight-errantry, wide enough,\r\nhowever, to make you an emperor in the twinkling of an eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this speech Don Quixote wound up the evidence of his madness, but\r\nstill better in what he added when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cGod knows, I would gladly\r\ntake Don Lorenzo with me to teach him how to spare the humble, and\r\ntrample the proud under foot, virtues that are part and parcel of the\r\nprofession I belong to; but since his tender age does not allow of it,\r\nnor his praiseworthy pursuits permit it, I will simply content myself\r\nwith impressing it upon your worship that you will become famous as a\r\npoet if you are guided by the opinion of others rather than by your\r\nown; because no fathers or mothers ever think their own children\r\nill-favoured, and this sort of deception prevails still more strongly\r\nin the case of the children of the brain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth father and son were amazed afresh at the strange medley Don\r\nQuixote talked, at one moment sense, at another nonsense, and at the\r\npertinacity and persistence he displayed in going through thick and\r\nthin in quest of his unlucky adventures, which he made the end and aim\r\nof his desires. There was a renewal of offers of service and\r\ncivilities, and then, with the gracious permission of the lady of the\r\ncastle, they took their departure, Don Quixote on Rocinante, and Sancho\r\non Dapple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np18e.jpg (18K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nIN WHICH IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENAMOURED SHEPHERD, TOGETHER\r\nWITH OTHER TRULY DROLL INCIDENTS\r\n\r\np19a.jpg (131K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote had gone but a short distance beyond Don Diego\xe2\x80\x99s village,\r\nwhen he fell in with a couple of either priests or students, and a\r\ncouple of peasants, mounted on four beasts of the ass kind. One of the\r\nstudents carried, wrapped up in a piece of green buckram by way of a\r\nportmanteau, what seemed to be a little linen and a couple of pairs of\r\nribbed stockings; the other carried nothing but a pair of new\r\nfencing-foils with buttons. The peasants carried divers articles that\r\nshowed they were on their way from some large town where they had\r\nbought them, and were taking them home to their village; and both\r\nstudents and peasants were struck with the same amazement that\r\neverybody felt who saw Don Quixote for the first time, and were dying\r\nto know who this man, so different from ordinary men, could be. Don\r\nQuixote saluted them, and after ascertaining that their road was the\r\nsame as his, made them an offer of his company, and begged them to\r\nslacken their pace, as their young asses travelled faster than his\r\nhorse; and then, to gratify them, he told them in a few words who he\r\nwas and the calling and profession he followed, which was that of a\r\nknight-errant seeking adventures in all parts of the world. He informed\r\nthem that his own name was Don Quixote of La Mancha, and that he was\r\ncalled, by way of surname, the Knight of the Lions.\r\n\r\nAll this was Greek or gibberish to the peasants, but not so to the\r\nstudents, who very soon perceived the crack in Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s pate; for\r\nall that, however, they regarded him with admiration and respect, and\r\none of them said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you, sir knight, have no fixed road, as it\r\nis the way with those who seek adventures not to have any, let your\r\nworship come with us; you will see one of the finest and richest\r\nweddings that up to this day have ever been celebrated in La Mancha, or\r\nfor many a league round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote asked him if it was some prince\xe2\x80\x99s, that he spoke of it in\r\nthis way. \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the student; \xe2\x80\x9cit is the wedding of a\r\nfarmer and a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, he the richest in all this country, and\r\nshe the fairest mortal ever set eyes on. The display with which it is\r\nto be attended will be something rare and out of the common, for it\r\nwill be celebrated in a meadow adjoining the town of the bride, who is\r\ncalled, _par excellence_, Quiteria the fair, as the bridegroom is\r\ncalled Camacho the rich. She is eighteen, and he twenty-two, and they\r\nare fairly matched, though some knowing ones, who have all the\r\npedigrees in the world by heart, will have it that the family of the\r\nfair Quiteria is better than Camacho\xe2\x80\x99s; but no one minds that\r\nnow-a-days, for wealth can solder a great many flaws. At any rate,\r\nCamacho is free-handed, and it is his fancy to screen the whole meadow\r\nwith boughs and cover it in overhead, so that the sun will have hard\r\nwork if he tries to get in to reach the grass that covers the soil. He\r\nhas provided dancers too, not only sword but also bell-dancers, for in\r\nhis own town there are those who ring the changes and jingle the bells\r\nto perfection; of shoe-dancers I say nothing, for of them he has\r\nengaged a host. But none of these things, nor of the many others I have\r\nomitted to mention, will do more to make this a memorable wedding than\r\nthe part which I suspect the despairing Basilio will play in it. This\r\nBasilio is a youth of the same village as Quiteria, and he lived in the\r\nhouse next door to that of her parents, of which circumstance Love took\r\nadvantage to reproduce to the word the long-forgotten loves of Pyramus\r\nand Thisbe; for Basilio loved Quiteria from his earliest years, and she\r\nresponded to his passion with countless modest proofs of affection, so\r\nthat the loves of the two children, Basilio and Quiteria, were the talk\r\nand the amusement of the town. As they grew up, the father of Quiteria\r\nmade up his mind to refuse Basilio his wonted freedom of access to the\r\nhouse, and to relieve himself of constant doubts and suspicions, he\r\narranged a match for his daughter with the rich Camacho, as he did not\r\napprove of marrying her to Basilio, who had not so large a share of the\r\ngifts of fortune as of nature; for if the truth be told ungrudgingly,\r\nhe is the most agile youth we know, a mighty thrower of the bar, a\r\nfirst-rate wrestler, and a great ball-player; he runs like a deer, and\r\nleaps better than a goat, bowls over the nine-pins as if by magic,\r\nsings like a lark, plays the guitar so as to make it speak, and, above\r\nall, handles a sword as well as the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor that excellence alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote at this, \xe2\x80\x9cthe youth\r\ndeserves to marry, not merely the fair Quiteria, but Queen Guinevere\r\nherself, were she alive now, in spite of Launcelot and all who would\r\ntry to prevent it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that to my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, who had until now listened in\r\nsilence, \xe2\x80\x9cfor she won\xe2\x80\x99t hear of anything but each one marrying his\r\nequal, holding with the proverb \xe2\x80\x98each ewe to her like.\xe2\x80\x99 What I would\r\nlike is that this good Basilio (for I am beginning to take a fancy to\r\nhim already) should marry this lady Quiteria; and a blessing and good\r\nluck\xe2\x80\x94I meant to say the opposite\xe2\x80\x94on people who would prevent those who\r\nlove one another from marrying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf all those who love one another were to marry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit would deprive parents of the right to choose, and marry their\r\nchildren to the proper person and at the proper time; and if it was\r\nleft to daughters to choose husbands as they pleased, one would be for\r\nchoosing her father\xe2\x80\x99s servant, and another, someone she has seen\r\npassing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing, though he may be\r\na drunken bully; for love and fancy easily blind the eyes of the\r\njudgment, so much wanted in choosing one\xe2\x80\x99s way of life; and the\r\nmatrimonial choice is very liable to error, and it needs great caution\r\nand the special favour of heaven to make it a good one. He who has to\r\nmake a long journey, will, if he is wise, look out for some trusty and\r\npleasant companion to accompany him before he sets out. Why, then,\r\nshould not he do the same who has to make the whole journey of life\r\ndown to the final halting-place of death, more especially when the\r\ncompanion has to be his companion in bed, at board, and everywhere, as\r\nthe wife is to her husband? The companionship of one\xe2\x80\x99s wife is no\r\narticle of merchandise, that, after it has been bought, may be\r\nreturned, or bartered, or changed; for it is an inseparable accident\r\nthat lasts as long as life lasts; it is a noose that, once you put it\r\nround your neck, turns into a Gordian knot, which, if the scythe of\r\nDeath does not cut it, there is no untying. I could say a great deal\r\nmore on this subject, were I not prevented by the anxiety I feel to\r\nknow if the se\xc3\xb1or licentiate has anything more to tell about the story\r\nof Basilio.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this the student, bachelor, or, as Don Quixote called him,\r\nlicentiate, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing whatever to say further, but that\r\nfrom the moment Basilio learned that the fair Quiteria was to be\r\nmarried to Camacho the rich, he has never been seen to smile, or heard\r\nto utter rational word, and he always goes about moody and dejected,\r\ntalking to himself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses.\r\nHe eats little and sleeps little, and all he eats is fruit, and when he\r\nsleeps, if he sleeps at all, it is in the field on the hard earth like\r\na brute beast. Sometimes he gazes at the sky, at other times he fixes\r\nhis eyes on the earth in such an abstracted way that he might be taken\r\nfor a clothed statue, with its drapery stirred by the wind. In short,\r\nhe shows such signs of a heart crushed by suffering, that all we who\r\nknow him believe that when to-morrow the fair Quiteria says \xe2\x80\x98yes,\xe2\x80\x99 it\r\nwill be his sentence of death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod will guide it better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor God who gives the wound\r\ngives the salve; nobody knows what will happen; there are a good many\r\nhours between this and to-morrow, and any one of them, or any moment,\r\nthe house may fall; I have seen the rain coming down and the sun\r\nshining all at one time; many a one goes to bed in good health who\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stir the next day. And tell me, is there anyone who can boast of\r\nhaving driven a nail into the wheel of fortune? No, faith; and between\r\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t venture to put the point of a pin,\r\nfor there would not be room for it; if you tell me Quiteria loves\r\nBasilio heart and soul, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a bag of good luck; for\r\nlove, I have heard say, looks through spectacles that make copper seem\r\ngold, poverty wealth, and bleary eyes pearls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou driving at, Sancho? curses on thee!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor when thou takest to stringing proverbs and sayings together, no\r\none can understand thee but Judas himself, and I wish he had thee. Tell\r\nme, thou animal, what dost thou know about nails or wheels, or anything\r\nelse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cit is no wonder my\r\nwords are taken for nonsense; but no matter; I understand myself, and I\r\nknow I have not said anything very foolish in what I have said; only\r\nyour worship, se\xc3\xb1or, is always gravelling at everything I say, nay,\r\neverything I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCavilling, not gravelling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthou prevaricator of\r\nhonest language, God confound thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t find fault with me, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor you\r\nknow I have not been bred up at court or trained at Salamanca, to know\r\nwhether I am adding or dropping a letter or so in my words. Why! God\r\nbless me, it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to force a Sayago-man to speak like a Toledan;\r\nmaybe there are Toledans who do not hit it off when it comes to\r\npolished talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the licentiate, \xe2\x80\x9cfor those who have been bred up\r\nin the Tanneries and the Zocodover cannot talk like those who are\r\nalmost all day pacing the cathedral cloisters, and yet they are all\r\nToledans. Pure, correct, elegant and lucid language will be met with in\r\nmen of courtly breeding and discrimination, though they may have been\r\nborn in Majalahonda; I say of discrimination, because there are many\r\nwho are not so, and discrimination is the grammar of good language, if\r\nit be accompanied by practice. I, sirs, for my sins have studied canon\r\nlaw at Salamanca, and I rather pique myself on expressing my meaning in\r\nclear, plain, and intelligible language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you did not pique yourself more on your dexterity with those foils\r\nyou carry than on dexterity of tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other student, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nwould have been head of the degrees, where you are now tail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, bachelor Corchuelo,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the licentiate, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have the\r\nmost mistaken idea in the world about skill with the sword, if you\r\nthink it useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no idea on my part, but an established truth,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nCorchuelo; \xe2\x80\x9cand if you wish me to prove it to you by experiment, you\r\nhave swords there, and it is a good opportunity; I have a steady hand\r\nand a strong arm, and these joined with my resolution, which is not\r\nsmall, will make you confess that I am not mistaken. Dismount and put\r\nin practice your positions and circles and angles and science, for I\r\nhope to make you see stars at noonday with my rude raw swordsmanship,\r\nin which, next to God, I place my trust that the man is yet to be born\r\nwho will make me turn my back, and that there is not one in the world I\r\nwill not compel to give ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to whether you turn your back or not, I do not concern myself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied the master of fence; \xe2\x80\x9cthough it might be that your grave would\r\nbe dug on the spot where you planted your foot the first time; I mean\r\nthat you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with the\r\nsword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall soon see,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Corchuelo, and getting off his ass\r\nbriskly, he drew out furiously one of the swords the licentiate carried\r\non his beast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must not be that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote at this point; \xe2\x80\x9cI will be\r\nthe director of this fencing match, and judge of this often disputed\r\nquestion;\xe2\x80\x9d and dismounting from Rocinante and grasping his lance, he\r\nplanted himself in the middle of the road, just as the licentiate, with\r\nan easy, graceful bearing and step, advanced towards Corchuelo, who\r\ncame on against him, darting fire from his eyes, as the saying is. The\r\nother two of the company, the peasants, without dismounting from their\r\nasses, served as spectators of the mortal tragedy. The cuts, thrusts,\r\ndown strokes, back strokes and doubles, that Corchuelo delivered were\r\npast counting, and came thicker than hops or hail. He attacked like an\r\nangry lion, but he was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of the\r\nlicentiate\xe2\x80\x99s sword that checked him in the midst of his furious onset,\r\nand made him kiss it as if it were a relic, though not as devoutly as\r\nrelics are and ought to be kissed. The end of it was that the\r\nlicentiate reckoned up for him by thrusts every one of the buttons of\r\nthe short cassock he wore, tore the skirts into strips, like the tails\r\nof a cuttlefish, knocked off his hat twice, and so completely tired him\r\nout, that in vexation, anger, and rage, he took the sword by the hilt\r\nand flung it away with such force, that one of the peasants that were\r\nthere, who was a notary, and who went for it, made an affidavit\r\nafterwards that he sent it nearly three-quarters of a league, which\r\ntestimony will serve, and has served, to show and establish with all\r\ncertainty that strength is overcome by skill.\r\n\r\nCorchuelo sat down wearied, and Sancho approaching him said, \xe2\x80\x9cBy my\r\nfaith, se\xc3\xb1or bachelor, if your worship takes my advice, you will never\r\nchallenge anyone to fence again, only to wrestle and throw the bar, for\r\nyou have the youth and strength for that; but as for these fencers as\r\nthey call them, I have heard say they can put the point of a sword\r\nthrough the eye of a needle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corchuelo,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand with having had the truth I was so ignorant of proved to me by\r\nexperience;\xe2\x80\x9d and getting up he embraced the licentiate, and they were\r\nbetter friends than ever; and not caring to wait for the notary who had\r\ngone for the sword, as they saw he would be a long time about it, they\r\nresolved to push on so as to reach the village of Quiteria, to which\r\nthey all belonged, in good time.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the journey the licentiate held forth to them\r\non the excellences of the sword, with such conclusive arguments, and\r\nsuch figures and mathematical proofs, that all were convinced of the\r\nvalue of the science, and Corchuelo cured of his dogmatism.\r\n\r\nIt grew dark; but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as\r\nif there was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front of\r\nit. They heard, too, the pleasant mingled notes of a variety of\r\ninstruments, flutes, drums, psalteries, pipes, tabors, and timbrels,\r\nand as they drew near they perceived that the trees of a leafy arcade\r\nthat had been constructed at the entrance of the town were filled with\r\nlights unaffected by the wind, for the breeze at the time was so gentle\r\nthat it had not power to stir the leaves on the trees. The musicians\r\nwere the life of the wedding, wandering through the pleasant grounds in\r\nseparate bands, some dancing, others singing, others playing the\r\nvarious instruments already mentioned. In short, it seemed as though\r\nmirth and gaiety were frisking and gambolling all over the meadow.\r\nSeveral other persons were engaged in erecting raised benches from\r\nwhich people might conveniently see the plays and dances that were to\r\nbe performed the next day on the spot dedicated to the celebration of\r\nthe marriage of Camacho the rich and the obsequies of Basilio. Don\r\nQuixote would not enter the village, although the peasant as well as\r\nthe bachelor pressed him; he excused himself, however, on the grounds,\r\namply sufficient in his opinion, that it was the custom of\r\nknights-errant to sleep in the fields and woods in preference to towns,\r\neven were it under gilded ceilings; and so turned aside a little out of\r\nthe road, very much against Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s will, as the good quarters he had\r\nenjoyed in the castle or house of Don Diego came back to his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np19e.jpg (29K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nWHEREIN AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE WEDDING OF CAMACHO THE RICH,\r\nTOGETHER WITH THE INCIDENT OF BASILIO THE POOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np20a.jpg (125K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScarce had the fair Aurora given bright Ph\xc5\x93bus time to dry the liquid\r\npearls upon her golden locks with the heat of his fervent rays, when\r\nDon Quixote, shaking off sloth from his limbs, sprang to his feet and\r\ncalled to his squire Sancho, who was still snoring; seeing which Don\r\nQuixote ere he roused him thus addressed him: \xe2\x80\x9cHappy thou, above all\r\nthe dwellers on the face of the earth, that, without envying or being\r\nenvied, sleepest with tranquil mind, and that neither enchanters\r\npersecute nor enchantments affright. Sleep, I say, and will say a\r\nhundred times, without any jealous thoughts of thy mistress to make\r\nthee keep ceaseless vigils, or any cares as to how thou art to pay the\r\ndebts thou owest, or find to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s food for thyself and thy needy\r\nlittle family, to interfere with thy repose. Ambition breaks not thy\r\nrest, nor doth this world\xe2\x80\x99s empty pomp disturb thee, for the utmost\r\nreach of thy anxiety is to provide for thy ass, since upon my shoulders\r\nthou hast laid the support of thyself, the counterpoise and burden that\r\nnature and custom have imposed upon masters. The servant sleeps and the\r\nmaster lies awake thinking how he is to feed him, advance him, and\r\nreward him. The distress of seeing the sky turn brazen, and withhold\r\nits needful moisture from the earth, is not felt by the servant but by\r\nthe master, who in time of scarcity and famine must support him who has\r\nserved him in times of plenty and abundance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np20b.jpg (365K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo all this Sancho made no reply because he was asleep, nor would he\r\nhave wakened up so soon as he did had not Don Quixote brought him to\r\nhis senses with the butt of his lance. He awoke at last, drowsy and\r\nlazy, and casting his eyes about in every direction, observed, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\ncomes, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t mistake, from the quarter of that arcade a steam and\r\na smell a great deal more like fried rashers than galingale or thyme; a\r\nwedding that begins with smells like that, by my faith, ought to be\r\nplentiful and unstinting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave done, thou glutton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9ccome, let us go and\r\nwitness this bridal, and see what the rejected Basilio does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him do what he likes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbe he not poor, he would\r\nmarry Quiteria. To make a grand match for himself, and he without a\r\nfarthing; is there nothing else? Faith, se\xc3\xb1or, it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion the poor\r\nman should be content with what he can get, and not go looking for\r\ndainties in the bottom of the sea. I will bet my arm that Camacho could\r\nbury Basilio in reals; and if that be so, as no doubt it is, what a\r\nfool Quiteria would be to refuse the fine dresses and jewels Camacho\r\nmust have given her and will give her, and take Basilio\xe2\x80\x99s bar-throwing\r\nand sword-play. They won\xe2\x80\x99t give a pint of wine at the tavern for a good\r\ncast of the bar or a neat thrust of the sword. Talents and\r\naccomplishments that can\xe2\x80\x99t be turned into money, let Count Dirlos have\r\nthem; but when such gifts fall to one that has hard cash, I wish my\r\ncondition of life was as becoming as they are. On a good foundation you\r\ncan raise a good building, and the best foundation in the world is\r\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote here, \xe2\x80\x9cstop that harangue;\r\nit is my belief, if thou wert allowed to continue all thou beginnest\r\nevery instant, thou wouldst have no time left for eating or sleeping;\r\nfor thou wouldst spend it all in talking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your worship had a good memory,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would\r\nremember the articles of our agreement before we started from home this\r\nlast time; one of them was that I was to be let say all I liked, so\r\nlong as it was not against my neighbour or your worship\xe2\x80\x99s authority;\r\nand so far, it seems to me, I have not broken the said article.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember no such article, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand even if it\r\nwere so, I desire you to hold your tongue and come along; for the\r\ninstruments we heard last night are already beginning to enliven the\r\nvalleys again, and no doubt the marriage will take place in the cool of\r\nthe morning, and not in the heat of the afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho did as his master bade him, and putting the saddle on Rocinante\r\nand the pack-saddle on Dapple, they both mounted and at a leisurely\r\npace entered the arcade. The first thing that presented itself to\r\nSancho\xe2\x80\x99s eyes was a whole ox spitted on a whole elm tree, and in the\r\nfire at which it was to be roasted there was burning a middling-sized\r\nmountain of faggots, and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had\r\nnot been made in the ordinary mould of common pots, for they were six\r\nhalf wine-jars, each fit to hold the contents of a slaughter-house;\r\nthey swallowed up whole sheep and hid them away in their insides\r\nwithout showing any more sign of them than if they were pigeons.\r\nCountless were the hares ready skinned and the plucked fowls that hung\r\non the trees for burial in the pots, numberless the wildfowl and game\r\nof various sorts suspended from the branches that the air might keep\r\nthem cool. Sancho counted more than sixty wine skins of over six\r\ngallons each, and all filled, as it proved afterwards, with generous\r\nwines. There were, besides, piles of the whitest bread, like the heaps\r\nof corn one sees on the threshing-floors. There was a wall made of\r\ncheeses arranged like open brick-work, and two cauldrons full of oil,\r\nbigger than those of a dyer\xe2\x80\x99s shop, served for cooking fritters, which\r\nwhen fried were taken out with two mighty shovels, and plunged into\r\nanother cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by. Of cooks and\r\ncook-maids there were over fifty, all clean, brisk, and blithe. In the\r\ncapacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft little sucking-pigs, which,\r\nsewn up there, served to give it tenderness and flavour. The spices of\r\ndifferent kinds did not seem to have been bought by the pound but by\r\nthe quarter, and all lay open to view in a great chest. In short, all\r\nthe preparations made for the wedding were in rustic style, but\r\nabundant enough to feed an army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np20c.jpg (415K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSancho observed all, contemplated all, and everything won his heart.\r\nThe first to captivate and take his fancy were the pots, out of which\r\nhe would have very gladly helped himself to a moderate pipkinful; then\r\nthe wine skins secured his affections; and lastly, the produce of the\r\nfrying-pans, if, indeed, such imposing cauldrons may be called\r\nfrying-pans; and unable to control himself or bear it any longer, he\r\napproached one of the busy cooks and civilly but hungrily begged\r\npermission to soak a scrap of bread in one of the pots; to which the\r\ncook made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cBrother, this is not a day on which hunger is to\r\nhave any sway, thanks to the rich Camacho; get down and look about for\r\na ladle and skim off a hen or two, and much good may they do you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cook; \xe2\x80\x9csinner that I am! how particular and\r\nbashful you are!\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying, he seized a bucket and plunging it\r\ninto one of the half jars took up three hens and a couple of geese, and\r\nsaid to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cFall to, friend, and take the edge off your appetite\r\nwith these skimmings until dinner-time comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np20d.jpg (351K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to put them in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cook, \xe2\x80\x9ctake spoon and all; for Camacho\xe2\x80\x99s wealth\r\nand happiness furnish everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Sancho fared thus, Don Quixote was watching the entrance, at one\r\nend of the arcade, of some twelve peasants, all in holiday and gala\r\ndress, mounted on twelve beautiful mares with rich handsome field\r\ntrappings and a number of little bells attached to their petrals, who,\r\nmarshalled in regular order, ran not one but several courses over the\r\nmeadow, with jubilant shouts and cries of \xe2\x80\x9cLong live Camacho and\r\nQuiteria! he as rich as she is fair; and she the fairest on earth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing this, Don Quixote said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is easy to see these\r\nfolk have never seen my Dulcinea del Toboso; for if they had they would\r\nbe more moderate in their praises of this Quiteria of theirs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShortly after this, several bands of dancers of various sorts began to\r\nenter the arcade at different points, and among them one of\r\nsword-dancers composed of some four-and-twenty lads of gallant and\r\nhigh-spirited mien, clad in the finest and whitest of linen, and with\r\nhandkerchiefs embroidered in various colours with fine silk; and one of\r\nthose on the mares asked an active youth who led them if any of the\r\ndancers had been wounded. \xe2\x80\x9cAs yet, thank God, no one has been wounded,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are all safe and sound;\xe2\x80\x9d and he at once began to execute\r\ncomplicated figures with the rest of his comrades, with so many turns\r\nand so great dexterity, that although Don Quixote was well used to see\r\ndances of the same kind, he thought he had never seen any so good as\r\nthis. He also admired another that came in composed of fair young\r\nmaidens, none of whom seemed to be under fourteen or over eighteen\r\nyears of age, all clad in green stuff, with their locks partly braided,\r\npartly flowing loose, but all of such bright gold as to vie with the\r\nsunbeams, and over them they wore garlands of jessamine, roses,\r\namaranth, and honeysuckle. At their head were a venerable old man and\r\nan ancient dame, more brisk and active, however, than might have been\r\nexpected from their years. The notes of a Zamora bagpipe accompanied\r\nthem, and with modesty in their countenances and in their eyes, and\r\nlightness in their feet, they looked the best dancers in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np20e.jpg (361K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing these there came an artistic dance of the sort they call\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cspeaking dances.\xe2\x80\x9d It was composed of eight nymphs in two files, with\r\nthe god Cupid leading one and Interest the other, the former furnished\r\nwith wings, bow, quiver and arrows, the latter in a rich dress of gold\r\nand silk of divers colours. The nymphs that followed Love bore their\r\nnames written on white parchment in large letters on their backs.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoetry\xe2\x80\x9d was the name of the first, \xe2\x80\x9cWit\xe2\x80\x9d of the second, \xe2\x80\x9cBirth\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nthird, and \xe2\x80\x9cValour\xe2\x80\x9d of the fourth. Those that followed Interest were\r\ndistinguished in the same way; the badge of the first announced\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiberality,\xe2\x80\x9d that of the second \xe2\x80\x9cLargess,\xe2\x80\x9d the third \xe2\x80\x9cTreasure,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe fourth \xe2\x80\x9cPeaceful Possession.\xe2\x80\x9d In front of them all came a wooden\r\ncastle drawn by four wild men, all clad in ivy and hemp stained green,\r\nand looking so natural that they nearly terrified Sancho. On the front\r\nof the castle and on each of the four sides of its frame it bore the\r\ninscription \xe2\x80\x9cCastle of Caution.\xe2\x80\x9d Four skillful tabor and flute players\r\naccompanied them, and the dance having been opened, Cupid, after\r\nexecuting two figures, raised his eyes and bent his bow against a\r\ndamsel who stood between the turrets of the castle, and thus addressed\r\nher:\r\n\r\nI am the mighty God whose sway\r\nIs potent over land and sea.\r\nThe heavens above us own me; nay,\r\nThe shades below acknowledge me.\r\nI know not fear, I have my will,\r\nWhate\xe2\x80\x99er my whim or fancy be;\r\nFor me there\xe2\x80\x99s no impossible,\r\nI order, bind, forbid, set free.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving concluded the stanza he discharged an arrow at the top of the\r\ncastle, and went back to his place. Interest then came forward and went\r\nthrough two more figures, and as soon as the tabors ceased, he said:\r\n\r\nBut mightier than Love am I,\r\nThough Love it be that leads me on,\r\nThan mine no lineage is more high,\r\nOr older, underneath the sun.\r\nTo use me rightly few know how,\r\nTo act without me fewer still,\r\nFor I am Interest, and I vow\r\nFor evermore to do thy will.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterest retired, and Poetry came forward, and when she had gone\r\nthrough her figures like the others, fixing her eyes on the damsel of\r\nthe castle, she said:\r\n\r\nWith many a fanciful conceit,\r\nFair Lady, winsome Poesy\r\nHer soul, an offering at thy feet,\r\nPresents in sonnets unto thee.\r\nIf thou my homage wilt not scorn,\r\nThy fortune, watched by envious eyes,\r\nOn wings of poesy upborne\r\nShall be exalted to the skies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoetry withdrew, and on the side of Interest Liberality advanced, and\r\nafter having gone through her figures, said:\r\n\r\nTo give, while shunning each extreme,\r\nThe sparing hand, the over-free,\r\nTherein consists, so wise men deem,\r\nThe virtue Liberality.\r\nBut thee, fair lady, to enrich,\r\nMyself a prodigal I\xe2\x80\x99ll prove,\r\nA vice not wholly shameful, which\r\nMay find its fair excuse in love.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same manner all the characters of the two bands advanced and\r\nretired, and each executed its figures, and delivered its verses, some\r\nof them graceful, some burlesque, but Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s memory (though he\r\nhad an excellent one) only carried away those that have been just\r\nquoted. All then mingled together, forming chains and breaking off\r\nagain with graceful, unconstrained gaiety; and whenever Love passed in\r\nfront of the castle he shot his arrows up at it, while Interest broke\r\ngilded pellets against it. At length, after they had danced a good\r\nwhile, Interest drew out a great purse, made of the skin of a large\r\nbrindled cat and to all appearance full of money, and flung it at the\r\ncastle, and with the force of the blow the boards fell asunder and\r\ntumbled down, leaving the damsel exposed and unprotected. Interest and\r\nthe characters of his band advanced, and throwing a great chain of gold\r\nover her neck pretended to take her and lead her away captive, on\r\nseeing which, Love and his supporters made as though they would release\r\nher, the whole action being to the accompaniment of the tabors and in\r\nthe form of a regular dance. The wild men made peace between them, and\r\nwith great dexterity readjusted and fixed the boards of the castle, and\r\nthe damsel once more ensconced herself within; and with this the dance\r\nwound up, to the great enjoyment of the beholders.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote asked one of the nymphs who it was that had composed and\r\narranged it. She replied that it was a beneficiary of the town who had\r\na nice taste in devising things of the sort. \xe2\x80\x9cI will lay a wager,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDon Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the same bachelor or beneficiary is a greater friend\r\nof Camacho\xe2\x80\x99s than of Basilio\xe2\x80\x99s, and that he is better at satire than at\r\nvespers; he has introduced the accomplishments of Basilio and the\r\nriches of Camacho very neatly into the dance.\xe2\x80\x9d Sancho Panza, who was\r\nlistening to all this, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThe king is my cock; I stick to\r\nCamacho.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt is easy to see thou art a clown, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand one of that sort that cry \xe2\x80\x98Long life to the conqueror.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know of what sort I am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know very\r\nwell I\xe2\x80\x99ll never get such elegant skimmings off Basilio\xe2\x80\x99s pots as these\r\nI have got off Camacho\xe2\x80\x99s;\xe2\x80\x9d and he showed him the bucketful of geese and\r\nhens, and seizing one began to eat with great gaiety and appetite,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cA fig for the accomplishments of Basilio! As much as thou hast\r\nso much art thou worth, and as much as thou art worth so much hast\r\nthou. As a grandmother of mine used to say, there are only two families\r\nin the world, the Haves and the Haven\xe2\x80\x99ts; and she stuck to the Haves;\r\nand to this day, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, people would sooner feel the pulse\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98Have,\xe2\x80\x99 than of \xe2\x80\x98Know;\xe2\x80\x99 an ass covered with gold looks better than a\r\nhorse with a pack-saddle. So once more I say I stick to Camacho, the\r\nbountiful skimmings of whose pots are geese and hens, hares and\r\nrabbits; but of Basilio\xe2\x80\x99s, if any ever come to hand, or even to foot,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll be only rinsings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast thou finished thy harangue, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\r\nI have finished it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I see your worship takes\r\noffence at it; but if it was not for that, there was work enough cut\r\nout for three days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant I may see thee dumb before I die, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the rate we are going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be chewing clay before\r\nyour worship dies; and then, maybe, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be so dumb that I\xe2\x80\x99ll not say a\r\nword until the end of the world, or, at least, till the day of\r\njudgment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven should that happen, O Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthy silence\r\nwill never come up to all thou hast talked, art talking, and wilt talk\r\nall thy life; moreover, it naturally stands to reason, that my death\r\nwill come before thine; so I never expect to see thee dumb, not even\r\nwhen thou art drinking or sleeping, and that is the utmost I can say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn good faith, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no trusting that\r\nfleshless one, I mean Death, who devours the lamb as soon as the sheep,\r\nand, as I have heard our curate say, treads with equal foot upon the\r\nlofty towers of kings and the lowly huts of the poor. That lady is more\r\nmighty than dainty, she is in no way squeamish, she devours all and is\r\nready for all, and fills her alforjas with people of all sorts, ages,\r\nand ranks. She is no reaper that sleeps out the noontide; at all times\r\nshe is reaping and cutting down, as well the dry grass as the green;\r\nshe never seems to chew, but bolts and swallows all that is put before\r\nher, for she has a canine appetite that is never satisfied; and though\r\nshe has no belly, she shows she has a dropsy and is athirst to drink\r\nthe lives of all that live, as one would drink a jug of cold water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay no more, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote at this; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t try to better\r\nit, and risk a fall; for in truth what thou hast said about death in\r\nthy rustic phrase is what a good preacher might have said. I tell thee,\r\nSancho, if thou hadst discretion equal to thy mother wit, thou mightst\r\ntake a pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe preaches well who lives well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know no more\r\ntheology than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor needst thou,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I cannot conceive or make out\r\nhow it is that, the fear of God being the beginning of wisdom, thou,\r\nwho art more afraid of a lizard than of him, knowest so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPass judgment on your chivalries, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nset yourself up to judge of other men\xe2\x80\x99s fears or braveries, for I am as\r\ngood a fearer of God as my neighbours; but leave me to despatch these\r\nskimmings, for all the rest is only idle talk that we shall be called\r\nto account for in the other world;\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying, he began a fresh\r\nattack on the bucket, with such a hearty appetite that he aroused Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s, who no doubt would have helped him had he not been prevented\r\nby what must be told farther on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np20f.jpg (41K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nIN WHICH CAMACHO\xe2\x80\x99S WEDDING IS CONTINUED, WITH OTHER DELIGHTFUL\r\nINCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np21a.jpg (118K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Don Quixote and Sancho were engaged in the discussion set forth\r\nthe last chapter, they heard loud shouts and a great noise, which were\r\nuttered and made by the men on the mares as they went at full gallop,\r\nshouting, to receive the bride and bridegroom, who were approaching\r\nwith musical instruments and pageantry of all sorts around them, and\r\naccompanied by the priest and the relatives of both, and all the most\r\ndistinguished people of the surrounding villages. When Sancho saw the\r\nbride, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cBy my faith, she is not dressed like a country\r\ngirl, but like some fine court lady; egad, as well as I can make out,\r\nthe patena she wears rich coral, and her green Cuenca stuff is\r\nthirty-pile velvet; and then the white linen trimming\xe2\x80\x94by my oath, but\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s satin! Look at her hands\xe2\x80\x94jet rings on them! May I never have luck\r\nif they\xe2\x80\x99re not gold rings, and real gold, and set with pearls as white\r\nas a curdled milk, and every one of them worth an eye of one\xe2\x80\x99s head!\r\nWhoreson baggage, what hair she has! if it\xe2\x80\x99s not a wig, I never saw\r\nlonger or fairer all the days of my life. See how bravely she bears\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94and her shape! Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you say she was like a walking palm\r\ntree loaded with clusters of dates? for the trinkets she has hanging\r\nfrom her hair and neck look just like them. I swear in my heart she is\r\na brave lass, and fit \xe2\x80\x98to pass over the banks of Flanders.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote laughed at Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s boorish eulogies and thought that,\r\nsaving his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he had never seen a more beautiful\r\nwoman. The fair Quiteria appeared somewhat pale, which was, no doubt,\r\nbecause of the bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out for\r\ntheir wedding on the morrow. They advanced towards a theatre that stood\r\non one side of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs, where they\r\nwere to plight their troth, and from which they were to behold the\r\ndances and plays; but at the moment of their arrival at the spot they\r\nheard a loud outcry behind them, and a voice exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cWait a\r\nlittle, ye, as inconsiderate as ye are hasty!\xe2\x80\x9d At these words all\r\nturned round, and perceived that the speaker was a man clad in what\r\nseemed to be a loose black coat garnished with crimson patches like\r\nflames. He was crowned (as was presently seen) with a crown of gloomy\r\ncypress, and in his hand he held a long staff. As he approached he was\r\nrecognised by everyone as the gay Basilio, and all waited anxiously to\r\nsee what would come of his words, in dread of some catastrophe in\r\nconsequence of his appearance at such a moment. He came up at last\r\nweary and breathless, and planting himself in front of the bridal pair,\r\ndrove his staff, which had a steel spike at the end, into the ground,\r\nand, with a pale face and eyes fixed on Quiteria, he thus addressed her\r\nin a hoarse, trembling voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell dost thou know, ungrateful Quiteria, that according to the holy\r\nlaw we acknowledge, so long as live thou canst take no husband; nor art\r\nthou ignorant either that, in my hopes that time and my own exertions\r\nwould improve my fortunes, I have never failed to observe the respect\r\ndue to thy honour; but thou, casting behind thee all thou owest to my\r\ntrue love, wouldst surrender what is mine to another whose wealth\r\nserves to bring him not only good fortune but supreme happiness; and\r\nnow to complete it (not that I think he deserves it, but inasmuch as\r\nheaven is pleased to bestow it upon him), I will, with my own hands, do\r\naway with the obstacle that may interfere with it, and remove myself\r\nfrom between you. Long live the rich Camacho! many a happy year may he\r\nlive with the ungrateful Quiteria! and let the poor Basilio die,\r\nBasilio whose poverty clipped the wings of his happiness, and brought\r\nhim to the grave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, he seized the staff he had driven into the ground, and\r\nleaving one half of it fixed there, showed it to be a sheath that\r\nconcealed a tolerably long rapier; and, what may be called its hilt\r\nbeing planted in the ground, he swiftly, coolly, and deliberately threw\r\nhimself upon it, and in an instant the bloody point and half the steel\r\nblade appeared at his back, the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed\r\nin his blood, and transfixed by his own weapon.\r\n\r\nHis friends at once ran to his aid, filled with grief at his misery and\r\nsad fate, and Don Quixote, dismounting from Rocinante, hastened to\r\nsupport him, and took him in his arms, and found he had not yet ceased\r\nto breathe. They were about to draw out the rapier, but the priest who\r\nwas standing by objected to its being withdrawn before he had confessed\r\nhim, as the instant of its withdrawal would be that of this death.\r\nBasilio, however, reviving slightly, said in a weak voice, as though in\r\npain, \xe2\x80\x9cIf thou wouldst consent, cruel Quiteria, to give me thy hand as\r\nmy bride in this last fatal moment, I might still hope that my rashness\r\nwould find pardon, as by its means I attained the bliss of being\r\nthine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing this the priest bade him think of the welfare of his soul\r\nrather than of the cravings of the body, and in all earnestness implore\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s pardon for his sins and for his rash resolve; to which Basilio\r\nreplied that he was determined not to confess unless Quiteria first\r\ngave him her hand in marriage, for that happiness would compose his\r\nmind and give him courage to make his confession.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote hearing the wounded man\xe2\x80\x99s entreaty, exclaimed aloud that\r\nwhat Basilio asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request that\r\nmight be easily complied with; and that it would be as much to Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nCamacho\xe2\x80\x99s honour to receive the lady Quiteria as the widow of the brave\r\nBasilio as if he received her direct from her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this case,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be only to say \xe2\x80\x98yes,\xe2\x80\x99 and no\r\nconsequences can follow the utterance of the word, for the nuptial\r\ncouch of this marriage must be the grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCamacho was listening to all this, perplexed and bewildered and not\r\nknowing what to say or do; but so urgent were the entreaties of\r\nBasilio\xe2\x80\x99s friends, imploring him to allow Quiteria to give him her\r\nhand, so that his soul, quitting this life in despair, should not be\r\nlost, that they moved, nay, forced him, to say that if Quiteria were\r\nwilling to give it he was satisfied, as it was only putting off the\r\nfulfillment of his wishes for a moment. At once all assailed Quiteria\r\nand pressed her, some with prayers, and others with tears, and others\r\nwith persuasive arguments, to give her hand to poor Basilio; but she,\r\nharder than marble and more unmoved than any statue, seemed unable or\r\nunwilling to utter a word, nor would she have given any reply had not\r\nthe priest bade her decide quickly what she meant to do, as Basilio now\r\nhad his soul at his teeth, and there was no time for hesitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np21b.jpg (374K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this the fair Quiteria, to all appearance distressed, grieved, and\r\nrepentant, advanced without a word to where Basilio lay, his eyes\r\nalready turned in his head, his breathing short and painful, murmuring\r\nthe name of Quiteria between his teeth, and apparently about to die\r\nlike a heathen and not like a Christian. Quiteria approached him, and\r\nkneeling, demanded his hand by signs without speaking. Basilio opened\r\nhis eyes and gazing fixedly at her, said, \xe2\x80\x9cO Quiteria, why hast thou\r\nturned compassionate at a moment when thy compassion will serve as a\r\ndagger to rob me of life, for I have not now the strength left either\r\nto bear the happiness thou givest me in accepting me as thine, or to\r\nsuppress the pain that is rapidly drawing the dread shadow of death\r\nover my eyes? What I entreat of thee, O thou fatal star to me, is that\r\nthe hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give me, be not given out of\r\ncomplaisance or to deceive me afresh, but that thou confess and declare\r\nthat without any constraint upon thy will thou givest it to me as to\r\nthy lawful husband; for it is not meet that thou shouldst trifle with\r\nme at such a moment as this, or have recourse to falsehoods with one\r\nwho has dealt so truly by thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders\r\nexpected each return of faintness would take his life with it. Then\r\nQuiteria, overcome with modesty and shame, holding in her right hand\r\nthe hand of Basilio, said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo force would bend my will; as freely,\r\ntherefore, as it is possible for me to do so, I give thee the hand of a\r\nlawful wife, and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free\r\nwill, untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has\r\nbrought upon thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I give it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Basilio, \xe2\x80\x9cnot agitated or distracted, but with\r\nunclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant me, thus do I give\r\nmyself to be thy husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I give myself to be thy wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Quiteria, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether thou livest\r\nmany years, or they carry thee from my arms to the grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor one so badly wounded,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Sancho at this point, \xe2\x80\x9cthis young\r\nman has a great deal to say; they should make him leave off billing and\r\ncooing, and attend to his soul; for to my thinking he has it more on\r\nhis tongue than at his teeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBasilio and Quiteria having thus joined hands, the priest, deeply moved\r\nand with tears in his eyes, pronounced the blessing upon them, and\r\nimplored heaven to grant an easy passage to the soul of the newly\r\nwedded man, who, the instant he received the blessing, started nimbly\r\nto his feet and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that\r\nhad been sheathed in his body. All the bystanders were astounded, and\r\nsome, more simple than inquiring, began shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cA miracle, a\r\nmiracle!\xe2\x80\x9d But Basilio replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNo miracle, no miracle; only a trick, a\r\ntrick!\xe2\x80\x9d The priest, perplexed and amazed, made haste to examine the\r\nwound with both hands, and found that the blade had passed, not through\r\nBasilio\xe2\x80\x99s flesh and ribs, but through a hollow iron tube full of blood,\r\nwhich he had adroitly fixed at the place, the blood, as was afterwards\r\nascertained, having been so prepared as not to congeal. In short, the\r\npriest and Camacho and most of those present saw they were tricked and\r\nmade fools of. The bride showed no signs of displeasure at the\r\ndeception; on the contrary, hearing them say that the marriage, being\r\nfraudulent, would not be valid, she said that she confirmed it afresh,\r\nwhence they all concluded that the affair had been planned by agreement\r\nand understanding between the pair, whereat Camacho and his supporters\r\nwere so mortified that they proceeded to revenge themselves by\r\nviolence, and a great number of them drawing their swords attacked\r\nBasilio, in whose protection as many more swords were in an instant\r\nunsheathed, while Don Quixote taking the lead on horseback, with his\r\nlance over his arm and well covered with his shield, made all give way\r\nbefore him. Sancho, who never found any pleasure or enjoyment in such\r\ndoings, retreated to the wine-jars from which he had taken his\r\ndelectable skimmings, considering that, as a holy place, that spot\r\nwould be respected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, sirs, hold!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Don Quixote in a loud voice; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have no\r\nright to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us: remember\r\nlove and war are the same thing, and as in war it is allowable and\r\ncommon to make use of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy, so in\r\nthe contests and rivalries of love the tricks and devices employed to\r\nattain the desired end are justifiable, provided they be not to the\r\ndiscredit or dishonour of the loved object. Quiteria belonged to\r\nBasilio and Basilio to Quiteria by the just and beneficent disposal of\r\nheaven. Camacho is rich, and can purchase his pleasure when, where, and\r\nas it pleases him. Basilio has but this ewe-lamb, and no one, however\r\npowerful he may be, shall take her from him; these two whom God hath\r\njoined man cannot separate; and he who attempts it must first pass the\r\npoint of this lance;\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying he brandished it so stoutly and\r\ndexterously that he overawed all who did not know him.\r\n\r\nBut so deep an impression had the rejection of Quiteria made on\r\nCamacho\xe2\x80\x99s mind that it banished her at once from his thoughts; and so\r\nthe counsels of the priest, who was a wise and kindly disposed man,\r\nprevailed with him, and by their means he and his partisans were\r\npacified and tranquillised, and to prove it put up their swords again,\r\ninveighing against the pliancy of Quiteria rather than the craftiness\r\nof Basilio; Camacho maintaining that, if Quiteria as a maiden had such\r\na love for Basilio, she would have loved him too as a married woman,\r\nand that he ought to thank heaven more for having taken her than for\r\nhaving given her.\r\n\r\nCamacho and those of his following, therefore, being consoled and\r\npacified, those on Basilio\xe2\x80\x99s side were appeased; and the rich Camacho,\r\nto show that he felt no resentment for the trick, and did not care\r\nabout it, desired the festival to go on just as if he were married in\r\nreality. Neither Basilio, however, nor his bride, nor their followers\r\nwould take any part in it, and they withdrew to Basilio\xe2\x80\x99s village; for\r\nthe poor, if they are persons of virtue and good sense, have those who\r\nfollow, honour, and uphold them, just as the rich have those who\r\nflatter and dance attendance on them. With them they carried Don\r\nQuixote, regarding him as a man of worth and a stout one. Sancho alone\r\nhad a cloud on his soul, for he found himself debarred from waiting for\r\nCamacho\xe2\x80\x99s splendid feast and festival, which lasted until night; and\r\nthus dragged away, he moodily followed his master, who accompanied\r\nBasilio\xe2\x80\x99s party, and left behind him the flesh-pots of Egypt; though in\r\nhis heart he took them with him, and their now nearly finished\r\nskimmings that he carried in the bucket conjured up visions before his\r\neyes of the glory and abundance of the good cheer he was losing. And\r\nso, vexed and dejected though not hungry, without dismounting from\r\nDapple he followed in the footsteps of Rocinante.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np21c.jpg (417K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np21e.jpg (49K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE GRAND ADVENTURE OF THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS IN THE\r\nHEART OF LA MANCHA, WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE BROUGHT TO A HAPPY\r\nTERMINATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np22a.jpg (112K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany and great were the attentions shown to Don Quixote by the newly\r\nmarried couple, who felt themselves under an obligation to him for\r\ncoming forward in defence of their cause; and they exalted his wisdom\r\nto the same level with his courage, rating him as a Cid in arms, and a\r\nCicero in eloquence. Worthy Sancho enjoyed himself for three days at\r\nthe expense of the pair, from whom they learned that the sham wound was\r\nnot a scheme arranged with the fair Quiteria, but a device of\r\nBasilio\xe2\x80\x99s, who counted on exactly the result they had seen; he\r\nconfessed, it is true, that he had confided his idea to some of his\r\nfriends, so that at the proper time they might aid him in his purpose\r\nand insure the success of the deception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np22b.jpg (344K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cis not and ought not to be called deception\r\nwhich aims at virtuous ends;\xe2\x80\x9d and the marriage of lovers he maintained\r\nto be a most excellent end, reminding them, however, that love has no\r\ngreater enemy than hunger and constant want; for love is all gaiety,\r\nenjoyment, and happiness, especially when the lover is in the\r\npossession of the object of his love, and poverty and want are the\r\ndeclared enemies of all these; which he said to urge Se\xc3\xb1or Basilio to\r\nabandon the practice of those accomplishments he was skilled in, for\r\nthough they brought him fame, they brought him no money, and apply\r\nhimself to the acquisition of wealth by legitimate industry, which will\r\nnever fail those who are prudent and persevering. The poor man who is a\r\nman of honour (if indeed a poor man can be a man of honour) has a jewel\r\nwhen he has a fair wife, and if she is taken from him, his honour is\r\ntaken from him and slain. The fair woman who is a woman of honour, and\r\nwhose husband is poor, deserves to be crowned with the laurels and\r\ncrowns of victory and triumph. Beauty by itself attracts the desires of\r\nall who behold it, and the royal eagles and birds of towering flight\r\nstoop on it as on a dainty lure; but if beauty be accompanied by want\r\nand penury, then the ravens and the kites and other birds of prey\r\nassail it, and she who stands firm against such attacks well deserves\r\nto be called the crown of her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, O prudent Basilio,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cit was the opinion of a certain sage, I know not\r\nwhom, that there was not more than one good woman in the whole world;\r\nand his advice was that each one should think and believe that this one\r\ngood woman was his own wife, and in this way he would live happy. I\r\nmyself am not married, nor, so far, has it ever entered my thoughts to\r\nbe so; nevertheless I would venture to give advice to anyone who might\r\nask it, as to the mode in which he should seek a wife such as he would\r\nbe content to marry. The first thing I would recommend him, would be to\r\nlook to good name rather than to wealth, for a good woman does not win\r\na good name merely by being good, but by letting it be seen that she is\r\nso, and open looseness and freedom do much more damage to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhonour than secret depravity. If you take a good woman into your house\r\nit will be an easy matter to keep her good, and even to make her still\r\nbetter; but if you take a bad one you will find it hard work to mend\r\nher, for it is no very easy matter to pass from one extreme to another.\r\nI do not say it is impossible, but I look upon it as difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho, listening to all this, said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThis master of mine,\r\nwhen I say anything that has weight and substance, says I might take a\r\npulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons; but I\r\nsay of him that, when he begins stringing maxims together and giving\r\nadvice not only might he take a pulpit in hand, but two on each finger,\r\nand go into the market-places to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content. Devil take you\r\nfor a knight-errant, what a lot of things you know! I used to think in\r\nmy heart that the only thing he knew was what belonged to his chivalry;\r\nbut there is nothing he won\xe2\x80\x99t have a finger in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho muttered this somewhat aloud, and his master overheard him, and\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou muttering there, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying anything or muttering anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nonly saying to myself that I wish I had heard what your worship has\r\nsaid just now before I married; perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99d say now, \xe2\x80\x98The ox that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloose licks himself well.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs thy Teresa so bad then, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not very bad,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she is not very good; at\r\nleast she is not as good as I could wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou dost wrong, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cto speak ill of thy wife;\r\nfor after all she is the mother of thy children.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe are quits,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor she speaks ill of me whenever she takes it into\r\nher head, especially when she is jealous; and Satan himself could not\r\nput up with her then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fine, they remained three days with the newly married couple, by\r\nwhom they were entertained and treated like kings. Don Quixote begged\r\nthe fencing licentiate to find him a guide to show him the way to the\r\ncave of Montesinos, as he had a great desire to enter it and see with\r\nhis own eyes if the wonderful tales that were told of it all over the\r\ncountry were true. The licentiate said he would get him a cousin of his\r\nown, a famous scholar, and one very much given to reading books of\r\nchivalry, who would have great pleasure in conducting him to the mouth\r\nof the very cave, and would show him the lakes of Ruidera, which were\r\nlikewise famous all over La Mancha, and even all over Spain; and he\r\nassured him he would find him entertaining, for he was a youth who\r\ncould write books good enough to be printed and dedicated to princes.\r\nThe cousin arrived at last, leading an ass in foal, with a pack-saddle\r\ncovered with a parti-coloured carpet or sackcloth; Sancho saddled\r\nRocinante, got Dapple ready, and stocked his alforjas, along with which\r\nwent those of the cousin, likewise well filled; and so, commending\r\nthemselves to God and bidding farewell to all, they set out, taking the\r\nroad for the famous cave of Montesinos.\r\n\r\nOn the way Don Quixote asked the cousin of what sort and character his\r\npursuits, avocations, and studies were, to which he replied that he was\r\nby profession a humanist, and that his pursuits and studies were making\r\nbooks for the press, all of great utility and no less entertainment to\r\nthe nation. One was called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Book of Liveries,\xe2\x80\x9d in which he\r\ndescribed seven hundred and three liveries, with their colours,\r\nmottoes, and ciphers, from which gentlemen of the court might pick and\r\nchoose any they fancied for festivals and revels, without having to go\r\na-begging for them from anyone, or puzzling their brains, as the saying\r\nis, to have them appropriate to their objects and purposes; \xe2\x80\x9cfor,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cI give the jealous, the rejected, the forgotten, the absent, what\r\nwill suit them, and fit them without fail. I have another book, too,\r\nwhich I shall call \xe2\x80\x98Metamorphoses, or the Spanish Ovid,\xe2\x80\x99 one of rare\r\nand original invention, for imitating Ovid in burlesque style, I show\r\nin it who the Giralda of Seville and the Angel of the Magdalena were,\r\nwhat the sewer of Vecinguerra at Cordova was, what the bulls of\r\nGuisando, the Sierra Morena, the Leganitos and Lavapies fountains at\r\nMadrid, not forgetting those of the Piojo, of the Cano Dorado, and of\r\nthe Priora; and all with their allegories, metaphors, and changes, so\r\nthat they are amusing, interesting, and instructive, all at once.\r\nAnother book I have which I call \xe2\x80\x98The Supplement to Polydore Vergil,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhich treats of the invention of things, and is a work of great\r\nerudition and research, for I establish and elucidate elegantly some\r\nthings of great importance which Polydore omitted to mention. He forgot\r\nto tell us who was the first man in the world that had a cold in his\r\nhead, and who was the first to try salivation for the French disease,\r\nbut I give it accurately set forth, and quote more than five-and-twenty\r\nauthors in proof of it, so you may perceive I have laboured to good\r\npurpose and that the book will be of service to the whole world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho, who had been very attentive to the cousin\xe2\x80\x99s words, said to him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, se\xc3\xb1or\xe2\x80\x94and God give you luck in printing your books\xe2\x80\x94can you\r\ntell me (for of course you know, as you know everything) who was the\r\nfirst man that scratched his head? For to my thinking it must have been\r\nour father Adam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it must,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cousin; \xe2\x80\x9cfor there is no doubt but Adam had a\r\nhead and hair; and being the first man in the world he would have\r\nscratched himself sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut now tell me, who was the first tumbler\r\nin the world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the cousin, \xe2\x80\x9cI could not at this moment say\r\npositively without having investigated it; I will look it up when I go\r\nback to where I have my books, and will satisfy you the next time we\r\nmeet, for this will not be the last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t give yourself any trouble about\r\nit, for I have just this minute hit upon what I asked you. The first\r\ntumbler in the world, you must know, was Lucifer, when they cast or\r\npitched him out of heaven; for he came tumbling into the bottomless\r\npit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cousin; and said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSancho, that question and answer are not thine own; thou hast heard\r\nthem from someone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your peace, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfaith, if I take to asking\r\nquestions and answering, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go on from this till to-morrow morning.\r\nNay! to ask foolish things and answer nonsense I needn\xe2\x80\x99t go looking for\r\nhelp from my neighbours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast said more than thou art aware of, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor there are some who weary themselves out in learning and proving\r\nthings that, after they are known and proved, are not worth a farthing\r\nto the understanding or memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this and other pleasant conversation the day went by, and that night\r\nthey put up at a small hamlet whence it was not more than two leagues\r\nto the cave of Montesinos, so the cousin told Don Quixote, adding, that\r\nif he was bent upon entering it, it would be requisite for him to\r\nprovide himself with ropes, so that he might be tied and lowered into\r\nits depths. Don Quixote said that even if it reached to the bottomless\r\npit he meant to see where it went to; so they bought about a hundred\r\nfathoms of rope, and next day at two in the afternoon they arrived at\r\nthe cave, the mouth of which is spacious and wide, but full of thorn\r\nand wild-fig bushes and brambles and briars, so thick and matted that\r\nthey completely close it up and cover it over.\r\n\r\nOn coming within sight of it the cousin, Sancho, and Don Quixote\r\ndismounted, and the first two immediately tied the latter very firmly\r\nwith the ropes, and as they were girding and swathing him Sancho said\r\nto him, \xe2\x80\x9cMind what you are about, master mine; don\xe2\x80\x99t go burying\r\nyourself alive, or putting yourself where you\xe2\x80\x99ll be like a bottle put\r\nto cool in a well; it\xe2\x80\x99s no affair or business of your worship\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nbecome the explorer of this, which must be worse than a Moorish\r\ndungeon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTie me and hold thy peace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor an emprise like\r\nthis, friend Sancho, was reserved for me;\xe2\x80\x9d and said the guide, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg\r\nof you, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, to observe carefully and examine with a\r\nhundred eyes everything that is within there; perhaps there may be some\r\nthings for me to put into my book of \xe2\x80\x98Transformations.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe drum is in hands that will know how to beat it well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSancho Panza.\r\n\r\nWhen he had said this and finished the tying (which was not over the\r\narmour but only over the doublet) Don Quixote observed, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\ncareless of us not to have provided ourselves with a small cattle-bell\r\nto be tied on the rope close to me, the sound of which would show that\r\nI was still descending and alive; but as that is out of the question\r\nnow, in God\xe2\x80\x99s hand be it to guide me;\xe2\x80\x9d and forthwith he fell on his\r\nknees and in a low voice offered up a prayer to heaven, imploring God\r\nto aid him and grant him success in this to all appearance perilous and\r\nuntried adventure, and then exclaimed aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cO mistress of my actions\r\nand movements, illustrious and peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, if so be\r\nthe prayers and supplications of this fortunate lover can reach thy\r\nears, by thy incomparable beauty I entreat thee to listen to them, for\r\nthey but ask thee not to refuse me thy favour and protection now that I\r\nstand in such need of them. I am about to precipitate, to sink, to\r\nplunge myself into the abyss that is here before me, only to let the\r\nworld know that while thou dost favour me there is no impossibility I\r\nwill not attempt and accomplish.\xe2\x80\x9d With these words he approached the\r\ncavern, and perceived that it was impossible to let himself down or\r\neffect an entrance except by sheer force or cleaving a passage; so\r\ndrawing his sword he began to demolish and cut away the brambles at the\r\nmouth of the cave, at the noise of which a vast multitude of crows and\r\nchoughs flew out of it so thick and so fast that they knocked Don\r\nQuixote down; and if he had been as much of a believer in augury as he\r\nwas a Catholic Christian he would have taken it as a bad omen and\r\ndeclined to bury himself in such a place. He got up, however, and as\r\nthere came no more crows, or night-birds like the bats that flew out at\r\nthe same time with the crows, the cousin and Sancho giving him rope, he\r\nlowered himself into the depths of the dread cavern; and as he entered\r\nit Sancho sent his blessing after him, making a thousand crosses over\r\nhim and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cGod, and the Pe\xc3\xb1a de Francia, and the Trinity of Gaeta\r\nguide thee, flower and cream of knights-errant. There thou goest, thou\r\ndare-devil of the earth, heart of steel, arm of brass; once more, God\r\nguide thee and send thee back safe, sound, and unhurt to the light of\r\nthis world thou art leaving to bury thyself in the darkness thou art\r\nseeking there;\xe2\x80\x9d and the cousin offered up almost the same prayers and\r\nsupplications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np22c.jpg (365K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote kept calling to them to give him rope and more rope, and\r\nthey gave it out little by little, and by the time the calls, which\r\ncame out of the cave as out of a pipe, ceased to be heard they had let\r\ndown the hundred fathoms of rope. They were inclined to pull Don\r\nQuixote up again, as they could give him no more rope; however, they\r\nwaited about half an hour, at the end of which time they began to\r\ngather in the rope again with great ease and without feeling any\r\nweight, which made them fancy Don Quixote was remaining below; and\r\npersuaded that it was so, Sancho wept bitterly, and hauled away in\r\ngreat haste in order to settle the question. When, however, they had\r\ncome to, as it seemed, rather more than eighty fathoms they felt a\r\nweight, at which they were greatly delighted; and at last, at ten\r\nfathoms more, they saw Don Quixote distinctly, and Sancho called out to\r\nhim, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome back, se\xc3\xb1or, for we had begun to think you were\r\ngoing to stop there to found a family.\xe2\x80\x9d But Don Quixote answered not a\r\nword, and drawing him out entirely they perceived he had his eyes shut\r\nand every appearance of being fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThey stretched him on the ground and untied him, but still he did not\r\nawake; however, they rolled him back and forwards and shook and pulled\r\nhim about, so that after some time he came to himself, stretching\r\nhimself just as if he were waking up from a deep and sound sleep, and\r\nlooking about him he said, \xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive you, friends; ye have taken me\r\naway from the sweetest and most delightful existence and spectacle that\r\never human being enjoyed or beheld. Now indeed do I know that all the\r\npleasures of this life pass away like a shadow and a dream, or fade\r\nlike the flower of the field. O ill-fated Montesinos! O sore-wounded\r\nDurandarte! O unhappy Belerma! O tearful Guadiana, and ye O hapless\r\ndaughters of Ruidera who show in your waves the tears that flowed from\r\nyour beauteous eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np22d.jpg (318K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cousin and Sancho Panza listened with deep attention to the words\r\nof Don Quixote, who uttered them as though with immense pain he drew\r\nthem up from his very bowels. They begged of him to explain himself,\r\nand tell them what he had seen in that hell down there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHell do you call it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9ccall it by no such name, for\r\nit does not deserve it, as ye shall soon see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then begged them to give him something to eat, as he was very\r\nhungry. They spread the cousin\xe2\x80\x99s sackcloth on the grass, and put the\r\nstores of the alforjas into requisition, and all three sitting down\r\nlovingly and sociably, they made a luncheon and a supper of it all in\r\none; and when the sackcloth was removed, Don Quixote of La Mancha said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet no one rise, and attend to me, my sons, both of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np22e.jpg (48K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nOF THE WONDERFUL THINGS THE INCOMPARABLE DON QUIXOTE SAID HE SAW IN THE\r\nPROFOUND CAVE OF MONTESINOS, THE IMPOSSIBILITY AND MAGNITUDE OF WHICH\r\nCAUSE THIS ADVENTURE TO BE DEEMED APOCRYPHAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np23a.jpg (148K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about four in the afternoon when the sun, veiled in clouds, with\r\nsubdued light and tempered beams, enabled Don Quixote to relate,\r\nwithout heat or inconvenience, what he had seen in the cave of\r\nMontesinos to his two illustrious hearers, and he began as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA matter of some twelve or fourteen times a man\xe2\x80\x99s height down in this\r\npit, on the right-hand side, there is a recess or space, roomy enough\r\nto contain a large cart with its mules. A little light reaches it\r\nthrough some chinks or crevices, communicating with it and open to the\r\nsurface of the earth. This recess or space I perceived when I was\r\nalready growing weary and disgusted at finding myself hanging suspended\r\nby the rope, travelling downwards into that dark region without any\r\ncertainty or knowledge of where I was going, so I resolved to enter it\r\nand rest myself for a while. I called out, telling you not to let out\r\nmore rope until I bade you, but you cannot have heard me. I then\r\ngathered in the rope you were sending me, and making a coil or pile of\r\nit I seated myself upon it, ruminating and considering what I was to do\r\nto lower myself to the bottom, having no one to hold me up; and as I\r\nwas thus deep in thought and perplexity, suddenly and without\r\nprovocation a profound sleep fell upon me, and when I least expected\r\nit, I know not how, I awoke and found myself in the midst of the most\r\nbeautiful, delightful meadow that nature could produce or the most\r\nlively human imagination conceive. I opened my eyes, I rubbed them, and\r\nfound I was not asleep but thoroughly awake. Nevertheless, I felt my\r\nhead and breast to satisfy myself whether it was I myself who was there\r\nor some empty delusive phantom; but touch, feeling, the collected\r\nthoughts that passed through my mind, all convinced me that I was the\r\nsame then and there that I am this moment. Next there presented itself\r\nto my sight a stately royal palace or castle, with walls that seemed\r\nbuilt of clear transparent crystal; and through two great doors that\r\nopened wide therein, I saw coming forth and advancing towards me a\r\nvenerable old man, clad in a long gown of mulberry-coloured serge that\r\ntrailed upon the ground. On his shoulders and breast he had a green\r\nsatin collegiate hood, and covering his head a black Milanese bonnet,\r\nand his snow-white beard fell below his girdle. He carried no arms\r\nwhatever, nothing but a rosary of beads bigger than fair-sized\r\nfilberts, each tenth bead being like a moderate ostrich egg; his\r\nbearing, his gait, his dignity and imposing presence held me spellbound\r\nand wondering. He approached me, and the first thing he did was to\r\nembrace me closely, and then he said to me, \xe2\x80\x98For a long time now, O\r\nvaliant knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, we who are here enchanted in\r\nthese solitudes have been hoping to see thee, that thou mayest make\r\nknown to the world what is shut up and concealed in this deep cave,\r\ncalled the cave of Montesinos, which thou hast entered, an achievement\r\nreserved for thy invincible heart and stupendous courage alone to\r\nattempt. Come with me, illustrious sir, and I will show thee the\r\nmarvels hidden within this transparent castle, whereof I am the alcaide\r\nand perpetual warden; for I am Montesinos himself, from whom the cave\r\ntakes its name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe instant he told me he was Montesinos, I asked him if the story\r\nthey told in the world above here was true, that he had taken out the\r\nheart of his great friend Durandarte from his breast with a little\r\ndagger, and carried it to the lady Belerma, as his friend when at the\r\npoint of death had commanded him. He said in reply that they spoke the\r\ntruth in every respect except as to the dagger, for it was not a\r\ndagger, nor little, but a burnished poniard sharper than an awl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat poniard must have been made by Ramon de Hoces the Sevillian,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cit could not have been by that\r\nponiard maker, however, because Ramon de Hoces was a man of yesterday,\r\nand the affair of Roncesvalles, where this mishap occurred, was long\r\nago; but the question is of no great importance, nor does it affect or\r\nmake any alteration in the truth or substance of the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cousin; \xe2\x80\x9ccontinue, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, for I am\r\nlistening to you with the greatest pleasure in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd with no less do I tell the tale,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand so, to\r\nproceed\xe2\x80\x94the venerable Montesinos led me into the palace of crystal,\r\nwhere, in a lower chamber, strangely cool and entirely of alabaster,\r\nwas an elaborately wrought marble tomb, upon which I beheld, stretched\r\nat full length, a knight, not of bronze, or marble, or jasper, as are\r\nseen on other tombs, but of actual flesh and bone. His right hand\r\n(which seemed to me somewhat hairy and sinewy, a sign of great strength\r\nin its owner) lay on the side of his heart; but before I could put any\r\nquestion to Montesinos, he, seeing me gazing at the tomb in amazement,\r\nsaid to me, \xe2\x80\x98This is my friend Durandarte, flower and mirror of the\r\ntrue lovers and valiant knights of his time. He is held enchanted here,\r\nas I myself and many others are, by that French enchanter Merlin, who,\r\nthey say, was the devil\xe2\x80\x99s son; but my belief is, not that he was the\r\ndevil\xe2\x80\x99s son, but that he knew, as the saying is, a point more than the\r\ndevil. How or why he enchanted us, no one knows, but time will tell,\r\nand I suspect that time is not far off. What I marvel at is, that I\r\nknow it to be as sure as that it is now day, that Durandarte ended his\r\nlife in my arms, and that, after his death, I took out his heart with\r\nmy own hands; and indeed it must have weighed more than two pounds,\r\nfor, according to naturalists, he who has a large heart is more largely\r\nendowed with valour than he who has a small one. Then, as this is the\r\ncase, and as the knight did really die, how comes it that he now moans\r\nand sighs from time to time, as if he were still alive?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np23b.jpg (243K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs he said this, the wretched Durandarte cried out in a loud voice:\r\n\r\nO cousin Montesinos!\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas my last request of thee,\r\nWhen my soul hath left the body,\r\nAnd that lying dead I be,\r\nWith thy poniard or thy dagger\r\nCut the heart from out my breast,\r\nAnd bear it to Belerma.\r\nThis was my last request.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn hearing which, the venerable Montesinos fell on his knees before\r\nthe unhappy knight, and with tearful eyes exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Long since, Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nDurandarte, my beloved cousin, long since have I done what you bade me\r\non that sad day when I lost you; I took out your heart as well as I\r\ncould, not leaving an atom of it in your breast, I wiped it with a lace\r\nhandkerchief, and I took the road to France with it, having first laid\r\nyou in the bosom of the earth with tears enough to wash and cleanse my\r\nhands of the blood that covered them after wandering among your bowels;\r\nand more by token, O cousin of my soul, at the first village I came to\r\nafter leaving Roncesvalles, I sprinkled a little salt upon your heart\r\nto keep it sweet, and bring it, if not fresh, at least pickled, into\r\nthe presence of the lady Belerma, whom, together with you, myself,\r\nGuadiana your squire, the duenna Ruidera and her seven daughters and\r\ntwo nieces, and many more of your friends and acquaintances, the sage\r\nMerlin has been keeping enchanted here these many years; and although\r\nmore than five hundred have gone by, not one of us has died; Ruidera\r\nand her daughters and nieces alone are missing, and these, because of\r\nthe tears they shed, Merlin, out of the compassion he seems to have\r\nfelt for them, changed into so many lakes, which to this day in the\r\nworld of the living, and in the province of La Mancha, are called the\r\nLakes of Ruidera. The seven daughters belong to the kings of Spain and\r\nthe two nieces to the knights of a very holy order called the Order of\r\nSt. John. Guadiana your squire, likewise bewailing your fate, was\r\nchanged into a river of his own name, but when he came to the surface\r\nand beheld the sun of another heaven, so great was his grief at finding\r\nhe was leaving you, that he plunged into the bowels of the earth;\r\nhowever, as he cannot help following his natural course, he from time\r\nto time comes forth and shows himself to the sun and the world. The\r\nlakes aforesaid send him their waters, and with these, and others that\r\ncome to him, he makes a grand and imposing entrance into Portugal; but\r\nfor all that, go where he may, he shows his melancholy and sadness, and\r\ntakes no pride in breeding dainty choice fish, only coarse and\r\ntasteless sorts, very different from those of the golden Tagus. All\r\nthis that I tell you now, O cousin mine, I have told you many times\r\nbefore, and as you make no answer, I fear that either you believe me\r\nnot, or do not hear me, whereat I feel God knows what grief. I have now\r\nnews to give you, which, if it serves not to alleviate your sufferings,\r\nwill not in any wise increase them. Know that you have here before you\r\n(open your eyes and you will see) that great knight of whom the sage\r\nMerlin has prophesied such great things; that Don Quixote of La Mancha\r\nI mean, who has again, and to better purpose than in past times,\r\nrevived in these days knight-errantry, long since forgotten, and by\r\nwhose intervention and aid it may be we shall be disenchanted; for\r\ngreat deeds are reserved for great men.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And if that may not be,\xe2\x80\x99 said the wretched Durandarte in a low and\r\nfeeble voice, \xe2\x80\x98if that may not be, then, my cousin, I say \xe2\x80\x9cpatience and\r\nshuffle;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 and turning over on his side, he relapsed into his former\r\nsilence without uttering another word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np23c.jpg (331K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now there was heard a great outcry and lamentation, accompanied by\r\ndeep sighs and bitter sobs. I looked round, and through the crystal\r\nwall I saw passing through another chamber a procession of two lines of\r\nfair damsels all clad in mourning, and with white turbans of Turkish\r\nfashion on their heads. Behind, in the rear of these, there came a\r\nlady, for so from her dignity she seemed to be, also clad in black,\r\nwith a white veil so long and ample that it swept the ground. Her\r\nturban was twice as large as the largest of any of the others; her\r\neyebrows met, her nose was rather flat, her mouth was large but with\r\nruddy lips, and her teeth, of which at times she allowed a glimpse,\r\nwere seen to be sparse and ill-set, though as white as peeled almonds.\r\nShe carried in her hands a fine cloth, and in it, as well as I could\r\nmake out, a heart that had been mummied, so parched and dried was it.\r\nMontesinos told me that all those forming the procession were the\r\nattendants of Durandarte and Belerma, who were enchanted there with\r\ntheir master and mistress, and that the last, she who carried the heart\r\nin the cloth, was the lady Belerma, who, with her damsels, four days in\r\nthe week went in procession singing, or rather weeping, dirges over the\r\nbody and miserable heart of his cousin; and that if she appeared to me\r\nsomewhat ill-favoured or not so beautiful as fame reported her, it was\r\nbecause of the bad nights and worse days that she passed in that\r\nenchantment, as I could see by the great dark circles round her eyes,\r\nand her sickly complexion; \xe2\x80\x98her sallowness, and the rings round her\r\neyes,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98are not caused by the periodical ailment usual with\r\nwomen, for it is many months and even years since she has had any, but\r\nby the grief her own heart suffers because of that which she holds in\r\nher hand perpetually, and which recalls and brings back to her memory\r\nthe sad fate of her lost lover; were it not for this, hardly would the\r\ngreat Dulcinea del Toboso, so celebrated in all these parts, and even\r\nin the world, come up to her for beauty, grace, and gaiety.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Hold hard!\xe2\x80\x99 said I at this, \xe2\x80\x98tell your story as you ought, Se\xc3\xb1or Don\r\nMontesinos, for you know very well that all comparisons are odious, and\r\nthere is no occasion to compare one person with another; the peerless\r\nDulcinea del Toboso is what she is, and the lady Do\xc3\xb1a Belerma is what\r\n_she_ is and has been, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\xe2\x80\x99 To which he made answer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Forgive me, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote; I own I was wrong and spoke unadvisedly\r\nin saying that the lady Dulcinea could scarcely come up to the lady\r\nBelerma; for it were enough for me to have learned, by what means I\r\nknow not, that you are her knight, to make me bite my tongue out before\r\nI compared her to anything save heaven itself.\xe2\x80\x99 After this apology\r\nwhich the great Montesinos made me, my heart recovered itself from the\r\nshock I had received in hearing my lady compared with Belerma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill I wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your worship did not get upon the\r\nold fellow and bruise every bone of him with kicks, and pluck his beard\r\nuntil you didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave a hair in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Sancho, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cit would not have been\r\nright in me to do that, for we are all bound to pay respect to the\r\naged, even though they be not knights, but especially to those who are,\r\nand who are enchanted; I only know I gave him as good as he brought in\r\nthe many other questions and answers we exchanged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot understand, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the cousin here,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow it is that your worship, in such a short space of time as you have\r\nbeen below there, could have seen so many things, and said and answered\r\nso much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long is it since I went down?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle better than an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat cannot be,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause night overtook me\r\nwhile I was there, and day came, and it was night again and day again\r\nthree times; so that, by my reckoning, I have been three days in those\r\nremote regions beyond our ken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy master must be right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor as everything that has\r\nhappened to him is by enchantment, maybe what seems to us an hour would\r\nseem three days and nights there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did your worship eat anything all that time, se\xc3\xb1or?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never touched a morsel,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cnor did I feel\r\nhunger, or think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do the enchanted eat?\xe2\x80\x9d said the cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey neither eat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cnor are they subject to the\r\ngreater excrements, though it is thought that their nails, beards, and\r\nhair grow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do the enchanted sleep, now, se\xc3\xb1or?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cat least, during those three\r\ndays I was with them not one of them closed an eye, nor did I either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe proverb, \xe2\x80\x98Tell me what company thou keepest and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell thee\r\nwhat thou art,\xe2\x80\x99 is to the point here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship keeps\r\ncompany with enchanted people that are always fasting and watching;\r\nwhat wonder is it, then, that you neither eat nor sleep while you are\r\nwith them? But forgive me, se\xc3\xb1or, if I say that of all this you have\r\ntold us now, may God take me\xe2\x80\x94I was just going to say the devil\xe2\x80\x94if I\r\nbelieve a single particle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cousin, \xe2\x80\x9chas Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, then, been lying? Why,\r\neven if he wished it he has not had time to imagine and put together\r\nsuch a host of lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe my master lies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf not, what dost thou believe?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this Merlin, or those enchanters who\r\nenchanted the whole crew your worship says you saw and discoursed with\r\ndown there, stuffed your imagination or your mind with all this\r\nrigmarole you have been treating us to, and all that is still to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that might be, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is not so,\r\nfor everything that I have told you I saw with my own eyes, and touched\r\nwith my own hands. But what will you say when I tell you now how, among\r\nthe countless other marvellous things Montesinos showed me (of which at\r\nleisure and at the proper time I will give thee an account in the\r\ncourse of our journey, for they would not be all in place here), he\r\nshowed me three country girls who went skipping and capering like goats\r\nover the pleasant fields there, and the instant I beheld them I knew\r\none to be the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, and the other two those\r\nsame country girls that were with her and that we spoke to on the road\r\nfrom El Toboso! I asked Montesinos if he knew them, and he told me he\r\ndid not, but he thought they must be some enchanted ladies of\r\ndistinction, for it was only a few days before that they had made their\r\nappearance in those meadows; but I was not to be surprised at that,\r\nbecause there were a great many other ladies there of times past and\r\npresent, enchanted in various strange shapes, and among them he had\r\nrecognised Queen Guinevere and her dame Quinta\xc3\xb1ona, she who poured out\r\nthe wine for Lancelot when he came from Britain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Sancho Panza heard his master say this he was ready to take leave\r\nof his senses, or die with laughter; for, as he knew the real truth\r\nabout the pretended enchantment of Dulcinea, in which he himself had\r\nbeen the enchanter and concocter of all the evidence, he made up his\r\nmind at last that, beyond all doubt, his master was out of his wits and\r\nstark mad, so he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was an evil hour, a worse season, and\r\na sorrowful day, when your worship, dear master mine, went down to the\r\nother world, and an unlucky moment when you met with Se\xc3\xb1or Montesinos,\r\nwho has sent you back to us like this. You were well enough here above\r\nin your full senses, such as God had given you, delivering maxims and\r\ngiving advice at every turn, and not as you are now, talking the\r\ngreatest nonsense that can be imagined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I know thee, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI heed not thy words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I your worship\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether you beat me or kill me\r\nfor those I have spoken, and will speak if you don\xe2\x80\x99t correct and mend\r\nyour own. But tell me, while we are still at peace, how or by what did\r\nyou recognise the lady our mistress; and if you spoke to her, what did\r\nyou say, and what did she answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recognised her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cby her wearing the same garments\r\nshe wore when thou didst point her out to me. I spoke to her, but she\r\ndid not utter a word in reply; on the contrary, she turned her back on\r\nme and took to flight, at such a pace that crossbow bolt could not have\r\novertaken her. I wished to follow her, and would have done so had not\r\nMontesinos recommended me not to take the trouble as it would be\r\nuseless, particularly as the time was drawing near when it would be\r\nnecessary for me to quit the cavern. He told me, moreover, that in\r\ncourse of time he would let me know how he and Belerma, and Durandarte,\r\nand all who were there, were to be disenchanted. But of all I saw and\r\nobserved down there, what gave me most pain was, that while Montesinos\r\nwas speaking to me, one of the two companions of the hapless Dulcinea\r\napproached me on one without my having seen her coming, and with tears\r\nin her eyes said to me, in a low, agitated voice, \xe2\x80\x98My lady Dulcinea del\r\nToboso kisses your worship\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and entreats you to do her the\r\nfavour of letting her know how you are; and, being in great need, she\r\nalso entreats your worship as earnestly as she can to be so good as to\r\nlend her half a dozen reals, or as much as you may have about you, on\r\nthis new dimity petticoat that I have here; and she promises to repay\r\nthem very speedily.\xe2\x80\x99 I was amazed and taken aback by such a message,\r\nand turning to Se\xc3\xb1or Montesinos I asked him, \xe2\x80\x98Is it possible, Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nMontesinos, that persons of distinction under enchantment can be in\r\nneed?\xe2\x80\x99 To which he replied, \xe2\x80\x98Believe me, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, that which\r\nis called need is to be met with everywhere, and penetrates all\r\nquarters and reaches everyone, and does not spare even the enchanted;\r\nand as the lady Dulcinea del Toboso sends to beg those six reals, and\r\nthe pledge is to all appearance a good one, there is nothing for it but\r\nto give them to her, for no doubt she must be in some great strait.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwill take no pledge of her,\xe2\x80\x99 I replied, \xe2\x80\x98nor yet can I give her what\r\nshe asks, for all I have is four reals; which I gave (they were those\r\nwhich thou, Sancho, gavest me the other day to bestow in alms upon the\r\npoor I met along the road), and I said, \xe2\x80\x98Tell your mistress, my dear,\r\nthat I am grieved to the heart because of her distresses, and wish I\r\nwas a Fucar to remedy them, and that I would have her know that I\r\ncannot be, and ought not be, in health while deprived of the happiness\r\nof seeing her and enjoying her discreet conversation, and that I\r\nimplore her as earnestly as I can, to allow herself to be seen and\r\naddressed by this her captive servant and forlorn knight. Tell her,\r\ntoo, that when she least expects it she will hear it announced that I\r\nhave made an oath and vow after the fashion of that which the Marquis\r\nof Mantua made to avenge his nephew Baldwin, when he found him at the\r\npoint of death in the heart of the mountains, which was, not to eat\r\nbread off a tablecloth, and other trifling matters which he added,\r\nuntil he had avenged him; and I will make the same to take no rest, and\r\nto roam the seven regions of the earth more thoroughly than the Infante\r\nDon Pedro of Portugal ever roamed them, until I have disenchanted her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All that and more, you owe my lady,\xe2\x80\x99 the damsel\xe2\x80\x99s answer to me, and\r\ntaking the four reals, instead of making me a curtsey she cut a caper,\r\nspringing two full yards into the air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO blessed God!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sancho aloud at this, \xe2\x80\x9cis it possible that\r\nsuch things can be in the world, and that enchanters and enchantments\r\ncan have such power in it as to have changed my master\xe2\x80\x99s right senses\r\ninto a craze so full of absurdity! O se\xc3\xb1or, se\xc3\xb1or, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nconsider yourself, have a care for your honour, and give no credit to\r\nthis silly stuff that has left you scant and short of wits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou talkest in this way because thou lovest me, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand not being experienced in the things of the world,\r\neverything that has some difficulty about it seems to thee impossible;\r\nbut time will pass, as I said before, and I will tell thee some of the\r\nthings I saw down there which will make thee believe what I have\r\nrelated now, the truth of which admits of neither reply nor question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np23e.jpg (54K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nWHEREIN ARE RELATED A THOUSAND TRIFLING MATTERS, AS TRIVIAL AS THEY ARE\r\nNECESSARY TO THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF THIS GREAT HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np24a.jpg (137K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe who translated this great history from the original written by its\r\nfirst author, Cide Hamete Benengeli, says that on coming to the chapter\r\ngiving the adventures of the cave of Montesinos he found written on the\r\nmargin of it, in Hamete\xe2\x80\x99s own hand, these exact words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot convince or persuade myself that everything that is written\r\nin the preceding chapter could have precisely happened to the valiant\r\nDon Quixote; and for this reason, that all the adventures that have\r\noccurred up to the present have been possible and probable; but as for\r\nthis one of the cave, I see no way of accepting it as true, as it\r\npasses all reasonable bounds. For me to believe that Don Quixote could\r\nlie, he being the most truthful gentleman and the noblest knight of his\r\ntime, is impossible; he would not have told a lie though he were shot\r\nto death with arrows. On the other hand, I reflect that he related and\r\ntold the story with all the circumstances detailed, and that he could\r\nnot in so short a space have fabricated such a vast complication of\r\nabsurdities; if, then, this adventure seems apocryphal, it is no fault\r\nof mine; and so, without affirming its falsehood or its truth, I write\r\nit down. Decide for thyself in thy wisdom, reader; for I am not bound,\r\nnor is it in my power, to do more; though certain it is they say that\r\nat the time of his death he retracted, and said he had invented it,\r\nthinking it matched and tallied with the adventures he had read of in\r\nhis histories.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he goes on to say:\r\n\r\nThe cousin was amazed as well at Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s boldness as at the patience\r\nof his master, and concluded that the good temper the latter displayed\r\narose from the happiness he felt at having seen his lady Dulcinea, even\r\nenchanted as she was; because otherwise the words and language Sancho\r\nhad addressed to him deserved a thrashing; for indeed he seemed to him\r\nto have been rather impudent to his master, to whom he now observed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote of La Mancha, look upon the time I have spent in\r\ntravelling with your worship as very well employed, for I have gained\r\nfour things in the course of it; the first is that I have made your\r\nacquaintance, which I consider great good fortune; the second, that I\r\nhave learned what the cave of Montesinos contains, together with the\r\ntransformations of Guadiana and of the lakes of Ruidera; which will be\r\nof use to me for the Spanish Ovid that I have in hand; the third, to\r\nhave discovered the antiquity of cards, that they were in use at least\r\nin the time of Charlemagne, as may be inferred from the words you say\r\nDurandarte uttered when, at the end of that long spell while Montesinos\r\nwas talking to him, he woke up and said, \xe2\x80\x98Patience and shuffle.\xe2\x80\x99 This\r\nphrase and expression he could not have learned while he was enchanted,\r\nbut only before he had become so, in France, and in the time of the\r\naforesaid emperor Charlemagne. And this demonstration is just the thing\r\nfor me for that other book I am writing, the \xe2\x80\x98Supplement to Polydore\r\nVergil on the Invention of Antiquities;\xe2\x80\x99 for I believe he never thought\r\nof inserting that of cards in his book, as I mean to do in mine, and it\r\nwill be a matter of great importance, particularly when I can cite so\r\ngrave and veracious an authority as Se\xc3\xb1or Durandarte. And the fourth\r\nthing is, that I have ascertained the source of the river Guadiana,\r\nheretofore unknown to mankind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I should like to know, if by\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s favour they grant you a licence to print those books of\r\nyours\xe2\x80\x94which I doubt\xe2\x80\x94to whom do you mean to dedicate them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are lords and grandees in Spain to whom they can be dedicated,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot many,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cnot that they are unworthy of it, but\r\nbecause they do not care to accept books and incur the obligation of\r\nmaking the return that seems due to the author\xe2\x80\x99s labour and courtesy.\r\nOne prince I know who makes up for all the rest, and more\xe2\x80\x94how much\r\nmore, if I ventured to say, perhaps I should stir up envy in many a\r\nnoble breast; but let this stand over for some more convenient time,\r\nand let us go and look for some place to shelter ourselves in\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot far from this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cousin, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a hermitage, where\r\nthere lives a hermit, who they say was a soldier, and who has the\r\nreputation of being a good Christian and a very intelligent and\r\ncharitable man. Close to the hermitage he has a small house which he\r\nbuilt at his own cost, but though small it is large enough for the\r\nreception of guests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas this hermit any hens, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFew hermits are without them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor those we see\r\nnow-a-days are not like the hermits of the Egyptian deserts who were\r\nclad in palm-leaves, and lived on the roots of the earth. But do not\r\nthink that by praising these I am disparaging the others; all I mean to\r\nsay is that the penances of those of the present day do not come up to\r\nthe asceticism and austerity of former times; but it does not follow\r\nfrom this that they are not all worthy; at least I think them so; and\r\nat the worst the hypocrite who pretends to be good does less harm than\r\nthe open sinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point they saw approaching the spot where they stood a man on\r\nfoot, proceeding at a rapid pace, and beating a mule loaded with lances\r\nand halberds. When he came up to them, he saluted them and passed on\r\nwithout stopping. Don Quixote called to him, \xe2\x80\x9cStay, good fellow; you\r\nseem to be making more haste than suits that mule.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot stop, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the man; \xe2\x80\x9cfor the arms you see I carry\r\nhere are to be used to-morrow, so I must not delay; God be with you.\r\nBut if you want to know what I am carrying them for, I mean to lodge\r\nto-night at the inn that is beyond the hermitage, and if you be going\r\nthe same road you will find me there, and I will tell you some curious\r\nthings; once more God be with you;\xe2\x80\x9d and he urged on his mule at such a\r\npace that Don Quixote had no time to ask him what these curious things\r\nwere that he meant to tell them; and as he was somewhat inquisitive,\r\nand always tortured by his anxiety to learn something new, he decided\r\nto set out at once, and go and pass the night at the inn instead of\r\nstopping at the hermitage, where the cousin would have had them halt.\r\nAccordingly they mounted and all three took the direct road for the\r\ninn, which they reached a little before nightfall. On the road the\r\ncousin proposed they should go up to the hermitage to drink a sup. The\r\ninstant Sancho heard this he steered his Dapple towards it, and Don\r\nQuixote and the cousin did the same; but it seems Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s bad luck so\r\nordered it that the hermit was not at home, for so a sub-hermit they\r\nfound in the hermitage told them. They called for some of the best. She\r\nreplied that her master had none, but that if they liked cheap water\r\nshe would give it with great pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I found any in water,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are wells along the road\r\nwhere I could have had enough of it. Ah, Camacho\xe2\x80\x99s wedding, and\r\nplentiful house of Don Diego, how often do I miss you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeaving the hermitage, they pushed on towards the inn, and a little\r\nfarther they came upon a youth who was pacing along in front of them at\r\nno great speed, so that they overtook him. He carried a sword over his\r\nshoulder, and slung on it a budget or bundle of his clothes apparently,\r\nprobably his breeches or pantaloons, and his cloak and a shirt or two;\r\nfor he had on a short jacket of velvet with a gloss like satin on it in\r\nplaces, and had his shirt out; his stockings were of silk, and his\r\nshoes square-toed as they wear them at court. His age might have been\r\neighteen or nineteen; he was of a merry countenance, and to all\r\nappearance of an active habit, and he went along singing seguidillas to\r\nbeguile the wearisomeness of the road. As they came up with him he was\r\njust finishing one, which the cousin got by heart and they say ran\r\nthus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m off to the wars\r\nFor the want of pence,\r\nOh, had I but money\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d show more sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first to address him was Don Quixote, who said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou travel very\r\nairily, sir gallant; whither bound, may we ask, if it is your pleasure\r\nto tell us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which the youth replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThe heat and my poverty are the reason of\r\nmy travelling so airily, and it is to the wars that I am bound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow poverty?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthe heat one can understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the youth, \xe2\x80\x9cin this bundle I carry velvet pantaloons\r\nto match this jacket; if I wear them out on the road, I shall not be\r\nable to make a decent appearance in them in the city, and I have not\r\nthe wherewithal to buy others; and so for this reason, as well as to\r\nkeep myself cool, I am making my way in this fashion to overtake some\r\ncompanies of infantry that are not twelve leagues off, in which I shall\r\nenlist, and there will be no want of baggage trains to travel with\r\nafter that to the place of embarkation, which they say will be\r\nCarthagena; I would rather have the King for a master, and serve him in\r\nthe wars, than serve a court pauper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you get any bounty, now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had been in the service of some grandee of Spain or personage of\r\ndistinction,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the youth, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have been safe to get it;\r\nfor that is the advantage of serving good masters, that out of the\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 hall men come to be ancients or captains, or get a good\r\npension. But I, to my misfortune, always served place-hunters and\r\nadventurers, whose keep and wages were so miserable and scanty that\r\nhalf went in paying for the starching of one\xe2\x80\x99s collars; it would be a\r\nmiracle indeed if a page volunteer ever got anything like a reasonable\r\nbounty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd tell me, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cis it possible,\r\nmy friend, that all the time you served you never got any livery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey gave me two,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the page; \xe2\x80\x9cbut just as when one quits a\r\nreligious community before making profession, they strip him of the\r\ndress of the order and give him back his own clothes, so did my masters\r\nreturn me mine; for as soon as the business on which they came to court\r\nwas finished, they went home and took back the liveries they had given\r\nmerely for show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat spilorceria!\xe2\x80\x94as an Italian would say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\r\nall that, consider yourself happy in having left court with as worthy\r\nan object as you have, for there is nothing on earth more honourable or\r\nprofitable than serving, first of all God, and then one\xe2\x80\x99s king and\r\nnatural lord, particularly in the profession of arms, by which, if not\r\nmore wealth, at least more honour is to be won than by letters, as I\r\nhave said many a time; for though letters may have founded more great\r\nhouses than arms, still those founded by arms have I know not what\r\nsuperiority over those founded by letters, and a certain splendour\r\nbelonging to them that distinguishes them above all. And bear in mind\r\nwhat I am now about to say to you, for it will be of great use and\r\ncomfort to you in time of trouble; it is, not to let your mind dwell on\r\nthe adverse chances that may befall you; for the worst of all is death,\r\nand if it be a good death, the best of all is to die. They asked Julius\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar, the valiant Roman emperor, what was the best death. He answered,\r\nthat which is unexpected, which comes suddenly and unforeseen; and\r\nthough he answered like a pagan, and one without the knowledge of the\r\ntrue God, yet, as far as sparing our feelings is concerned, he was\r\nright; for suppose you are killed in the first engagement or skirmish,\r\nwhether by a cannon ball or blown up by mine, what matters it? It is\r\nonly dying, and all is over; and according to Terence, a soldier shows\r\nbetter dead in battle, than alive and safe in flight; and the good\r\nsoldier wins fame in proportion as he is obedient to his captains and\r\nthose in command over him. And remember, my son, that it is better for\r\nthe soldier to smell of gunpowder than of civet, and that if old age\r\nshould come upon you in this honourable calling, though you may be\r\ncovered with wounds and crippled and lame, it will not come upon you\r\nwithout honour, and that such as poverty cannot lessen; especially now\r\nthat provisions are being made for supporting and relieving old and\r\ndisabled soldiers; for it is not right to deal with them after the\r\nfashion of those who set free and get rid of their black slaves when\r\nthey are old and useless, and, turning them out of their houses under\r\nthe pretence of making them free, make them slaves to hunger, from\r\nwhich they cannot expect to be released except by death. But for the\r\npresent I won\xe2\x80\x99t say more than get ye up behind me on my horse as far as\r\nthe inn, and sup with me there, and to-morrow you shall pursue your\r\njourney, and God give you as good speed as your intentions deserve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe page did not accept the invitation to mount, though he did that to\r\nsupper at the inn; and here they say Sancho said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cGod be\r\nwith you for a master; is it possible that a man who can say things so\r\nmany and so good as he has said just now, can say that he saw the\r\nimpossible absurdities he reports about the cave of Montesinos? Well,\r\nwell, we shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now, just as night was falling, they reached the inn, and it was\r\nnot without satisfaction that Sancho perceived his master took it for a\r\nreal inn, and not for a castle as usual. The instant they entered Don\r\nQuixote asked the landlord after the man with the lances and halberds,\r\nand was told that he was in the stable seeing to his mule; which was\r\nwhat Sancho and the cousin proceeded to do for their beasts, giving the\r\nbest manger and the best place in the stable to Rocinante.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np24e.jpg (61K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nWHEREIN IS SET DOWN THE BRAYING ADVENTURE, AND THE DROLL ONE OF THE\r\nPUPPET-SHOWMAN, TOGETHER WITH THE MEMORABLE DIVINATIONS OF THE DIVINING\r\nAPE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np25a.jpg (154K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s bread would not bake, as the common saying is, until he\r\nhad heard and learned the curious things promised by the man who\r\ncarried the arms. He went to seek him where the innkeeper said he was\r\nand having found him, bade him say now at any rate what he had to say\r\nin answer to the question he had asked him on the road. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tale of my\r\nwonders must be taken more leisurely and not standing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet me finish foddering my beast, good sir; and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\r\nthings that will astonish you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t wait for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you in everything,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand so he did, sifting the barley for him and cleaning out the manger;\r\na degree of humility which made the other feel bound to tell him with a\r\ngood grace what he had asked; so seating himself on a bench, with Don\r\nQuixote beside him, and the cousin, the page, Sancho Panza, and the\r\nlandlord, for a senate and an audience, he began his story in this way:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must know that in a village four leagues and a half from this inn,\r\nit so happened that one of the regidors, by the tricks and roguery of a\r\nservant girl of his (it\xe2\x80\x99s too long a tale to tell), lost an ass; and\r\nthough he did all he possibly could to find it, it was all to no\r\npurpose. A fortnight might have gone by, so the story goes, since the\r\nass had been missing, when, as the regidor who had lost it was standing\r\nin the plaza, another regidor of the same town said to him, \xe2\x80\x98Pay me for\r\ngood news, gossip; your ass has turned up.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That I will, and well,\r\ngossip,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other; \xe2\x80\x98but tell us, where has he turned up?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98In the\r\nforest,\xe2\x80\x99 said the finder; \xe2\x80\x98I saw him this morning without pack-saddle\r\nor harness of any sort, and so lean that it went to one\xe2\x80\x99s heart to see\r\nhim. I tried to drive him before me and bring him to you, but he is\r\nalready so wild and shy that when I went near him he made off into the\r\nthickest part of the forest. If you have a mind that we two should go\r\nback and look for him, let me put up this she-ass at my house and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe back at once.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You will be doing me a great kindness,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nowner of the ass, \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to pay it back in the same coin.\xe2\x80\x99 It is\r\nwith all these circumstances, and in the very same way I am telling it\r\nnow, that those who know all about the matter tell the story. Well\r\nthen, the two regidors set off on foot, arm in arm, for the forest, and\r\ncoming to the place where they hoped to find the ass they could not\r\nfind him, nor was he to be seen anywhere about, search as they might.\r\nSeeing, then, that there was no sign of him, the regidor who had seen\r\nhim said to the other, \xe2\x80\x98Look here, gossip; a plan has occurred to me,\r\nby which, beyond a doubt, we shall manage to discover the animal, even\r\nif he is stowed away in the bowels of the earth, not to say the forest.\r\nHere it is. I can bray to perfection, and if you can ever so little,\r\nthe thing\xe2\x80\x99s as good as done.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ever so little did you say, gossip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the other; \xe2\x80\x98by God, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not give in to anybody, not even to the\r\nasses themselves.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll soon see,\xe2\x80\x99 said the second regidor, \xe2\x80\x98for my\r\nplan is that you should go one side of the forest, and I the other, so\r\nas to go all round about it; and every now and then you will bray and I\r\nwill bray; and it cannot be but that the ass will hear us, and answer\r\nus if he is in the forest.\xe2\x80\x99 To which the owner of the ass replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent plan, I declare, gossip, and worthy of your great\r\ngenius;\xe2\x80\x99 and the two separating as agreed, it so fell out that they\r\nbrayed almost at the same moment, and each, deceived by the braying of\r\nthe other, ran to look, fancying the ass had turned up at last. When\r\nthey came in sight of one another, said the loser, \xe2\x80\x98Is it possible,\r\ngossip, that it was not my ass that brayed?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No, it was I,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nother. \xe2\x80\x98Well then, I can tell you, gossip,\xe2\x80\x99 said the ass\xe2\x80\x99s owner, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nbetween you and an ass there is not an atom of difference as far as\r\nbraying goes, for I never in all my life saw or heard anything more\r\nnatural.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Those praises and compliments belong to you more justly than\r\nto me, gossip,\xe2\x80\x99 said the inventor of the plan; \xe2\x80\x98for, by the God that\r\nmade me, you might give a couple of brays odds to the best and most\r\nfinished brayer in the world; the tone you have got is deep, your voice\r\nis well kept up as to time and pitch, and your finishing notes come\r\nthick and fast; in fact, I own myself beaten, and yield the palm to\r\nyou, and give in to you in this rare accomplishment.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well then,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe owner, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll set a higher value on myself for the future, and\r\nconsider that I know something, as I have an excellence of some sort;\r\nfor though I always thought I brayed well, I never supposed I came up\r\nto the pitch of perfection you say.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And I say too,\xe2\x80\x99 said the second,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that there are rare gifts going to loss in the world, and that they\r\nare ill bestowed upon those who don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to make use of them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ours,\xe2\x80\x99 said the owner of the ass, \xe2\x80\x98unless it is in cases like this we\r\nhave now in hand, cannot be of any service to us, and even in this God\r\ngrant they may be of some use.\xe2\x80\x99 So saying they separated, and took to\r\ntheir braying once more, but every instant they were deceiving one\r\nanother, and coming to meet one another again, until they arranged by\r\nway of countersign, so as to know that it was they and not the ass, to\r\ngive two brays, one after the other. In this way, doubling the brays at\r\nevery step, they made the complete circuit of the forest, but the lost\r\nass never gave them an answer or even the sign of one. How could the\r\npoor ill-starred brute have answered, when, in the thickest part of the\r\nforest, they found him devoured by wolves? As soon as he saw him his\r\nowner said, \xe2\x80\x98I was wondering he did not answer, for if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dead\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d have brayed when he heard us, or he\xe2\x80\x99d have been no ass; but for\r\nthe sake of having heard you bray to such perfection, gossip, I count\r\nthe trouble I have taken to look for him well bestowed, even though I\r\nhave found him dead.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s in a good hand, gossip,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98if the abbot sings well, the acolyte is not much behind him.\xe2\x80\x99 So they\r\nreturned disconsolate and hoarse to their village, where they told\r\ntheir friends, neighbours, and acquaintances what had befallen them in\r\ntheir search for the ass, each crying up the other\xe2\x80\x99s perfection in\r\nbraying. The whole story came to be known and spread abroad through the\r\nvillages of the neighbourhood; and the devil, who never sleeps, with\r\nhis love for sowing dissensions and scattering discord everywhere,\r\nblowing mischief about and making quarrels out of nothing, contrived to\r\nmake the people of the other towns fall to braying whenever they saw\r\nanyone from our village, as if to throw the braying of our regidors in\r\nour teeth. Then the boys took to it, which was the same thing for it as\r\ngetting into the hands and mouths of all the devils of hell; and\r\nbraying spread from one town to another in such a way that the men of\r\nthe braying town are as easy to be known as blacks are to be known from\r\nwhites, and the unlucky joke has gone so far that several times the\r\nscoffed have come out in arms and in a body to do battle with the\r\nscoffers, and neither king nor rook, fear nor shame, can mend matters.\r\nTo-morrow or the day after, I believe, the men of my town, that is, of\r\nthe braying town, are going to take the field against another village\r\ntwo leagues away from ours, one of those that persecute us most; and\r\nthat we may turn out well prepared I have bought these lances and\r\nhalberds you have seen. These are the curious things I told you I had\r\nto tell, and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t think them so, I have got no others;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nwith this the worthy fellow brought his story to a close.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment there came in at the gate of the inn a man entirely\r\nclad in chamois leather, hose, breeches, and doublet, who said in a\r\nloud voice, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or host, have you room? Here\xe2\x80\x99s the divining ape and the\r\nshow of the Release of Melisendra just coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOds body!\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s Master Pedro! We\xe2\x80\x99re in for a\r\ngrand night!\xe2\x80\x9d I forgot to mention that the said Master Pedro had his\r\nleft eye and nearly half his cheek covered with a patch of green\r\ntaffety, showing that something ailed all that side. \xe2\x80\x9cYour worship is\r\nwelcome, Master Pedro,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the landlord; \xe2\x80\x9cbut where are the ape\r\nand the show, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t see them?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThey are close at hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said he\r\nin the chamois leather, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I came on first to know if there was any\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d make the Duke of Alva himself clear out to make room for\r\nMaster Pedro,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord; \xe2\x80\x9cbring in the ape and the show;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s company in the inn to-night that will pay to see that and the\r\ncleverness of the ape.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSo be it by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man with the\r\npatch; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll lower the price, and be well satisfied if I only pay my\r\nexpenses; and now I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back and hurry on the cart with the ape and\r\nthe show;\xe2\x80\x9d and with this he went out of the inn.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote at once asked the landlord what this Master Pedro was, and\r\nwhat was the show and what was the ape he had with him; which the\r\nlandlord replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a famous puppet-showman, who for some time\r\npast has been going about this Mancha de Aragon, exhibiting a show of\r\nthe release of Melisendra by the famous Don Gaiferos, one of the best\r\nand best-represented stories that have been seen in this part of the\r\nkingdom for many a year; he has also with him an ape with the most\r\nextraordinary gift ever seen in an ape or imagined in a human being;\r\nfor if you ask him anything, he listens attentively to the question,\r\nand then jumps on his master\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and pressing close to his ear\r\ntells him the answer which Master Pedro then delivers. He says a great\r\ndeal more about things past than about things to come; and though he\r\ndoes not always hit the truth in every case, most times he is not far\r\nwrong, so that he makes us fancy he has got the devil in him. He gets\r\ntwo reals for every question if the ape answers; I mean if his master\r\nanswers for him after he has whispered into his ear; and so it is\r\nbelieved that this same Master Pedro is very rich. He is a \xe2\x80\x98gallant\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99 as they say in Italy, and good company, and leads the finest life\r\nin the world; talks more than six, drinks more than a dozen, and all by\r\nhis tongue, and his ape, and his show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster Pedro now came back, and in a cart followed the show and the\r\nape\xe2\x80\x94a big one, without a tail and with buttocks as bare as felt, but\r\nnot vicious-looking. As soon as Don Quixote saw him, he asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cCan\r\nyou tell me, sir fortune-teller, what fish do we catch, and how will it\r\nbe with us? See, here are my two reals,\xe2\x80\x9d and he bade Sancho give them\r\nto Master Pedro; but he answered for the ape and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, this\r\nanimal does not give any answer or information touching things that are\r\nto come; of things past he knows something, and more or less of things\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not give a farthing to be told what\xe2\x80\x99s past\r\nwith me, for who knows that better than I do myself? And to pay for\r\nbeing told what I know would be mighty foolish. But as you know things\r\npresent, here are my two reals, and tell me, most excellent sir ape,\r\nwhat is my wife Teresa Panza doing now, and what is she diverting\r\nherself with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster Pedro refused to take the money, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not receive\r\npayment in advance or until the service has been first rendered;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthen with his right hand he gave a couple of slaps on his left\r\nshoulder, and with one spring the ape perched himself upon it, and\r\nputting his mouth to his master\xe2\x80\x99s ear began chattering his teeth\r\nrapidly; and having kept this up as long as one would be saying a\r\ncredo, with another spring he brought himself to the ground, and the\r\nsame instant Master Pedro ran in great haste and fell upon his knees\r\nbefore Don Quixote, and embracing his legs exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThese legs do I\r\nembrace as I would embrace the two pillars of Hercules, O illustrious\r\nreviver of knight-errantry, so long consigned to oblivion! O never yet\r\nduly extolled knight, Don Quixote of La Mancha, courage of the\r\nfaint-hearted, prop of the tottering, arm of the fallen, staff and\r\ncounsel of all who are unfortunate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np25b.jpg (373K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was thunderstruck, Sancho astounded, the cousin staggered,\r\nthe page astonished, the man from the braying town agape, the landlord\r\nin perplexity, and, in short, everyone amazed at the words of the\r\npuppet-showman, who went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou, worthy Sancho Panza, the\r\nbest squire and squire to the best knight in the world! Be of good\r\ncheer, for thy good wife Teresa is well, and she is at this moment\r\nhackling a pound of flax; and more by token she has at her left hand a\r\njug with a broken spout that holds a good drop of wine, with which she\r\nsolaces herself at her work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I can well believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a lucky one, and if it\r\nwas not for her jealousy I would not change her for the giantess\r\nAndandona, who by my master\xe2\x80\x99s account was a very clever and worthy\r\nwoman; my Teresa is one of those that won\xe2\x80\x99t let themselves want for\r\nanything, though their heirs may have to pay for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I declare,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9che who reads much and travels much\r\nsees and knows a great deal. I say so because what amount of persuasion\r\ncould have persuaded me that there are apes in the world that can\r\ndivine as I have seen now with my own eyes? For I am that very Don\r\nQuixote of La Mancha this worthy animal refers to, though he has gone\r\nrather too far in my praise; but whatever I may be, I thank heaven that\r\nit has endowed me with a tender and compassionate heart, always\r\ndisposed to do good to all and harm to none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had money,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page, \xe2\x80\x9cI would ask se\xc3\xb1or ape what will\r\nhappen to me in the peregrination I am making.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Master Pedro, who had by this time risen from Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeet, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI have already said that this little beast gives no\r\nanswer as to the future; but if he did, not having money would be of no\r\nconsequence, for to oblige Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, here present, I would\r\ngive up all the profits in the world. And now, because I have promised\r\nit, and to afford him pleasure, I will set up my show and offer\r\nentertainment to all who are in the inn, without any charge whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAs soon as he heard this, the landlord, delighted beyond measure,\r\npointed out a place where the show might be fixed, which was done at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was not very well satisfied with the divinations of the\r\nape, as he did not think it proper that an ape should divine anything,\r\neither past or future; so while Master Pedro was arranging the show, he\r\nretired with Sancho into a corner of the stable, where, without being\r\noverheard by anyone, he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Sancho, I have been\r\nseriously thinking over this ape\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary gift, and have come to\r\nthe conclusion that beyond doubt this Master Pedro, his master, has a\r\npact, tacit or express, with the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the packet is express from the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cit must be a\r\nvery dirty packet no doubt; but what good can it do Master Pedro to\r\nhave such packets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou dost not understand me, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cI only mean\r\nhe must have made some compact with the devil to infuse this power into\r\nthe ape, that he may get his living, and after he has grown rich he\r\nwill give him his soul, which is what the enemy of mankind wants; this\r\nI am led to believe by observing that the ape only answers about things\r\npast or present, and the devil\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge extends no further; for the\r\nfuture he knows only by guesswork, and that not always; for it is\r\nreserved for God alone to know the times and the seasons, and for him\r\nthere is neither past nor future; all is present. This being as it is,\r\nit is clear that this ape speaks by the spirit of the devil; and I am\r\nastonished they have not denounced him to the Holy Office, and put him\r\nto the question, and forced it out of him by whose virtue it is that he\r\ndivines; because it is certain this ape is not an astrologer; neither\r\nhis master nor he sets up, or knows how to set up, those figures they\r\ncall judiciary, which are now so common in Spain that there is not a\r\njade, or page, or old cobbler, that will not undertake to set up a\r\nfigure as readily as pick up a knave of cards from the ground, bringing\r\nto nought the marvellous truth of the science by their lies and\r\nignorance. I know of a lady who asked one of these figure schemers\r\nwhether her little lap-dog would be in pup and would breed, and how\r\nmany and of what colour the little pups would be. To which se\xc3\xb1or\r\nastrologer, after having set up his figure, made answer that the bitch\r\nwould be in pup, and would drop three pups, one green, another bright\r\nred, and the third parti-coloured, provided she conceived between\r\neleven and twelve either of the day or night, and on a Monday or\r\nSaturday; but as things turned out, two days after this the bitch died\r\nof a surfeit, and se\xc3\xb1or planet-ruler had the credit all over the place\r\nof being a most profound astrologer, as most of these planet-rulers\r\nhave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI would be glad if your worship would make\r\nMaster Pedro ask his ape whether what happened your worship in the cave\r\nof Montesinos is true; for, begging your worship\xe2\x80\x99s pardon, I, for my\r\npart, take it to have been all flam and lies, or at any rate something\r\nyou dreamt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9chowever, I will do what you\r\nsuggest; though I have my own scruples about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point Master Pedro came up in quest of Don Quixote, to tell him\r\nthe show was now ready and to come and see it, for it was worth seeing.\r\nDon Quixote explained his wish, and begged him to ask his ape at once\r\nto tell him whether certain things which had happened to him in the\r\ncave of Montesinos were dreams or realities, for to him they appeared\r\nto partake of both. Upon this Master Pedro, without answering, went\r\nback to fetch the ape, and, having placed it in front of Don Quixote\r\nand Sancho, said: \xe2\x80\x9cSee here, se\xc3\xb1or ape, this gentleman wishes to know\r\nwhether certain things which happened to him in the cave called the\r\ncave of Montesinos were false or true.\xe2\x80\x9d On his making the usual sign\r\nthe ape mounted on his left shoulder and seemed to whisper in his ear,\r\nand Master Pedro said at once, \xe2\x80\x9cThe ape says that the things you saw or\r\nthat happened to you in that cave are, part of them false, part true;\r\nand that he only knows this and no more as regards this question; but\r\nif your worship wishes to know more, on Friday next he will answer all\r\nthat may be asked him, for his virtue is at present exhausted, and will\r\nnot return to him till Friday, as he has said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I not say, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I could not bring myself to\r\nbelieve that all your worship said about the adventures in the cave was\r\ntrue, or even the half of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe course of events will tell, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9ctime,\r\nthat discloses all things, leaves nothing that it does not drag into\r\nthe light of day, though it be buried in the bosom of the earth. But\r\nenough of that for the present; let us go and see Master Pedro\xe2\x80\x99s show,\r\nfor I am sure there must be something novel in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething!\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Pedro; \xe2\x80\x9cthis show of mine has sixty thousand\r\nnovel things in it; let me tell you, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, it is one of\r\nthe best-worth-seeing things in the world this day; but _operibus\r\ncredite et non verbis_, and now let\xe2\x80\x99s get to work, for it is growing\r\nlate, and we have a great deal to do and to say and show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote and Sancho obeyed him and went to where the show was\r\nalready put up and uncovered, set all around with lighted wax tapers\r\nwhich made it look splendid and bright. When they came to it Master\r\nPedro ensconced himself inside it, for it was he who had to work the\r\npuppets, and a boy, a servant of his, posted himself outside to act as\r\nshowman and explain the mysteries of the exhibition, having a wand in\r\nhis hand to point to the figures as they came out. And so, all who were\r\nin the inn being arranged in front of the show, some of them standing,\r\nand Don Quixote, Sancho, the page, and cousin, accommodated with the\r\nbest places, the interpreter began to say what he will hear or see who\r\nreads or hears the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np25e.jpg (28K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nWHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE DROLL ADVENTURE OF THE PUPPET-SHOWMAN,\r\nTOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS IN TRUTH RIGHT GOOD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np26a.jpg (157K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll were silent, Tyrians and Trojans; I mean all who were watching the\r\nshow were hanging on the lips of the interpreter of its wonders, when\r\ndrums and trumpets were heard to sound inside it and cannon to go off.\r\nThe noise was soon over, and then the boy lifted up his voice and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis true story which is here represented to your worships is taken\r\nword for word from the French chronicles and from the Spanish ballads\r\nthat are in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and in the mouth of the boys about the\r\nstreets. Its subject is the release by Se\xc3\xb1or Don Gaiferos of his wife\r\nMelisendra, when a captive in Spain at the hands of the Moors in the\r\ncity of Sansue\xc3\xb1a, for so they called then what is now called Saragossa;\r\nand there you may see how Don Gaiferos is playing at the tables, just\r\nas they sing it-\r\n\r\nAt tables playing Don Gaiferos sits,\r\nFor Melisendra is forgotten now.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that personage who appears there with a crown on his head and a\r\nsceptre in his hand is the Emperor Charlemagne, the supposed father of\r\nMelisendra, who, angered to see his son-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s inaction and\r\nunconcern, comes in to chide him; and observe with what vehemence and\r\nenergy he chides him, so that you would fancy he was going to give him\r\nhalf a dozen raps with his sceptre; and indeed there are authors who\r\nsay he did give them, and sound ones too; and after having said a great\r\ndeal to him about imperilling his honour by not effecting the release\r\nof his wife, he said, so the tale runs,\r\n\r\nEnough I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, see to it now.\r\n\r\n\r\nObserve, too, how the emperor turns away, and leaves Don Gaiferos\r\nfuming; and you see now how in a burst of anger, he flings the table\r\nand the board far from him and calls in haste for his armour, and asks\r\nhis cousin Don Roland for the loan of his sword, Durindana, and how Don\r\nRoland refuses to lend it, offering him his company in the difficult\r\nenterprise he is undertaking; but he, in his valour and anger, will not\r\naccept it, and says that he alone will suffice to rescue his wife, even\r\nthough she were imprisoned deep in the centre of the earth, and with\r\nthis he retires to arm himself and set out on his journey at once. Now\r\nlet your worships turn your eyes to that tower that appears there,\r\nwhich is supposed to be one of the towers of the alcazar of Saragossa,\r\nnow called the Aljaferia; that lady who appears on that balcony dressed\r\nin Moorish fashion is the peerless Melisendra, for many a time she used\r\nto gaze from thence upon the road to France, and seek consolation in\r\nher captivity by thinking of Paris and her husband. Observe, too, a new\r\nincident which now occurs, such as, perhaps, never was seen. Do you not\r\nsee that Moor, who silently and stealthily, with his finger on his lip,\r\napproaches Melisendra from behind? Observe now how he prints a kiss\r\nupon her lips, and what a hurry she is in to spit, and wipe them with\r\nthe white sleeve of her smock, and how she bewails herself, and tears\r\nher fair hair as though it were to blame for the wrong. Observe, too,\r\nthat the stately Moor who is in that corridor is King Marsilio of\r\nSansue\xc3\xb1a, who, having seen the Moor\xe2\x80\x99s insolence, at once orders him\r\n(though his kinsman and a great favourite of his) to be seized and\r\ngiven two hundred lashes, while carried through the streets of the city\r\naccording to custom, with criers going before him and officers of\r\njustice behind; and here you see them come out to execute the sentence,\r\nalthough the offence has been scarcely committed; for among the Moors\r\nthere are no indictments nor remands as with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Don Quixote called out, \xe2\x80\x9cChild, child, go straight on with your\r\nstory, and don\xe2\x80\x99t run into curves and slants, for to establish a fact\r\nclearly there is need of a great deal of proof and confirmation;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nsaid Master Pedro from within, \xe2\x80\x9cBoy, stick to your text and do as the\r\ngentleman bids you; it\xe2\x80\x99s the best plan; keep to your plain song, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t attempt harmonies, for they are apt to break down from being over\r\nfine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, and he went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThis figure that you\r\nsee here on horseback, covered with a Gascon cloak, is Don Gaiferos\r\nhimself, whom his wife, now avenged of the insult of the amorous Moor,\r\nand taking her stand on the balcony of the tower with a calmer and more\r\ntranquil countenance, has perceived without recognising him; and she\r\naddresses her husband, supposing him to be some traveller, and holds\r\nwith him all that conversation and colloquy in the ballad that runs\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nIf you, sir knight, to France are bound,\r\nOh! for Gaiferos ask\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich I do not repeat here because prolixity begets disgust; suffice it\r\nto observe how Don Gaiferos discovers himself, and that by her joyful\r\ngestures Melisendra shows us she has recognised him; and what is more,\r\nwe now see she lowers herself from the balcony to place herself on the\r\nhaunches of her good husband\xe2\x80\x99s horse. But ah! unhappy lady, the edge of\r\nher petticoat has caught on one of the bars of the balcony and she is\r\nleft hanging in the air, unable to reach the ground. But you see how\r\ncompassionate heaven sends aid in our sorest need; Don Gaiferos\r\nadvances, and without minding whether the rich petticoat is torn or\r\nnot, he seizes her and by force brings her to the ground, and then with\r\none jerk places her on the haunches of his horse, astraddle like a man,\r\nand bids her hold on tight and clasp her arms round his neck, crossing\r\nthem on his breast so as not to fall, for the lady Melisendra was not\r\nused to that style of riding. You see, too, how the neighing of the\r\nhorse shows his satisfaction with the gallant and beautiful burden he\r\nbears in his lord and lady. You see how they wheel round and quit the\r\ncity, and in joy and gladness take the road to Paris. Go in peace, O\r\npeerless pair of true lovers! May you reach your longed-for fatherland\r\nin safety, and may fortune interpose no impediment to your prosperous\r\njourney; may the eyes of your friends and kinsmen behold you enjoying\r\nin peace and tranquillity the remaining days of your life\xe2\x80\x94and that they\r\nmay be as many as those of Nestor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Master Pedro called out again and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSimplicity, boy! None of\r\nyour high flights; all affectation is bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe interpreter made no answer, but went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no want\r\nof idle eyes, that see everything, to see Melisendra come down and\r\nmount, and word was brought to King Marsilio, who at once gave orders\r\nto sound the alarm; and see what a stir there is, and how the city is\r\ndrowned with the sound of the bells pealing in the towers of all the\r\nmosques.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote at this; \xe2\x80\x9con that point of the bells\r\nMaster Pedro is very inaccurate, for bells are not in use among the\r\nMoors; only kettledrums, and a kind of small trumpet somewhat like our\r\nclarion; to ring bells this way in Sansue\xc3\xb1a is unquestionably a great\r\nabsurdity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Master Pedro stopped ringing, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\ninto trifles, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, or want to have things up to a pitch\r\nof perfection that is out of reach. Are there not almost every day a\r\nthousand comedies represented all round us full of thousands of\r\ninaccuracies and absurdities, and, for all that, they have a successful\r\nrun, and are listened to not only with applause, but with admiration\r\nand all the rest of it? Go on, boy, and don\xe2\x80\x99t mind; for so long as I\r\nfill my pouch, no matter if I show as many inaccuracies as there are\r\nmotes in a sunbeam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; and the boy went on: \xe2\x80\x9cSee what a\r\nnumerous and glittering crowd of horsemen issues from the city in\r\npursuit of the two faithful lovers, what a blowing of trumpets there\r\nis, what sounding of horns, what beating of drums and tabors; I fear me\r\nthey will overtake them and bring them back tied to the tail of their\r\nown horse, which would be a dreadful sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np26b.jpg (342K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote, however, seeing such a swarm of Moors and hearing such a\r\ndin, thought it would be right to aid the fugitives, and standing up he\r\nexclaimed in a loud voice, \xe2\x80\x9cNever, while I live, will I permit foul\r\nplay to be practised in my presence on such a famous knight and\r\nfearless lover as Don Gaiferos. Halt! ill-born rabble, follow him not\r\nnor pursue him, or ye will have to reckon with me in battle!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nsuiting the action to the word, he drew his sword, and with one bound\r\nplaced himself close to the show, and with unexampled rapidity and fury\r\nbegan to shower down blows on the puppet troop of Moors, knocking over\r\nsome, decapitating others, maiming this one and demolishing that; and\r\namong many more he delivered one down stroke which, if Master Pedro had\r\nnot ducked, made himself small, and got out of the way, would have\r\nsliced off his head as easily as if it had been made of almond-paste.\r\nMaster Pedro kept shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cHold hard! Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote! can\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee they\xe2\x80\x99re not real Moors you\xe2\x80\x99re knocking down and killing and\r\ndestroying, but only little pasteboard figures! Look\xe2\x80\x94sinner that I\r\nam!\xe2\x80\x94how you\xe2\x80\x99re wrecking and ruining all that I\xe2\x80\x99m worth!\xe2\x80\x9d But in spite\r\nof this, Don Quixote did not leave off discharging a continuous rain of\r\ncuts, slashes, downstrokes, and backstrokes, and at length, in less\r\nthan the space of two credos, he brought the whole show to the ground,\r\nwith all its fittings and figures shivered and knocked to pieces, King\r\nMarsilio badly wounded, and the Emperor Charlemagne with his crown and\r\nhead split in two. The whole audience was thrown into confusion, the\r\nape fled to the roof of the inn, the cousin was frightened, and even\r\nSancho Panza himself was in mighty fear, for, as he swore after the\r\nstorm was over, he had never seen his master in such a furious passion.\r\n\r\nThe complete destruction of the show being thus accomplished, Don\r\nQuixote became a little calmer, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had here before me now\r\nall those who do not or will not believe how useful knights-errant are\r\nin the world; just think, if I had not been here present, what would\r\nhave become of the brave Don Gaiferos and the fair Melisendra! Depend\r\nupon it, by this time those dogs would have overtaken them and\r\ninflicted some outrage upon them. So, then, long live knight-errantry\r\nbeyond everything living on earth this day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it live, and welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Pedro at this in a feeble\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cand let me die, for I am so unfortunate that I can say with\r\nKing Don Rodrigo\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nYesterday was I lord of Spain\r\nTo-day I\xe2\x80\x99ve not a turret left\r\nThat I may call mine own.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot half an hour, nay, barely a minute ago, I saw myself lord of kings\r\nand emperors, with my stables filled with countless horses, and my\r\ntrunks and bags with gay dresses unnumbered; and now I find myself\r\nruined and laid low, destitute and a beggar, and above all without my\r\nape, for, by my faith, my teeth will have to sweat for it before I have\r\nhim caught; and all through the reckless fury of sir knight here, who,\r\nthey say, protects the fatherless, and rights wrongs, and does other\r\ncharitable deeds; but whose generous intentions have been found wanting\r\nin my case only, blessed and praised be the highest heavens! Verily,\r\nknight of the rueful figure he must be to have disfigured mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho Panza was touched by Master Pedro\xe2\x80\x99s words, and said to him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t weep and lament, Master Pedro; you break my heart; let me tell\r\nyou my master, Don Quixote, is so catholic and scrupulous a Christian\r\nthat, if he can make out that he has done you any wrong, he will own\r\nit, and be willing to pay for it and make it good, and something over\r\nand above.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly let Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote pay me for some part of the work he has\r\ndestroyed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Pedro, \xe2\x80\x9cand I would be content, and his worship\r\nwould ease his conscience, for he cannot be saved who keeps what is\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s against the owner\xe2\x80\x99s will, and makes no restitution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut at present I am not aware that I\r\nhave got anything of yours, Master Pedro.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Master Pedro; \xe2\x80\x9cand these relics lying here on the bare\r\nhard ground\xe2\x80\x94what scattered and shattered them but the invincible\r\nstrength of that mighty arm? And whose were the bodies they belonged to\r\nbut mine? And what did I get my living by but by them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow am I fully convinced,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cof what I had many a\r\ntime before believed; that the enchanters who persecute me do nothing\r\nmore than put figures like these before my eyes, and then change and\r\nturn them into what they please. In truth and earnest, I assure you\r\ngentlemen who now hear me, that to me everything that has taken place\r\nhere seemed to take place literally, that Melisendra was Melisendra,\r\nDon Gaiferos Don Gaiferos, Marsilio Marsilio, and Charlemagne\r\nCharlemagne. That was why my anger was roused; and to be faithful to my\r\ncalling as a knight-errant I sought to give aid and protection to those\r\nwho fled, and with this good intention I did what you have seen. If the\r\nresult has been the opposite of what I intended, it is no fault of\r\nmine, but of those wicked beings that persecute me; but, for all that,\r\nI am willing to condemn myself in costs for this error of mine, though\r\nit did not proceed from malice; let Master Pedro see what he wants for\r\nthe spoiled figures, for I agree to pay it at once in good and current\r\nmoney of Castile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster Pedro made him a bow, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI expected no less of the rare\r\nChristianity of the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, true helper and\r\nprotector of all destitute and needy vagabonds; master landlord here\r\nand the great Sancho Panza shall be the arbitrators and appraisers\r\nbetween your worship and me of what these dilapidated figures are worth\r\nor may be worth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord and Sancho consented, and then Master Pedro picked up from\r\nthe ground King Marsilio of Saragossa with his head off, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere you see how impossible it is to restore this king to his former\r\nstate, so I think, saving your better judgments, that for his death,\r\ndecease, and demise, four reals and a half may be given me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProceed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, for this cleavage from top to bottom,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Master\r\nPedro, taking up the split Emperor Charlemagne, \xe2\x80\x9cit would not be much\r\nif I were to ask five reals and a quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not little,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor is it much,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord; \xe2\x80\x9cmake it even, and say five\r\nreals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him have the whole five and a quarter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor the\r\nsum total of this notable disaster does not stand on a quarter more or\r\nless; and make an end of it quickly, Master Pedro, for it\xe2\x80\x99s getting on\r\nto supper-time, and I have some hints of hunger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor this figure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Pedro, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is without a nose, and\r\nwants an eye, and is the fair Melisendra, I ask, and I am reasonable in\r\nmy charge, two reals and twelve maravedis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very devil must be in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif Melisendra and\r\nher husband are not by this time at least on the French border, for the\r\nhorse they rode on seemed to me to fly rather than gallop; so you\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t try to sell me the cat for the hare, showing me here a noseless\r\nMelisendra when she is now, may be, enjoying herself at her ease with\r\nher husband in France. God help every one to his own, Master Pedro, and\r\nlet us all proceed fairly and honestly; and now go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster Pedro, perceiving that Don Quixote was beginning to wander, and\r\nreturn to his original fancy, was not disposed to let him escape, so he\r\nsaid to him, \xe2\x80\x9cThis cannot be Melisendra, but must be one of the damsels\r\nthat waited on her; so if I\xe2\x80\x99m given sixty maravedis for her, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\ncontent and sufficiently paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so he went on, putting values on ever so many more smashed figures,\r\nwhich, after the two arbitrators had adjusted them to the satisfaction\r\nof both parties, came to forty reals and three-quarters; and over and\r\nabove this sum, which Sancho at once disbursed, Master Pedro asked for\r\ntwo reals for his trouble in catching the ape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him have them, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cnot to catch the ape,\r\nbut to get drunk; and two hundred would I give this minute for the good\r\nnews, to anyone who could tell me positively, that the lady Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nMelisandra and Se\xc3\xb1or Don Gaiferos were now in France and with their own\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one could tell us that better than my ape,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Pedro; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no devil that could catch him now; I suspect, however, that\r\naffection and hunger will drive him to come looking for me to-night;\r\nbut to-morrow will soon be here and we shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn short, the puppet-show storm passed off, and all supped in peace and\r\ngood fellowship at Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s expense, for he was the height of\r\ngenerosity. Before it was daylight the man with the lances and halberds\r\ntook his departure, and soon after daybreak the cousin and the page\r\ncame to bid Don Quixote farewell, the former returning home, the latter\r\nresuming his journey, towards which, to help him, Don Quixote gave him\r\ntwelve reals. Master Pedro did not care to engage in any more palaver\r\nwith Don Quixote, whom he knew right well; so he rose before the sun,\r\nand having got together the remains of his show and caught his ape, he\r\ntoo went off to seek his adventures. The landlord, who did not know Don\r\nQuixote, was as much astonished at his mad freaks as at his generosity.\r\nTo conclude, Sancho, by his master\xe2\x80\x99s orders, paid him very liberally,\r\nand taking leave of him they quitted the inn at about eight in the\r\nmorning and took to the road, where we will leave them to pursue their\r\njourney, for this is necessary in order to allow certain other matters\r\nto be set forth, which are required to clear up this famous history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np26e.jpg (34K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nWHEREIN IT IS SHOWN WHO MASTER PEDRO AND HIS APE WERE, TOGETHER WITH\r\nTHE MISHAP DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE BRAYING ADVENTURE, WHICH HE DID NOT\r\nCONCLUDE AS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED OR AS HE HAD EXPECTED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np27a.jpg (135K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCide Hamete, the chronicler of this great history, begins this chapter\r\nwith these words, \xe2\x80\x9cI swear as a Catholic Christian;\xe2\x80\x9d with regard to\r\nwhich his translator says that Cide Hamete\xe2\x80\x99s swearing as a Catholic\r\nChristian, he being\xe2\x80\x94as no doubt he was\xe2\x80\x94a Moor, only meant that, just as\r\na Catholic Christian taking an oath swears, or ought to swear, what is\r\ntrue, and tell the truth in what he avers, so he was telling the truth,\r\nas much as if he swore as a Catholic Christian, in all he chose to\r\nwrite about Quixote, especially in declaring who Master Pedro was and\r\nwhat was the divining ape that astonished all the villages with his\r\ndivinations. He says, then, that he who has read the First Part of this\r\nhistory will remember well enough the Gines de Pasamonte whom, with\r\nother galley slaves, Don Quixote set free in the Sierra Morena: a\r\nkindness for which he afterwards got poor thanks and worse payment from\r\nthat evil-minded, ill-conditioned set. This Gines de Pasamonte\xe2\x80\x94Don\r\nGinesillo de Parapilla, Don Quixote called him\xe2\x80\x94it was that stole Dapple\r\nfrom Sancho Panza; which, because by the fault of the printers neither\r\nthe how nor the when was stated in the First Part, has been a puzzle to\r\na good many people, who attribute to the bad memory of the author what\r\nwas the error of the press. In fact, however, Gines stole him while\r\nSancho Panza was asleep on his back, adopting the plan and device that\r\nBrunello had recourse to when he stole Sacripante\xe2\x80\x99s horse from between\r\nhis legs at the siege of Albracca; and, as has been told, Sancho\r\nafterwards recovered him. This Gines, then, afraid of being caught by\r\nthe officers of justice, who were looking for him to punish him for his\r\nnumberless rascalities and offences (which were so many and so great\r\nthat he himself wrote a big book giving an account of them), resolved\r\nto shift his quarters into the kingdom of Aragon, and cover up his left\r\neye, and take up the trade of a puppet-showman; for this, as well as\r\njuggling, he knew how to practise to perfection. From some released\r\nChristians returning from Barbary, it so happened, he bought the ape,\r\nwhich he taught to mount upon his shoulder on his making a certain\r\nsign, and to whisper, or seem to do so, in his ear. Thus prepared,\r\nbefore entering any village whither he was bound with his show and his\r\nape, he used to inform himself at the nearest village, or from the most\r\nlikely person he could find, as to what particular things had happened\r\nthere, and to whom; and bearing them well in mind, the first thing he\r\ndid was to exhibit his show, sometimes one story, sometimes another,\r\nbut all lively, amusing, and familiar. As soon as the exhibition was\r\nover he brought forward the accomplishments of his ape, assuring the\r\npublic that he divined all the past and the present, but as to the\r\nfuture he had no skill. For each question answered he asked two reals,\r\nand for some he made a reduction, just as he happened to feel the pulse\r\nof the questioners; and when now and then he came to houses where\r\nthings that he knew of had happened to the people living there, even if\r\nthey did not ask him a question, not caring to pay for it, he would\r\nmake the sign to the ape and then declare that it had said so and so,\r\nwhich fitted the case exactly. In this way he acquired a prodigious\r\nname and all ran after him; on other occasions, being very crafty, he\r\nwould answer in such a way that the answers suited the questions; and\r\nas no one cross-questioned him or pressed him to tell how his ape\r\ndivined, he made fools of them all and filled his pouch. The instant he\r\nentered the inn he knew Don Quixote and Sancho, and with that knowledge\r\nit was easy for him to astonish them and all who were there; but it\r\nwould have cost him dear had Don Quixote brought down his hand a little\r\nlower when he cut off King Marsilio\xe2\x80\x99s head and destroyed all his\r\nhorsemen, as related in the preceeding chapter.\r\n\r\nSo much for Master Pedro and his ape; and now to return to Don Quixote\r\nof La Mancha. After he had left the inn he determined to visit, first\r\nof all, the banks of the Ebro and that neighbourhood, before entering\r\nthe city of Saragossa, for the ample time there was still to spare\r\nbefore the jousts left him enough for all. With this object in view he\r\nfollowed the road and travelled along it for two days, without meeting\r\nany adventure worth committing to writing until on the third day, as he\r\nwas ascending a hill, he heard a great noise of drums, trumpets, and\r\nmusket-shots. At first he imagined some regiment of soldiers was\r\npassing that way, and to see them he spurred Rocinante and mounted the\r\nhill. On reaching the top he saw at the foot of it over two hundred\r\nmen, as it seemed to him, armed with weapons of various sorts, lances,\r\ncrossbows, partisans, halberds, and pikes, and a few muskets and a\r\ngreat many bucklers. He descended the slope and approached the band\r\nnear enough to see distinctly the flags, make out the colours and\r\ndistinguish the devices they bore, especially one on a standard or\r\nensign of white satin, on which there was painted in a very life-like\r\nstyle an ass like a little sard, with its head up, its mouth open and\r\nits tongue out, as if it were in the act and attitude of braying; and\r\nround it were inscribed in large characters these two lines\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThey did not bray in vain,\r\nOur alcaldes twain.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this device Don Quixote concluded that these people must be from\r\nthe braying town, and he said so to Sancho, explaining to him what was\r\nwritten on the standard. At the same time be observed that the man who\r\nhad told them about the matter was wrong in saying that the two who\r\nbrayed were regidors, for according to the lines of the standard they\r\nwere alcaldes. To which Sancho replied, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to\r\nstick at in that, for maybe the regidors who brayed then came to be\r\nalcaldes of their town afterwards, and so they may go by both titles;\r\nmoreover, it has nothing to do with the truth of the story whether the\r\nbrayers were alcaldes or regidors, provided at any rate they did bray;\r\nfor an alcalde is just as likely to bray as a regidor.\xe2\x80\x9d They perceived,\r\nin short, clearly that the town which had been twitted had turned out\r\nto do battle with some other that had jeered it more than was fair or\r\nneighbourly.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote proceeded to join them, not a little to Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuneasiness, for he never relished mixing himself up in expeditions of\r\nthat sort. The members of the troop received him into the midst of\r\nthem, taking him to be someone who was on their side. Don Quixote,\r\nputting up his visor, advanced with an easy bearing and demeanour to\r\nthe standard with the ass, and all the chief men of the army gathered\r\nround him to look at him, staring at him with the usual amazement that\r\neverybody felt on seeing him for the first time. Don Quixote, seeing\r\nthem examining him so attentively, and that none of them spoke to him\r\nor put any question to him, determined to take advantage of their\r\nsilence; so, breaking his own, he lifted up his voice and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWorthy\r\nsirs, I entreat you as earnestly as I can not to interrupt an argument\r\nI wish to address to you, until you find it displeases or wearies you;\r\nand if that come to pass, on the slightest hint you give me I will put\r\na seal upon my lips and a gag upon my tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all bade him say what he liked, for they would listen to him\r\nwillingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np27b.jpg (330K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this permission Don Quixote went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI, sirs, am a\r\nknight-errant whose calling is that of arms, and whose profession is to\r\nprotect those who require protection, and give help to such as stand in\r\nneed of it. Some days ago I became acquainted with your misfortune and\r\nthe cause which impels you to take up arms again and again to revenge\r\nyourselves upon your enemies; and having many times thought over your\r\nbusiness in my mind, I find that, according to the laws of combat, you\r\nare mistaken in holding yourselves insulted; for a private individual\r\ncannot insult an entire community; unless it be by defying it\r\ncollectively as a traitor, because he cannot tell who in particular is\r\nguilty of the treason for which he defies it. Of this we have an\r\nexample in Don Diego Ordo\xc3\xb1ez de Lara, who defied the whole town of\r\nZamora, because he did not know that Vellido Dolfos alone had committed\r\nthe treachery of slaying his king; and therefore he defied them all,\r\nand the vengeance and the reply concerned all; though, to be sure,\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Don Diego went rather too far, indeed very much beyond the limits\r\nof a defiance; for he had no occasion to defy the dead, or the waters,\r\nor the fishes, or those yet unborn, and all the rest of it as set\r\nforth; but let that pass, for when anger breaks out there\xe2\x80\x99s no father,\r\ngovernor, or bridle to check the tongue. The case being, then, that no\r\none person can insult a kingdom, province, city, state, or entire\r\ncommunity, it is clear there is no reason for going out to avenge the\r\ndefiance of such an insult, inasmuch as it is not one. A fine thing it\r\nwould be if the people of the clock town were to be at loggerheads\r\nevery moment with everyone who called them by that name,\xe2\x80\x94or the\r\nCazoleros, Berengeneros, Ballenatos, Jaboneros, or the bearers of all\r\nthe other names and titles that are always in the mouth of the boys and\r\ncommon people! It would be a nice business indeed if all these\r\nillustrious cities were to take huff and revenge themselves and go\r\nabout perpetually making trombones of their swords in every petty\r\nquarrel! No, no; God forbid! There are four things for which sensible\r\nmen and well-ordered States ought to take up arms, draw their swords,\r\nand risk their persons, lives, and properties. The first is to defend\r\nthe Catholic faith; the second, to defend one\xe2\x80\x99s life, which is in\r\naccordance with natural and divine law; the third, in defence of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhonour, family, and property; the fourth, in the service of one\xe2\x80\x99s king\r\nin a just war; and if to these we choose to add a fifth (which may be\r\nincluded in the second), in defence of one\xe2\x80\x99s country. To these five, as\r\nit were capital causes, there may be added some others that may be just\r\nand reasonable, and make it a duty to take up arms; but to take them up\r\nfor trifles and things to laugh at and be amused by rather than\r\noffended, looks as though he who did so was altogether wanting in\r\ncommon sense. Moreover, to take an unjust revenge (and there cannot be\r\nany just one) is directly opposed to the sacred law that we\r\nacknowledge, wherein we are commanded to do good to our enemies and to\r\nlove them that hate us; a command which, though it seems somewhat\r\ndifficult to obey, is only so to those who have in them less of God\r\nthan of the world, and more of the flesh than of the spirit; for Jesus\r\nChrist, God and true man, who never lied, and could not and cannot lie,\r\nsaid, as our law-giver, that his yoke was easy and his burden light; he\r\nwould not, therefore, have laid any command upon us that it was\r\nimpossible to obey. Thus, sirs, you are bound to keep quiet by human\r\nand divine law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil take me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho to himself at this, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this master\r\nof mine is a theologian; or, if not, faith, he\xe2\x80\x99s as like one as one egg\r\nis like another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote stopped to take breath, and, observing that silence was\r\nstill preserved, had a mind to continue his discourse, and would have\r\ndone so had not Sancho interposed with his smartness; for he, seeing\r\nhis master pause, took the lead, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMy lord Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha, who once was called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, but\r\nnow is called the Knight of the Lions, is a gentleman of great\r\ndiscretion who knows Latin and his mother tongue like a bachelor, and\r\nin everything that he deals with or advises proceeds like a good\r\nsoldier, and has all the laws and ordinances of what they call combat\r\nat his fingers\xe2\x80\x99 ends; so you have nothing to do but to let yourselves\r\nbe guided by what he says, and on my head be it if it is wrong. Besides\r\nwhich, you have been told that it is folly to take offence at merely\r\nhearing a bray. I remember when I was a boy I brayed as often as I had\r\na fancy, without anyone hindering me, and so elegantly and naturally\r\nthat when I brayed all the asses in the town would bray; but I was none\r\nthe less for that the son of my parents who were greatly respected; and\r\nthough I was envied because of the gift by more than one of the high\r\nand mighty ones of the town, I did not care two farthings for it; and\r\nthat you may see I am telling the truth, wait a bit and listen, for\r\nthis art, like swimming, once learnt is never forgotten;\xe2\x80\x9d and then,\r\ntaking hold of his nose, he began to bray so vigorously that all the\r\nvalleys around rang again.\r\n\r\nOne of those, however, that stood near him, fancying he was mocking\r\nthem, lifted up a long staff he had in his hand and smote him such a\r\nblow with it that Sancho dropped helpless to the ground. Don Quixote,\r\nseeing him so roughly handled, attacked the man who had struck him\r\nlance in hand, but so many thrust themselves between them that he could\r\nnot avenge him. Far from it, finding a shower of stones rained upon\r\nhim, and crossbows and muskets unnumbered levelled at him, he wheeled\r\nRocinante round and, as fast as his best gallop could take him, fled\r\nfrom the midst of them, commending himself to God with all his heart to\r\ndeliver him out of this peril, in dread every step of some ball coming\r\nin at his back and coming out at his breast, and every minute drawing\r\nhis breath to see whether it had gone from him. The members of the\r\nband, however, were satisfied with seeing him take to flight, and did\r\nnot fire on him. They put up Sancho, scarcely restored to his senses,\r\non his ass, and let him go after his master; not that he was\r\nsufficiently in his wits to guide the beast, but Dapple followed the\r\nfootsteps of Rocinante, from whom he could not remain a moment\r\nseparated. Don Quixote having got some way off looked back, and seeing\r\nSancho coming, waited for him, as he perceived that no one followed\r\nhim. The men of the troop stood their ground till night, and as the\r\nenemy did not come out to battle, they returned to their town exulting;\r\nand had they been aware of the ancient custom of the Greeks, they would\r\nhave erected a trophy on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np27e.jpg (47K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nOF MATTERS THAT BENENGELI SAYS HE WHO READS THEM WILL KNOW, IF HE READS\r\nTHEM WITH ATTENTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np28a.jpg (111K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the brave man flees, treachery is manifest and it is for wise men\r\nto reserve themselves for better occasions. This proved to be the case\r\nwith Don Quixote, who, giving way before the fury of the townsfolk and\r\nthe hostile intentions of the angry troop, took to flight and, without\r\na thought of Sancho or the danger in which he was leaving him,\r\nretreated to such a distance as he thought made him safe. Sancho, lying\r\nacross his ass, followed him, as has been said, and at length came up,\r\nhaving by this time recovered his senses, and on joining him let\r\nhimself drop off Dapple at Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s feet, sore, bruised, and\r\nbelaboured. Don Quixote dismounted to examine his wounds, but finding\r\nhim whole from head to foot, he said to him, angrily enough, \xe2\x80\x9cIn an\r\nevil hour didst thou take to braying, Sancho! Where hast thou learned\r\nthat it is well done to mention the rope in the house of the man that\r\nhas been hanged? To the music of brays what harmonies couldst thou\r\nexpect to get but cudgels? Give thanks to God, Sancho, that they signed\r\nthe cross on thee just now with a stick, and did not mark thee _per\r\nsignum crucis_ with a cutlass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not equal to answering,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I feel as if I was\r\nspeaking through my shoulders; let us mount and get away from this;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll keep from braying, but not from saying that knights-errant fly and\r\nleave their good squires to be pounded like privet, or made meal of at\r\nthe hands of their enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does not fly who retires,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I would have\r\nthee know, Sancho, that the valour which is not based upon a foundation\r\nof prudence is called rashness, and the exploits of the rash man are to\r\nbe attributed rather to good fortune than to courage; and so I own that\r\nI retired, but not that I fled; and therein I have followed the example\r\nof many valiant men who have reserved themselves for better times; the\r\nhistories are full of instances of this, but as it would not be any\r\ngood to thee or pleasure to me, I will not recount them to thee now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho was by this time mounted with the help of Don Quixote, who then\r\nhimself mounted Rocinante, and at a leisurely pace they proceeded to\r\ntake shelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a league\r\noff. Every now and then Sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismal\r\ngroans, and on Don Quixote asking him what caused such acute suffering,\r\nhe replied that, from the end of his back-bone up to the nape of his\r\nneck, he was so sore that it nearly drove him out of his senses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cause of that soreness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be, no doubt,\r\nthat the staff wherewith they smote thee being a very long one, it\r\ncaught thee all down the back, where all the parts that are sore are\r\nsituated, and had it reached any further thou wouldst be sorer still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship has relieved me of a great doubt,\r\nand cleared up the point for me in elegant style! Body o\xe2\x80\x99 me! is the\r\ncause of my soreness such a mystery that there\xe2\x80\x99s any need to tell me I\r\nam sore everywhere the staff hit me? If it was my ankles that pained me\r\nthere might be something in going divining why they did, but it is not\r\nmuch to divine that I\xe2\x80\x99m sore where they thrashed me. By my faith,\r\nmaster mine, the ills of others hang by a hair; every day I am\r\ndiscovering more and more how little I have to hope for from keeping\r\ncompany with your worship; for if this time you have allowed me to be\r\ndrubbed, the next time, or a hundred times more, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the\r\nblanketings of the other day over again, and all the other pranks\r\nwhich, if they have fallen on my shoulders now, will be thrown in my\r\nteeth by-and-by. I would do a great deal better (if I was not an\r\nignorant brute that will never do any good all my life), I would do a\r\ngreat deal better, I say, to go home to my wife and children and\r\nsupport them and bring them up on what God may please to give me,\r\ninstead of following your worship along roads that lead nowhere and\r\npaths that are none at all, with little to drink and less to eat. And\r\nthen when it comes to sleeping! Measure out seven feet on the earth,\r\nbrother squire, and if that\xe2\x80\x99s not enough for you, take as many more,\r\nfor you may have it all your own way and stretch yourself to your\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s content. Oh that I could see burnt and turned to ashes the\r\nfirst man that meddled with knight-errantry or at any rate the first\r\nwho chose to be squire to such fools as all the knights-errant of past\r\ntimes must have been! Of those of the present day I say nothing,\r\nbecause, as your worship is one of them, I respect them, and because I\r\nknow your worship knows a point more than the devil in all you say and\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would lay a good wager with you, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nnow that you are talking on without anyone to stop you, you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel\r\na pain in your whole body. Talk away, my son, say whatever comes into\r\nyour head or mouth, for so long as you feel no pain, the irritation\r\nyour impertinences give me will be a pleasure to me; and if you are so\r\nanxious to go home to your wife and children, God forbid that I should\r\nprevent you; you have money of mine; see how long it is since we left\r\nour village this third time, and how much you can and ought to earn\r\nevery month, and pay yourself out of your own hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I worked for Tom Carrasco, the father of the bachelor Samson\r\nCarrasco that your worship knows,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI used to earn two\r\nducats a month besides my food; I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell what I can earn with your\r\nworship, though I know a knight-errant\xe2\x80\x99s squire has harder times of it\r\nthan he who works for a farmer; for after all, we who work for farmers,\r\nhowever much we toil all day, at the worst, at night, we have our olla\r\nsupper and sleep in a bed, which I have not slept in since I have been\r\nin your worship\xe2\x80\x99s service, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the short time we were in Don\r\nDiego de Miranda\xe2\x80\x99s house, and the feast I had with the skimmings I took\r\noff Camacho\xe2\x80\x99s pots, and what I ate, drank, and slept in Basilio\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse; all the rest of the time I have been sleeping on the hard ground\r\nunder the open sky, exposed to what they call the inclemencies of\r\nheaven, keeping life in me with scraps of cheese and crusts of bread,\r\nand drinking water either from the brooks or from the springs we come\r\nto on these by-paths we travel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI own, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat all thou sayest is true; how\r\nmuch, thinkest thou, ought I to give thee over and above what Tom\r\nCarrasco gave thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if your worship was to add on two reals a\r\nmonth I\xe2\x80\x99d consider myself well paid; that is, as far as the wages of my\r\nlabour go; but to make up to me for your worship\xe2\x80\x99s pledge and promise\r\nto me to give me the government of an island, it would be fair to add\r\nsix reals more, making thirty in all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cit is twenty-five days since we left\r\nour village, so reckon up, Sancho, according to the wages you have made\r\nout for yourself, and see how much I owe you in proportion, and pay\r\nyourself, as I said before, out of your own hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO body o\xe2\x80\x99 me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut your worship is very much out in that\r\nreckoning; for when it comes to the promise of the island we must count\r\nfrom the day your worship promised it to me to this present hour we are\r\nat now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how long is it, Sancho, since I promised it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I remember rightly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cit must be over twenty years,\r\nthree days more or less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote gave himself a great slap on the forehead and began to\r\nlaugh heartily, and said he, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I have not been wandering, either in\r\nthe Sierra Morena or in the whole course of our sallies, but barely two\r\nmonths, and thou sayest, Sancho, that it is twenty years since I\r\npromised thee the island. I believe now thou wouldst have all the money\r\nthou hast of mine go in thy wages. If so, and if that be thy pleasure,\r\nI give it to thee now, once and for all, and much good may it do thee,\r\nfor so long as I see myself rid of such a good-for-nothing squire I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe glad to be left a pauper without a rap. But tell me, thou perverter\r\nof the squirely rules of knight-errantry, where hast thou ever seen or\r\nread that any knight-errant\xe2\x80\x99s squire made terms with his lord, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nmust give me so much a month for serving you\xe2\x80\x99? Plunge, scoundrel,\r\nrogue, monster\xe2\x80\x94for such I take thee to be\xe2\x80\x94plunge, I say, into the _mare\r\nmagnum_ of their histories; and if thou shalt find that any squire ever\r\nsaid or thought what thou hast said now, I will let thee nail it on my\r\nforehead, and give me, over and above, four sound slaps in the face.\r\nTurn the rein, or the halter, of thy Dapple, and begone home; for one\r\nsingle step further thou shalt not make in my company. O bread\r\nthanklessly received! O promises ill-bestowed! O man more beast than\r\nhuman being! Now, when I was about to raise thee to such a position,\r\nthat, in spite of thy wife, they would call thee \xe2\x80\x98my lord,\xe2\x80\x99 thou art\r\nleaving me? Thou art going now when I had a firm and fixed intention of\r\nmaking thee lord of the best island in the world? Well, as thou thyself\r\nhast said before now, honey is not for the mouth of the ass. Ass thou\r\nart, ass thou wilt be, and ass thou wilt end when the course of thy\r\nlife is run; for I know it will come to its close before thou dost\r\nperceive or discern that thou art a beast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho regarded Don Quixote earnestly while he was giving him this\r\nrating, and was so touched by remorse that the tears came to his eyes,\r\nand in a piteous and broken voice he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cMaster mine, I\r\nconfess that, to be a complete ass, all I want is a tail; if your\r\nworship will only fix one on to me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll look on it as rightly placed,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll serve you as an ass all the remaining days of my life. Forgive\r\nme and have pity on my folly, and remember I know but little, and, if I\r\ntalk much, it\xe2\x80\x99s more from infirmity than malice; but he who sins and\r\nmends commends himself to God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have been surprised, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif thou\r\nhadst not introduced some bit of a proverb into thy speech. Well, well,\r\nI forgive thee, provided thou dost mend and not show thyself in future\r\nso fond of thine own interest, but try to be of good cheer and take\r\nheart, and encourage thyself to look forward to the fulfillment of my\r\npromises, which, by being delayed, does not become impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho said he would do so, and keep up his heart as best he could.\r\nThey then entered the grove, and Don Quixote settled himself at the\r\nfoot of an elm, and Sancho at that of a beech, for trees of this kind\r\nand others like them always have feet but no hands. Sancho passed the\r\nnight in pain, for with the evening dews the blow of the staff made\r\nitself felt all the more. Don Quixote passed it in his never-failing\r\nmeditations; but, for all that, they had some winks of sleep, and with\r\nthe appearance of daylight they pursued their journey in quest of the\r\nbanks of the famous Ebro, where that befell them which will be told in\r\nthe following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np28e.jpg (36K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nOF THE FAMOUS ADVENTURE OF THE ENCHANTED BARK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np29a.jpg (127K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy stages as already described or left undescribed, two days after\r\nquitting the grove Don Quixote and Sancho reached the river Ebro, and\r\nthe sight of it was a great delight to Don Quixote as he contemplated\r\nand gazed upon the charms of its banks, the clearness of its stream,\r\nthe gentleness of its current and the abundance of its crystal waters;\r\nand the pleasant view revived a thousand tender thoughts in his mind.\r\nAbove all, he dwelt upon what he had seen in the cave of Montesinos;\r\nfor though Master Pedro\xe2\x80\x99s ape had told him that of those things part\r\nwas true, part false, he clung more to their truth than to their\r\nfalsehood, the very reverse of Sancho, who held them all to be\r\ndownright lies.\r\n\r\nAs they were thus proceeding, then, they discovered a small boat,\r\nwithout oars or any other gear, that lay at the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge tied to\r\nthe stem of a tree growing on the bank. Don Quixote looked all round,\r\nand seeing nobody, at once, without more ado, dismounted from Rocinante\r\nand bade Sancho get down from Dapple and tie both beasts securely to\r\nthe trunk of a poplar or willow that stood there. Sancho asked him the\r\nreason of this sudden dismounting and tying. Don Quixote made answer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou must know, Sancho, that this bark is plainly, and without the\r\npossibility of any alternative, calling and inviting me to enter it,\r\nand in it go to give aid to some knight or other person of distinction\r\nin need of it, who is no doubt in some sore strait; for this is the way\r\nof the books of chivalry and of the enchanters who figure and speak in\r\nthem. When a knight is involved in some difficulty from which he cannot\r\nbe delivered save by the hand of another knight, though they may be at\r\na distance of two or three thousand leagues or more one from the other,\r\nthey either take him up on a cloud, or they provide a bark for him to\r\nget into, and in less than the twinkling of an eye they carry him where\r\nthey will and where his help is required; and so, Sancho, this bark is\r\nplaced here for the same purpose; this is as true as that it is now\r\nday, and ere this one passes tie Dapple and Rocinante together, and\r\nthen in God\xe2\x80\x99s hand be it to guide us; for I would not hold back from\r\nembarking, though barefooted friars were to beg me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs that\xe2\x80\x99s the case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand your worship chooses to give in\r\nto these\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I may call them absurdities\xe2\x80\x94at every turn,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing for it but to obey and bow the head, bearing in mind\r\nthe proverb, \xe2\x80\x98Do as thy master bids thee, and sit down to table with\r\nhim;\xe2\x80\x99 but for all that, for the sake of easing my conscience, I warn\r\nyour worship that it is my opinion this bark is no enchanted one, but\r\nbelongs to some of the fishermen of the river, for they catch the best\r\nshad in the world here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Sancho said this, he tied the beasts, leaving them to the care and\r\nprotection of the enchanters with sorrow enough in his heart. Don\r\nQuixote bade him not be uneasy about deserting the animals, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he who\r\nwould carry themselves over such longinquous roads and regions would\r\ntake care to feed them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that logiquous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cnor have I ever\r\nheard the word all the days of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLonginquous,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cmeans far off; but it is no wonder\r\nthou dost not understand it, for thou art not bound to know Latin, like\r\nsome who pretend to know it and don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow they are tied,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are we to do next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9ccross ourselves and weigh anchor; I mean,\r\nembark and cut the moorings by which the bark is held;\xe2\x80\x9d and the bark\r\nbegan to drift away slowly from the bank. But when Sancho saw himself\r\nsomewhere about two yards out in the river, he began to tremble and\r\ngive himself up for lost; but nothing distressed him more than hearing\r\nDapple bray and seeing Rocinante struggling to get loose, and said he\r\nto his master, \xe2\x80\x9cDapple is braying in grief at our leaving him, and\r\nRocinante is trying to escape and plunge in after us. O dear friends,\r\npeace be with you, and may this madness that is taking us away from\r\nyou, turned into sober sense, bring us back to you.\xe2\x80\x9d And with this he\r\nfell weeping so bitterly, that Don Quixote said to him, sharply and\r\nangrily, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou afraid of, cowardly creature? What art thou\r\nweeping at, heart of butter-paste? Who pursues or molests thee, thou\r\nsoul of a tame mouse? What dost thou want, unsatisfied in the very\r\nheart of abundance? Art thou, perchance, tramping barefoot over the\r\nRiphaean mountains, instead of being seated on a bench like an archduke\r\non the tranquil stream of this pleasant river, from which in a short\r\nspace we shall come out upon the broad sea? But we must have already\r\nemerged and gone seven hundred or eight hundred leagues; and if I had\r\nhere an astrolabe to take the altitude of the pole, I could tell thee\r\nhow many we have travelled, though either I know little, or we have\r\nalready crossed or shall shortly cross the equinoctial line which parts\r\nthe two opposite poles midway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when we come to that line your worship speaks of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow far shall we have gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery far,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor of the three hundred and sixty\r\ndegrees that this terraqueous globe contains, as computed by Ptolemy,\r\nthe greatest cosmographer known, we shall have travelled one-half when\r\nwe come to the line I spoke of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship gives me a nice authority for what\r\nyou say, putrid Dolly something transmogrified, or whatever it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote laughed at the interpretation Sancho put upon \xe2\x80\x9ccomputed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand the name of the cosmographer Ptolemy, and said he, \xe2\x80\x9cThou must know,\r\nSancho, that with the Spaniards and those who embark at Cadiz for the\r\nEast Indies, one of the signs they have to show them when they have\r\npassed the equinoctial line I told thee of, is, that the lice die upon\r\neverybody on board the ship, and not a single one is left, or to be\r\nfound in the whole vessel if they gave its weight in gold for it; so,\r\nSancho, thou mayest as well pass thy hand down thy thigh, and if thou\r\ncomest upon anything alive we shall be no longer in doubt; if not, then\r\nwe have crossed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cstill, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do as your\r\nworship bids me; though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what need there is for trying\r\nthese experiments, for I can see with my own eyes that we have not\r\nmoved five yards away from the bank, or shifted two yards from where\r\nthe animals stand, for there are Rocinante and Dapple in the very same\r\nplace where we left them; and watching a point, as I do now, I swear by\r\nall that\xe2\x80\x99s good, we are not stirring or moving at the pace of an ant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry the test I told thee of, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind any other, for thou knowest nothing about colures, lines,\r\nparallels, zodiacs, ecliptics, poles, solstices, equinoxes, planets,\r\nsigns, bearings, the measures of which the celestial and terrestrial\r\nspheres are composed; if thou wert acquainted with all these things, or\r\nany portion of them, thou wouldst see clearly how many parallels we\r\nhave cut, what signs we have seen, and what constellations we have left\r\nbehind and are now leaving behind. But again I tell thee, feel and\r\nhunt, for I am certain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth white\r\npaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho felt, and passing his hand gently and carefully down to the\r\nhollow of his left knee, he looked up at his master and said, \xe2\x80\x9cEither\r\nthe test is a false one, or we have not come to where your worship\r\nsays, nor within many leagues of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9chast thou come upon aught?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, and aughts,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; and shaking his fingers he washed his\r\nwhole hand in the river along which the boat was quietly gliding in\r\nmidstream, not moved by any occult intelligence or invisible enchanter,\r\nbut simply by the current, just there smooth and gentle.\r\n\r\nThey now came in sight of some large water mills that stood in the\r\nmiddle of the river, and the instant Don Quixote saw them he cried out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeest thou there, my friend? there stands the castle or fortress,\r\nwhere there is, no doubt, some knight in durance, or ill-used queen, or\r\ninfanta, or princess, in whose aid I am brought hither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil city, fortress, or castle is your worship talking\r\nabout, se\xc3\xb1or?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you see that those are mills that\r\nstand in the river to grind corn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold thy peace, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthough they look like\r\nmills they are not so; I have already told thee that enchantments\r\ntransform things and change their proper shapes; I do not mean to say\r\nthey really change them from one form into another, but that it seems\r\nas though they did, as experience proved in the transformation of\r\nDulcinea, sole refuge of my hopes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time, the boat, having reached the middle of the stream, began\r\nto move less slowly than hitherto. The millers belonging to the mills,\r\nwhen they saw the boat coming down the river, and on the point of being\r\nsucked in by the draught of the wheels, ran out in haste, several of\r\nthem, with long poles to stop it, and being all mealy, with faces and\r\ngarments covered with flour, they presented a sinister appearance. They\r\nraised loud shouts, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cDevils of men, where are you going to? Are\r\nyou mad? Do you want to drown yourselves, or dash yourselves to pieces\r\namong these wheels?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I not tell thee, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote at this, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we had\r\nreached the place where I am to show what the might of my arm can do?\r\nSee what ruffians and villains come out against me; see what monsters\r\noppose me; see what hideous countenances come to frighten us! You shall\r\nsoon see, scoundrels!\xe2\x80\x9d And then standing up in the boat he began in a\r\nloud voice to hurl threats at the millers, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cIll-conditioned\r\nand worse-counselled rabble, restore to liberty and freedom the person\r\nye hold in durance in this your fortress or prison, high or low or of\r\nwhatever rank or quality he be, for I am Don Quixote of La Mancha,\r\notherwise called the Knight of the Lions, for whom, by the disposition\r\nof heaven above, it is reserved to give a happy issue to this\r\nadventure;\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying he drew his sword and began making passes in\r\nthe air at the millers, who, hearing but not understanding all this\r\nnonsense, strove to stop the boat, which was now getting into the\r\nrushing channel of the wheels. Sancho fell upon his knees devoutly\r\nappealing to heaven to deliver him from such imminent peril; which it\r\ndid by the activity and quickness of the millers, who, pushing against\r\nthe boat with their poles, stopped it, not, however, without upsetting\r\nand throwing Don Quixote and Sancho into the water; and lucky it was\r\nfor Don Quixote that he could swim like a goose, though the weight of\r\nhis armour carried him twice to the bottom; and had it not been for the\r\nmillers, who plunged in and hoisted them both out, it would have been\r\nTroy town with the pair of them. As soon as, more drenched than\r\nthirsty, they were landed, Sancho went down on his knees and with\r\nclasped hands and eyes raised to heaven, prayed a long and fervent\r\nprayer to God to deliver him evermore from the rash projects and\r\nattempts of his master. The fishermen, the owners of the boat, which\r\nthe mill-wheels had knocked to pieces, now came up, and seeing it\r\nsmashed they proceeded to strip Sancho and to demand payment for it\r\nfrom Don Quixote; but he with great calmness, just as if nothing had\r\nhappened him, told the millers and fishermen that he would pay for the\r\nbark most cheerfully, on condition that they delivered up to him, free\r\nand unhurt, the person or persons that were in durance in that castle\r\nof theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np29b.jpg (314K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat persons or what castle art thou talking of, madman? Art thou for\r\ncarrying off the people who come to grind corn in these mills?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be preaching in\r\nthe desert to attempt by entreaties to induce this rabble to do any\r\nvirtuous action. In this adventure two mighty enchanters must have\r\nencountered one another, and one frustrates what the other attempts;\r\none provided the bark for me, and the other upset me; God help us, this\r\nworld is all machinations and schemes at cross purposes one with the\r\nother. I can do no more.\xe2\x80\x9d And then turning towards the mills he said\r\naloud, \xe2\x80\x9cFriends, whoe\xe2\x80\x99er ye be that are immured in that prison, forgive\r\nme that, to my misfortune and yours, I cannot deliver you from your\r\nmisery; this adventure is doubtless reserved and destined for some\r\nother knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying he settled with the fishermen, and paid fifty reals for the\r\nboat, which Sancho handed to them very much against the grain, saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a couple more bark businesses like this we shall have sunk our\r\nwhole capital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fishermen and the millers stood staring in amazement at the two\r\nfigures, so very different to all appearance from ordinary men, and\r\nwere wholly unable to make out the drift of the observations and\r\nquestions Don Quixote addressed to them; and coming to the conclusion\r\nthat they were madmen, they left them and betook themselves, the\r\nmillers to their mills, and the fishermen to their huts. Don Quixote\r\nand Sancho returned to their beasts, and to their life of beasts, and\r\nso ended the adventure of the enchanted bark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np29e.jpg (54K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nOF DON QUIXOTE\xe2\x80\x99S ADVENTURE WITH A FAIR HUNTRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np30a.jpg (134K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey reached their beasts in low spirits and bad humour enough, knight\r\nand squire, Sancho particularly, for with him what touched the stock of\r\nmoney touched his heart, and when any was taken from him he felt as if\r\nhe was robbed of the apples of his eyes. In fine, without exchanging a\r\nword, they mounted and quitted the famous river, Don Quixote absorbed\r\nin thoughts of his love, Sancho in thinking of his advancement, which\r\njust then, it seemed to him, he was very far from securing; for, fool\r\nas he was, he saw clearly enough that his master\xe2\x80\x99s acts were all or\r\nmost of them utterly senseless; and he began to cast about for an\r\nopportunity of retiring from his service and going home some day,\r\nwithout entering into any explanations or taking any farewell of him.\r\nFortune, however, ordered matters after a fashion very much the\r\nopposite of what he contemplated.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that the next day towards sunset, on coming out of a\r\nwood, Don Quixote cast his eyes over a green meadow, and at the far end\r\nof it observed some people, and as he drew nearer saw that it was a\r\nhawking party. Coming closer, he distinguished among them a lady of\r\ngraceful mien, on a pure white palfrey or hackney caparisoned with\r\ngreen trappings and a silver-mounted side-saddle. The lady was also in\r\ngreen, and so richly and splendidly dressed that splendour itself\r\nseemed personified in her. On her left hand she bore a hawk, a proof to\r\nDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s mind that she must be some great lady and the mistress of\r\nthe whole hunting party, which was the fact; so he said to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cRun\r\nSancho, my son, and say to that lady on the palfrey with the hawk that\r\nI, the Knight of the Lions, kiss the hands of her exalted beauty, and\r\nif her excellence will grant me leave I will go and kiss them in person\r\nand place myself at her service for aught that may be in my power and\r\nher highness may command; and mind, Sancho, how thou speakest, and take\r\ncare not to thrust in any of thy proverbs into thy message.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np30b.jpg (334K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a likely one here to thrust any in!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cleave me\r\nalone for that! Why, this is not the first time in my life I have\r\ncarried messages to high and exalted ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept that thou didst carry to the lady Dulcinea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not that thou hast carried any other, at least in my service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut pledges don\xe2\x80\x99t distress a good\r\npayer, and in a house where there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty supper is soon cooked; I\r\nmean there\xe2\x80\x99s no need of telling or warning me about anything; for I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nready for everything and know a little of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I believe, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cgo and good luck to thee,\r\nand God speed thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho went off at top speed, forcing Dapple out of his regular pace,\r\nand came to where the fair huntress was standing, and dismounting knelt\r\nbefore her and said, \xe2\x80\x9cFair lady, that knight that you see there, the\r\nKnight of the Lions by name, is my master, and I am a squire of his,\r\nand at home they call me Sancho Panza. This same Knight of the Lions,\r\nwho was called not long since the Knight of the Rueful Countenance,\r\nsends by me to say may it please your highness to give him leave that,\r\nwith your permission, approbation, and consent, he may come and carry\r\nout his wishes, which are, as he says and I believe, to serve your\r\nexalted loftiness and beauty; and if you give it, your ladyship will do\r\na thing which will redound to your honour, and he will receive a most\r\ndistinguished favour and happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have indeed, squire,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cdelivered your message with\r\nall the formalities such messages require; rise up, for it is not right\r\nthat the squire of a knight so great as he of the Rueful Countenance,\r\nof whom we have heard a great deal here, should remain on his knees;\r\nrise, my friend, and bid your master welcome to the services of myself\r\nand the duke my husband, in a country house we have here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho got up, charmed as much by the beauty of the good lady as by her\r\nhigh-bred air and her courtesy, but, above all, by what she had said\r\nabout having heard of his master, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance;\r\nfor if she did not call him Knight of the Lions it was no doubt because\r\nhe had so lately taken the name. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, brother squire,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\nduchess (whose title, however, is not known), \xe2\x80\x9cthis master of yours, is\r\nhe not one of whom there is a history extant in print, called \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nIngenious Gentleman, Don Quixote of La Mancha,\xe2\x80\x99 who has for the lady of\r\nhis heart a certain Dulcinea del Toboso?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is the same, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand that squire of his who\r\nfigures, or ought to figure, in the said history under the name of\r\nSancho Panza, is myself, unless they have changed me in the cradle, I\r\nmean in the press.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am rejoiced at all this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess; \xe2\x80\x9cgo, brother Panza, and\r\ntell your master that he is welcome to my estate, and that nothing\r\ncould happen to me that could give me greater pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho returned to his master mightily pleased with this gratifying\r\nanswer, and told him all the great lady had said to him, lauding to the\r\nskies, in his rustic phrase, her rare beauty, her graceful gaiety, and\r\nher courtesy. Don Quixote drew himself up briskly in his saddle, fixed\r\nhimself in his stirrups, settled his visor, gave Rocinante the spur,\r\nand with an easy bearing advanced to kiss the hands of the duchess,\r\nwho, having sent to summon the duke her husband, told him while Don\r\nQuixote was approaching all about the message; and as both of them had\r\nread the First Part of this history, and from it were aware of Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s crazy turn, they awaited him with the greatest delight and\r\nanxiety to make his acquaintance, meaning to fall in with his humour\r\nand agree with everything he said, and, so long as he stayed with them,\r\nto treat him as a knight-errant, with all the ceremonies usual in the\r\nbooks of chivalry they had read, for they themselves were very fond of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote now came up with his visor raised, and as he seemed about\r\nto dismount Sancho made haste to go and hold his stirrup for him; but\r\nin getting down off Dapple he was so unlucky as to hitch his foot in\r\none of the ropes of the pack-saddle in such a way that he was unable to\r\nfree it, and was left hanging by it with his face and breast on the\r\nground. Don Quixote, who was not used to dismount without having the\r\nstirrup held, fancying that Sancho had by this time come to hold it for\r\nhim, threw himself off with a lurch and brought Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s saddle\r\nafter him, which was no doubt badly girthed, and saddle and he both\r\ncame to the ground; not without discomfiture to him and abundant curses\r\nmuttered between his teeth against the unlucky Sancho, who had his foot\r\nstill in the shackles. The duke ordered his huntsmen to go to the help\r\nof knight and squire, and they raised Don Quixote, sorely shaken by his\r\nfall; and he, limping, advanced as best he could to kneel before the\r\nnoble pair. This, however, the duke would by no means permit; on the\r\ncontrary, dismounting from his horse, he went and embraced Don Quixote,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cI am grieved, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, that your\r\nfirst experience on my ground should have been such an unfortunate one\r\nas we have seen; but the carelessness of squires is often the cause of\r\nworse accidents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat which has happened me in meeting you, mighty prince,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don\r\nQuixote, \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be unfortunate, even if my fall had not stopped short\r\nof the depths of the bottomless pit, for the glory of having seen you\r\nwould have lifted me up and delivered me from it. My squire, God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncurse upon him, is better at unloosing his tongue in talking\r\nimpertinence than in tightening the girths of a saddle to keep it\r\nsteady; but however I may be, fallen or raised up, on foot or on\r\nhorseback, I shall always be at your service and that of my lady the\r\nduchess, your worthy consort, worthy queen of beauty and paramount\r\nprincess of courtesy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote of La Mancha,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere my lady\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Dulcinea del Toboso is, it is not right that other beauties should\r\nbe praised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho, by this time released from his entanglement, was standing by,\r\nand before his master could answer he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no denying, and\r\nit must be maintained, that my lady Dulcinea del Toboso is very\r\nbeautiful; but the hare jumps up where one least expects it; and I have\r\nheard say that what we call nature is like a potter that makes vessels\r\nof clay, and he who makes one fair vessel can as well make two, or\r\nthree, or a hundred; I say so because, by my faith, my lady the duchess\r\nis in no way behind my mistress the lady Dulcinea del Toboso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote turned to the duchess and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYour highness may conceive\r\nthat never had knight-errant in this world a more talkative or a\r\ndroller squire than I have, and he will prove the truth of what I say,\r\nif your highness is pleased to accept of my services for a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which the duchess made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat worthy Sancho is droll I\r\nconsider a very good thing, because it is a sign that he is shrewd; for\r\ndrollery and sprightliness, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, as you very well know,\r\ndo not take up their abode with dull wits; and as good Sancho is droll\r\nand sprightly I here set him down as shrewd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd talkative,\xe2\x80\x9d added Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cfor many droll things cannot be\r\nsaid in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come, great Knight\r\nof the Rueful Countenance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the Lions, your highness must say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor there is no\r\nRueful Countenance nor any such character now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe of the Lions be it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the duke; \xe2\x80\x9cI say, let Sir Knight of\r\nthe Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shall be given\r\nthat reception which is due to so exalted a personage, and which the\r\nduchess and I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s saddle, and Don\r\nQuixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they\r\nplaced the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle. The\r\nduchess desired Sancho to come to her side, for she found infinite\r\nenjoyment in listening to his shrewd remarks. Sancho required no\r\npressing, but pushed himself in between them and the duke, who thought\r\nit rare good fortune to receive such a knight-errant and such a homely\r\nsquire in their castle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np30e.jpg (54K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.br/> WHICH TREATS OF MANY AND GREAT MATTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np31a.jpg (155K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupreme was the satisfaction that Sancho felt at seeing himself, as it\r\nseemed, an established favourite with the duchess, for he looked\r\nforward to finding in her castle what he had found in Don Diego\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nand in Basilio\xe2\x80\x99s; he was always fond of good living, and always seized\r\nby the forelock any opportunity of feasting himself whenever it\r\npresented itself. The history informs us, then, that before they\r\nreached the country house or castle, the duke went on in advance and\r\ninstructed all his servants how they were to treat Don Quixote; and so\r\nthe instant he came up to the castle gates with the duchess, two\r\nlackeys or equerries, clad in what they call morning gowns of fine\r\ncrimson satin reaching to their feet, hastened out, and catching Don\r\nQuixote in their arms before he saw or heard them, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nhighness should go and take my lady the duchess off her horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np31b.jpg (334K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote obeyed, and great bandying of compliments followed between\r\nthe two over the matter; but in the end the duchess\xe2\x80\x99s determination\r\ncarried the day, and she refused to get down or dismount from her\r\npalfrey except in the arms of the duke, saying she did not consider\r\nherself worthy to impose so unnecessary a burden on so great a knight.\r\nAt length the duke came out to take her down, and as they entered a\r\nspacious court two fair damsels came forward and threw over Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders a large mantle of the finest scarlet cloth, and at\r\nthe same instant all the galleries of the court were lined with the\r\nmen-servants and women-servants of the household, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome,\r\nflower and cream of knight-errantry!\xe2\x80\x9d while all or most of them flung\r\npellets filled with scented water over Don Quixote and the duke and\r\nduchess; at all which Don Quixote was greatly astonished, and this was\r\nthe first time that he thoroughly felt and believed himself to be a\r\nknight-errant in reality and not merely in fancy, now that he saw\r\nhimself treated in the same way as he had read of such knights being\r\ntreated in days of yore.\r\n\r\nSancho, deserting Dapple, hung on to the duchess and entered the\r\ncastle, but feeling some twinges of conscience at having left the ass\r\nalone, he approached a respectable duenna who had come out with the\r\nrest to receive the duchess, and in a low voice he said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1ora\r\nGonzalez, or however your grace may be called\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am called Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez de Grijalba,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the duenna; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is\r\nyour will, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d To which Sancho made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be glad if\r\nyour worship would do me the favour to go out to the castle gate, where\r\nyou will find a grey ass of mine; make them, if you please, put him in\r\nthe stable, or put him there yourself, for the poor little beast is\r\nrather easily frightened, and cannot bear being alone at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the master is as wise as the man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duenna, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have got a\r\nfine bargain. Be off with you, brother, and bad luck to you and him who\r\nbrought you here; go, look after your ass, for we, the duennas of this\r\nhouse, are not used to work of that sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, in troth,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard my master, who is\r\nthe very treasure-finder of stories, telling the story of Lancelot when\r\nhe came from Britain, say that ladies waited upon him and duennas upon\r\nhis hack; and, if it comes to my ass, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change him for Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nLancelot\xe2\x80\x99s hack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are a jester, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duenna, \xe2\x80\x9ckeep your drolleries\r\nfor some place where they\xe2\x80\x99ll pass muster and be paid for; for you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget nothing from me but a fig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, it will be a very ripe one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlose the trick in years by a point too little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSon of a bitch,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duenna, all aglow with anger, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nold or not, it\xe2\x80\x99s with God I have to reckon, not with you, you\r\ngarlic-stuffed scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d and she said it so loud, that the duchess\r\nheard it, and turning round and seeing the duenna in such a state of\r\nexcitement, and her eyes flaming so, asked whom she was wrangling with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith this good fellow here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duenna, \xe2\x80\x9cwho has particularly\r\nrequested me to go and put an ass of his that is at the castle gate\r\ninto the stable, holding it up to me as an example that they did the\r\nsame I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where\xe2\x80\x94that some ladies waited on one Lancelot, and\r\nduennas on his hack; and what is more, to wind up with, he called me\r\nold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have considered the greatest\r\naffront that could be offered me;\xe2\x80\x9d and addressing Sancho, she said to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must know, friend Sancho, that Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez is very\r\nyouthful, and that she wears that hood more for authority and custom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake than because of her years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay all the rest of mine be unlucky,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif I meant it that\r\nway; I only spoke because the affection I have for my ass is so great,\r\nand I thought I could not commend him to a more kind-hearted person\r\nthan the lady Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote, who was listening, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIs this proper\r\nconversation for the place, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cevery one must mention what he wants wherever\r\nhe may be; I thought of Dapple here, and I spoke of him here; if I had\r\nthought of him in the stable I would have spoken there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn which the duke observed, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho is quite right, and there is no\r\nreason at all to find fault with him; Dapple shall be fed to his\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s content, and Sancho may rest easy, for he shall be treated like\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation, amusing to all except Don Quixote, was\r\nproceeding, they ascended the staircase and ushered Don Quixote into a\r\nchamber hung with rich cloth of gold and brocade; six damsels relieved\r\nhim of his armour and waited on him like pages, all of them prepared\r\nand instructed by the duke and duchess as to what they were to do, and\r\nhow they were to treat Don Quixote, so that he might see and believe\r\nthey were treating him like a knight-errant. When his armour was\r\nremoved, there stood Don Quixote in his tight-fitting breeches and\r\nchamois doublet, lean, lanky, and long, with cheeks that seemed to be\r\nkissing each other inside; such a figure, that if the damsels waiting\r\non him had not taken care to check their merriment (which was one of\r\nthe particular directions their master and mistress had given them),\r\nthey would have burst with laughter. They asked him to let himself be\r\nstripped that they might put a shirt on him, but he would not on any\r\naccount, saying that modesty became knights-errant just as much as\r\nvalour. However, he said they might give the shirt to Sancho; and\r\nshutting himself in with him in a room where there was a sumptuous bed,\r\nhe undressed and put on the shirt; and then, finding himself alone with\r\nSancho, he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, thou new-fledged buffoon and old\r\nbooby, dost thou think it right to offend and insult a duenna so\r\ndeserving of reverence and respect as that one just now? Was that a\r\ntime to bethink thee of thy Dapple, or are these noble personages\r\nlikely to let the beasts fare badly when they treat their owners in\r\nsuch elegant style? For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Sancho, restrain thyself, and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshow the thread so as to let them see what a coarse, boorish texture\r\nthou art of. Remember, sinner that thou art, the master is the more\r\nesteemed the more respectable and well-bred his servants are; and that\r\none of the greatest advantages that princes have over other men is that\r\nthey have servants as good as themselves to wait on them. Dost thou not\r\nsee\xe2\x80\x94shortsighted being that thou art, and unlucky mortal that I\r\nam!\xe2\x80\x94that if they perceive thee to be a coarse clown or a dull\r\nblockhead, they will suspect me to be some impostor or swindler? Nay,\r\nnay, Sancho friend, keep clear, oh, keep clear of these\r\nstumbling-blocks; for he who falls into the way of being a chatterbox\r\nand droll, drops into a wretched buffoon the first time he trips;\r\nbridle thy tongue, consider and weigh thy words before they escape thy\r\nmouth, and bear in mind we are now in quarters whence, by God\xe2\x80\x99s help,\r\nand the strength of my arm, we shall come forth mightily advanced in\r\nfame and fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho promised him with much earnestness to keep his mouth shut, and\r\nto bite off his tongue before he uttered a word that was not altogether\r\nto the purpose and well considered, and told him he might make his mind\r\neasy on that point, for it should never be discovered through him what\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote dressed himself, put on his baldric with his sword, threw\r\nthe scarlet mantle over his shoulders, placed on his head a montera of\r\ngreen satin that the damsels had given him, and thus arrayed passed out\r\ninto the large room, where he found the damsels drawn up in double\r\nfile, the same number on each side, all with the appliances for washing\r\nthe hands, which they presented to him with profuse obeisances and\r\nceremonies. Then came twelve pages, together with the seneschal, to\r\nlead him to dinner, as his hosts were already waiting for him. They\r\nplaced him in the midst of them, and with much pomp and stateliness\r\nthey conducted him into another room, where there was a sumptuous table\r\nlaid with but four covers. The duchess and the duke came out to the\r\ndoor of the room to receive him, and with them a grave ecclesiastic,\r\none of those who rule noblemen\xe2\x80\x99s houses; one of those who, not being\r\nborn magnates themselves, never know how to teach those who are how to\r\nbehave as such; one of those who would have the greatness of great folk\r\nmeasured by their own narrowness of mind; one of those who, when they\r\ntry to introduce economy into the household they rule, lead it into\r\nmeanness. One of this sort, I say, must have been the grave churchman\r\nwho came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote.\r\n\r\nA vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking\r\nDon Quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The duke\r\npressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he\r\nrefused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to\r\naccept it.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and\r\nduchess those at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with\r\namazement at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious\r\npersons; and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed\r\nbetween the duke and Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at the\r\nhead of the table, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf your worship will give me leave I will\r\ntell you a story of what happened in my village about this matter of\r\nseats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he\r\nwas about to say something foolish. Sancho glanced at him, and guessing\r\nhis thoughts, said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of my going astray, se\xc3\xb1or, or\r\nsaying anything that won\xe2\x80\x99t be pat to the purpose; I haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten\r\nthe advice your worship gave me just now about talking much or little,\r\nwell or ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no recollection of anything, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9csay\r\nwhat thou wilt, only say it quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I am going to say is so true that my\r\nmaster Don Quixote, who is here present, will keep me from lying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLie as much as thou wilt for all I care, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor I am not going to stop thee, but consider what thou art going to\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have so considered and reconsidered,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the\r\nbell-ringer\xe2\x80\x99s in a safe berth; as will be seen by what follows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif your highnesses would order\r\nthem to turn out this idiot, for he will talk a heap of nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the life of the duke, Sancho shall not be taken away from me for a\r\nmoment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess; \xe2\x80\x9cI am very fond of him, for I know he is\r\nvery discreet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiscreet be the days of your holiness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the good\r\nopinion you have of my wit, though there\xe2\x80\x99s none in me; but the story I\r\nwant to tell is this. There was an invitation given by a gentleman of\r\nmy town, a very rich one, and one of quality, for he was one of the\r\nAlamos of Medina del Campo, and married to Do\xc3\xb1a Mencia de Qui\xc3\xb1ones, the\r\ndaughter of Don Alonso de Mara\xc3\xb1on, Knight of the Order of Santiago,\r\nthat was drowned at the Herradura\xe2\x80\x94him there was that quarrel about\r\nyears ago in our village, that my master Don Quixote was mixed up in,\r\nto the best of my belief, that Tomasillo the scapegrace, the son of\r\nBalbastro the smith, was wounded in.\xe2\x80\x94Isn\xe2\x80\x99t all this true, master mine?\r\nAs you live, say so, that these gentlefolk may not take me for some\r\nlying chatterer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ecclesiastic, \xe2\x80\x9cI take you to be more a chatterer\r\nthan a liar; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I shall take you for by-and-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou citest so many witnesses and proofs, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I have no choice but to say thou must be telling the truth; go\r\non, and cut the story short, for thou art taking the way not to make an\r\nend for two days to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not to cut it short,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess; \xe2\x80\x9con the contrary, for my\r\ngratification, he is to tell it as he knows it, though he should not\r\nfinish it these six days; and if he took so many they would be to me\r\nthe pleasantest I ever spent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, sirs, I say,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this same gentleman,\r\nwhom I know as well as I do my own hands, for it\xe2\x80\x99s not a bowshot from\r\nmy house to his, invited a poor but respectable labourer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet on, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the churchman; \xe2\x80\x9cat the rate you are going you\r\nwill not stop with your story short of the next world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stop less than half-way, please God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand so I say\r\nthis labourer, coming to the house of the gentleman I spoke of that\r\ninvited him\xe2\x80\x94rest his soul, he is now dead; and more by token he died\r\nthe death of an angel, so they say; for I was not there, for just at\r\nthat time I had gone to reap at Tembleque\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you live, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said the churchman, \xe2\x80\x9cmake haste back from\r\nTembleque, and finish your story without burying the gentleman, unless\r\nyou want to make more funerals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, it so happened,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat as the pair of them\r\nwere going to sit down to table\xe2\x80\x94and I think I can see them now plainer\r\nthan ever\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGreat was the enjoyment the duke and duchess derived from the\r\nirritation the worthy churchman showed at the long-winded, halting way\r\nSancho had of telling his story, while Don Quixote was chafing with\r\nrage and vexation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, as I was saying,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cas the pair of them were\r\ngoing to sit down to table, as I said, the labourer insisted upon the\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s taking the head of the table, and the gentleman insisted\r\nupon the labourer\xe2\x80\x99s taking it, as his orders should be obeyed in his\r\nhouse; but the labourer, who plumed himself on his politeness and good\r\nbreeding, would not on any account, until the gentleman, out of\r\npatience, putting his hands on his shoulders, compelled him by force to\r\nsit down, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Sit down, you stupid lout, for wherever I sit will\r\nbe the head to you; and that\xe2\x80\x99s the story, and, troth, I think it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen brought in amiss here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote turned all colours, which, on his sunburnt face, mottled it\r\ntill it looked like jasper. The duke and duchess suppressed their\r\nlaughter so as not altogether to mortify Don Quixote, for they saw\r\nthrough Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s impertinence; and to change the conversation, and keep\r\nSancho from uttering more absurdities, the duchess asked Don Quixote\r\nwhat news he had of the lady Dulcinea, and if he had sent her any\r\npresents of giants or miscreants lately, for he could not but have\r\nvanquished a good many.\r\n\r\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1ora, my misfortunes, though they had\r\na beginning, will never have an end. I have vanquished giants and I\r\nhave sent her caitiffs and miscreants; but where are they to find her\r\nif she is enchanted and turned into the most ill-favoured peasant wench\r\nthat can be imagined?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho Panza; \xe2\x80\x9cto me she seems the fairest\r\ncreature in the world; at any rate, in nimbleness and jumping she won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngive in to a tumbler; by my faith, se\xc3\xb1ora duchess, she leaps from the\r\nground on to the back of an ass like a cat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen her enchanted, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, seen her!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, who the devil was it but myself\r\nthat first thought of the enchantment business? She is as much\r\nenchanted as my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastic, when he heard them talking of giants and caitiffs and\r\nenchantments, began to suspect that this must be Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha, whose story the duke was always reading; and he had himself\r\noften reproved him for it, telling him it was foolish to read such\r\nfooleries; and becoming convinced that his suspicion was correct,\r\naddressing the duke, he said very angrily to him, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, your\r\nexcellence will have to give account to God for what this good man\r\ndoes. This Don Quixote, or Don Simpleton, or whatever his name is,\r\ncannot, I imagine, be such a blockhead as your excellence would have\r\nhim, holding out encouragement to him to go on with his vagaries and\r\nfollies.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning to address Don Quixote he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you,\r\nnum-skull, who put it into your head that you are a knight-errant, and\r\nvanquish giants and capture miscreants? Go your ways in a good hour,\r\nand in a good hour be it said to you. Go home and bring up your\r\nchildren if you have any, and attend to your business, and give over\r\ngoing wandering about the world, gaping and making a laughing-stock of\r\nyourself to all who know you and all who don\xe2\x80\x99t. Where, in heaven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname, have you discovered that there are or ever were knights-errant?\r\nWhere are there giants in Spain or miscreants in La Mancha, or\r\nenchanted Dulcineas, or all the rest of the silly things they tell\r\nabout you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote listened attentively to the reverend gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s words, and\r\nas soon as he perceived he had done speaking, regardless of the\r\npresence of the duke and duchess, he sprang to his feet with angry\r\nlooks and an agitated countenance, and said\xe2\x80\x94But the reply deserves a\r\nchapter to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np31e.jpg (46K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nOF THE REPLY DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS CENSURER, WITH OTHER INCIDENTS, GRAVE\r\nAND DROLL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np32a.jpg (152K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote, then, having risen to his feet, trembling from head to\r\nfoot like a man dosed with mercury, said in a hurried, agitated voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe place I am in, the presence in which I stand, and the respect I\r\nhave and always have had for the profession to which your worship\r\nbelongs, hold and bind the hands of my just indignation; and as well\r\nfor these reasons as because I know, as everyone knows, that a\r\ngownsman\xe2\x80\x99s weapon is the same as a woman\xe2\x80\x99s, the tongue, I will with\r\nmine engage in equal combat with your worship, from whom one might have\r\nexpected good advice instead of foul abuse. Pious, well-meant reproof\r\nrequires a different demeanour and arguments of another sort; at any\r\nrate, to have reproved me in public, and so roughly, exceeds the bounds\r\nof proper reproof, for that comes better with gentleness than with\r\nrudeness; and it is not seemly to call the sinner roundly blockhead and\r\nbooby, without knowing anything of the sin that is reproved. Come, tell\r\nme, for which of the stupidities you have observed in me do you condemn\r\nand abuse me, and bid me go home and look after my house and wife and\r\nchildren, without knowing whether I have any? Is nothing more needed\r\nthan to get a footing, by hook or by crook, in other people\xe2\x80\x99s houses to\r\nrule over the masters (and that, perhaps, after having been brought up\r\nin all the straitness of some seminary, and without having ever seen\r\nmore of the world than may lie within twenty or thirty leagues round),\r\nto fit one to lay down the law rashly for chivalry, and pass judgment\r\non knights-errant? Is it, haply, an idle occupation, or is the time\r\nill-spent that is spent in roaming the world in quest, not of its\r\nenjoyments, but of those arduous toils whereby the good mount upwards\r\nto the abodes of everlasting life? If gentlemen, great lords, nobles,\r\nmen of high birth, were to rate me as a fool I should take it as an\r\nirreparable insult; but I care not a farthing if clerks who have never\r\nentered upon or trod the paths of chivalry should think me foolish.\r\nKnight I am, and knight I will die, if such be the pleasure of the Most\r\nHigh. Some take the broad road of overweening ambition; others that of\r\nmean and servile flattery; others that of deceitful hypocrisy, and some\r\nthat of true religion; but I, led by my star, follow the narrow path of\r\nknight-errantry, and in pursuit of that calling I despise wealth, but\r\nnot honour. I have redressed injuries, righted wrongs, punished\r\ninsolences, vanquished giants, and crushed monsters; I am in love, for\r\nno other reason than that it is incumbent on knights-errant to be so;\r\nbut though I am, I am no carnal-minded lover, but one of the chaste,\r\nplatonic sort. My intentions are always directed to worthy ends, to do\r\ngood to all and evil to none; and if he who means this, does this, and\r\nmakes this his practice deserves to be called a fool, it is for your\r\nhighnesses to say, O most excellent duke and duchess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, by God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9csay no more in your own defence, master\r\nmine, for there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more in the world to be said, thought, or\r\ninsisted on; and besides, when this gentleman denies, as he has, that\r\nthere are or ever have been any knights-errant in the world, is it any\r\nwonder if he knows nothing of what he has been talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ecclesiastic, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are that Sancho Panza\r\nthat is mentioned, to whom your master has promised an island?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand what\xe2\x80\x99s more, I am one who deserves it as\r\nmuch as anyone; I am one of the sort\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Attach thyself to the good, and\r\nthou wilt be one of them,\xe2\x80\x99 and of those, \xe2\x80\x98Not with whom thou art bred,\r\nbut with whom thou art fed,\xe2\x80\x99 and of those, \xe2\x80\x98Who leans against a good\r\ntree, a good shade covers him;\xe2\x80\x99 I have leant upon a good master, and I\r\nhave been for months going about with him, and please God I shall be\r\njust such another; long life to him and long life to me, for neither\r\nwill he be in any want of empires to rule, or I of islands to govern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sancho my friend, certainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cfor in the name\r\nof Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote I confer upon you the government of one of no\r\nsmall importance that I have at my disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo down on thy knees, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand kiss the feet of\r\nhis excellence for the favour he has bestowed upon thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho obeyed, and on seeing this the ecclesiastic stood up from table\r\ncompletely out of temper, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cBy the gown I wear, I am almost\r\ninclined to say that your excellence is as great a fool as these\r\nsinners. No wonder they are mad, when people who are in their senses\r\nsanction their madness! I leave your excellence with them, for so long\r\nas they are in the house, I will remain in my own, and spare myself the\r\ntrouble of reproving what I cannot remedy;\xe2\x80\x9d and without uttering\r\nanother word, or eating another morsel, he went off, the entreaties of\r\nthe duke and duchess being entirely unavailing to stop him; not that\r\nthe duke said much to him, for he could not, because of the laughter\r\nhis uncalled-for anger provoked.\r\n\r\nWhen he had done laughing, he said to Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have replied on\r\nyour own behalf so stoutly, Sir Knight of the Lions, that there is no\r\noccasion to seek further satisfaction for this, which, though it may\r\nlook like an offence, is not so at all, for, as women can give no\r\noffence, no more can ecclesiastics, as you very well know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand the reason is, that he who is\r\nnot liable to offence cannot give offence to anyone. Women, children,\r\nand ecclesiastics, as they cannot defend themselves, though they may\r\nreceive offence cannot be insulted, because between the offence and the\r\ninsult there is, as your excellence very well knows, this difference:\r\nthe insult comes from one who is capable of offering it, and does so,\r\nand maintains it; the offence may come from any quarter without\r\ncarrying insult. To take an example: a man is standing unsuspectingly\r\nin the street and ten others come up armed and beat him; he draws his\r\nsword and quits himself like a man, but the number of his antagonists\r\nmakes it impossible for him to effect his purpose and avenge himself;\r\nthis man suffers an offence but not an insult. Another example will\r\nmake the same thing plain: a man is standing with his back turned,\r\nanother comes up and strikes him, and after striking him takes to\r\nflight, without waiting an instant, and the other pursues him but does\r\nnot overtake him; he who received the blow received an offence, but not\r\nan insult, because an insult must be maintained. If he who struck him,\r\nthough he did so sneakingly and treacherously, had drawn his sword and\r\nstood and faced him, then he who had been struck would have received\r\noffence and insult at the same time; offence because he was struck\r\ntreacherously, insult because he who struck him maintained what he had\r\ndone, standing his ground without taking to flight. And so, according\r\nto the laws of the accursed duel, I may have received offence, but not\r\ninsult, for neither women nor children can maintain it, nor can they\r\nwound, nor have they any way of standing their ground, and it is just\r\nthe same with those connected with religion; for these three sorts of\r\npersons are without arms offensive or defensive, and so, though\r\nnaturally they are bound to defend themselves, they have no right to\r\noffend anybody; and though I said just now I might have received\r\noffence, I say now certainly not, for he who cannot receive an insult\r\ncan still less give one; for which reasons I ought not to feel, nor do\r\nI feel, aggrieved at what that good man said to me; I only wish he had\r\nstayed a little longer, that I might have shown him the mistake he\r\nmakes in supposing and maintaining that there are not and never have\r\nbeen any knights-errant in the world; had Amadis or any of his\r\ncountless descendants heard him say as much, I am sure it would not\r\nhave gone well with his worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take my oath of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cthey would have given him\r\na slash that would have slit him down from top to toe like a\r\npomegranate or a ripe melon; they were likely fellows to put up with\r\njokes of that sort! By my faith, I\xe2\x80\x99m certain if Reinaldos of Montalvan\r\nhad heard the little man\xe2\x80\x99s words he would have given him such a spank\r\non the mouth that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spoken for the next three years; ay,\r\nlet him tackle them, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll see how he\xe2\x80\x99ll get out of their hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duchess, as she listened to Sancho, was ready to die with laughter,\r\nand in her own mind she set him down as droller and madder than his\r\nmaster; and there were a good many just then who were of the same\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote finally grew calm, and dinner came to an end, and as the\r\ncloth was removed four damsels came in, one of them with a silver\r\nbasin, another with a jug also of silver, a third with two fine white\r\ntowels on her shoulder, and the fourth with her arms bared to the\r\nelbows, and in her white hands (for white they certainly were) a round\r\nball of Naples soap. The one with the basin approached, and with arch\r\ncomposure and impudence, thrust it under Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s chin, who,\r\nwondering at such a ceremony, said never a word, supposing it to be the\r\ncustom of that country to wash beards instead of hands; he therefore\r\nstretched his out as far as he could, and at the same instant the jug\r\nbegan to pour and the damsel with the soap rubbed his beard briskly,\r\nraising snow-flakes, for the soap lather was no less white, not only\r\nover the beard, but all over the face, and over the eyes of the\r\nsubmissive knight, so that they were perforce obliged to keep shut. The\r\nduke and duchess, who had not known anything about this, waited to see\r\nwhat came of this strange washing. The barber damsel, when she had him\r\na hand\xe2\x80\x99s breadth deep in lather, pretended that there was no more\r\nwater, and bade the one with the jug go and fetch some, while Se\xc3\xb1or Don\r\nQuixote waited. She did so, and Don Quixote was left the strangest and\r\nmost ludicrous figure that could be imagined. All those present, and\r\nthere were a good many, were watching him, and as they saw him there\r\nwith half a yard of neck, and that uncommonly brown, his eyes shut, and\r\nhis beard full of soap, it was a great wonder, and only by great\r\ndiscretion, that they were able to restrain their laughter. The\r\ndamsels, the concocters of the joke, kept their eyes down, not daring\r\nto look at their master and mistress; and as for them, laughter and\r\nanger struggled within them, and they knew not what to do, whether to\r\npunish the audacity of the girls, or to reward them for the amusement\r\nthey had received from seeing Don Quixote in such a plight.\r\n\r\nAt length the damsel with the jug returned and they made an end of\r\nwashing Don Quixote, and the one who carried the towels very\r\ndeliberately wiped him and dried him; and all four together making him\r\na profound obeisance and curtsey, they were about to go, when the duke,\r\nlest Don Quixote should see through the joke, called out to the one\r\nwith the basin saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCome and wash me, and take care that there is\r\nwater enough.\xe2\x80\x9d The girl, sharp-witted and prompt, came and placed the\r\nbasin for the duke as she had done for Don Quixote, and they soon had\r\nhim well soaped and washed, and having wiped him dry they made their\r\nobeisance and retired. It appeared afterwards that the duke had sworn\r\nthat if they had not washed him as they had Don Quixote he would have\r\npunished them for their impudence, which they adroitly atoned for by\r\nsoaping him as well.\r\n\r\nSancho observed the ceremony of the washing very attentively, and said\r\nto himself, \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless me, if it were only the custom in this country\r\nto wash squires\xe2\x80\x99 beards too as well as knights\xe2\x80\x99. For by God and upon my\r\nsoul I want it badly; and if they gave me a scrape of the razor besides\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d take it as a still greater kindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you saying to yourself, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the duchess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was saying, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in the courts of other\r\nprinces, when the cloth is taken away, I have always heard say they\r\ngive water for the hands, but not lye for the beard; and that shows it\r\nis good to live long that you may see much; to be sure, they say too\r\nthat he who lives a long life must undergo much evil, though to undergo\r\na washing of that sort is pleasure rather than pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be uneasy, friend Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess; \xe2\x80\x9cI will take care\r\nthat my damsels wash you, and even put you in the tub if necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be content with the beard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cat any rate for the\r\npresent; and as for the future, God has decreed what is to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttend to worthy Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s request, seneschal,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ndo exactly what he wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe seneschal replied that Se\xc3\xb1or Sancho should be obeyed in everything;\r\nand with that he went away to dinner and took Sancho along with him,\r\nwhile the duke and duchess and Don Quixote remained at table discussing\r\na great variety of things, but all bearing on the calling of arms and\r\nknight-errantry.\r\n\r\nThe duchess begged Don Quixote, as he seemed to have a retentive\r\nmemory, to describe and portray to her the beauty and features of the\r\nlady Dulcinea del Toboso, for, judging by what fame trumpeted abroad of\r\nher beauty, she felt sure she must be the fairest creature in the\r\nworld, nay, in all La Mancha.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote sighed on hearing the duchess\xe2\x80\x99s request, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\ncould pluck out my heart, and lay it on a plate on this table here\r\nbefore your highness\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, it would spare my tongue the pain of\r\ntelling what can hardly be thought of, for in it your excellence would\r\nsee her portrayed in full. But why should I attempt to depict and\r\ndescribe in detail, and feature by feature, the beauty of the peerless\r\nDulcinea, the burden being one worthy of other shoulders than mine, an\r\nenterprise wherein the pencils of Parrhasius, Timantes, and Apelles,\r\nand the graver of Lysippus ought to be employed, to paint it in\r\npictures and carve it in marble and bronze, and Ciceronian and\r\nDemosthenian eloquence to sound its praises?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does Demosthenian mean, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote?\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nis a word I never heard in all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemosthenian eloquence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cmeans the eloquence of\r\nDemosthenes, as Ciceronian means that of Cicero, who were the two most\r\neloquent orators in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must have lost your wits to ask such a\r\nquestion. Nevertheless, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote would greatly gratify us if\r\nhe would depict her to us; for never fear, even in an outline or sketch\r\nshe will be something to make the fairest envious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would do so certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9chad she not been blurred\r\nto my mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye by the misfortune that fell upon her a short time\r\nsince, one of such a nature that I am more ready to weep over it than\r\nto describe it. For your highnesses must know that, going a few days\r\nback to kiss her hands and receive her benediction, approbation, and\r\npermission for this third sally, I found her altogether a different\r\nbeing from the one I sought; I found her enchanted and changed from a\r\nprincess into a peasant, from fair to foul, from an angel into a devil,\r\nfrom fragrant to pestiferous, from refined to clownish, from a\r\ndignified lady into a jumping tomboy, and, in a word, from Dulcinea del\r\nToboso into a coarse Sayago wench.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke aloud at this, \xe2\x80\x9cwho can have done the\r\nworld such an injury? Who can have robbed it of the beauty that\r\ngladdened it, of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modesty\r\nthat shed a lustre upon it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cwho could it be but some malignant\r\nenchanter of the many that persecute me out of envy\xe2\x80\x94that accursed race\r\nborn into the world to obscure and bring to naught the achievements of\r\nthe good, and glorify and exalt the deeds of the wicked? Enchanters\r\nhave persecuted me, enchanters persecute me still, and enchanters will\r\ncontinue to persecute me until they have sunk me and my lofty chivalry\r\nin the deep abyss of oblivion; and they injure and wound me where they\r\nknow I feel it most. For to deprive a knight-errant of his lady is to\r\ndeprive him of the eyes he sees with, of the sun that gives him light,\r\nof the food whereby he lives. Many a time before have I said it, and I\r\nsay it now once more, a knight-errant without a lady is like a tree\r\nwithout leaves, a building without a foundation, or a shadow without\r\nthe body that causes it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no denying it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess; \xe2\x80\x9cbut still, if we are to\r\nbelieve the history of Don Quixote that has come out here lately with\r\ngeneral applause, it is to be inferred from it, if I mistake not, that\r\nyou never saw the lady Dulcinea, and that the said lady is nothing in\r\nthe world but an imaginary lady, one that you yourself begot and gave\r\nbirth to in your brain, and adorned with whatever charms and\r\nperfections you chose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a good deal to be said on that point,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cGod\r\nknows whether there be any Dulcinea or not in the world, or whether she\r\nis imaginary or not imaginary; these are things the proof of which must\r\nnot be pushed to extreme lengths. I have not begotten nor given birth\r\nto my lady, though I behold her as she needs must be, a lady who\r\ncontains in herself all the qualities to make her famous throughout the\r\nworld, beautiful without blemish, dignified without haughtiness, tender\r\nand yet modest, gracious from courtesy and courteous from good\r\nbreeding, and lastly, of exalted lineage, because beauty shines forth\r\nand excels with a higher degree of perfection upon good blood than in\r\nthe fair of lowly birth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke; \xe2\x80\x9cbut Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote will give me\r\nleave to say what I am constrained to say by the story of his exploits\r\nthat I have read, from which it is to be inferred that, granting there\r\nis a Dulcinea in El Toboso, or out of it, and that she is in the\r\nhighest degree beautiful as you have described her to us, as regards\r\nthe loftiness of her lineage she is not on a par with the Orianas,\r\nAlastrajareas, Madasimas, or others of that sort, with whom, as you\r\nwell know, the histories abound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo that I may reply,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Dulcinea is the daughter\r\nof her own works, and that virtues rectify blood, and that lowly virtue\r\nis more to be regarded and esteemed than exalted vice. Dulcinea,\r\nbesides, has that within her that may raise her to be a crowned and\r\nsceptred queen; for the merit of a fair and virtuous woman is capable\r\nof performing greater miracles; and virtually, though not formally, she\r\nhas in herself higher fortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI protest, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in all you say,\r\nyou go most cautiously and lead in hand, as the saying is; henceforth I\r\nwill believe myself, and I will take care that everyone in my house\r\nbelieves, even my lord the duke if needs be, that there is a Dulcinea\r\nin El Toboso, and that she is living to-day, and that she is beautiful\r\nand nobly born and deserves to have such a knight as Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote\r\nin her service, and that is the highest praise that it is in my power\r\nto give her or that I can think of. But I cannot help entertaining a\r\ndoubt, and having a certain grudge against Sancho Panza; the doubt is\r\nthis, that the aforesaid history declares that the said Sancho Panza,\r\nwhen he carried a letter on your worship\xe2\x80\x99s behalf to the said lady\r\nDulcinea, found her sifting a sack of wheat; and more by token it says\r\nit was red wheat; a thing which makes me doubt the loftiness of her\r\nlineage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Don Quixote made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1ora, your highness must know that\r\neverything or almost everything that happens me transcends the ordinary\r\nlimits of what happens to other knights-errant; whether it be that it\r\nis directed by the inscrutable will of destiny, or by the malice of\r\nsome jealous enchanter. Now it is an established fact that all or most\r\nfamous knights-errant have some special gift, one that of being proof\r\nagainst enchantment, another that of being made of such invulnerable\r\nflesh that he cannot be wounded, as was the famous Roland, one of the\r\ntwelve peers of France, of whom it is related that he could not be\r\nwounded except in the sole of his left foot, and that it must be with\r\nthe point of a stout pin and not with any other sort of weapon\r\nwhatever; and so, when Bernardo del Carpio slew him at Roncesvalles,\r\nfinding that he could not wound him with steel, he lifted him up from\r\nthe ground in his arms and strangled him, calling to mind seasonably\r\nthe death which Hercules inflicted on Ant\xc3\xa6us, the fierce giant that\r\nthey say was the son of Terra. I would infer from what I have mentioned\r\nthat perhaps I may have some gift of this kind, not that of being\r\ninvulnerable, because experience has many times proved to me that I am\r\nof tender flesh and not at all impenetrable; nor that of being proof\r\nagainst enchantment, for I have already seen myself thrust into a cage,\r\nin which all the world would not have been able to confine me except by\r\nforce of enchantments. But as I delivered myself from that one, I am\r\ninclined to believe that there is no other that can hurt me; and so,\r\nthese enchanters, seeing that they cannot exert their vile craft\r\nagainst my person, revenge themselves on what I love most, and seek to\r\nrob me of life by maltreating that of Dulcinea in whom I live; and\r\ntherefore I am convinced that when my squire carried my message to her,\r\nthey changed her into a common peasant girl, engaged in such a mean\r\noccupation as sifting wheat; I have already said, however, that that\r\nwheat was not red wheat, nor wheat at all, but grains of orient pearl.\r\nAnd as a proof of all this, I must tell your highnesses that, coming to\r\nEl Toboso a short time back, I was altogether unable to discover the\r\npalace of Dulcinea; and that the next day, though Sancho, my squire,\r\nsaw her in her own proper shape, which is the fairest in the world, to\r\nme she appeared to be a coarse, ill-favoured farm-wench, and by no\r\nmeans a well-spoken one, she who is propriety itself. And so, as I am\r\nnot and, so far as one can judge, cannot be enchanted, she it is that\r\nis enchanted, that is smitten, that is altered, changed, and\r\ntransformed; in her have my enemies revenged themselves upon me, and\r\nfor her shall I live in ceaseless tears, until I see her in her\r\npristine state. I have mentioned this lest anybody should mind what\r\nSancho said about Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s winnowing or sifting; for, as they changed\r\nher to me, it is no wonder if they changed her to him. Dulcinea is\r\nillustrious and well-born, and of one of the gentle families of El\r\nToboso, which are many, ancient, and good. Therein, most assuredly, not\r\nsmall is the share of the peerless Dulcinea, through whom her town will\r\nbe famous and celebrated in ages to come, as Troy was through Helen,\r\nand Spain through La Cava, though with a better title and tradition.\r\nFor another thing; I would have your graces understand that Sancho\r\nPanza is one of the drollest squires that ever served knight-errant;\r\nsometimes there is a simplicity about him so acute that it is an\r\namusement to try and make out whether he is simple or sharp; he has\r\nmischievous tricks that stamp him rogue, and blundering ways that prove\r\nhim a booby; he doubts everything and believes everything; when I fancy\r\nhe is on the point of coming down headlong from sheer stupidity, he\r\ncomes out with something shrewd that sends him up to the skies. After\r\nall, I would not exchange him for another squire, though I were given a\r\ncity to boot, and therefore I am in doubt whether it will be well to\r\nsend him to the government your highness has bestowed upon him; though\r\nI perceive in him a certain aptitude for the work of governing, so\r\nthat, with a little trimming of his understanding, he would manage any\r\ngovernment as easily as the king does his taxes; and moreover, we know\r\nalready ample experience that it does not require much cleverness or\r\nmuch learning to be a governor, for there are a hundred round about us\r\nthat scarcely know how to read, and govern like gerfalcons. The main\r\npoint is that they should have good intentions and be desirous of doing\r\nright in all things, for they will never be at a loss for persons to\r\nadvise and direct them in what they have to do, like those\r\nknight-governors who, being no lawyers, pronounce sentences with the\r\naid of an assessor. My advice to him will be to take no bribe and\r\nsurrender no right, and I have some other little matters in reserve,\r\nthat shall be produced in due season for Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s benefit and the\r\nadvantage of the island he is to govern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke, duchess, and Don Quixote had reached this point in their\r\nconversation, when they heard voices and a great hubbub in the palace,\r\nand Sancho burst abruptly into the room all glowing with anger, with a\r\nstraining-cloth by way of a bib, and followed by several servants, or,\r\nmore properly speaking, kitchen-boys and other underlings, one of whom\r\ncarried a small trough full of water, that from its colour and impurity\r\nwas plainly dishwater. The one with the trough pursued him and followed\r\nhim everywhere he went, endeavouring with the utmost persistence to\r\nthrust it under his chin, while another kitchen-boy seemed anxious to\r\nwash his beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is all this, brothers?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the duchess. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What do\r\nyou want to do to this good man? Do you forget he is a governor-elect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which the barber kitchen-boy replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman will not let\r\nhimself be washed as is customary, and as my lord and the se\xc3\xb1or his\r\nmaster have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, in a great rage; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99d like it to be\r\nwith cleaner towels, clearer lye, and not such dirty hands; for there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot so much difference between me and my master that he should be\r\nwashed with angels\xe2\x80\x99 water and I with devil\xe2\x80\x99s lye. The customs of\r\ncountries and princes\xe2\x80\x99 palaces are only good so long as they give no\r\nannoyance; but the way of washing they have here is worse than doing\r\npenance. I have a clean beard, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t require to be refreshed in\r\nthat fashion, and whoever comes to wash me or touch a hair of my head,\r\nI mean to say my beard, with all due respect be it said, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him\r\na punch that will leave my fist sunk in his skull; for cirimonies and\r\nsoapings of this sort are more like jokes than the polite attentions of\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s host.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duchess was ready to die with laughter when she saw Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s rage\r\nand heard his words; but it was no pleasure to Don Quixote to see him\r\nin such a sorry trim, with the dingy towel about him, and the\r\nhangers-on of the kitchen all round him; so making a low bow to the\r\nduke and duchess, as if to ask their permission to speak, he addressed\r\nthe rout in a dignified tone: \xe2\x80\x9cHolloa, gentlemen! you let that youth\r\nalone, and go back to where you came from, or anywhere else if you\r\nlike; my squire is as clean as any other person, and those troughs are\r\nas bad as narrow thin-necked jars to him; take my advice and leave him\r\nalone, for neither he nor I understand joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho took the word out of his mouth and went on, \xe2\x80\x9cNay, let them come\r\nand try their jokes on the country bumpkin, for it\xe2\x80\x99s about as likely\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll stand them as that it\xe2\x80\x99s now midnight! Let them bring me a comb\r\nhere, or what they please, and curry this beard of mine, and if they\r\nget anything out of it that offends against cleanliness, let them clip\r\nme to the skin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon this, the duchess, laughing all the while, said, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho Panza is\r\nright, and always will be in all he says; he is clean, and, as he says\r\nhimself, he does not require to be washed; and if our ways do not\r\nplease him, he is free to choose. Besides, you promoters of cleanliness\r\nhave been excessively careless and thoughtless, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I ought\r\nnot to say audacious, to bring troughs and wooden utensils and kitchen\r\ndishclouts, instead of basins and jugs of pure gold and towels of\r\nholland, to such a person and such a beard; but, after all, you are\r\nill-conditioned and ill-bred, and spiteful as you are, you cannot help\r\nshowing the grudge you have against the squires of knights-errant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe impudent servitors, and even the seneschal who came with them, took\r\nthe duchess to be speaking in earnest, so they removed the\r\nstraining-cloth from Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and with something like shame and\r\nconfusion of face went off all of them and left him; whereupon he,\r\nseeing himself safe out of that extreme danger, as it seemed to him,\r\nran and fell on his knees before the duchess, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom great\r\nladies great favours may be looked for; this which your grace has done\r\nme to-day cannot be requited with less than wishing I was dubbed a\r\nknight-errant, to devote myself all the days of my life to the service\r\nof so exalted a lady. I am a labouring man, my name is Sancho Panza, I\r\nam married, I have children, and I am serving as a squire; if in any\r\none of these ways I can serve your highness, I will not be longer in\r\nobeying than your grace in commanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is easy to see, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have\r\nlearned to be polite in the school of politeness itself; I mean to say\r\nit is easy to see that you have been nursed in the bosom of Se\xc3\xb1or Don\r\nQuixote, who is, of course, the cream of good breeding and flower of\r\nceremony\xe2\x80\x94or cirimony, as you would say yourself. Fair be the fortunes\r\nof such a master and such a servant, the one the cynosure of\r\nknight-errantry, the other the star of squirely fidelity! Rise, Sancho,\r\nmy friend; I will repay your courtesy by taking care that my lord the\r\nduke makes good to you the promised gift of the government as soon as\r\npossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this, the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote retired to\r\ntake his midday sleep; but the duchess begged Sancho, unless he had a\r\nvery great desire to go to sleep, to come and spend the afternoon with\r\nher and her damsels in a very cool chamber. Sancho replied that, though\r\nhe certainly had the habit of sleeping four or five hours in the heat\r\nof the day in summer, to serve her excellence he would try with all his\r\nmight not to sleep even one that day, and that he would come in\r\nobedience to her command, and with that he went off. The duke gave\r\nfresh orders with respect to treating Don Quixote as a knight-errant,\r\nwithout departing even in smallest particular from the style in which,\r\nas the stories tell us, they used to treat the knights of old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np32e.jpg (16K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nOF THE DELECTABLE DISCOURSE WHICH THE DUCHESS AND HER DAMSELS HELD WITH\r\nSANCHO PANZA, WELL WORTH READING AND NOTING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np33a.jpg (138K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history records that Sancho did not sleep that afternoon, but in\r\norder to keep his word came, before he had well done dinner, to visit\r\nthe duchess, who, finding enjoyment in listening to him, made him sit\r\ndown beside her on a low seat, though Sancho, out of pure good\r\nbreeding, wanted not to sit down; the duchess, however, told him he was\r\nto sit down as governor and talk as squire, as in both respects he was\r\nworthy of even the chair of the Cid Ruy Diaz the Campeador. Sancho\r\nshrugged his shoulders, obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndamsels and duennas gathered round him, waiting in profound silence to\r\nhear what he would say. It was the duchess, however, who spoke first,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear us, I\r\nshould be glad if the se\xc3\xb1or governor would relieve me of certain doubts\r\nI have, rising out of the history of the great Don Quixote that is now\r\nin print. One is: inasmuch as worthy Sancho never saw Dulcinea, I mean\r\nthe lady Dulcinea del Toboso, nor took Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s letter to her, for\r\nit was left in the memorandum book in the Sierra Morena, how did he\r\ndare to invent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat,\r\nthe whole story being a deception and falsehood, and so much to the\r\nprejudice of the peerless Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s good name, a thing that is not at\r\nall becoming the character and fidelity of a good squire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np33b.jpg (326K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt these words, Sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up from his\r\nchair, and with noiseless steps, with his body bent and his finger on\r\nhis lips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings; and this\r\ndone, he came back to his seat and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, se\xc3\xb1ora, that I have seen\r\nthat there is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly,\r\nI will answer what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without\r\nfear or dread. And the first thing I have got to say is, that for my\r\nown part I hold my master Don Quixote to be stark mad, though sometimes\r\nhe says things that, to my mind, and indeed everybody\xe2\x80\x99s that listens to\r\nhim, are so wise, and run in such a straight furrow, that Satan himself\r\ncould not have said them better; but for all that, really, and beyond\r\nall question, it\xe2\x80\x99s my firm belief he is cracked. Well, then, as this is\r\nclear to my mind, I can venture to make him believe things that have\r\nneither head nor tail, like that affair of the answer to the letter,\r\nand that other of six or eight days ago, which is not yet in history,\r\nthat is to say, the affair of the enchantment of my lady Dulcinea; for\r\nI made him believe she is enchanted, though there\xe2\x80\x99s no more truth in it\r\nthan over the hills of \xc3\x9abeda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or deception,\r\nso Sancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened, and his\r\nhearers were not a little amused by it; and then resuming, the duchess\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIn consequence of what worthy Sancho has told me, a doubt starts\r\nup in my mind, and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If Don Quixote be mad, crazy, and cracked, and Sancho Panza his squire\r\nknows it, and, notwithstanding, serves and follows him, and goes\r\ntrusting to his empty promises, there can be no doubt he must be still\r\nmadder and sillier than his master; and that being so, it will be cast\r\nin your teeth, se\xc3\xb1ora duchess, if you give the said Sancho an island to\r\ngovern; for how will he who does not know how to govern himself know\r\nhow to govern others?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that doubt comes timely; but your\r\ngrace may say it out, and speak plainly, or as you like; for I know\r\nwhat you say is true, and if I were wise I should have left my master\r\nlong ago; but this was my fate, this was my bad luck; I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\r\nI must follow him; we\xe2\x80\x99re from the same village, I\xe2\x80\x99ve eaten his bread,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m fond of him, I\xe2\x80\x99m grateful, he gave me his ass-colts, and above all\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m faithful; so it\xe2\x80\x99s quite impossible for anything to separate us,\r\nexcept the pickaxe and shovel. And if your highness does not like to\r\ngive me the government you promised, God made me without it, and maybe\r\nyour not giving it to me will be all the better for my conscience, for\r\nfool as I am I know the proverb \xe2\x80\x98to her hurt the ant got wings,\xe2\x80\x99 and it\r\nmay be that Sancho the squire will get to heaven sooner than Sancho the\r\ngovernor. \xe2\x80\x98They make as good bread here as in France,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98by night\r\nall cats are grey,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98a hard case enough his, who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t broken his\r\nfast at two in the afternoon,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s no stomach a hand\xe2\x80\x99s breadth\r\nbigger than another,\xe2\x80\x99 and the same can be filled \xe2\x80\x98with straw or hay,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nas the saying is, and \xe2\x80\x98the little birds of the field have God for their\r\npurveyor and caterer,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98four yards of Cuenca frieze keep one warmer\r\nthan four of Segovia broad-cloth,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98when we quit this world and are\r\nput underground the prince travels by as narrow a path as the\r\njourneyman,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s body does not take up more feet of earth\r\nthan the sacristan\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 for all that the one is higher than the other;\r\nfor when we go to our graves we all pack ourselves up and make\r\nourselves small, or rather they pack us up and make us small in spite\r\nof us, and then\xe2\x80\x94good night to us. And I say once more, if your ladyship\r\ndoes not like to give me the island because I\xe2\x80\x99m a fool, like a wise man\r\nI will take care to give myself no trouble about it; I have heard say\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x98behind the cross there\xe2\x80\x99s the devil,\xe2\x80\x99 and that \xe2\x80\x98all that glitters\r\nis not gold,\xe2\x80\x99 and that from among the oxen, and the ploughs, and the\r\nyokes, Wamba the husbandman was taken to be made King of Spain, and\r\nfrom among brocades, and pleasures, and riches, Roderick was taken to\r\nbe devoured by adders, if the verses of the old ballads don\xe2\x80\x99t lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t lie!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez, the duenna, who\r\nwas one of the listeners. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s a ballad that says they put\r\nKing Rodrigo alive into a tomb full of toads, and adders, and lizards,\r\nand that two days afterwards the king, in a plaintive, feeble voice,\r\ncried out from within the tomb-\r\n\r\nThey gnaw me now, they gnaw me now,\r\nThere where I most did sin.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd according to that the gentleman has good reason to say he would\r\nrather be a labouring man than a king, if vermin are to eat him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duchess could not help laughing at the simplicity of her duenna, or\r\nwondering at the language and proverbs of Sancho, to whom she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorthy Sancho knows very well that when once a knight has made a\r\npromise he strives to keep it, though it should cost him his life. My\r\nlord and husband the duke, though not one of the errant sort, is none\r\nthe less a knight for that reason, and will keep his word about the\r\npromised island, in spite of the envy and malice of the world. Let\r\nSancho be of good cheer; for when he least expects it he will find\r\nhimself seated on the throne of his island and seat of dignity, and\r\nwill take possession of his government that he may discard it for\r\nanother of three-bordered brocade. The charge I give him is to be\r\ncareful how he governs his vassals, bearing in mind that they are all\r\nloyal and well-born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to governing them well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no need of charging\r\nme to do that, for I\xe2\x80\x99m kind-hearted by nature, and full of compassion\r\nfor the poor; there\xe2\x80\x99s no stealing the loaf from him who kneads and\r\nbakes;\xe2\x80\x99 and by my faith it won\xe2\x80\x99t do to throw false dice with me; I am\r\nan old dog, and I know all about \xe2\x80\x98tus, tus;\xe2\x80\x99 I can be wide-awake if\r\nneed be, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t let clouds come before my eyes, for I know where\r\nthe shoe pinches me; I say so, because with me the good will have\r\nsupport and protection, and the bad neither footing nor access. And it\r\nseems to me that, in governments, to make a beginning is everything;\r\nand maybe, after having been governor a fortnight, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take kindly to\r\nthe work and know more about it than the field labour I have been\r\nbrought up to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cfor no one is born ready\r\ntaught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones. But\r\nto return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment\r\nof the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more\r\nthan evident, that Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s idea of practising a deception upon his\r\nmaster, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that\r\nif he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was\r\nall a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For\r\nin truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse\r\ncountry wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso,\r\nand that worthy Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the\r\none that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the\r\ntruth of this, than of anything else we never saw. Se\xc3\xb1or Sancho Panza\r\nmust know that we too have enchanters here that are well disposed to\r\nus, and tell us what goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly,\r\nwithout subterfuge or deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile\r\ncountry lass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted\r\nas the mother that bore her; and when we least expect it, we shall see\r\nher in her own proper form, and then Sancho will be disabused of the\r\nerror he is under at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that\xe2\x80\x99s very possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho Panza; \xe2\x80\x9cand now I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to\r\nbelieve what my master says about what he saw in the cave of\r\nMontesinos, where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in the\r\nvery same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I\r\nenchanted her all to please myself. It must be all exactly the other\r\nway, as your ladyship says; because it is impossible to suppose that\r\nout of my poor wit such a cunning trick could be concocted in a moment,\r\nnor do I think my master is so mad that by my weak and feeble\r\npersuasion he could be made to believe a thing so out of all reason.\r\nBut, se\xc3\xb1ora, your excellence must not therefore think me ill-disposed,\r\nfor a dolt like me is not bound to see into the thoughts and plots of\r\nthose vile enchanters. I invented all that to escape my master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nscolding, and not with any intention of hurting him; and if it has\r\nturned out differently, there is a God in heaven who judges our\r\nhearts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess; \xe2\x80\x9cbut tell me, Sancho, what is this\r\nyou say about the cave of Montesinos, for I should like to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho upon this related to her, word for word, what has been said\r\nalready touching that adventure, and having heard it the duchess said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom this occurrence it may be inferred that, as the great Don Quixote\r\nsays he saw there the same country wench Sancho saw on the way from El\r\nToboso, it is, no doubt, Dulcinea, and that there are some very active\r\nand exceedingly busy enchanters about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand if my lady Dulcinea is enchanted, so much\r\nthe worse for her, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to pick a quarrel with my master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenemies, who seem to be many and spiteful. The truth is that the one I\r\nsaw was a country wench, and I set her down to be a country wench; and\r\nif that was Dulcinea it must not be laid at my door, nor should I be\r\ncalled to answer for it or take the consequences. But they must go\r\nnagging at me at every step\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Sancho said it, Sancho did it, Sancho\r\nhere, Sancho there,\xe2\x80\x99 as if Sancho was nobody at all, and not that same\r\nSancho Panza that\xe2\x80\x99s now going all over the world in books, so Samson\r\nCarrasco told me, and he\xe2\x80\x99s at any rate one that\xe2\x80\x99s a bachelor of\r\nSalamanca; and people of that sort can\xe2\x80\x99t lie, except when the whim\r\nseizes them or they have some very good reason for it. So there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\noccasion for anybody to quarrel with me; and then I have a good\r\ncharacter, and, as I have heard my master say, \xe2\x80\x98a good name is better\r\nthan great riches;\xe2\x80\x99 let them only stick me into this government and\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll see wonders, for one who has been a good squire will be a good\r\ngovernor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll worthy Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s observations,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9care Catonian\r\nsentences, or at any rate out of the very heart of Michael Verino\r\nhimself, who _florentibus occidit annis_. In fact, to speak in his own\r\nstyle, \xe2\x80\x98under a bad cloak there\xe2\x80\x99s often a good drinker.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI never yet drank out of wickedness;\r\nfrom thirst I have very likely, for I have nothing of the hypocrite in\r\nme; I drink when I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined, or, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not inclined, when they offer\r\nit to me, so as not to look either strait-laced or ill-bred; for when a\r\nfriend drinks one\xe2\x80\x99s health what heart can be so hard as not to return\r\nit? But if I put on my shoes I don\xe2\x80\x99t dirty them; besides, squires to\r\nknights-errant mostly drink water, for they are always wandering among\r\nwoods, forests and meadows, mountains and crags, without a drop of wine\r\nto be had if they gave their eyes for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess; \xe2\x80\x9cand now let Sancho go and take his\r\nsleep, and we will talk by-and-by at greater length, and settle how he\r\nmay soon go and stick himself into the government, as he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho once more kissed the duchess\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and entreated her to let\r\ngood care be taken of his Dapple, for he was the light of his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is Dapple?\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy ass,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich, not to mention him by that name, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\naccustomed to call Dapple; I begged this lady duenna here to take care\r\nof him when I came into the castle, and she got as angry as if I had\r\nsaid she was ugly or old, though it ought to be more natural and proper\r\nfor duennas to feed asses than to ornament chambers. God bless me! what\r\na spite a gentleman of my village had against these ladies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have been some clown,\xe2\x80\x9d said Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez the duenna; \xe2\x80\x9cfor if\r\nhe had been a gentleman and well-born he would have exalted them higher\r\nthan the horns of the moon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess; \xe2\x80\x9cno more of this; hush, Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nRodriguez, and let Se\xc3\xb1or Panza rest easy and leave the treatment of\r\nDapple in my charge, for as he is a treasure of Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put him\r\non the apple of my eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be enough for him to be in the stable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nneither he nor I are worthy to rest a moment in the apple of your\r\nhighness\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and I\xe2\x80\x99d as soon stab myself as consent to it; for\r\nthough my master says that in civilities it is better to lose by a card\r\ntoo many than a card too few, when it comes to civilities to asses we\r\nmust mind what we are about and keep within due bounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake him to your government, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cand there you\r\nwill be able to make as much of him as you like, and even release him\r\nfrom work and pension him off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think, se\xc3\xb1ora duchess, that you have said anything absurd,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen more than two asses go to governments, and for me\r\nto take mine with me would be nothing new.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho\xe2\x80\x99s words made the duchess laugh again and gave her fresh\r\namusement, and dismissing him to sleep she went away to tell the duke\r\nthe conversation she had had with him, and between them they plotted\r\nand arranged to play a joke upon Don Quixote that was to be a rare one\r\nand entirely in knight-errantry style, and in that same style they\r\npractised several upon him, so much in keeping and so clever that they\r\nform the best adventures this great history contains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np33e.jpg (34K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nWHICH RELATES HOW THEY LEARNED THE WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE TO DISENCHANT\r\nTHE PEERLESS DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO, WHICH IS ONE OF THE RAREST ADVENTURES\r\nIN THIS BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np34a.jpg (141K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat was the pleasure the duke and duchess took in the conversation of\r\nDon Quixote and Sancho Panza; and, more bent than ever upon the plan\r\nthey had of practising some jokes upon them that should have the look\r\nand appearance of adventures, they took as their basis of action what\r\nDon Quixote had already told them about the cave of Montesinos, in\r\norder to play him a famous one. But what the duchess marvelled at above\r\nall was that Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s simplicity could be so great as to make him\r\nbelieve as absolute truth that Dulcinea had been enchanted, when it was\r\nhe himself who had been the enchanter and trickster in the business.\r\nHaving, therefore, instructed their servants in everything they were to\r\ndo, six days afterwards they took him out to hunt, with as great a\r\nretinue of huntsmen and beaters as a crowned king.\r\n\r\nThey presented Don Quixote with a hunting suit, and Sancho with another\r\nof the finest green cloth; but Don Quixote declined to put his on,\r\nsaying that he must soon return to the hard pursuit of arms, and could\r\nnot carry wardrobes or stores with him. Sancho, however, took what they\r\ngave him, meaning to sell it at the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe appointed day having arrived, Don Quixote armed himself, and Sancho\r\narrayed himself, and mounted on his Dapple (for he would not give him\r\nup though they offered him a horse), he placed himself in the midst of\r\nthe troop of huntsmen. The duchess came out splendidly attired, and Don\r\nQuixote, in pure courtesy and politeness, held the rein of her palfrey,\r\nthough the duke wanted not to allow him; and at last they reached a\r\nwood that lay between two high mountains, where, after occupying\r\nvarious posts, ambushes, and paths, and distributing the party in\r\ndifferent positions, the hunt began with great noise, shouting, and\r\nhallooing, so that, between the baying of the hounds and the blowing of\r\nthe horns, they could not hear one another. The duchess dismounted, and\r\nwith a sharp boar-spear in her hand posted herself where she knew the\r\nwild boars were in the habit of passing. The duke and Don Quixote\r\nlikewise dismounted and placed themselves one at each side of her.\r\nSancho took up a position in the rear of all without dismounting from\r\nDapple, whom he dared not desert lest some mischief should befall him.\r\nScarcely had they taken their stand in a line with several of their\r\nservants, when they saw a huge boar, closely pressed by the hounds and\r\nfollowed by the huntsmen, making towards them, grinding his teeth and\r\ntusks, and scattering foam from his mouth. As soon as he saw him Don\r\nQuixote, bracing his shield on his arm, and drawing his sword, advanced\r\nto meet him; the duke with boar-spear did the same; but the duchess\r\nwould have gone in front of them all had not the duke prevented her.\r\nSancho alone, deserting Dapple at the sight of the mighty beast, took\r\nto his heels as hard as he could and strove in vain to mount a tall\r\noak. As he was clinging to a branch, however, half-way up in his\r\nstruggle to reach the top, the bough, such was his ill-luck and hard\r\nfate, gave way, and caught in his fall by a broken limb of the oak, he\r\nhung suspended in the air unable to reach the ground. Finding himself\r\nin this position, and that the green coat was beginning to tear, and\r\nreflecting that if the fierce animal came that way he might be able to\r\nget at him, he began to utter such cries, and call for help so\r\nearnestly, that all who heard him and did not see him felt sure he must\r\nbe in the teeth of some wild beast. In the end the tusked boar fell\r\npierced by the blades of the many spears they held in front of him; and\r\nDon Quixote, turning round at the cries of Sancho, for he knew by them\r\nthat it was he, saw him hanging from the oak head downwards, with\r\nDapple, who did not forsake him in his distress, close beside him; and\r\nCide Hamete observes that he seldom saw Sancho Panza without seeing\r\nDapple, or Dapple without seeing Sancho Panza; such was their\r\nattachment and loyalty one to the other. Don Quixote went over and\r\nunhooked Sancho, who, as soon as he found himself on the ground, looked\r\nat the rent in his huntingcoat and was grieved to the heart, for he\r\nthought he had got a patrimonial estate in that suit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they had slung the mighty boar across the back of a mule, and\r\nhaving covered it with sprigs of rosemary and branches of myrtle, they\r\nbore it away as the spoils of victory to some large field-tents which\r\nhad been pitched in the middle of the wood, where they found the tables\r\nlaid and dinner served, in such grand and sumptuous style that it was\r\neasy to see the rank and magnificence of those who had provided it.\r\nSancho, as he showed the rents in his torn suit to the duchess,\r\nobserved, \xe2\x80\x9cIf we had been hunting hares, or after small birds, my coat\r\nwould have been safe from being in the plight it\xe2\x80\x99s in; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat pleasure one can find in lying in wait for an animal that may take\r\nyour life with his tusk if he gets at you. I recollect having heard an\r\nold ballad sung that says,\r\n\r\nBy bears be thou devoured, as erst\r\nWas famous Favila.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwas a Gothic king, who, going a-hunting, was\r\ndevoured by a bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand I would not have kings and princes expose\r\nthemselves to such dangers for the sake of a pleasure which, to my\r\nmind, ought not to be one, as it consists in killing an animal that has\r\ndone no harm whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite the contrary, Sancho; you are wrong there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke; \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nhunting is more suitable and requisite for kings and princes than for\r\nanybody else. The chase is the emblem of war; it has stratagems, wiles,\r\nand crafty devices for overcoming the enemy in safety; in it extreme\r\ncold and intolerable heat have to be borne, indolence and sleep are\r\ndespised, the bodily powers are invigorated, the limbs of him who\r\nengages in it are made supple, and, in a word, it is a pursuit which\r\nmay be followed without injury to anyone and with enjoyment to many;\r\nand the best of it is, it is not for everybody, as field-sports of\r\nother sorts are, except hawking, which also is only for kings and great\r\nlords. Reconsider your opinion therefore, Sancho, and when you are\r\ngovernor take to hunting, and you will find the good of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthe good governor should have a broken leg and\r\nkeep at home;\xe2\x80\x9d it would be a nice thing if, after people had been at\r\nthe trouble of coming to look for him on business, the governor were to\r\nbe away in the forest enjoying himself; the government would go on\r\nbadly in that fashion. By my faith, se\xc3\xb1or, hunting and amusements are\r\nmore fit for idlers than for governors; what I intend to amuse myself\r\nwith is playing all fours at Eastertime, and bowls on Sundays and\r\nholidays; for these huntings don\xe2\x80\x99t suit my condition or agree with my\r\nconscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant it may turn out so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s a long\r\nstep from saying to doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe that as it may,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98pledges don\xe2\x80\x99t distress a good\r\npayer,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98he whom God helps does better than he who gets up early,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s the tripes that carry the feet and not the feet the tripes;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI mean to say that if God gives me help and I do my duty honestly, no\r\ndoubt I\xe2\x80\x99ll govern better than a gerfalcon. Nay, let them only put a\r\nfinger in my mouth, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll see whether I can bite or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe curse of God and all his saints upon thee, thou accursed Sancho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen will the day come\xe2\x80\x94as I have often said to\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x94when I shall hear thee make one single coherent, rational remark\r\nwithout proverbs? Pray, your highnesses, leave this fool alone, for he\r\nwill grind your souls between, not to say two, but two thousand\r\nproverbs, dragged in as much in season, and as much to the purpose\r\nas\xe2\x80\x94may God grant as much health to him, or to me if I want to listen to\r\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s proverbs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cthough more in number\r\nthan the Greek Commander\xe2\x80\x99s, are not therefore less to be esteemed for\r\nthe conciseness of the maxims. For my own part, I can say they give me\r\nmore pleasure than others that may be better brought in and more\r\nseasonably introduced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn pleasant conversation of this sort they passed out of the tent into\r\nthe wood, and the day was spent in visiting some of the posts and\r\nhiding-places, and then night closed in, not, however, as brilliantly\r\nor tranquilly as might have been expected at the season, for it was\r\nthen midsummer; but bringing with it a kind of haze that greatly aided\r\nthe project of the duke and duchess; and thus, as night began to fall,\r\nand a little after twilight set in, suddenly the whole wood on all four\r\nsides seemed to be on fire, and shortly after, here, there, on all\r\nsides, a vast number of trumpets and other military instruments were\r\nheard, as if several troops of cavalry were passing through the wood.\r\nThe blaze of the fire and the noise of the warlike instruments almost\r\nblinded the eyes and deafened the ears of those that stood by, and\r\nindeed of all who were in the wood. Then there were heard repeated\r\nlelilies after the fashion of the Moors when they rush to battle;\r\ntrumpets and clarions brayed, drums beat, fifes played, so unceasingly\r\nand so fast that he could not have had any senses who did not lose them\r\nwith the confused din of so many instruments. The duke was astounded,\r\nthe duchess amazed, Don Quixote wondering, Sancho Panza trembling, and\r\nindeed, even they who were aware of the cause were frightened. In their\r\nfear, silence fell upon them, and a postillion, in the guise of a\r\ndemon, passed in front of them, blowing, in lieu of a bugle, a huge\r\nhollow horn that gave out a horrible hoarse note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo there! brother courier,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cwho are you? Where are\r\nyou going? What troops are these that seem to be passing through the\r\nwood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which the courier replied in a harsh, discordant voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI am the\r\ndevil; I am in search of Don Quixote of La Mancha; those who are coming\r\nthis way are six troops of enchanters, who are bringing on a triumphal\r\ncar the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso; she comes under enchantment,\r\ntogether with the gallant Frenchman Montesinos, to give instructions to\r\nDon Quixote as to how, she the said lady, may be disenchanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were the devil, as you say and as your appearance indicates,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would have known the said knight Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha, for you have him here before you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God and upon my conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d said the devil, \xe2\x80\x9cI never observed it,\r\nfor my mind is occupied with so many different things that I was\r\nforgetting the main thing I came about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis demon must be an honest fellow and a good Christian,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t swear by God and his conscience;\r\nI feel sure now there must be good souls even in hell itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout dismounting, the demon then turned to Don Quixote and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe unfortunate but valiant knight Montesinos sends me to thee, the\r\nKnight of the Lions (would that I saw thee in their claws), bidding me\r\ntell thee to wait for him wherever I may find thee, as he brings with\r\nhim her whom they call Dulcinea del Toboso, that he may show thee what\r\nis needful in order to disenchant her; and as I came for no more I need\r\nstay no longer; demons of my sort be with thee, and good angels with\r\nthese gentles;\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying he blew his huge horn, turned about and\r\nwent off without waiting for a reply from anyone.\r\n\r\nThey all felt fresh wonder, but particularly Sancho and Don Quixote;\r\nSancho to see how, in defiance of the truth, they would have it that\r\nDulcinea was enchanted; Don Quixote because he could not feel sure\r\nwhether what had happened to him in the cave of Montesinos was true or\r\nnot; and as he was deep in these cogitations the duke said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou mean to wait, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d replied he; \xe2\x80\x9chere will I wait, fearless and firm, though all\r\nhell should come to attack me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, if I see another devil or hear another horn like the last,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll wait here as much as in Flanders,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\nNight now closed in more completely, and many lights began to flit\r\nthrough the wood, just as those fiery exhalations from the earth, that\r\nlook like shooting-stars to our eyes, flit through the heavens; a\r\nfrightful noise, too, was heard, like that made by the solid wheels the\r\nox-carts usually have, by the harsh, ceaseless creaking of which, they\r\nsay, the bears and wolves are put to flight, if there happen to be any\r\nwhere they are passing. In addition to all this commotion, there came a\r\nfurther disturbance to increase the tumult, for now it seemed as if in\r\ntruth, on all four sides of the wood, four encounters or battles were\r\ngoing on at the same time; in one quarter resounded the dull noise of a\r\nterrible cannonade, in another numberless muskets were being\r\ndischarged, the shouts of the combatants sounded almost close at hand,\r\nand farther away the Moorish lelilies were raised again and again. In a\r\nword, the bugles, the horns, the clarions, the trumpets, the drums, the\r\ncannon, the musketry, and above all the tremendous noise of the carts,\r\nall made up together a din so confused and terrific that Don Quixote\r\nhad need to summon up all his courage to brave it; but Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s gave\r\nway, and he fell fainting on the skirt of the duchess\xe2\x80\x99s robe, who let\r\nhim lie there and promptly bade them throw water in his face. This was\r\ndone, and he came to himself by the time that one of the carts with the\r\ncreaking wheels reached the spot. It was drawn by four plodding oxen\r\nall covered with black housings; on each horn they had fixed a large\r\nlighted wax taper, and on the top of the cart was constructed a raised\r\nseat, on which sat a venerable old man with a beard whiter than the\r\nvery snow, and so long that it fell below his waist; he was dressed in\r\na long robe of black buckram; for as the cart was thickly set with a\r\nmultitude of candles it was easy to make out everything that was on it.\r\nLeading it were two hideous demons, also clad in buckram, with\r\ncountenances so frightful that Sancho, having once seen them, shut his\r\neyes so as not to see them again. As soon as the cart came opposite the\r\nspot the old man rose from his lofty seat, and standing up said in a\r\nloud voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI am the sage Lirgandeo,\xe2\x80\x9d and without another word the\r\ncart then passed on. Behind it came another of the same form, with\r\nanother aged man enthroned, who, stopping the cart, said in a voice no\r\nless solemn than that of the first, \xe2\x80\x9cI am the sage Alquife, the great\r\nfriend of Urganda the Unknown,\xe2\x80\x9d and passed on. Then another cart came\r\nby at the same pace, but the occupant of the throne was not old like\r\nthe others, but a man stalwart and robust, and of a forbidding\r\ncountenance, who as he came up said in a voice far hoarser and more\r\ndevilish, \xe2\x80\x9cI am the enchanter Archelaus, the mortal enemy of Amadis of\r\nGaul and all his kindred,\xe2\x80\x9d and then passed on. Having gone a short\r\ndistance the three carts halted and the monotonous noise of their\r\nwheels ceased, and soon after they heard another, not noise, but sound\r\nof sweet, harmonious music, of which Sancho was very glad, taking it to\r\nbe a good sign; and said he to the duchess, from whom he did not stir a\r\nstep, or for a single instant, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1ora, where there\xe2\x80\x99s music there can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe mischief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor where there are lights and it is bright,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess; to\r\nwhich Sancho replied, \xe2\x80\x9cFire gives light, and it\xe2\x80\x99s bright where there\r\nare bonfires, as we see by those that are all round us and perhaps may\r\nburn us; but music is a sign of mirth and merrymaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat remains to be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, who was listening to all\r\nthat passed; and he was right, as is shown in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np34e.jpg (47K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nWHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE INSTRUCTION GIVEN TO DON QUIXOTE TOUCHING THE\r\nDISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MARVELLOUS INCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np35a.jpg (108K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey saw advancing towards them, to the sound of this pleasing music,\r\nwhat they call a triumphal car, drawn by six grey mules with white\r\nlinen housings, on each of which was mounted a penitent, robed also in\r\nwhite, with a large lighted wax taper in his hand. The car was twice\r\nor, perhaps, three times as large as the former ones, and in front and\r\non the sides stood twelve more penitents, all as white as snow and all\r\nwith lighted tapers, a spectacle to excite fear as well as wonder; and\r\non a raised throne was seated a nymph draped in a multitude of\r\nsilver-tissue veils with an embroidery of countless gold spangles\r\nglittering all over them, that made her appear, if not richly, at least\r\nbrilliantly, apparelled. She had her face covered with thin transparent\r\nsendal, the texture of which did not prevent the fair features of a\r\nmaiden from being distinguished, while the numerous lights made it\r\npossible to judge of her beauty and of her years, which seemed to be\r\nnot less than seventeen but not to have yet reached twenty. Beside her\r\nwas a figure in a robe of state, as they call it, reaching to the feet,\r\nwhile the head was covered with a black veil. But the instant the car\r\nwas opposite the duke and duchess and Don Quixote the music of the\r\nclarions ceased, and then that of the lutes and harps on the car, and\r\nthe figure in the robe rose up, and flinging it apart and removing the\r\nveil from its face, disclosed to their eyes the shape of Death itself,\r\nfleshless and hideous, at which sight Don Quixote felt uneasy, Sancho\r\nfrightened, and the duke and duchess displayed a certain trepidation.\r\nHaving risen to its feet, this living death, in a sleepy voice and with\r\na tongue hardly awake, held forth as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np35b.jpg (232K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am that Merlin who the legends say\r\nThe devil had for father, and the lie\r\nHath gathered credence with the lapse of time.\r\nOf magic prince, of Zoroastric lore\r\nMonarch and treasurer, with jealous eye\r\nI view the efforts of the age to hide\r\nThe gallant deeds of doughty errant knights,\r\nWho are, and ever have been, dear to me.\r\nEnchanters and magicians and their kind\r\n\r\nAre mostly hard of heart; not so am I;\r\nFor mine is tender, soft, compassionate,\r\nAnd its delight is doing good to all.\r\nIn the dim caverns of the gloomy Dis,\r\nWhere, tracing mystic lines and characters,\r\nMy soul abideth now, there came to me\r\nThe sorrow-laden plaint of her, the fair,\r\nThe peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.\r\nI knew of her enchantment and her fate,\r\nFrom high-born dame to peasant wench transformed\r\nAnd touched with pity, first I turned the leaves\r\nOf countless volumes of my devilish craft,\r\nAnd then, in this grim grisly skeleton\r\nMyself encasing, hither have I come\r\nTo show where lies the fitting remedy\r\nTo give relief in such a piteous case.\r\nO thou, the pride and pink of all that I wear\r\n\r\nThe adamantine steel! O shining light,\r\nO beacon, polestar, path and guide of all\r\nWho, scorning slumber and the lazy down,\r\nAdopt the toilsome life of bloodstained arms!\r\nTo thee, great hero who all praise transcends,\r\nLa Mancha\xe2\x80\x99s lustre and Iberia\xe2\x80\x99s star,\r\nDon Quixote, wise as brave, to thee I say\xe2\x80\x94\r\nFor peerless Dulcinea del Toboso\r\nHer pristine form and beauty to regain,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis needful that thy esquire Sancho shall,\r\nOn his own sturdy buttocks bared to heaven,\r\nThree thousand and three hundred lashes lay,\r\nAnd that they smart and sting and hurt him well.\r\nThus have the authors of her woe resolved.\r\nAnd this is, gentles, wherefore I have come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all that\xe2\x80\x99s good,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sancho at this, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just as soon give\r\nmyself three stabs with a dagger as three, not to say three thousand,\r\nlashes. The devil take such a way of disenchanting! I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what my\r\nbackside has got to do with enchantments. By God, if Se\xc3\xb1or Merlin has\r\nnot found out some other way of disenchanting the lady Dulcinea del\r\nToboso, she may go to her grave enchanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you, Don Clown stuffed with garlic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand tie you to a tree as naked as when your mother brought you forth,\r\nand give you, not to say three thousand three hundred, but six thousand\r\nsix hundred lashes, and so well laid on that they won\xe2\x80\x99t be got rid of\r\nif you try three thousand three hundred times; don\xe2\x80\x99t answer me a word\r\nor I\xe2\x80\x99ll tear your soul out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this Merlin said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat will not do, for the lashes worthy\r\nSancho has to receive must be given of his own free will and not by\r\nforce, and at whatever time he pleases, for there is no fixed limit\r\nassigned to him; but it is permitted him, if he likes to commute by\r\nhalf the pain of this whipping, to let them be given by the hand of\r\nanother, though it may be somewhat weighty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a hand, my own or anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s, weighty or weighable, shall\r\ntouch me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cWas it I that gave birth to the lady Dulcinea\r\ndel Toboso, that my backside is to pay for the sins of her eyes? My\r\nmaster, indeed, that\xe2\x80\x99s a part of her\xe2\x80\x94for, he\xe2\x80\x99s always calling her \xe2\x80\x98my\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98my soul,\xe2\x80\x99 and his stay and prop\xe2\x80\x94may and ought to whip\r\nhimself for her and take all the trouble required for her\r\ndisenchantment. But for me to whip myself! Abernuncio!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as Sancho had done speaking the nymph in silver that was at the\r\nside of Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s ghost stood up, and removing the thin veil from her\r\nface disclosed one that seemed to all something more than exceedingly\r\nbeautiful; and with a masculine freedom from embarrassment and in a\r\nvoice not very like a lady\xe2\x80\x99s, addressing Sancho directly, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThou\r\nwretched squire, soul of a pitcher, heart of a cork tree, with bowels\r\nof flint and pebbles; if, thou impudent thief, they bade thee throw\r\nthyself down from some lofty tower; if, enemy of mankind, they asked\r\nthee to swallow a dozen of toads, two of lizards, and three of adders;\r\nif they wanted thee to slay thy wife and children with a sharp\r\nmurderous scimitar, it would be no wonder for thee to show thyself\r\nstubborn and squeamish. But to make a piece of work about three\r\nthousand three hundred lashes, what every poor little charity-boy gets\r\nevery month\xe2\x80\x94it is enough to amaze, astonish, astound the compassionate\r\nbowels of all who hear it, nay, all who come to hear it in the course\r\nof time. Turn, O miserable, hard-hearted animal, turn, I say, those\r\ntimorous owl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes upon these of mine that are compared to radiant\r\nstars, and thou wilt see them weeping trickling streams and rills, and\r\ntracing furrows, tracks, and paths over the fair fields of my cheeks.\r\nLet it move thee, crafty, ill-conditioned monster, to see my blooming\r\nyouth\xe2\x80\x94still in its teens, for I am not yet twenty\xe2\x80\x94wasting and withering\r\naway beneath the husk of a rude peasant wench; and if I do not appear\r\nin that shape now, it is a special favour Se\xc3\xb1or Merlin here has granted\r\nme, to the sole end that my beauty may soften thee; for the tears of\r\nbeauty in distress turn rocks into cotton and tigers into ewes. Lay on\r\nto that hide of thine, thou great untamed brute, rouse up thy lusty\r\nvigour that only urges thee to eat and eat, and set free the softness\r\nof my flesh, the gentleness of my nature, and the fairness of my face.\r\nAnd if thou wilt not relent or come to reason for me, do so for the\r\nsake of that poor knight thou hast beside thee; thy master I mean,\r\nwhose soul I can this moment see, how he has it stuck in his throat not\r\nten fingers from his lips, and only waiting for thy inflexible or\r\nyielding reply to make its escape by his mouth or go back again into\r\nhis stomach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote on hearing this felt his throat, and turning to the duke he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cBy God, se\xc3\xb1or, Dulcinea says true, I have my soul stuck here in\r\nmy throat like the nut of a crossbow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat say you to this, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I said before; as for the\r\nlashes, abernuncio!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbrenuncio, you should say, Sancho, and not as you do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me alone, your highness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not in a humour now to\r\nlook into niceties or a letter more or less, for these lashes that are\r\nto be given me, or I\xe2\x80\x99m to give myself, have so upset me, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying or doing. But I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know of this lady, my\r\nlady Dulcinea del Toboso, where she learned this way she has of asking\r\nfavours. She comes to ask me to score my flesh with lashes, and she\r\ncalls me soul of a pitcher, and great untamed brute, and a string of\r\nfoul names that the devil is welcome to. Is my flesh brass? or is it\r\nanything to me whether she is enchanted or not? Does she bring with her\r\na basket of fair linen, shirts, kerchiefs, socks\xe2\x80\x94not that I wear any\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ncoax me? No, nothing but one piece of abuse after another, though she\r\nknows the proverb they have here that \xe2\x80\x98an ass loaded with gold goes\r\nlightly up a mountain,\xe2\x80\x99 and that \xe2\x80\x98gifts break rocks,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98praying to\r\nGod and plying the hammer,\xe2\x80\x99 and that \xe2\x80\x98one \xe2\x80\x9ctake\xe2\x80\x9d is better than two\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give thee\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 Then there\xe2\x80\x99s my master, who ought to stroke me\r\ndown and pet me to make me turn wool and carded cotton; he says if he\r\ngets hold of me he\xe2\x80\x99ll tie me naked to a tree and double the tale of\r\nlashes on me. These tender-hearted gentry should consider that it\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nmerely a squire, but a governor they are asking to whip himself; just\r\nas if it was \xe2\x80\x98drink with cherries.\xe2\x80\x99 Let them learn, plague take them,\r\nthe right way to ask, and beg, and behave themselves; for all times are\r\nnot alike, nor are people always in good humour. I\xe2\x80\x99m now ready to burst\r\nwith grief at seeing my green coat torn, and they come to ask me to\r\nwhip myself of my own free will, I having as little fancy for it as for\r\nturning cacique.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, the fact is, friend Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cthat unless\r\nyou become softer than a ripe fig, you shall not get hold of the\r\ngovernment. It would be a nice thing for me to send my islanders a\r\ncruel governor with flinty bowels, who won\xe2\x80\x99t yield to the tears of\r\nafflicted damsels or to the prayers of wise, magisterial, ancient\r\nenchanters and sages. In short, Sancho, either you must be whipped by\r\nyourself, or they must whip you, or you shan\xe2\x80\x99t be governor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t two days\xe2\x80\x99 grace be given me in which to\r\nconsider what is best for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, certainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Merlin; \xe2\x80\x9chere, this minute, and on the spot,\r\nthe matter must be settled; either Dulcinea will return to the cave of\r\nMontesinos and to her former condition of peasant wench, or else in her\r\npresent form shall be carried to the Elysian fields, where she will\r\nremain waiting until the number of stripes is completed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, Sancho!\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cshow courage, and gratitude for\r\nyour master Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s bread that you have eaten; we are all bound\r\nto oblige and please him for his benevolent disposition and lofty\r\nchivalry. Consent to this whipping, my son; to the devil with the\r\ndevil, and leave fear to milksops, for \xe2\x80\x98a stout heart breaks bad luck,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nas you very well know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Sancho replied with an irrelevant remark, which, addressing\r\nMerlin, he made to him, \xe2\x80\x9cWill your worship tell me, Se\xc3\xb1or Merlin\xe2\x80\x94when\r\nthat courier devil came up he gave my master a message from Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nMontesinos, charging him to wait for him here, as he was coming to\r\narrange how the lady Do\xc3\xb1a Dulcinea del Toboso was to be disenchanted;\r\nbut up to the present we have not seen Montesinos, nor anything like\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Merlin made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cThe devil, Sancho, is a blockhead and a\r\ngreat scoundrel; I sent him to look for your master, but not with a\r\nmessage from Montesinos but from myself; for Montesinos is in his cave\r\nexpecting, or more properly speaking, waiting for his disenchantment;\r\nfor there\xe2\x80\x99s the tail to be skinned yet for him; if he owes you\r\nanything, or you have any business to transact with him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him\r\nto you and put him where you choose; but for the present make up your\r\nmind to consent to this penance, and believe me it will be very good\r\nfor you, for soul as well for body\xe2\x80\x94for your soul because of the charity\r\nwith which you perform it, for your body because I know that you are of\r\na sanguine habit and it will do you no harm to draw a little blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a great many doctors in the world; even the enchanters are\r\ndoctors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9chowever, as everybody tells me the same\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94though I can\xe2\x80\x99t see it myself\xe2\x80\x94I say I am willing to give myself\r\nthe three thousand three hundred lashes, provided I am to lay them on\r\nwhenever I like, without any fixing of days or times; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try and\r\nget out of debt as quickly as I can, that the world may enjoy the\r\nbeauty of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso; as it seems, contrary to what I\r\nthought, that she is beautiful after all. It must be a condition, too,\r\nthat I am not to be bound to draw blood with the scourge, and that if\r\nany of the lashes happen to be fly-flappers they are to count. Item,\r\nthat, in case I should make any mistake in the reckoning, Se\xc3\xb1or Merlin,\r\nas he knows everything, is to keep count, and let me know how many are\r\nstill wanting or over the number.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be no need to let you know of any over,\xe2\x80\x9d said Merlin,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause, when you reach the full number, the lady Dulcinea will at\r\nonce, and that very instant, be disenchanted, and will come in her\r\ngratitude to seek out the worthy Sancho, and thank him, and even reward\r\nhim for the good work. So you have no cause to be uneasy about stripes\r\ntoo many or too few; heaven forbid I should cheat anyone of even a hair\r\nof his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, in God\xe2\x80\x99s hands be it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cin the hard case I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nin I give in; I say I accept the penance on the conditions laid down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe instant Sancho uttered these last words the music of the clarions\r\nstruck up once more, and again a host of muskets were discharged, and\r\nDon Quixote hung on Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s neck kissing him again and again on the\r\nforehead and cheeks. The duchess and the duke expressed the greatest\r\nsatisfaction, the car began to move on, and as it passed the fair\r\nDulcinea bowed to the duke and duchess and made a low curtsey to\r\nSancho.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np35c.jpg (284K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now bright smiling dawn came on apace; the flowers of the field,\r\nrevived, raised up their heads, and the crystal waters of the brooks,\r\nmurmuring over the grey and white pebbles, hastened to pay their\r\ntribute to the expectant rivers; the glad earth, the unclouded sky, the\r\nfresh breeze, the clear light, each and all showed that the day that\r\ncame treading on the skirts of morning would be calm and bright. The\r\nduke and duchess, pleased with their hunt and at having carried out\r\ntheir plans so cleverly and successfully, returned to their castle\r\nresolved to follow up their joke; for to them there was no reality that\r\ncould afford them more amusement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np35e.jpg (10K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE STRANGE AND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE\r\nDISTRESSED DUENNA, ALIAS THE COUNTESS TRIFALDI, TOGETHER WITH A LETTER\r\nWHICH SANCHO PANZA WROTE TO HIS WIFE, TERESA PANZA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np36a.jpg (150K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duke had a majordomo of a very facetious and sportive turn, and he\r\nit was that played the part of Merlin, made all the arrangements for\r\nthe late adventure, composed the verses, and got a page to represent\r\nDulcinea; and now, with the assistance of his master and mistress, he\r\ngot up another of the drollest and strangest contrivances that can be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nThe duchess asked Sancho the next day if he had made a beginning with\r\nhis penance task which he had to perform for the disenchantment of\r\nDulcinea. He said he had, and had given himself five lashes overnight.\r\n\r\nThe duchess asked him what he had given them with.\r\n\r\nHe said with his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cis more like giving oneself slaps than\r\nlashes; I am sure the sage Merlin will not be satisfied with such\r\ntenderness; worthy Sancho must make a scourge with claws, or a\r\ncat-o\xe2\x80\x99-nine tails, that will make itself felt; for it\xe2\x80\x99s with blood that\r\nletters enter, and the release of so great a lady as Dulcinea will not\r\nbe granted so cheaply, or at such a paltry price; and remember, Sancho,\r\nthat works of charity done in a lukewarm and half-hearted way are\r\nwithout merit and of no avail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Sancho replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIf your ladyship will give me a proper\r\nscourge or cord, I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay on with it, provided it does not hurt too\r\nmuch; for you must know, boor as I am, my flesh is more cotton than\r\nhemp, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t do for me to destroy myself for the good of anybody\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess; \xe2\x80\x9cto-morrow I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a\r\nscourge that will be just the thing for you, and will accommodate\r\nitself to the tenderness of your flesh, as if it was its own sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cYour highness must know, dear lady of my soul, that\r\nI have a letter written to my wife, Teresa Panza, giving her an account\r\nof all that has happened me since I left her; I have it here in my\r\nbosom, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wanting but to put the address to it; I\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nglad if your discretion would read it, for I think it runs in the\r\ngovernor style; I mean the way governors ought to write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who dictated it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the duchess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho should have dictated but myself, sinner as I am?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you write it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I can neither read nor write, though\r\nI can sign my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cfor never fear but you display in\r\nit the quality and quantity of your wit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho drew out an open letter from his bosom, and the duchess, taking\r\nit, found it ran in this fashion:\r\n\r\nSANCHO PANZA\xe2\x80\x99S LETTER TO HIS WIFE, TERESA PANZA\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I was well whipped I went mounted like a gentleman; if I have got a\r\ngood government it is at the cost of a good whipping. Thou wilt not\r\nunderstand this just now, my Teresa; by-and-by thou wilt know what it\r\nmeans. I may tell thee, Teresa, I mean thee to go in a coach, for that\r\nis a matter of importance, because every other way of going is going on\r\nall-fours. Thou art a governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife; take care that nobody speaks\r\nevil of thee behind thy back. I send thee here a green hunting suit\r\nthat my lady the duchess gave me; alter it so as to make a petticoat\r\nand bodice for our daughter. Don Quixote, my master, if I am to believe\r\nwhat I hear in these parts, is a madman of some sense, and a droll\r\nblockhead, and I am in no way behind him. We have been in the cave of\r\nMontesinos, and the sage Merlin has laid hold of me for the\r\ndisenchantment of Dulcinea del Toboso, her that is called Aldonza\r\nLorenzo over there. With three thousand three hundred lashes, less\r\nfive, that I\xe2\x80\x99m to give myself, she will be left as entirely\r\ndisenchanted as the mother that bore her. Say nothing of this to\r\nanyone; for, make thy affairs public, and some will say they are white\r\nand others will say they are black. I shall leave this in a few days\r\nfor my government, to which I am going with a mighty great desire to\r\nmake money, for they tell me all new governors set out with the same\r\ndesire; I will feel the pulse of it and will let thee know if thou art\r\nto come and live with me or not. Dapple is well and sends many\r\nremembrances to thee; I am not going to leave him behind though they\r\ntook me away to be Grand Turk. My lady the duchess kisses thy hands a\r\nthousand times; do thou make a return with two thousand, for as my\r\nmaster says, nothing costs less or is cheaper than civility. God has\r\nnot been pleased to provide another valise for me with another hundred\r\ncrowns, like the one the other day; but never mind, my Teresa, the\r\nbell-ringer is in safe quarters, and all will come out in the scouring\r\nof the government; only it troubles me greatly what they tell me\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nonce I have tasted it I will eat my hands off after it; and if that is\r\nso it will not come very cheap to me; though to be sure the maimed have\r\na benefice of their own in the alms they beg for; so that one way or\r\nanother thou wilt be rich and in luck. God give it to thee as he can,\r\nand keep me to serve thee. From this castle, the 20th of July, 1614.\r\n\r\n\r\nThy husband, the governor,\r\nSANCHO PANZA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she had done reading the letter the duchess said to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cOn\r\ntwo points the worthy governor goes rather astray; one is in saying or\r\nhinting that this government has been bestowed upon him for the lashes\r\nthat he is to give himself, when he knows (and he cannot deny it) that\r\nwhen my lord the duke promised it to him nobody ever dreamt of such a\r\nthing as lashes; the other is that he shows himself here to be very\r\ncovetous; and I would not have him a money-seeker, for \xe2\x80\x98covetousness\r\nbursts the bag,\xe2\x80\x99 and the covetous governor does ungoverned justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it that way, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand if you think the\r\nletter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run as it ought to do, it\xe2\x80\x99s only to tear it up and make\r\nanother; and maybe it will be a worse one if it is left to my\r\ngumption.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cthis one will do, and I wish the duke to\r\nsee it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this they betook themselves to a garden where they were to dine,\r\nand the duchess showed Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s letter to the duke, who was highly\r\ndelighted with it. They dined, and after the cloth had been removed and\r\nthey had amused themselves for a while with Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s rich conversation,\r\nthe melancholy sound of a fife and harsh discordant drum made itself\r\nheard. All seemed somewhat put out by this dull, confused, martial\r\nharmony, especially Don Quixote, who could not keep his seat from pure\r\ndisquietude; as to Sancho, it is needless to say that fear drove him to\r\nhis usual refuge, the side or the skirts of the duchess; and indeed and\r\nin truth the sound they heard was a most doleful and melancholy one.\r\nWhile they were still in uncertainty they saw advancing towards them\r\nthrough the garden two men clad in mourning robes so long and flowing\r\nthat they trailed upon the ground. As they marched they beat two great\r\ndrums which were likewise draped in black, and beside them came the\r\nfife player, black and sombre like the others. Following these came a\r\npersonage of gigantic stature enveloped rather than clad in a gown of\r\nthe deepest black, the skirt of which was of prodigious dimensions.\r\nOver the gown, girdling or crossing his figure, he had a broad baldric\r\nwhich was also black, and from which hung a huge scimitar with a black\r\nscabbard and furniture. He had his face covered with a transparent\r\nblack veil, through which might be descried a very long beard as white\r\nas snow. He came on keeping step to the sound of the drums with great\r\ngravity and dignity; and, in short, his stature, his gait, the\r\nsombreness of his appearance and his following might well have struck\r\nwith astonishment, as they did, all who beheld him without knowing who\r\nhe was. With this measured pace and in this guise he advanced to kneel\r\nbefore the duke, who, with the others, awaited him standing. The duke,\r\nhowever, would not on any account allow him to speak until he had\r\nrisen. The prodigious scarecrow obeyed, and standing up, removed the\r\nveil from his face and disclosed the most enormous, the longest, the\r\nwhitest and the thickest beard that human eyes had ever beheld until\r\nthat moment, and then fetching up a grave, sonorous voice from the\r\ndepths of his broad, capacious chest, and fixing his eyes on the duke,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost high and mighty se\xc3\xb1or, my name is Trifaldin of the White Beard; I\r\nam squire to the Countess Trifaldi, otherwise called the Distressed\r\nDuenna, on whose behalf I bear a message to your highness, which is\r\nthat your magnificence will be pleased to grant her leave and\r\npermission to come and tell you her trouble, which is one of the\r\nstrangest and most wonderful that the mind most familiar with trouble\r\nin the world could have imagined; but first she desires to know if the\r\nvaliant and never vanquished knight, Don Quixote of La Mancha, is in\r\nthis your castle, for she has come in quest of him on foot and without\r\nbreaking her fast from the kingdom of Kandy to your realms here; a\r\nthing which may and ought to be regarded as a miracle or set down to\r\nenchantment; she is even now at the gate of this fortress or plaisance,\r\nand only waits for your permission to enter. I have spoken.\xe2\x80\x9d And with\r\nthat he coughed, and stroked down his beard with both his hands, and\r\nstood very tranquilly waiting for the response of the duke, which was\r\nto this effect: \xe2\x80\x9cMany days ago, worthy squire Trifaldin of the White\r\nBeard, we heard of the misfortune of my lady the Countess Trifaldi,\r\nwhom the enchanters have caused to be called the Distressed Duenna. Bid\r\nher enter, O stupendous squire, and tell her that the valiant knight\r\nDon Quixote of La Mancha is here, and from his generous disposition she\r\nmay safely promise herself every protection and assistance; and you may\r\ntell her, too, that if my aid be necessary it will not be withheld, for\r\nI am bound to give it to her by my quality of knight, which involves\r\nthe protection of women of all sorts, especially widowed, wronged, and\r\ndistressed dames, such as her ladyship seems to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this Trifaldin bent the knee to the ground, and making a\r\nsign to the fifer and drummers to strike up, he turned and marched out\r\nof the garden to the same notes and at the same pace as when he\r\nentered, leaving them all amazed at his bearing and solemnity. Turning\r\nto Don Quixote, the duke said, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, renowned knight, the mists\r\nof malice and ignorance are unable to hide or obscure the light of\r\nvalour and virtue. I say so, because your excellence has been barely\r\nsix days in this castle, and already the unhappy and the afflicted come\r\nin quest of you from lands far distant and remote, and not in coaches\r\nor on dromedaries, but on foot and fasting, confident that in that\r\nmighty arm they will find a cure for their sorrows and troubles; thanks\r\nto your great achievements, which are circulated all over the known\r\nearth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish, se\xc3\xb1or duke,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat blessed ecclesiastic,\r\nwho at table the other day showed such ill-will and bitter spite\r\nagainst knights-errant, were here now to see with his own eyes whether\r\nknights of the sort are needed in the world; he would at any rate learn\r\nby experience that those suffering any extraordinary affliction or\r\nsorrow, in extreme cases and unusual misfortunes do not go to look for\r\na remedy to the houses of jurists or village sacristans, or to the\r\nknight who has never attempted to pass the bounds of his own town, or\r\nto the indolent courtier who only seeks for news to repeat and talk of,\r\ninstead of striving to do deeds and exploits for others to relate and\r\nrecord. Relief in distress, help in need, protection for damsels,\r\nconsolation for widows, are to be found in no sort of persons better\r\nthan in knights-errant; and I give unceasing thanks to heaven that I am\r\none, and regard any misfortune or suffering that may befall me in the\r\npursuit of so honourable a calling as endured to good purpose. Let this\r\nduenna come and ask what she will, for I will effect her relief by the\r\nmight of my arm and the dauntless resolution of my bold heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np36e.jpg (22K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nWHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE DISTRESSED DUENNA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np37a.jpg (94K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duke and duchess were extremely glad to see how readily Don Quixote\r\nfell in with their scheme; but at this moment Sancho observed, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope\r\nthis se\xc3\xb1ora duenna won\xe2\x80\x99t be putting any difficulties in the way of the\r\npromise of my government; for I have heard a Toledo apothecary, who\r\ntalked like a goldfinch, say that where duennas were mixed up nothing\r\ngood could happen. God bless me, how he hated them, that same\r\napothecary! And so what I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking is, if all duennas, of whatever\r\nsort or condition they may be, are plagues and busybodies, what must\r\nthey be that are distressed, like this Countess Three-skirts or\r\nThree-tails!\xe2\x80\x94for in my country skirts or tails, tails or skirts, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, friend Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9csince this lady duenna comes\r\nin quest of me from such a distant land she cannot be one of those the\r\napothecary meant; moreover this is a countess, and when countesses\r\nserve as duennas it is in the service of queens and empresses, for in\r\ntheir own houses they are mistresses paramount and have other duennas\r\nto wait on them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez, who was present, made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cMy lady the\r\nduchess has duennas in her service that might be countesses if it was\r\nthe will of fortune; \xe2\x80\x98but laws go as kings like;\xe2\x80\x99 let nobody speak ill\r\nof duennas, above all of ancient maiden ones; for though I am not one\r\nmyself, I know and am aware of the advantage a maiden duenna has over\r\none that is a widow; but \xe2\x80\x98he who clipped us has kept the scissors.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s so much to be clipped about\r\nduennas, so my barber said, that \xe2\x80\x98it will be better not to stir the\r\nrice even though it sticks.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese squires,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez, \xe2\x80\x9care always our enemies; and\r\nas they are the haunting spirits of the antechambers and watch us at\r\nevery step, whenever they are not saying their prayers (and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noften enough) they spend their time in tattling about us, digging up\r\nour bones and burying our good name. But I can tell these walking\r\nblocks that we will live in spite of them, and in great houses too,\r\nthough we die of hunger and cover our flesh, be it delicate or not,\r\nwith widow\xe2\x80\x99s weeds, as one covers or hides a dunghill on a procession\r\nday. By my faith, if it were permitted me and time allowed, I could\r\nprove, not only to those here present, but to all the world, that there\r\nis no virtue that is not to be found in a duenna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my good Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez is\r\nright, and very much so; but she had better bide her time for fighting\r\nher own battle and that of the rest of the duennas, so as to crush the\r\ncalumny of that vile apothecary, and root out the prejudice in the\r\ngreat Sancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Sancho replied, \xe2\x80\x9cEver since I have sniffed the governorship I\r\nhave got rid of the humours of a squire, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a wild fig\r\nfor all the duennas in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey would have carried on this duenna dispute further had they not\r\nheard the notes of the fife and drums once more, from which they\r\nconcluded that the Distressed Duenna was making her entrance. The\r\nduchess asked the duke if it would be proper to go out to receive her,\r\nas she was a countess and a person of rank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn respect of her being a countess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, before the duke\r\ncould reply, \xe2\x80\x9cI am for your highnesses going out to receive her; but in\r\nrespect of her being a duenna, it is my opinion you should not stir a\r\nstep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho bade thee meddle in this, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho, se\xc3\xb1or?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI meddle for I have a right to meddle, as a\r\nsquire who has learned the rules of courtesy in the school of your\r\nworship, the most courteous and best-bred knight in the whole world of\r\ncourtliness; and in these things, as I have heard your worship say, as\r\nmuch is lost by a card too many as by a card too few, and to one who\r\nhas his ears open, few words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSancho is right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the countess is like,\r\nand by that measure the courtesy that is due to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now the drums and fife made their entrance as before; and here the\r\nauthor brought this short chapter to an end and began the next,\r\nfollowing up the same adventure, which is one of the most notable in\r\nthe history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np37e.jpg (21K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nWHEREIN IS TOLD THE DISTRESSED DUENNA\xe2\x80\x99S TALE OF HER MISFORTUNES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np38a.jpg (54K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the melancholy musicians there filed into the garden as many\r\nas twelve duennas, in two lines, all dressed in ample mourning robes\r\napparently of milled serge, with hoods of fine white gauze so long that\r\nthey allowed only the border of the robe to be seen. Behind them came\r\nthe Countess Trifaldi, the squire Trifaldin of the White Beard leading\r\nher by the hand, clad in the finest unnapped black baize, such that,\r\nhad it a nap, every tuft would have shown as big as a Martos chickpea;\r\nthe tail, or skirt, or whatever it might be called, ended in three\r\npoints which were borne up by the hands of three pages, likewise\r\ndressed in mourning, forming an elegant geometrical figure with the\r\nthree acute angles made by the three points, from which all who saw the\r\npeaked skirt concluded that it must be because of it the countess was\r\ncalled Trifaldi, as though it were Countess of the Three Skirts; and\r\nBenengeli says it was so, and that by her right name she was called the\r\nCountess Lobuna, because wolves bred in great numbers in her country;\r\nand if, instead of wolves, they had been foxes, she would have been\r\ncalled the Countess Zorruna, as it was the custom in those parts for\r\nlords to take distinctive titles from the thing or things most abundant\r\nin their dominions; this countess, however, in honour of the new\r\nfashion of her skirt, dropped Lobuna and took up Trifaldi.\r\n\r\nThe twelve duennas and the lady came on at procession pace, their faces\r\nbeing covered with black veils, not transparent ones like Trifaldin\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nbut so close that they allowed nothing to be seen through them. As soon\r\nas the band of duennas was fully in sight, the duke, the duchess, and\r\nDon Quixote stood up, as well as all who were watching the slow-moving\r\nprocession. The twelve duennas halted and formed a lane, along which\r\nthe Distressed One advanced, Trifaldin still holding her hand. On\r\nseeing this the duke, the duchess, and Don Quixote went some twelve\r\npaces forward to meet her. She then, kneeling on the ground, said in a\r\nvoice hoarse and rough, rather than fine and delicate, \xe2\x80\x9cMay it please\r\nyour highnesses not to offer such courtesies to this your servant, I\r\nshould say to this your handmaid, for I am in such distress that I\r\nshall never be able to make a proper return, because my strange and\r\nunparalleled misfortune has carried off my wits, and I know not\r\nwhither; but it must be a long way off, for the more I look for them\r\nthe less I find them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would be wanting in wits, se\xc3\xb1ora countess,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cwho did\r\nnot perceive your worth by your person, for at a glance it may be seen\r\nit deserves all the cream of courtesy and flower of polite usage;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nraising her up by the hand he led her to a seat beside the duchess, who\r\nlikewise received her with great urbanity. Don Quixote remained silent,\r\nwhile Sancho was dying to see the features of Trifaldi and one or two\r\nof her many duennas; but there was no possibility of it until they\r\nthemselves displayed them of their own accord and free will.\r\n\r\nAll kept still, waiting to see who would break silence, which the\r\nDistressed Duenna did in these words: \xe2\x80\x9cI am confident, most mighty\r\nlord, most fair lady, and most discreet company, that my most miserable\r\nmisery will be accorded a reception no less dispassionate than generous\r\nand condolent in your most valiant bosoms, for it is one that is enough\r\nto melt marble, soften diamonds, and mollify the steel of the most\r\nhardened hearts in the world; but ere it is proclaimed to your hearing,\r\nnot to say your ears, I would fain be enlightened whether there be\r\npresent in this society, circle, or company, that knight\r\nimmaculatissimus, Don Quixote de la Manchissima, and his squirissimus\r\nPanza.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Panza is here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, before anyone could reply, \xe2\x80\x9cand Don\r\nQuixotissimus too; and so, most distressedest Duenissima, you may say\r\nwhat you willissimus, for we are all readissimus to do you any\r\nservissimus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn this Don Quixote rose, and addressing the Distressed Duenna, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your sorrows, afflicted lady, can indulge in any hope of relief\r\nfrom the valour or might of any knight-errant, here are mine, which,\r\nfeeble and limited though they be, shall be entirely devoted to your\r\nservice. I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose calling it is to give aid\r\nto the needy of all sorts; and that being so, it is not necessary for\r\nyou, se\xc3\xb1ora, to make any appeal to benevolence, or deal in preambles,\r\nonly to tell your woes plainly and straightforwardly: for you have\r\nhearers that will know how, if not to remedy them, to sympathise with\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, the Distressed Duenna made as though she would throw\r\nherself at Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and actually did fall before them and\r\nsaid, as she strove to embrace them, \xe2\x80\x9cBefore these feet and legs I cast\r\nmyself, O unconquered knight, as before, what they are, the foundations\r\nand pillars of knight-errantry; these feet I desire to kiss, for upon\r\ntheir steps hangs and depends the sole remedy for my misfortune, O\r\nvalorous errant, whose veritable achievements leave behind and eclipse\r\nthe fabulous ones of the Amadises, Esplandians, and Belianises!\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nturning from Don Quixote to Sancho Panza, and grasping his hands, she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cO thou, most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant in this\r\npresent age or ages past, whose goodness is more extensive than the\r\nbeard of Trifaldin my companion here of present, well mayest thou boast\r\nthyself that, in serving the great Don Quixote, thou art serving,\r\nsummed up in one, the whole host of knights that have ever borne arms\r\nin the world. I conjure thee, by what thou owest to thy most loyal\r\ngoodness, that thou wilt become my kind intercessor with thy master,\r\nthat he speedily give aid to this most humble and most unfortunate\r\ncountess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Sancho made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cAs to my goodness, se\xc3\xb1ora, being as long\r\nand as great as your squire\xe2\x80\x99s beard, it matters very little to me; may\r\nI have my soul well bearded and moustached when it comes to quit this\r\nlife, that\xe2\x80\x99s the point; about beards here below I care little or\r\nnothing; but without all these blandishments and prayers, I will beg my\r\nmaster (for I know he loves me, and, besides, he has need of me just\r\nnow for a certain business) to help and aid your worship as far as he\r\ncan; unpack your woes and lay them before us, and leave us to deal with\r\nthem, for we\xe2\x80\x99ll be all of one mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke and duchess, as it was they who had made the experiment of\r\nthis adventure, were ready to burst with laughter at all this, and\r\nbetween themselves they commended the clever acting of the Trifaldi,\r\nwho, returning to her seat, said, \xe2\x80\x9cQueen Do\xc3\xb1a Maguncia reigned over the\r\nfamous kingdom of Kandy, which lies between the great Trapobana and the\r\nSouthern Sea, two leagues beyond Cape Comorin. She was the widow of\r\nKing Archipiela, her lord and husband, and of their marriage they had\r\nissue the Princess Antonomasia, heiress of the kingdom; which Princess\r\nAntonomasia was reared and brought up under my care and direction, I\r\nbeing the oldest and highest in rank of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s duennas. Time\r\npassed, and the young Antonomasia reached the age of fourteen, and such\r\na perfection of beauty, that nature could not raise it higher. Then, it\r\nmust not be supposed her intelligence was childish; she was as\r\nintelligent as she was fair, and she was fairer than all the world; and\r\nis so still, unless the envious fates and hard-hearted sisters three\r\nhave cut for her the thread of life. But that they have not, for Heaven\r\nwill not suffer so great a wrong to Earth, as it would be to pluck\r\nunripe the grapes of the fairest vineyard on its surface. Of this\r\nbeauty, to which my poor feeble tongue has failed to do justice,\r\ncountless princes, not only of that country, but of others, were\r\nenamoured, and among them a private gentleman, who was at the court,\r\ndared to raise his thoughts to the heaven of so great beauty, trusting\r\nto his youth, his gallant bearing, his numerous accomplishments and\r\ngraces, and his quickness and readiness of wit; for I may tell your\r\nhighnesses, if I am not wearying you, that he played the guitar so as\r\nto make it speak, and he was, besides, a poet and a great dancer, and\r\nhe could make birdcages so well, that by making them alone he might\r\nhave gained a livelihood, had he found himself reduced to utter\r\npoverty; and gifts and graces of this kind are enough to bring down a\r\nmountain, not to say a tender young girl. But all his gallantry, wit,\r\nand gaiety, all his graces and accomplishments, would have been of\r\nlittle or no avail towards gaining the fortress of my pupil, had not\r\nthe impudent thief taken the precaution of gaining me over first.\r\nFirst, the villain and heartless vagabond sought to win my good-will\r\nand purchase my compliance, so as to get me, like a treacherous warder,\r\nto deliver up to him the keys of the fortress I had in charge. In a\r\nword, he gained an influence over my mind, and overcame my resolutions\r\nwith I know not what trinkets and jewels he gave me; but it was some\r\nverses I heard him singing one night from a grating that opened on the\r\nstreet where he lived, that, more than anything else, made me give way\r\nand led to my fall; and if I remember rightly they ran thus:\r\n\r\nFrom that sweet enemy of mine\r\nMy bleeding heart hath had its wound;\r\nAnd to increase the pain I\xe2\x80\x99m bound\r\nTo suffer and to make no sign.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lines seemed pearls to me and his voice sweet as syrup; and\r\nafterwards, I may say ever since then, looking at the misfortune into\r\nwhich I have fallen, I have thought that poets, as Plato advised, ought\r\nto be banished from all well-ordered States; at least the amatory ones,\r\nfor they write verses, not like those of \xe2\x80\x98The Marquis of Mantua,\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\ndelight and draw tears from the women and children, but sharp-pointed\r\nconceits that pierce the heart like soft thorns, and like the lightning\r\nstrike it, leaving the raiment uninjured. Another time he sang:\r\n\r\nCome Death, so subtly veiled that I\r\nThy coming know not, how or when,\r\nLest it should give me life again\r\nTo find how sweet it is to die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94and other verses and burdens of the same sort, such as enchant when\r\nsung and fascinate when written. And then, when they condescend to\r\ncompose a sort of verse that was at that time in vogue in Kandy, which\r\nthey call seguidillas! Then it is that hearts leap and laughter breaks\r\nforth, and the body grows restless and all the senses turn quicksilver.\r\nAnd so I say, sirs, that these troubadours richly deserve to be\r\nbanished to the isles of the lizards. Though it is not they that are in\r\nfault, but the simpletons that extol them, and the fools that believe\r\nin them; and had I been the faithful duenna I should have been, his\r\nstale conceits would have never moved me, nor should I have been taken\r\nin by such phrases as \xe2\x80\x98in death I live,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98in ice I burn,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98in flames I\r\nshiver,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98hopeless I hope,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I go and stay,\xe2\x80\x99 and paradoxes of that sort\r\nwhich their writings are full of. And then when they promise the Ph\xc5\x93nix\r\nof Arabia, the crown of Ariadne, the horses of the Sun, the pearls of\r\nthe South, the gold of Tibar, and the balsam of Panchaia! Then it is\r\nthey give a loose to their pens, for it costs them little to make\r\npromises they have no intention or power of fulfilling. But where am I\r\nwandering to? Woe is me, unfortunate being! What madness or folly leads\r\nme to speak of the faults of others, when there is so much to be said\r\nabout my own? Again, woe is me, hapless that I am! it was not verses\r\nthat conquered me, but my own simplicity; it was not music made me\r\nyield, but my own imprudence; my own great ignorance and little caution\r\nopened the way and cleared the path for Don Clavijo\xe2\x80\x99s advances, for\r\nthat was the name of the gentleman I have referred to; and so, with my\r\nhelp as go-between, he found his way many a time into the chamber of\r\nthe deceived Antonomasia (deceived not by him but by me) under the\r\ntitle of a lawful husband; for, sinner though I was, would not have\r\nallowed him to approach the edge of her shoe-sole without being her\r\nhusband. No, no, not that; marriage must come first in any business of\r\nthis sort that I take in hand. But there was one hitch in this case,\r\nwhich was that of inequality of rank, Don Clavijo being a private\r\ngentleman, and the Princess Antonomasia, as I said, heiress to the\r\nkingdom. The entanglement remained for some time a secret, kept hidden\r\nby my cunning precautions, until I perceived that a certain expansion\r\nof waist in Antonomasia must before long disclose it, the dread of\r\nwhich made us all there take counsel together, and it was agreed that\r\nbefore the mischief came to light, Don Clavijo should demand\r\nAntonomasia as his wife before the Vicar, in virtue of an agreement to\r\nmarry him made by the princess, and drafted by my wit in such binding\r\nterms that the might of Samson could not have broken it. The necessary\r\nsteps were taken; the Vicar saw the agreement, and took the lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfession; she confessed everything in full, and he ordered her into\r\nthe custody of a very worthy alguacil of the court.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there alguacils of the court in Kandy, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho at this,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand poets, and seguidillas? I swear I think the world is the same all\r\nover! But make haste, Se\xc3\xb1ora Trifaldi; for it is late, and I am dying\r\nto know the end of this long story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the countess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np38e.jpg (22K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nIN WHICH THE TRIFALDI CONTINUES HER MARVELLOUS AND MEMORABLE STORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np39a.jpg (96K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy every word that Sancho uttered, the duchess was as much delighted as\r\nDon Quixote was driven to desperation. He bade him hold his tongue, and\r\nthe Distressed One went on to say: \xe2\x80\x9cAt length, after much questioning\r\nand answering, as the princess held to her story, without changing or\r\nvarying her previous declaration, the Vicar gave his decision in favour\r\nof Don Clavijo, and she was delivered over to him as his lawful wife;\r\nwhich the Queen Do\xc3\xb1a Maguncia, the Princess Antonomasia\xe2\x80\x99s mother, so\r\ntook to heart, that within the space of three days we buried her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe died, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Trifaldin; \xe2\x80\x9cthey don\xe2\x80\x99t bury living people in Kandy,\r\nonly the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or Squire,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9ca man in a swoon has been known to be\r\nburied before now, in the belief that he was dead; and it struck me\r\nthat Queen Maguncia ought to have swooned rather than died; because\r\nwith life a great many things come right, and the princess\xe2\x80\x99s folly was\r\nnot so great that she need feel it so keenly. If the lady had married\r\nsome page of hers, or some other servant of the house, as many another\r\nhas done, so I have heard say, then the mischief would have been past\r\ncuring. But to marry such an elegant accomplished gentleman as has been\r\njust now described to us\xe2\x80\x94indeed, indeed, though it was a folly, it was\r\nnot such a great one as you think; for according to the rules of my\r\nmaster here\xe2\x80\x94and he won\xe2\x80\x99t allow me to lie\xe2\x80\x94as of men of letters bishops\r\nare made, so of gentlemen knights, specially if they be errant, kings\r\nand emperors may be made.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art right, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor with a knight-errant,\r\nif he has but two fingers\xe2\x80\x99 breadth of good fortune, it is on the cards\r\nto become the mightiest lord on earth. But let se\xc3\xb1ora the Distressed\r\nOne proceed; for I suspect she has got yet to tell us the bitter part\r\nof this so far sweet story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bitter is indeed to come,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess; \xe2\x80\x9cand such bitter\r\nthat colocynth is sweet and oleander toothsome in comparison. The\r\nqueen, then, being dead, and not in a swoon, we buried her; and hardly\r\nhad we covered her with earth, hardly had we said our last farewells,\r\nwhen, _quis talia fando temperet a lachrymis?_ over the queen\xe2\x80\x99s grave\r\nthere appeared, mounted upon a wooden horse, the giant Malambruno,\r\nMaguncia\xe2\x80\x99s first cousin, who besides being cruel is an enchanter; and\r\nhe, to revenge the death of his cousin, punish the audacity of Don\r\nClavijo, and in wrath at the contumacy of Antonomasia, left them both\r\nenchanted by his art on the grave itself; she being changed into an ape\r\nof brass, and he into a horrible crocodile of some unknown metal; while\r\nbetween the two there stands a pillar, also of metal, with certain\r\ncharacters in the Syriac language inscribed upon it, which, being\r\ntranslated into Kandian, and now into Castilian, contain the following\r\nsentence: \xe2\x80\x98These two rash lovers shall not recover their former shape\r\nuntil the valiant Manchegan comes to do battle with me in single\r\ncombat; for the Fates reserve this unexampled adventure for his mighty\r\nvalour alone.\xe2\x80\x99 This done, he drew from its sheath a huge broad\r\nscimitar, and seizing me by the hair he made as though he meant to cut\r\nmy throat and shear my head clean off. I was terror-stricken, my voice\r\nstuck in my throat, and I was in the deepest distress; nevertheless I\r\nsummoned up my strength as well as I could, and in a trembling and\r\npiteous voice I addressed such words to him as induced him to stay the\r\ninfliction of a punishment so severe. He then caused all the duennas of\r\nthe palace, those that are here present, to be brought before him; and\r\nafter having dwelt upon the enormity of our offence, and denounced\r\nduennas, their characters, their evil ways and worse intrigues, laying\r\nto the charge of all what I alone was guilty of, he said he would not\r\nvisit us with capital punishment, but with others of a slow nature\r\nwhich would be in effect civil death for ever; and the very instant he\r\nceased speaking we all felt the pores of our faces opening, and\r\npricking us, as if with the points of needles. We at once put our hands\r\nup to our faces and found ourselves in the state you now see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the Distressed One and the other duennas raised the veils with\r\nwhich they were covered, and disclosed countenances all bristling with\r\nbeards, some red, some black, some white, and some grizzled, at which\r\nspectacle the duke and duchess made a show of being filled with wonder.\r\nDon Quixote and Sancho were overwhelmed with amazement, and the\r\nbystanders lost in astonishment, while the Trifaldi went on to say:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus did that malevolent villain Malambruno punish us, covering the\r\ntenderness and softness of our faces with these rough bristles! Would\r\nto heaven that he had swept off our heads with his enormous scimitar\r\ninstead of obscuring the light of our countenances with these\r\nwool-combings that cover us! For if we look into the matter, sirs (and\r\nwhat I am now going to say I would say with eyes flowing like\r\nfountains, only that the thought of our misfortune and the oceans they\r\nhave already wept, keep them as dry as barley spears, and so I say it\r\nwithout tears), where, I ask, can a duenna with a beard go to? What\r\nfather or mother will feel pity for her? Who will help her? For, if\r\neven when she has a smooth skin, and a face tortured by a thousand\r\nkinds of washes and cosmetics, she can hardly get anybody to love her,\r\nwhat will she do when she shows a countenance turned into a thicket? Oh\r\nduennas, companions mine! it was an unlucky moment when we were born\r\nand an ill-starred hour when our fathers begot us!\xe2\x80\x9d And as she said\r\nthis she showed signs of being about to faint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np39e.jpg (27K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nOF MATTERS RELATING AND BELONGING TO THIS ADVENTURE AND TO THIS\r\nMEMORABLE HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np40a.jpg (129K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVerily and truly all those who find pleasure in histories like this\r\nought show their gratitude to Cide Hamete, its original author, for the\r\nscrupulous care he has taken to set before us all its minute\r\nparticulars, not leaving anything, however trifling it may be, that he\r\ndoes not make clear and plain. He portrays the thoughts, he reveals the\r\nfancies, he answers implied questions, clears up doubts, sets\r\nobjections at rest, and, in a word, makes plain the smallest points the\r\nmost inquisitive can desire to know. O renowned author! O happy Don\r\nQuixote! O famous famous droll Sancho! All and each, may ye live\r\ncountless ages for the delight and amusement of the dwellers on earth!\r\n\r\nThe history goes on to say that when Sancho saw the Distressed One\r\nfaint he exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cI swear by the faith of an honest man and the\r\nshades of all my ancestors the Panzas, that never I did see or hear of,\r\nnor has my master related or conceived in his mind, such an adventure\r\nas this. A thousand devils\xe2\x80\x94not to curse thee\xe2\x80\x94take thee, Malambruno, for\r\nan enchanter and a giant! Couldst thou find no other sort of punishment\r\nfor these sinners but bearding them? Would it not have been better\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwould have been better for them\xe2\x80\x94to have taken off half their noses from\r\nthe middle upwards, even though they\xe2\x80\x99d have snuffled when they spoke,\r\nthan to have put beards on them? I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet they have not the means of\r\npaying anybody to shave them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the truth, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the twelve; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have not the\r\nmoney to get ourselves shaved, and so we have, some of us, taken to\r\nusing sticking-plasters by way of an economical remedy, for by applying\r\nthem to our faces and plucking them off with a jerk we are left as bare\r\nand smooth as the bottom of a stone mortar. There are, to be sure,\r\nwomen in Kandy that go about from house to house to remove down, and\r\ntrim eyebrows, and make cosmetics for the use of the women, but we, the\r\nduennas of my lady, would never let them in, for most of them have a\r\nflavour of agents that have ceased to be principals; and if we are not\r\nrelieved by Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote we shall be carried to our graves with\r\nbeards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will pluck out my own in the land of the Moors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif I don\xe2\x80\x99t cure yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this instant the Trifaldi recovered from her swoon and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nchink of that promise, valiant knight, reached my ears in the midst of\r\nmy swoon, and has been the means of reviving me and bringing back my\r\nsenses; and so once more I implore you, illustrious errant, indomitable\r\nsir, to let your gracious promises be turned into deeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere shall be no delay on my part,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cBethink you,\r\nse\xc3\xb1ora, of what I must do, for my heart is most eager to serve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Distressed One, \xe2\x80\x9cit is five thousand\r\nleagues, a couple more or less, from this to the kingdom of Kandy, if\r\nyou go by land; but if you go through the air and in a straight line,\r\nit is three thousand two hundred and twenty-seven. You must know, too,\r\nthat Malambruno told me that, whenever fate provided the knight our\r\ndeliverer, he himself would send him a steed far better and with less\r\ntricks than a post-horse; for he will be that same wooden horse on\r\nwhich the valiant Pierres carried off the fair Magalona; which said\r\nhorse is guided by a peg he has in his forehead that serves for a\r\nbridle, and flies through the air with such rapidity that you would\r\nfancy the very devils were carrying him. This horse, according to\r\nancient tradition, was made by Merlin. He lent him to Pierres, who was\r\na friend of his, and who made long journeys with him, and, as has been\r\nsaid, carried off the fair Magalona, bearing her through the air on its\r\nhaunches and making all who beheld them from the earth gape with\r\nastonishment; and he never lent him save to those whom he loved or\r\nthose who paid him well; and since the great Pierres we know of no one\r\nhaving mounted him until now. From him Malambruno stole him by his\r\nmagic art, and he has him now in his possession, and makes use of him\r\nin his journeys which he constantly makes through different parts of\r\nthe world; he is here to-day, to-morrow in France, and the next day in\r\nPotosi; and the best of it is the said horse neither eats nor sleeps\r\nnor wears out shoes, and goes at an ambling pace through the air\r\nwithout wings, so that he whom he has mounted upon him can carry a cup\r\nfull of water in his hand without spilling a drop, so smoothly and\r\neasily does he go, for which reason the fair Magalona enjoyed riding\r\nhim greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor going smoothly and easily,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho at this, \xe2\x80\x9cgive me my\r\nDapple, though he can\xe2\x80\x99t go through the air; but on the ground I\xe2\x80\x99ll back\r\nhim against all the amblers in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all laughed, and the Distressed One continued: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this same\r\nhorse, if so be that Malambruno is disposed to put an end to our\r\nsufferings, will be here before us ere the night shall have advanced\r\nhalf an hour; for he announced to me that the sign he would give me\r\nwhereby I might know that I had found the knight I was in quest of,\r\nwould be to send me the horse wherever he might be, speedily and\r\npromptly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how many is there room for on this horse?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Distressed One, \xe2\x80\x9cone in the saddle, and the other on\r\nthe croup; and generally these two are knight and squire, when there is\r\nno damsel that\xe2\x80\x99s being carried off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to know, Se\xc3\xb1ora Distressed One,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the\r\nname of this horse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Distressed One, \xe2\x80\x9cis not the same as Bellerophon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorse that was called Pegasus, or Alexander the Great\xe2\x80\x99s, called\r\nBucephalus, or Orlando Furioso\xe2\x80\x99s, the name of which was Brigliador, nor\r\nyet Bayard, the horse of Reinaldos of Montalvan, nor Frontino like\r\nRuggiero\xe2\x80\x99s, nor Bootes or Peritoa, as they say the horses of the sun\r\nwere called, nor is he called Orelia, like the horse on which the\r\nunfortunate Rodrigo, the last king of the Goths, rode to the battle\r\nwhere he lost his life and his kingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat as they have given him none of these\r\nfamous names of well-known horses, no more have they given him the name\r\nof my master\xe2\x80\x99s Rocinante, which for being apt surpasses all that have\r\nbeen mentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bearded countess, \xe2\x80\x9cstill it fits him very\r\nwell, for he is called Clavile\xc3\xb1o the Swift, which name is in accordance\r\nwith his being made of wood, with the peg he has in his forehead, and\r\nwith the swift pace at which he travels; and so, as far as name goes,\r\nhe may compare with the famous Rocinante.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to say against his name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut with what\r\nsort of bridle or halter is he managed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said already,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Trifaldi, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it is with a peg, by\r\nturning which to one side or the other the knight who rides him makes\r\nhim go as he pleases, either through the upper air, or skimming and\r\nalmost sweeping the earth, or else in that middle course that is sought\r\nand followed in all well-regulated proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut to fancy I\xe2\x80\x99m going to mount\r\nhim, either in the saddle or on the croup, is to ask pears of the elm\r\ntree. A good joke indeed! I can hardly keep my seat upon Dapple, and on\r\na pack-saddle softer than silk itself, and here they\xe2\x80\x99d have me hold on\r\nupon haunches of plank without pad or cushion of any sort! Gad, I have\r\nno notion of bruising myself to get rid of anyone\xe2\x80\x99s beard; let each one\r\nshave himself as best he can; I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to accompany my master on\r\nany such long journey; besides, I can\xe2\x80\x99t give any help to the shaving of\r\nthese beards as I can to the disenchantment of my lady Dulcinea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you can, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Trifaldi; \xe2\x80\x9cand so much, that\r\nwithout you, so I understand, we shall be able to do nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the king\xe2\x80\x99s name!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat have squires got to do\r\nwith the adventures of their masters? Are they to have the fame of such\r\nas they go through, and we the labour? Body o\xe2\x80\x99 me! if the historians\r\nwould only say, \xe2\x80\x98Such and such a knight finished such and such an\r\nadventure, but with the help of so and so, his squire, without which it\r\nwould have been impossible for him to accomplish it;\xe2\x80\x99 but they write\r\ncurtly, \xe2\x80\x9cDon Paralipomenon of the Three Stars accomplished the\r\nadventure of the six monsters;\xe2\x80\x99 without mentioning such a person as his\r\nsquire, who was there all the time, just as if there was no such being.\r\nOnce more, sirs, I say my master may go alone, and much good may it do\r\nhim; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here in the company of my lady the duchess; and\r\nmaybe when he comes back, he will find the lady Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s affair ever\r\nso much advanced; for I mean in leisure hours, and at idle moments, to\r\ngive myself a spell of whipping without so much as a hair to cover me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that you must go if it be necessary, my good Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nduchess, \xe2\x80\x9cfor they are worthy folk who ask you; and the faces of these\r\nladies must not remain overgrown in this way because of your idle\r\nfears; that would be a hard case indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the king\xe2\x80\x99s name, once more!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cIf this charitable work\r\nwere to be done for the sake of damsels in confinement or\r\ncharity-girls, a man might expose himself to some hardships; but to\r\nbear it for the sake of stripping beards off duennas! Devil take it!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d sooner see them all bearded, from the highest to the lowest, and\r\nfrom the most prudish to the most affected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very hard on duennas, Sancho my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou incline very much to the opinion of the Toledo apothecary. But\r\nindeed you are wrong; there are duennas in my house that may serve as\r\npatterns of duennas; and here is my Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez, who will not allow\r\nme to say otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellence may say it if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rodriguez; \xe2\x80\x9cfor God\r\nknows the truth of everything; and whether we duennas are good or bad,\r\nbearded or smooth, we are our mothers\xe2\x80\x99 daughters like other women; and\r\nas God sent us into the world, he knows why he did, and on his mercy I\r\nrely, and not on anybody\xe2\x80\x99s beard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Se\xc3\xb1ora Rodriguez, Se\xc3\xb1ora Trifaldi, and present company,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDon Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI trust in Heaven that it will look with kindly eyes upon\r\nyour troubles, for Sancho will do as I bid him. Only let Clavile\xc3\xb1o come\r\nand let me find myself face to face with Malambruno, and I am certain\r\nno razor will shave you more easily than my sword shall shave\r\nMalambruno\xe2\x80\x99s head off his shoulders; for \xe2\x80\x98God bears with the wicked,\r\nbut not for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Distressed One at this, \xe2\x80\x9cmay all the stars of the\r\ncelestial regions look down upon your greatness with benign eyes,\r\nvaliant knight, and shed every prosperity and valour upon your heart,\r\nthat it may be the shield and safeguard of the abused and downtrodden\r\nrace of duennas, detested by apothecaries, sneered at by squires, and\r\nmade game of by pages. Ill betide the jade that in the flower of her\r\nyouth would not sooner become a nun than a duenna! Unfortunate beings\r\nthat we are, we duennas! Though we may be descended in the direct male\r\nline from Hector of Troy himself, our mistresses never fail to address\r\nus as \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99 if they think it makes queens of them. O giant Malambruno,\r\nthough thou art an enchanter, thou art true to thy promises. Send us\r\nnow the peerless Clavile\xc3\xb1o, that our misfortune may be brought to an\r\nend; for if the hot weather sets in and these beards of ours are still\r\nthere, alas for our lot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Trifaldi said this in such a pathetic way that she drew tears from\r\nthe eyes of all and even Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s filled up; and he resolved in his\r\nheart to accompany his master to the uttermost ends of the earth, if so\r\nbe the removal of the wool from those venerable countenances depended\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np40e.jpg (13K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nOF THE ARRIVAL OF CLAVILE\xc3\x91O AND THE END OF THIS PROTRACTED ADVENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np41a.jpg (138K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now night came, and with it the appointed time for the arrival of\r\nthe famous horse Clavile\xc3\xb1o, the non-appearance of which was already\r\nbeginning to make Don Quixote uneasy, for it struck him that, as\r\nMalambruno was so long about sending it, either he himself was not the\r\nknight for whom the adventure was reserved, or else Malambruno did not\r\ndare to meet him in single combat. But lo! suddenly there came into the\r\ngarden four wild-men all clad in green ivy bearing on their shoulders a\r\ngreat wooden horse. They placed it on its feet on the ground, and one\r\nof the wild-men said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet the knight who has heart for it mount this\r\nmachine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Sancho exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mount, for neither have I the heart nor\r\nam I a knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd let the squire, if he has one,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the wild-man, \xe2\x80\x9ctake his\r\nseat on the croup, and let him trust the valiant Malambruno; for by no\r\nsword save his, nor by the malice of any other, shall he be assailed.\r\nIt is but to turn this peg the horse has in his neck, and he will bear\r\nthem through the air to where Malambruno awaits them; but lest the vast\r\nelevation of their course should make them giddy, their eyes must be\r\ncovered until the horse neighs, which will be the sign of their having\r\ncompleted their journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, leaving Clavile\xc3\xb1o behind them, they retired with easy\r\ndignity the way they came. As soon as the Distressed One saw the horse,\r\nalmost in tears she exclaimed to Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cValiant knight, the\r\npromise of Malambruno has proved trustworthy; the horse has come, our\r\nbeards are growing, and by every hair in them all of us implore thee to\r\nshave and shear us, as it is only mounting him with thy squire and\r\nmaking a happy beginning with your new journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will, Se\xc3\xb1ora Countess Trifaldi,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cmost gladly\r\nand with right goodwill, without stopping to take a cushion or put on\r\nmy spurs, so as not to lose time, such is my desire to see you and all\r\nthese duennas shaved clean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwith good-will or bad-will, or any way at\r\nall; and if this shaving can\xe2\x80\x99t be done without my mounting on the\r\ncroup, my master had better look out for another squire to go with him,\r\nand these ladies for some other way of making their faces smooth; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nno witch to have a taste for travelling through the air. What would my\r\nislanders say when they heard their governor was going, strolling about\r\non the winds? And another thing, as it is three thousand and odd\r\nleagues from this to Kandy, if the horse tires, or the giant takes\r\nhuff, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be half a dozen years getting back, and there won\xe2\x80\x99t be isle\r\nor island in the world that will know me: and so, as it is a common\r\nsaying \xe2\x80\x98in delay there\xe2\x80\x99s danger,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98when they offer thee a heifer\r\nrun with a halter,\xe2\x80\x99 these ladies\xe2\x80\x99 beards must excuse me; \xe2\x80\x98Saint Peter\r\nis very well in Rome;\xe2\x80\x99 I mean I am very well in this house where so\r\nmuch is made of me, and I hope for such a good thing from the master as\r\nto see myself a governor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke at this, \xe2\x80\x9cthe island that I have\r\npromised you is not a moving one, or one that will run away; it has\r\nroots so deeply buried in the bowels of the earth that it will be no\r\neasy matter to pluck it up or shift it from where it is; you know as\r\nwell as I do that there is no sort of office of any importance that is\r\nnot obtained by a bribe of some kind, great or small; well then, that\r\nwhich I look to receive for this government is that you go with your\r\nmaster Don Quixote, and bring this memorable adventure to a conclusion;\r\nand whether you return on Clavile\xc3\xb1o as quickly as his speed seems to\r\npromise, or adverse fortune brings you back on foot travelling as a\r\npilgrim from hostel to hostel and from inn to inn, you will always find\r\nyour island on your return where you left it, and your islanders with\r\nthe same eagerness they have always had to receive you as their\r\ngovernor, and my good-will will remain the same; doubt not the truth of\r\nthis, Se\xc3\xb1or Sancho, for that would be grievously wronging my\r\ndisposition to serve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay no more, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI am a poor squire and not equal to\r\ncarrying so much courtesy; let my master mount; bandage my eyes and\r\ncommit me to God\xe2\x80\x99s care, and tell me if I may commend myself to our\r\nLord or call upon the angels to protect me when we go towering up\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this the Trifaldi made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho, you may freely commend\r\nyourself to God or whom you will; for Malambruno though an enchanter is\r\na Christian, and works his enchantments with great circumspection,\r\ntaking very good care not to fall out with anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cGod and the most holy Trinity of Gaeta give\r\nme help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince the memorable adventure of the fulling mills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen Sancho in such a fright as now; were I as\r\nsuperstitious as others his abject fear would cause me some little\r\ntrepidation of spirit. But come here, Sancho, for with the leave of\r\nthese gentles I would say a word or two to thee in private;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ndrawing Sancho aside among the trees of the garden and seizing both his\r\nhands he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThou seest, brother Sancho, the long journey we have\r\nbefore us, and God knows when we shall return, or what leisure or\r\nopportunities this business will allow us; I wish thee therefore to\r\nretire now to thy chamber, as though thou wert going to fetch something\r\nrequired for the road, and in a trice give thyself if it be only five\r\nhundred lashes on account of the three thousand three hundred to which\r\nthou art bound; it will be all to the good, and to make a beginning\r\nwith a thing is to have it half finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut your worship must be out of your senses!\r\nThis is like the common saying, \xe2\x80\x98You see me with child, and you want me\r\na virgin.\xe2\x80\x99 Just as I\xe2\x80\x99m about to go sitting on a bare board, your\r\nworship would have me score my backside! Indeed, your worship is not\r\nreasonable. Let us be off to shave these duennas; and on our return I\r\npromise on my word to make such haste to wipe off all that\xe2\x80\x99s due as\r\nwill satisfy your worship; I can\xe2\x80\x99t say more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will comfort myself with that promise, my good Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand I believe thou wilt keep it; for indeed\r\nthough stupid thou art veracious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not voracious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9conly peckish; but even if I was a\r\nlittle, still I\xe2\x80\x99d keep my word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this they went back to mount Clavile\xc3\xb1o, and as they were about to\r\ndo so Don Quixote said, \xe2\x80\x9cCover thine eyes, Sancho, and mount; for one\r\nwho sends for us from lands so far distant cannot mean to deceive us\r\nfor the sake of the paltry glory to be derived from deceiving persons\r\nwho trust in him; though all should turn out the contrary of what I\r\nhope, no malice will be able to dim the glory of having undertaken this\r\nexploit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us be off, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have taken the beards and\r\ntears of these ladies deeply to heart, and I shan\xe2\x80\x99t eat a bit to relish\r\nit until I have seen them restored to their former smoothness. Mount,\r\nyour worship, and blindfold yourself, for if I am to go on the croup,\r\nit is plain the rider in the saddle must mount first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, and, taking a handkerchief out of his\r\npocket, he begged the Distressed One to bandage his eyes very\r\ncarefully; but after having them bandaged he uncovered them again,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cIf my memory does not deceive me, I have read in Virgil of the\r\nPalladium of Troy, a wooden horse the Greeks offered to the goddess\r\nPallas, which was big with armed knights, who were afterwards the\r\ndestruction of Troy; so it would be as well to see, first of all, what\r\nClavile\xc3\xb1o has in his stomach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no occasion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Distressed One; \xe2\x80\x9cI will be bail for\r\nhim, and I know that Malambruno has nothing tricky or treacherous about\r\nhim; you may mount without any fear, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote; on my head be\r\nit if any harm befalls you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote thought that to say anything further with regard to his\r\nsafety would be putting his courage in an unfavourable light; and so,\r\nwithout more words, he mounted Clavile\xc3\xb1o, and tried the peg, which\r\nturned easily; and as he had no stirrups and his legs hung down, he\r\nlooked like nothing so much as a figure in some Roman triumph painted\r\nor embroidered on a Flemish tapestry.\r\n\r\nMuch against the grain, and very slowly, Sancho proceeded to mount,\r\nand, after settling himself as well as he could on the croup, found it\r\nrather hard, and not at all soft, and asked the duke if it would be\r\npossible to oblige him with a pad of some kind, or a cushion; even if\r\nit were off the couch of his lady the duchess, or the bed of one of the\r\npages; as the haunches of that horse were more like marble than wood.\r\nOn this the Trifaldi observed that Clavile\xc3\xb1o would not bear any kind of\r\nharness or trappings, and that his best plan would be to sit sideways\r\nlike a woman, as in that way he would not feel the hardness so much.\r\n\r\nSancho did so, and, bidding them farewell, allowed his eyes to be\r\nbandaged, but immediately afterwards uncovered them again, and looking\r\ntenderly and tearfully on those in the garden, bade them help him in\r\nhis present strait with plenty of Paternosters and Ave Marias, that God\r\nmight provide someone to say as many for them, whenever they found\r\nthemselves in a similar emergency.\r\n\r\nAt this Don Quixote exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cArt thou on the gallows, thief, or at\r\nthy last moment, to use pitiful entreaties of that sort? Cowardly,\r\nspiritless creature, art thou not in the very place the fair Magalona\r\noccupied, and from which she descended, not into the grave, but to\r\nbecome Queen of France; unless the histories lie? And I who am here\r\nbeside thee, may I not put myself on a par with the valiant Pierres,\r\nwho pressed this very spot that I now press? Cover thine eyes, cover\r\nthine eyes, abject animal, and let not thy fear escape thy lips, at\r\nleast in my presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlindfold me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cas you won\xe2\x80\x99t let me commend myself or be\r\ncommended to God, is it any wonder if I am afraid there is a region of\r\ndevils about here that will carry us off to Peralvillo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were then blindfolded, and Don Quixote, finding himself settled to\r\nhis satisfaction, felt for the peg, and the instant he placed his\r\nfingers on it, all the duennas and all who stood by lifted up their\r\nvoices exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cGod guide thee, valiant knight! God be with thee,\r\nintrepid squire! Now, now ye go cleaving the air more swiftly than an\r\narrow! Now ye begin to amaze and astonish all who are gazing at you\r\nfrom the earth! Take care not to wobble about, valiant Sancho! Mind\r\nthou fall not, for thy fall will be worse than that rash youth\xe2\x80\x99s who\r\ntried to steer the chariot of his father the Sun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Sancho heard the voices, clinging tightly to his master and winding\r\nhis arms round him, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, how do they make out we are going\r\nup so high, if their voices reach us here and they seem to be speaking\r\nquite close to us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind that, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor as affairs of this\r\nsort, and flights like this are out of the common course of things, you\r\ncan see and hear as much as you like a thousand leagues off; but don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsqueeze me so tight or thou wilt upset me; and really I know not what\r\nthou hast to be uneasy or frightened at, for I can safely swear I never\r\nmounted a smoother-going steed all the days of my life; one would fancy\r\nwe never stirred from one place. Banish fear, my friend, for indeed\r\neverything is going as it ought, and we have the wind astern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor such a strong wind comes against me on\r\nthis side, that it seems as if people were blowing on me with a\r\nthousand pair of bellows;\xe2\x80\x9d which was the case; they were puffing at him\r\nwith a great pair of bellows; for the whole adventure was so well\r\nplanned by the duke, the duchess, and their majordomo, that nothing was\r\nomitted to make it perfectly successful.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote now, feeling the blast, said, \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond a doubt, Sancho, we\r\nmust have already reached the second region of the air, where the hail\r\nand snow are generated; the thunder, the lightning, and the\r\nthunderbolts are engendered in the third region, and if we go on\r\nascending at this rate, we shall shortly plunge into the region of\r\nfire, and I know not how to regulate this peg, so as not to mount up\r\nwhere we shall be burned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now they began to warm their faces, from a distance, with tow that\r\ncould be easily set on fire and extinguished again, fixed on the end of\r\na cane. On feeling the heat Sancho said, \xe2\x80\x9cMay I die if we are not\r\nalready in that fire place, or very near it, for a good part of my\r\nbeard has been singed, and I have a mind, se\xc3\xb1or, to uncover and see\r\nwhereabouts we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo nothing of the kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cremember the true story of\r\nthe licentiate Torralva that the devils carried flying through the air\r\nriding on a stick with his eyes shut; who in twelve hours reached Rome\r\nand dismounted at Torre di Nona, which is a street of the city, and saw\r\nthe whole sack and storming and the death of Bourbon, and was back in\r\nMadrid the next morning, where he gave an account of all he had seen;\r\nand he said moreover that as he was going through the air, the devil\r\nbade him open his eyes, and he did so, and saw himself so near the body\r\nof the moon, so it seemed to him, that he could have laid hold of it\r\nwith his hand, and that he did not dare to look at the earth lest he\r\nshould be seized with giddiness. So that, Sancho, it will not do for us\r\nto uncover ourselves, for he who has us in charge will be responsible\r\nfor us; and perhaps we are gaining an altitude and mounting up to\r\nenable us to descend at one swoop on the kingdom of Kandy, as the saker\r\nor falcon does on the heron, so as to seize it however high it may\r\nsoar; and though it seems to us not half an hour since we left the\r\ngarden, believe me we must have travelled a great distance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how that may be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9call I know is that if the\r\nSe\xc3\xb1ora Magallanes or Magalona was satisfied with this croup, she could\r\nnot have been very tender of flesh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke, the duchess, and all in the garden were listening to the\r\nconversation of the two heroes, and were beyond measure amused by it;\r\nand now, desirous of putting a finishing touch to this rare and\r\nwell-contrived adventure, they applied a light to Clavile\xc3\xb1o\xe2\x80\x99s tail with\r\nsome tow, and the horse, being full of squibs and crackers, immediately\r\nblew up with a prodigious noise, and brought Don Quixote and Sancho\r\nPanza to the ground half singed. By this time the bearded band of\r\nduennas, the Trifaldi and all, had vanished from the garden, and those\r\nthat remained lay stretched on the ground as if in a swoon. Don Quixote\r\nand Sancho got up rather shaken, and, looking about them, were filled\r\nwith amazement at finding themselves in the same garden from which they\r\nhad started, and seeing such a number of people stretched on the\r\nground; and their astonishment was increased when at one side of the\r\ngarden they perceived a tall lance planted in the ground, and hanging\r\nfrom it by two cords of green silk a smooth white parchment on which\r\nthere was the following inscription in large gold letters: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nillustrious knight Don Quixote of La Mancha has, by merely attempting\r\nit, finished and concluded the adventure of the Countess Trifaldi,\r\notherwise called the Distressed Duenna; Malambruno is now satisfied on\r\nevery point, the chins of the duennas are now smooth and clean, and\r\nKing Don Clavijo and Queen Antonomasia in their original form; and when\r\nthe squirely flagellation shall have been completed, the white dove\r\nshall find herself delivered from the pestiferous gerfalcons that\r\npersecute her, and in the arms of her beloved mate; for such is the\r\ndecree of the sage Merlin, arch-enchanter of enchanters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as Don Quixote had read the inscription on the parchment he\r\nperceived clearly that it referred to the disenchantment of Dulcinea,\r\nand returning hearty thanks to heaven that he had with so little danger\r\nachieved so grand an exploit as to restore to their former complexion\r\nthe countenances of those venerable duennas, he advanced towards the\r\nduke and duchess, who had not yet come to themselves, and taking the\r\nduke by the hand he said, \xe2\x80\x9cBe of good cheer, worthy sir, be of good\r\ncheer; it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing at all; the adventure is now over and without any\r\nharm done, as the inscription fixed on this post shows plainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke came to himself slowly and like one recovering consciousness\r\nafter a heavy sleep, and the duchess and all who had fallen prostrate\r\nabout the garden did the same, with such demonstrations of wonder and\r\namazement that they would have almost persuaded one that what they\r\npretended so adroitly in jest had happened to them in reality. The duke\r\nread the placard with half-shut eyes, and then ran to embrace Don\r\nQuixote with open arms, declaring him to be the best knight that had\r\never been seen in any age. Sancho kept looking about for the Distressed\r\nOne, to see what her face was like without the beard, and if she was as\r\nfair as her elegant person promised; but they told him that, the\r\ninstant Clavile\xc3\xb1o descended flaming through the air and came to the\r\nground, the whole band of duennas with the Trifaldi vanished, and that\r\nthey were already shaved and without a stump left.\r\n\r\nThe duchess asked Sancho how he had fared on that long journey, to\r\nwhich Sancho replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI felt, se\xc3\xb1ora, that we were flying through the\r\nregion of fire, as my master told me, and I wanted to uncover my eyes\r\nfor a bit; but my master, when I asked leave to uncover myself, would\r\nnot let me; but as I have a little bit of curiosity about me, and a\r\ndesire to know what is forbidden and kept from me, quietly and without\r\nanyone seeing me I drew aside the handkerchief covering my eyes ever so\r\nlittle, close to my nose, and from underneath looked towards the earth,\r\nand it seemed to me that it was altogether no bigger than a grain of\r\nmustard seed, and that the men walking on it were little bigger than\r\nhazel nuts; so you may see how high we must have got to then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this the duchess said, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho, my friend, mind what you are saying;\r\nit seems you could not have seen the earth, but only the men walking on\r\nit; for if the earth looked to you like a grain of mustard seed, and\r\neach man like a hazel nut, one man alone would have covered the whole\r\nearth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut for all that I got a glimpse of a bit\r\nof one side of it, and saw it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a bit of one side one does\r\nnot see the whole of what one looks at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that way of looking at things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nonly know that your ladyship will do well to bear in mind that as we\r\nwere flying by enchantment so I might have seen the whole earth and all\r\nthe men by enchantment whatever way I looked; and if you won\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nthis, no more will you believe that, uncovering myself nearly to the\r\neyebrows, I saw myself so close to the sky that there was not a palm\r\nand a half between me and it; and by everything that I can swear by,\r\nse\xc3\xb1ora, it is mighty great! And it so happened we came by where the\r\nseven goats are, and by God and upon my soul, as in my youth I was a\r\ngoatherd in my own country, as soon as I saw them I felt a longing to\r\nbe among them for a little, and if I had not given way to it I think\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d have burst. So I come and take, and what do I do? without saying\r\nanything to anybody, not even to my master, softly and quietly I got\r\ndown from Clavile\xc3\xb1o and amused myself with the goats\xe2\x80\x94which are like\r\nviolets, like flowers\xe2\x80\x94for nigh three-quarters of an hour; and Clavile\xc3\xb1o\r\nnever stirred or moved from one spot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd while the good Sancho was amusing himself with the goats,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe duke, \xe2\x80\x9chow did Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote amuse himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAs all these things and such like\r\noccurrences are out of the ordinary course of nature, it is no wonder\r\nthat Sancho says what he does; for my own part I can only say that I\r\ndid not uncover my eyes either above or below, nor did I see sky or\r\nearth or sea or shore. It is true I felt that I was passing through the\r\nregion of the air, and even that I touched that of fire; but that we\r\npassed farther I cannot believe; for the region of fire being between\r\nthe heaven of the moon and the last region of the air, we could not\r\nhave reached that heaven where the seven goats Sancho speaks of are\r\nwithout being burned; and as we were not burned, either Sancho is lying\r\nor Sancho is dreaming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am neither lying nor dreaming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9conly ask me the tokens\r\nof those same goats, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see by that whether I\xe2\x80\x99m telling the\r\ntruth or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell us them then, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9care green, two blood-red, two blue, and\r\none a mixture of all colours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn odd sort of goat, that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke; \xe2\x80\x9cin this earthly region of\r\nours we have no such colours; I mean goats of such colours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very plain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cof course there must be a difference\r\nbetween the goats of heaven and the goats of the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you see any he-goat among those\r\ngoats?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have heard say that none ever passed\r\nthe horns of the moon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did not care to ask him anything more about his journey, for they\r\nsaw he was in the vein to go rambling all over the heavens giving an\r\naccount of everything that went on there, without having ever stirred\r\nfrom the garden. Such, in short, was the end of the adventure of the\r\nDistressed Duenna, which gave the duke and duchess laughing matter not\r\nonly for the time being, but for all their lives, and Sancho something\r\nto talk about for ages, if he lived so long; but Don Quixote, coming\r\nclose to his ear, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho, as you would have us believe\r\nwhat you saw in heaven, I require you to believe me as to what I saw in\r\nthe cave of Montesinos; I say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np41e.jpg (38K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\nOF THE COUNSELS WHICH DON QUIXOTE GAVE SANCHO PANZA BEFORE HE SET OUT\r\nTO GOVERN THE ISLAND, TOGETHER WITH OTHER WELL-CONSIDERED MATTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np42a.jpg (120K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duke and duchess were so well pleased with the successful and droll\r\nresult of the adventure of the Distressed One, that they resolved to\r\ncarry on the joke, seeing what a fit subject they had to deal with for\r\nmaking it all pass for reality. So having laid their plans and given\r\ninstructions to their servants and vassals how to behave to Sancho in\r\nhis government of the promised island, the next day, that following\r\nClavile\xc3\xb1o\xe2\x80\x99s flight, the duke told Sancho to prepare and get ready to go\r\nand be governor, for his islanders were already looking out for him as\r\nfor the showers of May.\r\n\r\nSancho made him an obeisance, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cEver since I came down from\r\nheaven, and from the top of it beheld the earth, and saw how little it\r\nis, the great desire I had to be a governor has been partly cooled in\r\nme; for what is there grand in being ruler on a grain of mustard seed,\r\nor what dignity or authority in governing half a dozen men about as big\r\nas hazel nuts; for, so far as I could see, there were no more on the\r\nwhole earth? If your lordship would be so good as to give me ever so\r\nsmall a bit of heaven, were it no more than half a league, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather\r\nhave it than the best island in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecollect, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot give a bit of heaven, no\r\nnot so much as the breadth of my nail, to anyone; rewards and favours\r\nof that sort are reserved for God alone. What I can give I give you,\r\nand that is a real, genuine island, compact, well proportioned, and\r\nuncommonly fertile and fruitful, where, if you know how to use your\r\nopportunities, you may, with the help of the world\xe2\x80\x99s riches, gain those\r\nof heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9clet the island come; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try and be\r\nsuch a governor, that in spite of scoundrels I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to heaven; and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not from any craving to quit my own humble condition or better\r\nmyself, but from the desire I have to try what it tastes like to be a\r\ngovernor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you once make trial of it, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll eat your\r\nfingers off after the government, so sweet a thing is it to command and\r\nbe obeyed. Depend upon it when your master comes to be emperor (as he\r\nwill beyond a doubt from the course his affairs are taking), it will be\r\nno easy matter to wrest the dignity from him, and he will be sore and\r\nsorry at heart to have been so long without becoming one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cit is my belief it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing to be in\r\ncommand, if it\xe2\x80\x99s only over a drove of cattle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I be buried with you, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you know\r\neverything; I hope you will make as good a governor as your sagacity\r\npromises; and that is all I have to say; and now remember to-morrow is\r\nthe day you must set out for the government of the island, and this\r\nevening they will provide you with the proper attire for you to wear,\r\nand all things requisite for your departure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them dress me as they like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9chowever I\xe2\x80\x99m dressed\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be Sancho Panza.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke; \xe2\x80\x9cbut one\xe2\x80\x99s dress must be suited to the\r\noffice or rank one holds; for it would not do for a jurist to dress\r\nlike a soldier, or a soldier like a priest. You, Sancho, shall go\r\npartly as a lawyer, partly as a captain, for, in the island I am giving\r\nyou, arms are needed as much as letters, and letters as much as arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf letters I know but little,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know the\r\nA B C; but it is enough for me to have the Christus in my memory to be\r\na good governor. As for arms, I\xe2\x80\x99ll handle those they give me till I\r\ndrop, and then, God be my help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith so good a memory,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho cannot go wrong in\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Don Quixote joined them; and learning what passed, and how soon\r\nSancho was to go to his government, he with the duke\xe2\x80\x99s permission took\r\nhim by the hand, and retired to his room with him for the purpose of\r\ngiving him advice as to how he was to demean himself in his office. As\r\nsoon as they had entered the chamber he closed the door after him, and\r\nalmost by force made Sancho sit down beside him, and in a quiet tone\r\nthus addressed him: \xe2\x80\x9cI give infinite thanks to heaven, friend Sancho,\r\nthat, before I have met with any good luck, fortune has come forward to\r\nmeet thee. I who counted upon my good fortune to discharge the\r\nrecompense of thy services, find myself still waiting for advancement,\r\nwhile thou, before the time, and contrary to all reasonable\r\nexpectation, seest thyself blessed in the fulfillment of thy desires.\r\nSome will bribe, beg, solicit, rise early, entreat, persist, without\r\nattaining the object of their suit; while another comes, and without\r\nknowing why or wherefore, finds himself invested with the place or\r\noffice so many have sued for; and here it is that the common saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is good luck as well as bad luck in suits,\xe2\x80\x99 applies. Thou, who,\r\nto my thinking, art beyond all doubt a dullard, without early rising or\r\nnight watching or taking any trouble, with the mere breath of\r\nknight-errantry that has breathed upon thee, seest thyself without more\r\nado governor of an island, as though it were a mere matter of course.\r\nThis I say, Sancho, that thou attribute not the favour thou hast\r\nreceived to thine own merits, but give thanks to heaven that disposes\r\nmatters beneficently, and secondly thanks to the great power the\r\nprofession of knight-errantry contains in itself. With a heart, then,\r\ninclined to believe what I have said to thee, attend, my son, to thy\r\nCato here who would counsel thee and be thy polestar and guide to\r\ndirect and pilot thee to a safe haven out of this stormy sea wherein\r\nthou art about to ingulf thyself; for offices and great trusts are\r\nnothing else but a mighty gulf of troubles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, my son, thou must fear God, for in the fear of him is\r\nwisdom, and being wise thou canst not err in aught.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecondly, thou must keep in view what thou art, striving to know\r\nthyself, the most difficult thing to know that the mind can imagine. If\r\nthou knowest thyself, it will follow thou wilt not puff thyself up like\r\nthe frog that strove to make himself as large as the ox; if thou dost,\r\nthe recollection of having kept pigs in thine own country will serve as\r\nthe ugly feet for the wheel of thy folly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that was when I was a boy;\r\nafterwards when I was something more of a man it was geese I kept, not\r\npigs. But to my thinking that has nothing to do with it; for all who\r\nare governors don\xe2\x80\x99t come of a kingly stock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand for that reason those who are not of\r\nnoble origin should take care that the dignity of the office they hold\r\nbe accompanied by a gentle suavity, which wisely managed will save them\r\nfrom the sneers of malice that no station escapes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlory in thy humble birth, Sancho, and be not ashamed of saying thou\r\nart peasant-born; for when it is seen thou art not ashamed no one will\r\nset himself to put thee to the blush; and pride thyself rather upon\r\nbeing one of lowly virtue than a lofty sinner. Countless are they who,\r\nborn of mean parentage, have risen to the highest dignities, pontifical\r\nand imperial, and of the truth of this I could give thee instances\r\nenough to weary thee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, Sancho, if thou make virtue thy aim, and take a pride in\r\ndoing virtuous actions, thou wilt have no cause to envy those who have\r\nprincely and lordly ones, for blood is an inheritance, but virtue an\r\nacquisition, and virtue has in itself alone a worth that blood does not\r\npossess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis being so, if perchance anyone of thy kinsfolk should come to see\r\nthee when thou art in thine island, thou art not to repel or slight\r\nhim, but on the contrary to welcome him, entertain him, and make much\r\nof him; for in so doing thou wilt be approved of heaven (which is not\r\npleased that any should despise what it hath made), and wilt comply\r\nwith the laws of well-ordered nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou carriest thy wife with thee (and it is not well for those that\r\nadminister governments to be long without their wives), teach and\r\ninstruct her, and strive to smooth down her natural roughness; for all\r\nthat may be gained by a wise governor may be lost and wasted by a\r\nboorish stupid wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf perchance thou art left a widower\xe2\x80\x94a thing which may happen\xe2\x80\x94and in\r\nvirtue of thy office seekest a consort of higher degree, choose not one\r\nto serve thee for a hook, or for a fishing-rod, or for the hood of thy\r\n\xe2\x80\x98won\xe2\x80\x99t have it;\xe2\x80\x99 for verily, I tell thee, for all the judge\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nreceives, the husband will be held accountable at the general calling\r\nto account; where he will have repay in death fourfold, items that in\r\nlife he regarded as naught.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever go by arbitrary law, which is so much favoured by ignorant men\r\nwho plume themselves on cleverness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the tears of the poor man find with thee more compassion, but not\r\nmore justice, than the pleadings of the rich.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrive to lay bare the truth, as well amid the promises and presents\r\nof the rich man, as amid the sobs and entreaties of the poor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen equity may and should be brought into play, press not the utmost\r\nrigour of the law against the guilty; for the reputation of the stern\r\njudge stands not higher than that of the compassionate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf perchance thou permittest the staff of justice to swerve, let it be\r\nnot by the weight of a gift, but by that of mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it should happen to thee to give judgment in the cause of one who\r\nis thine enemy, turn thy thoughts away from thy injury and fix them on\r\nthe justice of the case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet not thine own passion blind thee in another man\xe2\x80\x99s cause; for the\r\nerrors thou wilt thus commit will be most frequently irremediable; or\r\nif not, only to be remedied at the expense of thy good name and even of\r\nthy fortune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf any handsome woman come to seek justice of thee, turn away thine\r\neyes from her tears and thine ears from her lamentations, and consider\r\ndeliberately the merits of her demand, if thou wouldst not have thy\r\nreason swept away by her weeping, and thy rectitude by her sighs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbuse not by word him whom thou hast to punish in deed, for the pain\r\nof punishment is enough for the unfortunate without the addition of\r\nthine objurgations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBear in mind that the culprit who comes under thy jurisdiction is but\r\na miserable man subject to all the propensities of our depraved nature,\r\nand so far as may be in thy power show thyself lenient and forbearing;\r\nfor though the attributes of God are all equal, to our eyes that of\r\nmercy is brighter and loftier than that of justice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou followest these precepts and rules, Sancho, thy days will be\r\nlong, thy fame eternal, thy reward abundant, thy felicity unutterable;\r\nthou wilt marry thy children as thou wouldst; they and thy\r\ngrandchildren will bear titles; thou wilt live in peace and concord\r\nwith all men; and, when life draws to a close, death will come to thee\r\nin calm and ripe old age, and the light and loving hands of thy\r\ngreat-grandchildren will close thine eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I have thus far addressed to thee are instructions for the\r\nadornment of thy mind; listen now to those which tend to that of the\r\nbody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np42e.jpg (17K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\nOF THE SECOND SET OF COUNSELS DON QUIXOTE GAVE SANCHO PANZA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np43a.jpg (129K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho, hearing the foregoing discourse of Don Quixote, would not have set\r\nhim down for a person of great good sense and greater rectitude of\r\npurpose? But, as has been frequently observed in the course of this\r\ngreat history, he only talked nonsense when he touched on chivalry, and\r\nin discussing all other subjects showed that he had a clear and\r\nunbiassed understanding; so that at every turn his acts gave the lie to\r\nhis intellect, and his intellect to his acts; but in the case of these\r\nsecond counsels that he gave Sancho, he showed himself to have a lively\r\nturn of humour, and displayed conspicuously his wisdom, and also his\r\nfolly.\r\n\r\nSancho listened to him with the deepest attention, and endeavoured to\r\nfix his counsels in his memory, like one who meant to follow them and\r\nby their means bring the full promise of his government to a happy\r\nissue. Don Quixote, then, went on to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith regard to the mode in which thou shouldst govern thy person and\r\nthy house, Sancho, the first charge I have to give thee is to be clean,\r\nand to cut thy nails, not letting them grow as some do, whose ignorance\r\nmakes them fancy that long nails are an ornament to their hands, as if\r\nthose excrescences they neglect to cut were nails, and not the talons\r\nof a lizard-catching kestrel\xe2\x80\x94a filthy and unnatural abuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo not ungirt and loose, Sancho; for disordered attire is a sign of an\r\nunstable mind, unless indeed the slovenliness and slackness is to be\r\nset down to craft, as was the common opinion in the case of Julius\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAscertain cautiously what thy office may be worth; and if it will\r\nallow thee to give liveries to thy servants, give them respectable and\r\nserviceable, rather than showy and gay ones, and divide them between\r\nthy servants and the poor; that is to say, if thou canst clothe six\r\npages, clothe three and three poor men, and thus thou wilt have pages\r\nfor heaven and pages for earth; the vainglorious never think of this\r\nnew mode of giving liveries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEat not garlic nor onions, lest they find out thy boorish origin by\r\nthe smell; walk slowly and speak deliberately, but not in such a way as\r\nto make it seem thou art listening to thyself, for all affectation is\r\nbad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDine sparingly and sup more sparingly still; for the health of the\r\nwhole body is forged in the workshop of the stomach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe temperate in drinking, bearing in mind that wine in excess keeps\r\nneither secrets nor promises.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, Sancho, not to chew on both sides, and not to eruct in\r\nanybody\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEruct!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo eruct, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cmeans to belch, and that is one\r\nof the filthiest words in the Spanish language, though a very\r\nexpressive one; and therefore nice folk have had recourse to the Latin,\r\nand instead of belch say eruct, and instead of belches say eructations;\r\nand if some do not understand these terms it matters little, for custom\r\nwill bring them into use in the course of time, so that they will be\r\nreadily understood; this is the way a language is enriched; custom and\r\nthe public are all-powerful there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cone of the counsels and cautions I\r\nmean to bear in mind shall be this, not to belch, for I\xe2\x80\x99m constantly\r\ndoing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEruct, Sancho, not belch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEruct, I shall say henceforth, and I swear not to forget it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikewise, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthou must not mingle such a\r\nquantity of proverbs in thy discourse as thou dost; for though proverbs\r\nare short maxims, thou dost drag them in so often by the head and\r\nshoulders that they savour more of nonsense than of maxims.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod alone can cure that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have more proverbs in me\r\nthan a book, and when I speak they come so thick together into my mouth\r\nthat they fall to fighting among themselves to get out; that\xe2\x80\x99s why my\r\ntongue lets fly the first that come, though they may not be pat to the\r\npurpose. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care henceforward to use such as befit the\r\ndignity of my office; for \xe2\x80\x98in a house where there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty, supper is\r\nsoon cooked,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98he who binds does not wrangle,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98the\r\nbell-ringer\xe2\x80\x99s in a safe berth,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98giving and keeping require\r\nbrains.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, Sancho!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cpack, tack, string proverbs\r\ntogether; nobody is hindering thee! \xe2\x80\x98My mother beats me, and I go on\r\nwith my tricks.\xe2\x80\x99 I am bidding thee avoid proverbs, and here in a second\r\nthou hast shot out a whole litany of them, which have as much to do\r\nwith what we are talking about as \xe2\x80\x98over the hills of \xc3\x9abeda.\xe2\x80\x99 Mind,\r\nSancho, I do not say that a proverb aptly brought in is objectionable;\r\nbut to pile up and string together proverbs at random makes\r\nconversation dull and vulgar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen thou ridest on horseback, do not go lolling with thy body on the\r\nback of the saddle, nor carry thy legs stiff or sticking out from the\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s belly, nor yet sit so loosely that one would suppose thou wert\r\non Dapple; for the seat on a horse makes gentlemen of some and grooms\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe moderate in thy sleep; for he who does not rise early does not get\r\nthe benefit of the day; and remember, Sancho, diligence is the mother\r\nof good fortune, and indolence, its opposite, never yet attained the\r\nobject of an honest ambition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last counsel I will give thee now, though it does not tend to\r\nbodily improvement, I would have thee carry carefully in thy memory,\r\nfor I believe it will be no less useful to thee than those I have given\r\nthee already, and it is this\xe2\x80\x94never engage in a dispute about families,\r\nat least in the way of comparing them one with another; for necessarily\r\none of those compared will be better than the other, and thou wilt be\r\nhated by the one thou hast disparaged, and get nothing in any shape\r\nfrom the one thou hast exalted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy attire shall be hose of full length, a long jerkin, and a cloak a\r\ntrifle longer; loose breeches by no means, for they are becoming\r\nneither for gentlemen nor for governors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the present, Sancho, this is all that has occurred to me to advise\r\nthee; as time goes by and occasions arise my instructions shall follow,\r\nif thou take care to let me know how thou art circumstanced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI see well enough that all these things your\r\nworship has said to me are good, holy, and profitable; but what use\r\nwill they be to me if I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember one of them? To be sure that\r\nabout not letting my nails grow, and marrying again if I have the\r\nchance, will not slip out of my head; but all that other hash, muddle,\r\nand jumble\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t and can\xe2\x80\x99t recollect any more of it than of last\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s clouds; so it must be given me in writing; for though I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neither read or write, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to my confessor, to drive it into me\r\nand remind me of it whenever it is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, sinner that I am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9chow bad it looks in\r\ngovernors not to know how to read or write; for let me tell thee,\r\nSancho, when a man knows not how to read, or is left-handed, it argues\r\none of two things; either that he was the son of exceedingly mean and\r\nlowly parents, or that he himself was so incorrigible and\r\nill-conditioned that neither good company nor good teaching could make\r\nany impression on him. It is a great defect that thou labourest under,\r\nand therefore I would have thee learn at any rate to sign thy name.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan sign my name well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor when I was steward of\r\nthe brotherhood in my village I learned to make certain letters, like\r\nthe marks on bales of goods, which they told me made out my name.\r\nBesides I can pretend my right hand is disabled and make someone else\r\nsign for me, for \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s a remedy for everything except death;\xe2\x80\x99 and as\r\nI shall be in command and hold the staff, I can do as I like; moreover,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98he who has the alcalde for his father-,\xe2\x80\x99 and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be governor, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s higher than alcalde. Only come and see! Let them make light of\r\nme and abuse me; \xe2\x80\x98they\xe2\x80\x99ll come for wool and go back shorn;\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98whom God\r\nloves, his house is known to Him;\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98the silly sayings of the rich pass\r\nfor saws in the world;\xe2\x80\x99 and as I\xe2\x80\x99ll be rich, being a governor, and at\r\nthe same time generous, as I mean to be, no fault will be seen in me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only make yourself honey and the flies will suck you;\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98as much as\r\nthou hast so much art thou worth,\xe2\x80\x99 as my grandmother used to say; and\r\n\xe2\x80\x98thou canst have no revenge of a man of substance.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, God\xe2\x80\x99s curse upon thee, Sancho!\xe2\x80\x9d here exclaimed Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9csixty\r\nthousand devils fly away with thee and thy proverbs! For the last hour\r\nthou hast been stringing them together and inflicting the pangs of\r\ntorture on me with every one of them. Those proverbs will bring thee to\r\nthe gallows one day, I promise thee; thy subjects will take the\r\ngovernment from thee, or there will be revolts among them. Tell me,\r\nwhere dost thou pick them up, thou booby? How dost thou apply them,\r\nthou blockhead? For with me, to utter one and make it apply properly, I\r\nhave to sweat and labour as if I were digging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, master mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship is making a fuss\r\nabout very little. Why the devil should you be vexed if I make use of\r\nwhat is my own? And I have got nothing else, nor any other stock in\r\ntrade except proverbs and more proverbs; and here are three just this\r\ninstant come into my head, pat to the purpose and like pears in a\r\nbasket; but I won\xe2\x80\x99t repeat them, for \xe2\x80\x98sage silence is called Sancho.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, Sancho, thou art not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor not only art thou\r\nnot sage silence, but thou art pestilent prate and perversity; still I\r\nwould like to know what three proverbs have just now come into thy\r\nmemory, for I have been turning over mine own\xe2\x80\x94and it is a good one\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnone occurs to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can be better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthan \xe2\x80\x98never put thy thumbs between\r\ntwo back teeth;\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98to \xe2\x80\x9c_get out of my house_\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c_what do you want\r\nwith my wife?_\xe2\x80\x9d there is no answer;\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98whether the pitcher hits the\r\nstove, or the stove the pitcher, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad business for the pitcher;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nall which fit to a hair? For no one should quarrel with his governor,\r\nor him in authority over him, because he will come off the worst, as he\r\ndoes who puts his finger between two back and if they are not back\r\nteeth it makes no difference, so long as they are teeth; and to\r\nwhatever the governor may say there\xe2\x80\x99s no answer, any more than to \xe2\x80\x98get\r\nout of my house\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98what do you want with my wife?\xe2\x80\x99 and then, as for\r\nthat about the stone and the pitcher, a blind man could see that. So\r\nthat he \xe2\x80\x98who sees the mote in another\xe2\x80\x99s eye had need to see the beam in\r\nhis own,\xe2\x80\x99 that it be not said of himself, \xe2\x80\x98the dead woman was\r\nfrightened at the one with her throat cut;\xe2\x80\x99 and your worship knows well\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x98the fool knows more in his own house than the wise man in\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fool knows nothing, either in his\r\nown house or in anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s, for no wise structure of any sort can\r\nstand on a foundation of folly; but let us say no more about it,\r\nSancho, for if thou governest badly, thine will be the fault and mine\r\nthe shame; but I comfort myself with having done my duty in advising\r\nthee as earnestly and as wisely as I could; and thus I am released from\r\nmy obligations and my promise. God guide thee, Sancho, and govern thee\r\nin thy government, and deliver me from the misgiving I have that thou\r\nwilt turn the whole island upside down, a thing I might easily prevent\r\nby explaining to the duke what thou art and telling him that all that\r\nfat little person of thine is nothing else but a sack full of proverbs\r\nand sauciness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif your worship thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m not fit for this\r\ngovernment, I give it up on the spot; for the mere black of the nail of\r\nmy soul is dearer to me than my whole body; and I can live just as\r\nwell, simple Sancho, on bread and onions, as governor, on partridges\r\nand capons; and what\xe2\x80\x99s more, while we\xe2\x80\x99re asleep we\xe2\x80\x99re all equal, great\r\nand small, rich and poor. But if your worship looks into it, you will\r\nsee it was your worship alone that put me on to this business of\r\ngoverning; for I know no more about the government of islands than a\r\nbuzzard; and if there\xe2\x80\x99s any reason to think that because of my being a\r\ngovernor the devil will get hold of me, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather go Sancho to heaven\r\nthan governor to hell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor those last words thou hast\r\nuttered alone, I consider thou deservest to be governor of a thousand\r\nislands. Thou hast good natural instincts, without which no knowledge\r\nis worth anything; commend thyself to God, and try not to swerve in the\r\npursuit of thy main object; I mean, always make it thy aim and fixed\r\npurpose to do right in all matters that come before thee, for heaven\r\nalways helps good intentions; and now let us go to dinner, for I think\r\nmy lord and lady are waiting for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np43e.jpg (41K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\nHOW SANCHO PANZA WAS CONDUCTED TO HIS GOVERNMENT, AND OF THE STRANGE\r\nADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE CASTLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np44a.jpg (140K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is stated, they say, in the true original of this history, that when\r\nCide Hamete came to write this chapter, his interpreter did not\r\ntranslate it as he wrote it\xe2\x80\x94that is, as a kind of complaint the Moor\r\nmade against himself for having taken in hand a story so dry and of so\r\nlittle variety as this of Don Quixote, for he found himself forced to\r\nspeak perpetually of him and Sancho, without venturing to indulge in\r\ndigressions and episodes more serious and more interesting. He said,\r\ntoo, that to go on, mind, hand, pen always restricted to writing upon\r\none single subject, and speaking through the mouths of a few\r\ncharacters, was intolerable drudgery, the result of which was never\r\nequal to the author\xe2\x80\x99s labour, and that to avoid this he had in the\r\nFirst Part availed himself of the device of novels, like \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nIll-advised Curiosity,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Captive Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d which stand, as it\r\nwere, apart from the story; the others are given there being incidents\r\nwhich occurred to Don Quixote himself and could not be omitted. He also\r\nthought, he says, that many, engrossed by the interest attaching to the\r\nexploits of Don Quixote, would take none in the novels, and pass them\r\nover hastily or impatiently without noticing the elegance and art of\r\ntheir composition, which would be very manifest were they published by\r\nthemselves and not as mere adjuncts to the crazes of Don Quixote or the\r\nsimplicities of Sancho. Therefore in this Second Part he thought it\r\nbest not to insert novels, either separate or interwoven, but only\r\nepisodes, something like them, arising out of the circumstances the\r\nfacts present; and even these sparingly, and with no more words than\r\nsuffice to make them plain; and as he confines and restricts himself to\r\nthe narrow limits of the narrative, though he has ability; capacity,\r\nand brains enough to deal with the whole universe, he requests that his\r\nlabours may not be despised, and that credit be given him, not alone\r\nfor what he writes, but for what he has refrained from writing.\r\n\r\nAnd so he goes on with his story, saying that the day Don Quixote gave\r\nthe counsels to Sancho, the same afternoon after dinner he handed them\r\nto him in writing so that he might get someone to read them to him.\r\nThey had scarcely, however, been given to him when he let them drop,\r\nand they fell into the hands of the duke, who showed them to the\r\nduchess and they were both amazed afresh at the madness and wit of Don\r\nQuixote. To carry on the joke, then, the same evening they despatched\r\nSancho with a large following to the village that was to serve him for\r\nan island. It happened that the person who had him in charge was a\r\nmajordomo of the duke\xe2\x80\x99s, a man of great discretion and humour\xe2\x80\x94and there\r\ncan be no humour without discretion\xe2\x80\x94and the same who played the part of\r\nthe Countess Trifaldi in the comical way that has been already\r\ndescribed; and thus qualified, and instructed by his master and\r\nmistress as to how to deal with Sancho, he carried out their scheme\r\nadmirably. Now it came to pass that as soon as Sancho saw this\r\nmajordomo he seemed in his features to recognise those of the Trifaldi,\r\nand turning to his master, he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, either the devil\r\nwill carry me off, here on this spot, righteous and believing, or your\r\nworship will own to me that the face of this majordomo of the duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhere is the very face of the Distressed One.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote regarded the majordomo attentively, and having done so,\r\nsaid to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason why the devil should carry thee\r\noff, Sancho, either righteous or believing\xe2\x80\x94and what thou meanest by\r\nthat I know not; the face of the Distressed One is that of the\r\nmajordomo, but for all that the majordomo is not the Distressed One;\r\nfor his being so would involve a mighty contradiction; but this is not\r\nthe time for going into questions of the sort, which would be involving\r\nourselves in an inextricable labyrinth. Believe me, my friend, we must\r\npray earnestly to our Lord that he deliver us both from wicked wizards\r\nand enchanters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no joke, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor before this I heard him\r\nspeak, and it seemed exactly as if the voice of the Trifaldi was\r\nsounding in my ears. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold my peace; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care to be\r\non the look-out henceforth for any sign that may be seen to confirm or\r\ndo away with this suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt do well, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand thou wilt let me\r\nknow all thou discoverest, and all that befalls thee in thy\r\ngovernment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho at last set out attended by a great number of people. He was\r\ndressed in the garb of a lawyer, with a gaban of tawny watered camlet\r\nover all and a montera cap of the same material, and mounted a la\r\ngineta upon a mule. Behind him, in accordance with the duke\xe2\x80\x99s orders,\r\nfollowed Dapple with brand new ass-trappings and ornaments of silk, and\r\nfrom time to time Sancho turned round to look at his ass, so well\r\npleased to have him with him that he would not have changed places with\r\nthe emperor of Germany. On taking leave he kissed the hands of the duke\r\nand duchess and got his master\xe2\x80\x99s blessing, which Don Quixote gave him\r\nwith tears, and he received blubbering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np44b.jpg (341K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet worthy Sancho go in peace, and good luck to him, Gentle Reader; and\r\nlook out for two bushels of laughter, which the account of how he\r\nbehaved himself in office will give thee. In the meantime turn thy\r\nattention to what happened his master the same night, and if thou dost\r\nnot laugh thereat, at any rate thou wilt stretch thy mouth with a grin;\r\nfor Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s adventures must be honoured either with wonder or\r\nwith laughter.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded, then, that as soon as Sancho had gone, Don Quixote felt\r\nhis loneliness, and had it been possible for him to revoke the mandate\r\nand take away the government from him he would have done so. The\r\nduchess observed his dejection and asked him why he was melancholy;\r\nbecause, she said, if it was for the loss of Sancho, there were\r\nsquires, duennas, and damsels in her house who would wait upon him to\r\nhis full satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I do feel the loss\r\nof Sancho; but that is not the main cause of my looking sad; and of all\r\nthe offers your excellence makes me, I accept only the good-will with\r\nwhich they are made, and as to the remainder I entreat of your\r\nexcellence to permit and allow me alone to wait upon myself in my\r\nchamber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cthat must not be; four\r\nof my damsels, as beautiful as flowers, shall wait upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will not be flowers, but thorns to\r\npierce my heart. They, or anything like them, shall as soon enter my\r\nchamber as fly. If your highness wishes to gratify me still further,\r\nthough I deserve it not, permit me to please myself, and wait upon\r\nmyself in my own room; for I place a barrier between my inclinations\r\nand my virtue, and I do not wish to break this rule through the\r\ngenerosity your highness is disposed to display towards me; and, in\r\nshort, I will sleep in my clothes, sooner than allow anyone to undress\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay no more, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, say no more,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nassure you I will give orders that not even a fly, not to say a damsel,\r\nshall enter your room. I am not the one to undermine the propriety of\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, for it strikes me that among his many virtues the\r\none that is pre-eminent is that of modesty. Your worship may undress\r\nand dress in private and in your own way, as you please and when you\r\nplease, for there will be no one to hinder you; and in your chamber you\r\nwill find all the utensils requisite to supply the wants of one who\r\nsleeps with his door locked, to the end that no natural needs compel\r\nyou to open it. May the great Dulcinea del Toboso live a thousand\r\nyears, and may her fame extend all over the surface of the globe, for\r\nshe deserves to be loved by a knight so valiant and so virtuous; and\r\nmay kind heaven infuse zeal into the heart of our governor Sancho Panza\r\nto finish off his discipline speedily, so that the world may once more\r\nenjoy the beauty of so grand a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYour highness has spoken like what you\r\nare; from the mouth of a noble lady nothing bad can come; and Dulcinea\r\nwill be more fortunate, and better known to the world by the praise of\r\nyour highness than by all the eulogies the greatest orators on earth\r\ncould bestow upon her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, it is nearly\r\nsupper-time, and the duke is probably waiting; come let us go to\r\nsupper, and retire to rest early, for the journey you made yesterday\r\nfrom Kandy was not such a short one but that it must have caused you\r\nsome fatigue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel none, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I would go so far as to\r\nswear to your excellence that in all my life I never mounted a quieter\r\nbeast, or a pleasanter paced one, than Clavile\xc3\xb1o; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\ncould have induced Malambruno to discard a steed so swift and so\r\ngentle, and burn it so recklessly as he did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9crepenting of the evil he had done to the\r\nTrifaldi and company, and others, and the crimes he must have committed\r\nas a wizard and enchanter, he resolved to make away with all the\r\ninstruments of his craft; and so burned Clavile\xc3\xb1o as the chief one, and\r\nthat which mainly kept him restless, wandering from land to land; and\r\nby its ashes and the trophy of the placard the valour of the great Don\r\nQuixote of La Mancha is established for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote renewed his thanks to the duchess; and having supped,\r\nretired to his chamber alone, refusing to allow anyone to enter with\r\nhim to wait on him, such was his fear of encountering temptations that\r\nmight lead or drive him to forget his chaste fidelity to his lady\r\nDulcinea; for he had always present to his mind the virtue of Amadis,\r\nthat flower and mirror of knights-errant. He locked the door behind\r\nhim, and by the light of two wax candles undressed himself, but as he\r\nwas taking off his stockings\xe2\x80\x94O disaster unworthy of such a\r\npersonage!\xe2\x80\x94there came a burst, not of sighs, or anything belying his\r\ndelicacy or good breeding, but of some two dozen stitches in one of his\r\nstockings, that made it look like a window-lattice. The worthy\r\ngentleman was beyond measure distressed, and at that moment he would\r\nhave given an ounce of silver to have had half a drachm of green silk\r\nthere; I say green silk, because the stockings were green.\r\n\r\nHere Cide Hamete exclaimed as he was writing, \xe2\x80\x9cO poverty, poverty! I\r\nknow not what could have possessed the great Cordovan poet to call thee\r\n\xe2\x80\x98holy gift ungratefully received.\xe2\x80\x99 Although a Moor, I know well enough\r\nfrom the intercourse I have had with Christians that holiness consists\r\nin charity, humility, faith, obedience, and poverty; but for all that,\r\nI say he must have a great deal of godliness who can find any\r\nsatisfaction in being poor; unless, indeed, it be the kind of poverty\r\none of their greatest saints refers to, saying, \xe2\x80\x98possess all things as\r\nthough ye possessed them not;\xe2\x80\x99 which is what they call poverty in\r\nspirit. But thou, that other poverty\xe2\x80\x94for it is of thee I am speaking\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94why dost thou love to fall out with gentlemen and men of good birth\r\nmore than with other people? Why dost thou compel them to smear the\r\ncracks in their shoes, and to have the buttons of their coats, one\r\nsilk, another hair, and another glass? Why must their ruffs be always\r\ncrinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(From this we may perceive the antiquity of starch and crimped ruffs.)\r\nThen he goes on: \xe2\x80\x9cPoor gentleman of good family! always cockering up\r\nhis honour, dining miserably and in secret, and making a hypocrite of\r\nthe toothpick with which he sallies out into the street after eating\r\nnothing to oblige him to use it! Poor fellow, I say, with his nervous\r\nhonour, fancying they perceive a league off the patch on his shoe, the\r\nsweat-stains on his hat, the shabbiness of his cloak, and the hunger of\r\nhis stomach!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this was brought home to Don Quixote by the bursting of his\r\nstitches; however, he comforted himself on perceiving that Sancho had\r\nleft behind a pair of travelling boots, which he resolved to wear the\r\nnext day. At last he went to bed, out of spirits and heavy at heart, as\r\nmuch because he missed Sancho as because of the irreparable disaster to\r\nhis stockings, the stitches of which he would have even taken up with\r\nsilk of another colour, which is one of the greatest signs of poverty a\r\ngentleman can show in the course of his never-failing embarrassments.\r\nHe put out the candles; but the night was warm and he could not sleep;\r\nhe rose from his bed and opened slightly a grated window that looked\r\nout on a beautiful garden, and as he did so he perceived and heard\r\npeople walking and talking in the garden. He set himself to listen\r\nattentively, and those below raised their voices so that he could hear\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUrge me not to sing, Emerencia, for thou knowest that ever since this\r\nstranger entered the castle and my eyes beheld him, I cannot sing but\r\nonly weep; besides my lady is a light rather than a heavy sleeper, and\r\nI would not for all the wealth of the world that she found us here; and\r\neven if she were asleep and did not waken, my singing would be in vain,\r\nif this strange \xc3\x86neas, who has come into my neighbourhood to flout me,\r\nsleeps on and wakens not to hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeed not that, dear Altisidora,\xe2\x80\x9d replied a voice; \xe2\x80\x9cthe duchess is no\r\ndoubt asleep, and everybody in the house save the lord of thy heart and\r\ndisturber of thy soul; for just now I perceived him open the grated\r\nwindow of his chamber, so he must be awake; sing, my poor sufferer, in\r\na low sweet tone to the accompaniment of thy harp; and even if the\r\nduchess hears us we can lay the blame on the heat of the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not the point, Emerencia,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Altisidora, \xe2\x80\x9cit is that I\r\nwould not that my singing should lay bare my heart, and that I should\r\nbe thought a light and wanton maiden by those who know not the mighty\r\npower of love; but come what may; better a blush on the cheeks than a\r\nsore in the heart;\xe2\x80\x9d and here a harp softly touched made itself heard.\r\nAs he listened to all this Don Quixote was in a state of breathless\r\namazement, for immediately the countless adventures like this, with\r\nwindows, gratings, gardens, serenades, lovemakings, and languishings,\r\nthat he had read of in his trashy books of chivalry, came to his mind.\r\nHe at once concluded that some damsel of the duchess\xe2\x80\x99s was in love with\r\nhim, and that her modesty forced her to keep her passion secret. He\r\ntrembled lest he should fall, and made an inward resolution not to\r\nyield; and commending himself with all his might and soul to his lady\r\nDulcinea he made up his mind to listen to the music; and to let them\r\nknow he was there he gave a pretended sneeze, at which the damsels were\r\nnot a little delighted, for all they wanted was that Don Quixote should\r\nhear them. So having tuned the harp, Altisidora, running her hand\r\nacross the strings, began this ballad:\r\n\r\nO thou that art above in bed,\r\nBetween the holland sheets,\r\nA-lying there from night till morn,\r\nWith outstretched legs asleep;\r\n\r\nO thou, most valiant knight of all\r\nThe famed Manchegan breed,\r\nOf purity and virtue more\r\nThan gold of Araby;\r\n\r\nGive ear unto a suffering maid,\r\nWell-grown but evil-starr\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nFor those two suns of thine have lit\r\nA fire within her heart.\r\n\r\nAdventures seeking thou dost rove,\r\nTo others bringing woe;\r\nThou scatterest wounds, but, ah, the balm\r\nTo heal them dost withhold!\r\n\r\nSay, valiant youth, and so may God\r\nThy enterprises speed,\r\nDidst thou the light mid Libya\xe2\x80\x99s sands\r\nOr Jaca\xe2\x80\x99s rocks first see?\r\n\r\nDid scaly serpents give thee suck?\r\nWho nursed thee when a babe?\r\nWert cradled in the forest rude,\r\nOr gloomy mountain cave?\r\n\r\nO Dulcinea may be proud,\r\nThat plump and lusty maid;\r\nFor she alone hath had the power\r\nA tiger fierce to tame.\r\n\r\nAnd she for this shall famous be\r\nFrom Tagus to Jarama,\r\nFrom Manzanares to Genil,\r\nFrom Duero to Arlanza.\r\n\r\nFain would I change with her, and give\r\nA petticoat to boot,\r\nThe best and bravest that I have,\r\nAll trimmed with gold galloon.\r\n\r\nO for to be the happy fair\r\nThy mighty arms enfold,\r\nOr even sit beside thy bed\r\nAnd scratch thy dusty poll!\r\n\r\nI rave,\xe2\x80\x94to favours such as these\r\nUnworthy to aspire;\r\nThy feet to tickle were enough\r\nFor one so mean as I.\r\n\r\nWhat caps, what slippers silver-laced,\r\nWould I on thee bestow!\r\nWhat damask breeches make for thee;\r\nWhat fine long holland cloaks!\r\n\r\nAnd I would give thee pearls that should\r\nAs big as oak-galls show;\r\nSo matchless big that each might well\r\nBe called the great \xe2\x80\x9cAlone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nManchegan Nero, look not down\r\nFrom thy Tarpeian Rock\r\nUpon this burning heart, nor add\r\nThe fuel of thy wrath.\r\n\r\nA virgin soft and young am I,\r\nNot yet fifteen years old;\r\n(I\xe2\x80\x99m only three months past fourteen,\r\nI swear upon my soul).\r\nI hobble not nor do I limp,\r\nAll blemish I\xe2\x80\x99m without,\r\nAnd as I walk my lily locks\r\nAre trailing on the ground.\r\n\r\nAnd though my nose be rather flat,\r\nAnd though my mouth be wide,\r\nMy teeth like topazes exalt\r\nMy beauty to the sky.\r\n\r\nThou knowest that my voice is sweet,\r\nThat is if thou dost hear;\r\nAnd I am moulded in a form\r\nSomewhat below the mean.\r\n\r\nThese charms, and many more, are thine,\r\nSpoils to thy spear and bow all;\r\nA damsel of this house am I,\r\nBy name Altisidora.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np44c.jpg (266K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the lay of the heart-stricken Altisidora came to an end, while the\r\nwarmly wooed Don Quixote began to feel alarm; and with a deep sigh he\r\nsaid to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cO that I should be such an unlucky knight that no\r\ndamsel can set eyes on me but falls in love with me! O that the\r\npeerless Dulcinea should be so unfortunate that they cannot let her\r\nenjoy my incomparable constancy in peace! What would ye with her, ye\r\nqueens? Why do ye persecute her, ye empresses? Why ye pursue her, ye\r\nvirgins of from fourteen to fifteen? Leave the unhappy being to\r\ntriumph, rejoice and glory in the lot love has been pleased to bestow\r\nupon her in surrendering my heart and yielding up my soul to her. Ye\r\nlove-smitten host, know that to Dulcinea only I am dough and\r\nsugar-paste, flint to all others; for her I am honey, for you aloes.\r\nFor me Dulcinea alone is beautiful, wise, virtuous, graceful, and\r\nhigh-bred, and all others are ill-favoured, foolish, light, and\r\nlow-born. Nature sent me into the world to be hers and no other\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nAltisidora may weep or sing, the lady for whose sake they belaboured me\r\nin the castle of the enchanted Moor may give way to despair, but I must\r\nbe Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s, boiled or roast, pure, courteous, and chaste, in spite\r\nof all the magic-working powers on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d And with that he shut the\r\nwindow with a bang, and, as much out of temper and out of sorts as if\r\nsome great misfortune had befallen him, stretched himself on his bed,\r\nwhere we will leave him for the present, as the great Sancho Panza, who\r\nis about to set up his famous government, now demands our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np44e.jpg (145K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\nOF HOW THE GREAT SANCHO PANZA TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS ISLAND, AND OF HOW\r\nHE MADE A BEGINNING IN GOVERNING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np45a.jpg (141K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO perpetual discoverer of the antipodes, torch of the world, eye of\r\nheaven, sweet stimulator of the water-coolers! Thimbraeus here, Ph\xc5\x93bus\r\nthere, now archer, now physician, father of poetry, inventor of music;\r\nthou that always risest and, notwithstanding appearances, never\r\nsettest! To thee, O Sun, by whose aid man begetteth man, to thee I\r\nappeal to help me and lighten the darkness of my wit that I may be able\r\nto proceed with scrupulous exactitude in giving an account of the great\r\nSancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s government; for without thee I feel myself weak, feeble,\r\nand uncertain.\r\n\r\nTo come to the point, then\xe2\x80\x94Sancho with all his attendants arrived at a\r\nvillage of some thousand inhabitants, and one of the largest the duke\r\npossessed. They informed him that it was called the island of\r\nBarataria, either because the name of the village was Baratario, or\r\nbecause of the joke by way of which the government had been conferred\r\nupon him. On reaching the gates of the town, which was a walled one,\r\nthe municipality came forth to meet him, the bells rang out a peal, and\r\nthe inhabitants showed every sign of general satisfaction; and with\r\ngreat pomp they conducted him to the principal church to give thanks to\r\nGod, and then with burlesque ceremonies they presented him with the\r\nkeys of the town, and acknowledged him as perpetual governor of the\r\nisland of Barataria. The costume, the beard, and the fat squat figure\r\nof the new governor astonished all those who were not in on the secret,\r\nand even all who were, and they were not a few. Finally, leading him\r\nout of the church they carried him to the judgment seat and seated him\r\non it, and the duke\xe2\x80\x99s majordomo said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an ancient custom\r\nin this island, se\xc3\xb1or governor, that he who comes to take possession of\r\nthis famous island is bound to answer a question which shall be put to\r\nhim, and which must be a somewhat knotty and difficult one; and by his\r\nanswer the people take the measure of their new governor\xe2\x80\x99s wit, and\r\nhail with joy or deplore his arrival accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the majordomo was making this speech Sancho was gazing at several\r\nlarge letters inscribed on the wall opposite his seat, and as he could\r\nnot read he asked what that was that was painted on the wall. The\r\nanswer was, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, there is written and recorded the day on which your\r\nlordship took possession of this island, and the inscription says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This day, the so-and-so of such-and-such a month and year, Se\xc3\xb1or Don\r\nSancho Panza took possession of this island; many years may he enjoy\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whom do they call Don Sancho Panza?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour lordship,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the majordomo; \xe2\x80\x9cfor no other Panza but the one\r\nwho is now seated in that chair has ever entered this island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, let me tell you, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don,\xe2\x80\x99 nor has anyone of my family ever had it; my name is plain Sancho\r\nPanza, and Sancho was my father\xe2\x80\x99s name, and Sancho was my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand they were all Panzas, without any Dons or Do\xc3\xb1as tacked on; I\r\nsuspect that in this island there are more Dons than stones; but never\r\nmind; God knows what I mean, and maybe if my government lasts four days\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll weed out these Dons that no doubt are as great a nuisance as the\r\nmidges, they\xe2\x80\x99re so plenty. Let the majordomo go on with his question,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll give the best answer I can, whether the people deplore or\r\nnot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this instant there came into court two old men, one carrying a cane\r\nby way of a walking-stick, and the one who had no stick said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\r\nsome time ago I lent this good man ten gold-crowns in gold to gratify\r\nhim and do him a service, on the condition that he was to return them\r\nto me whenever I should ask for them. A long time passed before I asked\r\nfor them, for I would not put him to any greater straits to return them\r\nthan he was in when I lent them to him; but thinking he was growing\r\ncareless about payment I asked for them once and several times; and not\r\nonly will he not give them back, but he denies that he owes them, and\r\nsays I never lent him any such crowns; or if I did, that he repaid\r\nthem; and I have no witnesses either of the loan, or the payment, for\r\nhe never paid me; I want your worship to put him to his oath, and if he\r\nswears he returned them to me I forgive him the debt here and before\r\nGod.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np45b.jpg (400K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat say you to this, good old man, you with the stick?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\nTo which the old man replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI admit, se\xc3\xb1or, that he lent them to me;\r\nbut let your worship lower your staff, and as he leaves it to my oath,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll swear that I gave them back, and paid him really and truly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe governor lowered the staff, and as he did so the old man who had\r\nthe stick handed it to the other old man to hold for him while he\r\nswore, as if he found it in his way; and then laid his hand on the\r\ncross of the staff, saying that it was true the ten crowns that were\r\ndemanded of him had been lent him; but that he had with his own hand\r\ngiven them back into the hand of the other, and that he, not\r\nrecollecting it, was always asking for them.\r\n\r\nSeeing this the great governor asked the creditor what answer he had to\r\nmake to what his opponent said. He said that no doubt his debtor had\r\ntold the truth, for he believed him to be an honest man and a good\r\nChristian, and he himself must have forgotten when and how he had given\r\nhim back the crowns; and that from that time forth he would make no\r\nfurther demand upon him.\r\n\r\nThe debtor took his stick again, and bowing his head left the court.\r\nObserving this, and how, without another word, he made off, and\r\nobserving too the resignation of the plaintiff, Sancho buried his head\r\nin his bosom and remained for a short space in deep thought, with the\r\nforefinger of his right hand on his brow and nose; then he raised his\r\nhead and bade them call back the old man with the stick, for he had\r\nalready taken his departure. They brought him back, and as soon as\r\nSancho saw him he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHonest man, give me that stick, for I want\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man; \xe2\x80\x9chere it is se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d and he put it into\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nSancho took it and, handing it to the other old man, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cGo,\r\nand God be with you; for now you are paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, se\xc3\xb1or!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old man; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, is this cane worth ten\r\ngold-crowns?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the governor, \xe2\x80\x9cor if not I am the greatest dolt in the\r\nworld; now you will see whether I have got the headpiece to govern a\r\nwhole kingdom;\xe2\x80\x9d and he ordered the cane to be broken in two, there, in\r\nthe presence of all. It was done, and in the middle of it they found\r\nten gold-crowns. All were filled with amazement, and looked upon their\r\ngovernor as another Solomon. They asked him how he had come to the\r\nconclusion that the ten crowns were in the cane; he replied, that\r\nobserving how the old man who swore gave the stick to his opponent\r\nwhile he was taking the oath, and swore that he had really and truly\r\ngiven him the crowns, and how as soon as he had done swearing he asked\r\nfor the stick again, it came into his head that the sum demanded must\r\nbe inside it; and from this he said it might be seen that God sometimes\r\nguides those who govern in their judgments, even though they may be\r\nfools; besides he had himself heard the curate of his village mention\r\njust such another case, and he had so good a memory, that if it was not\r\nthat he forgot everything he wished to remember, there would not be\r\nsuch a memory in all the island. To conclude, the old men went off, one\r\ncrestfallen, and the other in high contentment, all who were present\r\nwere astonished, and he who was recording the words, deeds, and\r\nmovements of Sancho could not make up his mind whether he was to look\r\nupon him and set him down as a fool or as a man of sense.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this case was disposed of, there came into court a woman\r\nholding on with a tight grip to a man dressed like a well-to-do cattle\r\ndealer, and she came forward making a great outcry and exclaiming,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJustice, se\xc3\xb1or governor, justice! and if I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it on earth I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo look for it in heaven. Se\xc3\xb1or governor of my soul, this wicked man\r\ncaught me in the middle of the fields here and used my body as if it\r\nwas an ill-washed rag, and, woe is me! got from me what I had kept\r\nthese three-and-twenty years and more, defending it against Moors and\r\nChristians, natives and strangers; and I always as hard as an oak, and\r\nkeeping myself as pure as a salamander in the fire, or wool among the\r\nbrambles, for this good fellow to come now with clean hands to handle\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt remains to be proved whether this gallant has clean hands or not,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Sancho; and turning to the man he asked him what he had to say in\r\nanswer to the woman\xe2\x80\x99s charge.\r\n\r\nHe all in confusion made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cSirs, I am a poor pig dealer, and\r\nthis morning I left the village to sell (saving your presence) four\r\npigs, and between dues and cribbings they got out of me little less\r\nthan the worth of them. As I was returning to my village I fell in on\r\nthe road with this good dame, and the devil who makes a coil and a mess\r\nout of everything, yoked us together. I paid her fairly, but she not\r\ncontented laid hold of me and never let go until she brought me here;\r\nshe says I forced her, but she lies by the oath I swear or am ready to\r\nswear; and this is the whole truth and every particle of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe governor on this asked him if he had any money in silver about him;\r\nhe said he had about twenty ducats in a leather purse in his bosom. The\r\ngovernor bade him take it out and hand it to the complainant; he obeyed\r\ntrembling; the woman took it, and making a thousand salaams to all and\r\npraying to God for the long life and health of the se\xc3\xb1or governor who\r\nhad such regard for distressed orphans and virgins, she hurried out of\r\ncourt with the purse grasped in both her hands, first looking, however,\r\nto see if the money it contained was silver.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was gone Sancho said to the cattle dealer, whose tears\r\nwere already starting and whose eyes and heart were following his\r\npurse, \xe2\x80\x9cGood fellow, go after that woman and take the purse from her,\r\nby force even, and come back with it here;\xe2\x80\x9d and he did not say it to\r\none who was a fool or deaf, for the man was off like a flash of\r\nlightning, and ran to do as he was bid.\r\n\r\nAll the bystanders waited anxiously to see the end of the case, and\r\npresently both man and woman came back at even closer grips than\r\nbefore, she with her petticoat up and the purse in the lap of it, and\r\nhe struggling hard to take it from her, but all to no purpose, so stout\r\nwas the woman\xe2\x80\x99s defence, she all the while crying out, \xe2\x80\x9cJustice from\r\nGod and the world! see here, se\xc3\xb1or governor, the shamelessness and\r\nboldness of this villain, who in the middle of the town, in the middle\r\nof the street, wanted to take from me the purse your worship bade him\r\ngive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did he take it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the governor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d let my life be taken from me sooner\r\nthan the purse. A pretty child I\xe2\x80\x99d be! It\xe2\x80\x99s another sort of cat they\r\nmust throw in my face, and not that poor scurvy knave. Pincers and\r\nhammers, mallets and chisels would not get it out of my grip; no, nor\r\nlions\xe2\x80\x99 claws; the soul from out of my body first!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man; \xe2\x80\x9cI own myself beaten and powerless; I\r\nconfess I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the strength to take it from her;\xe2\x80\x9d and he let go his\r\nhold of her.\r\n\r\nUpon this the governor said to the woman, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me see that purse, my\r\nworthy and sturdy friend.\xe2\x80\x9d She handed it to him at once, and the\r\ngovernor returned it to the man, and said to the unforced mistress of\r\nforce, \xe2\x80\x9cSister, if you had shown as much, or only half as much, spirit\r\nand vigour in defending your body as you have shown in defending that\r\npurse, the strength of Hercules could not have forced you. Be off, and\r\nGod speed you, and bad luck to you, and don\xe2\x80\x99t show your face in all\r\nthis island, or within six leagues of it on any side, under pain of two\r\nhundred lashes; be off at once, I say, you shameless, cheating shrew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman was cowed and went off disconsolately, hanging her head; and\r\nthe governor said to the man, \xe2\x80\x9cHonest man, go home with your money, and\r\nGod speed you; and for the future, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose it, see\r\nthat you don\xe2\x80\x99t take it into your head to yoke with anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d The man\r\nthanked him as clumsily as he could and went his way, and the\r\nbystanders were again filled with admiration at their new governor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njudgments and sentences.\r\n\r\nNext, two men, one apparently a farm labourer, and the other a tailor,\r\nfor he had a pair of shears in his hand, presented themselves before\r\nhim, and the tailor said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or governor, this labourer and I come\r\nbefore your worship by reason of this honest man coming to my shop\r\nyesterday (for saving everybody\xe2\x80\x99s presence I\xe2\x80\x99m a passed tailor, God be\r\nthanked), and putting a piece of cloth into my hands and asking me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Se\xc3\xb1or, will there be enough in this cloth to make me a cap?\xe2\x80\x99 Measuring\r\nthe cloth I said there would. He probably suspected\xe2\x80\x94as I supposed, and\r\nI supposed right\xe2\x80\x94that I wanted to steal some of the cloth, led to think\r\nso by his own roguery and the bad opinion people have of tailors; and\r\nhe told me to see if there would be enough for two. I guessed what he\r\nwould be at, and I said \xe2\x80\x98yes.\xe2\x80\x99 He, still following up his original\r\nunworthy notion, went on adding cap after cap, and I \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 after \xe2\x80\x98yes,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nuntil we got as far as five. He has just this moment come for them; I\r\ngave them to him, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t pay me for the making; on the contrary,\r\nhe calls upon me to pay him, or else return his cloth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs all this true, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man; \xe2\x80\x9cbut will your worship make him show the five\r\ncaps he has made me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tailor; and drawing his hand from under\r\nhis cloak he showed five caps stuck upon the five fingers of it, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are the caps this good man asks for; and by God and upon\r\nmy conscience I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a scrap of cloth left, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the work be\r\nexamined by the inspectors of the trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll present laughed at the number of caps and the novelty of the suit;\r\nSancho set himself to think for a moment, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to\r\nme that in this case it is not necessary to deliver long-winded\r\narguments, but only to give off-hand the judgment of an honest man; and\r\nso my decision is that the tailor lose the making and the labourer the\r\ncloth, and that the caps go to the prisoners in the gaol, and let there\r\nbe no more about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the previous decision about the cattle dealer\xe2\x80\x99s purse excited the\r\nadmiration of the bystanders, this provoked their laughter; however,\r\nthe governor\xe2\x80\x99s orders were after all executed. All this, having been\r\ntaken down by his chronicler, was at once despatched to the duke, who\r\nwas looking out for it with great eagerness; and here let us leave the\r\ngood Sancho; for his master, sorely troubled in mind by Altisidora\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmusic, has pressing claims upon us now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np45e.jpg (11K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\nOF THE TERRIBLE BELL AND CAT FRIGHT THAT DON QUIXOTE GOT IN THE COURSE\r\nOF THE ENAMOURED ALTISIDORA\xe2\x80\x99S WOOING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np46a.jpg (58K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Don Quixote wrapped up in the reflections which the music of\r\nthe enamourned maid Altisidora had given rise to. He went to bed with\r\nthem, and just like fleas they would not let him sleep or get a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s rest, and the broken stitches of his stockings helped them.\r\nBut as Time is fleet and no obstacle can stay his course, he came\r\nriding on the hours, and morning very soon arrived. Seeing which Don\r\nQuixote quitted the soft down, and, nowise slothful, dressed himself in\r\nhis chamois suit and put on his travelling boots to hide the disaster\r\nto his stockings. He threw over him his scarlet mantle, put on his head\r\na montera of green velvet trimmed with silver edging, flung across his\r\nshoulder the baldric with his good trenchant sword, took up a large\r\nrosary that he always carried with him, and with great solemnity and\r\nprecision of gait proceeded to the antechamber where the duke and\r\nduchess were already dressed and waiting for him. But as he passed\r\nthrough a gallery, Altisidora and the other damsel, her friend, were\r\nlying in wait for him, and the instant Altisidora saw him she pretended\r\nto faint, while her friend caught her in her lap, and began hastily\r\nunlacing the bosom of her dress.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote observed it, and approaching them said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know very well\r\nwhat this seizure arises from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not from what,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the friend, \xe2\x80\x9cfor Altisidora is the\r\nhealthiest damsel in all this house, and I have never heard her\r\ncomplain all the time I have known her. A plague on all the\r\nknights-errant in the world, if they be all ungrateful! Go away, Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nDon Quixote; for this poor child will not come to herself again so long\r\nas you are here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np46b.jpg (320K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which Don Quixote returned, \xe2\x80\x9cDo me the favour, se\xc3\xb1ora, to let a lute\r\nbe placed in my chamber to-night; and I will comfort this poor maiden\r\nto the best of my power; for in the early stages of love a prompt\r\ndisillusion is an approved remedy;\xe2\x80\x9d and with this he retired, so as not\r\nto be remarked by any who might see him there.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely withdrawn when Altisidora, recovering from her swoon,\r\nsaid to her companion, \xe2\x80\x9cThe lute must be left, for no doubt Don Quixote\r\nintends to give us some music; and being his it will not be bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went at once to inform the duchess of what was going on, and of\r\nthe lute Don Quixote asked for, and she, delighted beyond measure,\r\nplotted with the duke and her two damsels to play him a trick that\r\nshould be amusing but harmless; and in high glee they waited for night,\r\nwhich came quickly as the day had come; and as for the day, the duke\r\nand duchess spent it in charming conversation with Don Quixote.\r\n\r\nWhen eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock came, Don Quixote found a guitar in his chamber; he\r\ntried it, opened the window, and perceived that some persons were\r\nwalking in the garden; and having passed his fingers over the frets of\r\nthe guitar and tuned it as well as he could, he spat and cleared his\r\nchest, and then with a voice a little hoarse but full-toned, he sang\r\nthe following ballad, which he had himself that day composed:\r\n\r\nMighty Love the hearts of maidens\r\nDoth unsettle and perplex,\r\nAnd the instrument he uses\r\nMost of all is idleness.\r\n\r\nSewing, stitching, any labour,\r\nHaving always work to do,\r\nTo the poison Love instilleth\r\nIs the antidote most sure.\r\n\r\nAnd to proper-minded maidens\r\nWho desire the matron\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nModesty\xe2\x80\x99s a marriage portion,\r\nModesty their highest praise.\r\n\r\nMen of prudence and discretion,\r\nCourtiers gay and gallant knights,\r\nWith the wanton damsels dally,\r\nBut the modest take to wife.\r\nThere are passions, transient, fleeting,\r\nLoves in hostelries declar\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nSunrise loves, with sunset ended,\r\nWhen the guest hath gone his way.\r\n\r\nLove that springs up swift and sudden,\r\nHere to-day, to-morrow flown,\r\nPasses, leaves no trace behind it,\r\nLeaves no image on the soul.\r\n\r\nPainting that is laid on painting\r\nMaketh no display or show;\r\nWhere one beauty\xe2\x80\x99s in possession\r\nThere no other can take hold.\r\n\r\nDulcinea del Toboso\r\nPainted on my heart I wear;\r\nNever from its tablets, never,\r\nCan her image be eras\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n\r\nThe quality of all in lovers\r\nMost esteemed is constancy;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis by this that love works wonders,\r\nThis exalts them to the skies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote had got so far with his song, to which the duke, the\r\nduchess, Altisidora, and nearly the whole household of the castle were\r\nlistening, when all of a sudden from a gallery above that was exactly\r\nover his window they let down a cord with more than a hundred bells\r\nattached to it, and immediately after that discharged a great sack full\r\nof cats, which also had bells of smaller size tied to their tails. Such\r\nwas the din of the bells and the squalling of the cats, that though the\r\nduke and duchess were the contrivers of the joke they were startled by\r\nit, while Don Quixote stood paralysed with fear; and as luck would have\r\nit, two or three of the cats made their way in through the grating of\r\nhis chamber, and flying from one side to the other, made it seem as if\r\nthere was a legion of devils at large in it. They extinguished the\r\ncandles that were burning in the room, and rushed about seeking some\r\nway of escape; the cord with the large bells never ceased rising and\r\nfalling; and most of the people of the castle, not knowing what was\r\nreally the matter, were at their wits\xe2\x80\x99 end with astonishment. Don\r\nQuixote sprang to his feet, and drawing his sword, began making passes\r\nat the grating, shouting out, \xe2\x80\x9cAvaunt, malignant enchanters! avaunt, ye\r\nwitchcraft-working rabble! I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, against whom\r\nyour evil machinations avail not nor have any power.\xe2\x80\x9d And turning upon\r\nthe cats that were running about the room, he made several cuts at\r\nthem. They dashed at the grating and escaped by it, save one that,\r\nfinding itself hard pressed by the slashes of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s sword, flew\r\nat his face and held on to his nose tooth and nail, with the pain of\r\nwhich he began to shout his loudest. The duke and duchess hearing this,\r\nand guessing what it was, ran with all haste to his room, and as the\r\npoor gentleman was striving with all his might to detach the cat from\r\nhis face, they opened the door with a master-key and went in with\r\nlights and witnessed the unequal combat. The duke ran forward to part\r\nthe combatants, but Don Quixote cried out aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cLet no one take him\r\nfrom me; leave me hand to hand with this demon, this wizard, this\r\nenchanter; I will teach him, I myself, who Don Quixote of La Mancha\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d The cat, however, never minding these threats, snarled and held\r\non; but at last the duke pulled it off and flung it out of the window.\r\nDon Quixote was left with a face as full of holes as a sieve and a nose\r\nnot in very good condition, and greatly vexed that they did not let him\r\nfinish the battle he had been so stoutly fighting with that villain of\r\nan enchanter. They sent for some oil of John\xe2\x80\x99s wort, and Altisidora\r\nherself with her own fair hands bandaged all the wounded parts; and as\r\nshe did so she said to him in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAll these mishaps have\r\nbefallen thee, hardhearted knight, for the sin of thy insensibility and\r\nobstinacy; and God grant thy squire Sancho may forget to whip himself,\r\nso that that dearly beloved Dulcinea of thine may never be released\r\nfrom her enchantment, that thou mayest never come to her bed, at least\r\nwhile I who adore thee am alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo all this Don Quixote made no answer except to heave deep sighs, and\r\nthen stretched himself on his bed, thanking the duke and duchess for\r\ntheir kindness, not because he stood in any fear of that bell-ringing\r\nrabble of enchanters in cat shape, but because he recognised their good\r\nintentions in coming to his rescue. The duke and duchess left him to\r\nrepose and withdrew greatly grieved at the unfortunate result of the\r\njoke; as they never thought the adventure would have fallen so heavy on\r\nDon Quixote or cost him so dear, for it cost him five days of\r\nconfinement to his bed, during which he had another adventure,\r\npleasanter than the late one, which his chronicler will not relate just\r\nnow in order that he may turn his attention to Sancho Panza, who was\r\nproceeding with great diligence and drollery in his government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np46e.jpg (65K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\nWHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE ACCOUNT OF HOW SANCHO PANZA CONDUCTED HIMSELF\r\nIN HIS GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np47a.jpg (139K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history says that from the justice court they carried Sancho to a\r\nsumptuous palace, where in a spacious chamber there was a table laid\r\nout with royal magnificence. The clarions sounded as Sancho entered the\r\nroom, and four pages came forward to present him with water for his\r\nhands, which Sancho received with great dignity. The music ceased, and\r\nSancho seated himself at the head of the table, for there was only that\r\nseat placed, and no more than one cover laid. A personage, who it\r\nappeared afterwards was a physician, placed himself standing by his\r\nside with a whalebone wand in his hand. They then lifted up a fine\r\nwhite cloth covering fruit and a great variety of dishes of different\r\nsorts; one who looked like a student said grace, and a page put a laced\r\nbib on Sancho, while another who played the part of head carver placed\r\na dish of fruit before him. But hardly had he tasted a morsel when the\r\nman with the wand touched the plate with it, and they took it away from\r\nbefore him with the utmost celerity. The carver, however, brought him\r\nanother dish, and Sancho proceeded to try it; but before he could get\r\nat it, not to say taste it, already the wand had touched it and a page\r\nhad carried it off with the same promptitude as the fruit. Sancho\r\nseeing this was puzzled, and looking from one to another asked if this\r\ndinner was to be eaten after the fashion of a jugglery trick.\r\n\r\nTo this he with the wand replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not to be eaten, se\xc3\xb1or\r\ngovernor, except as is usual and customary in other islands where there\r\nare governors. I, se\xc3\xb1or, am a physician, and I am paid a salary in this\r\nisland to serve its governors as such, and I have a much greater regard\r\nfor their health than for my own, studying day and night and making\r\nmyself acquainted with the governor\xe2\x80\x99s constitution, in order to be able\r\nto cure him when he falls sick. The chief thing I have to do is to\r\nattend at his dinners and suppers and allow him to eat what appears to\r\nme to be fit for him, and keep from him what I think will do him harm\r\nand be injurious to his stomach; and therefore I ordered that plate of\r\nfruit to be removed as being too moist, and that other dish I ordered\r\nto be removed as being too hot and containing many spices that\r\nstimulate thirst; for he who drinks much kills and consumes the radical\r\nmoisture wherein life consists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat dish of roast partridges there that\r\nseems so savoury will not do me any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this the physician replied, \xe2\x80\x9cOf those my lord the governor shall not\r\neat so long as I live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cour master Hippocrates, the polestar\r\nand beacon of medicine, says in one of his aphorisms _omnis saturatio\r\nmala, perdicis autem pessima_, which means \xe2\x80\x98all repletion is bad, but\r\nthat of partridge is the worst of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9clet se\xc3\xb1or doctor see among the dishes\r\nthat are on the table what will do me most good and least harm, and let\r\nme eat it, without tapping it with his stick; for by the life of the\r\ngovernor, and so may God suffer me to enjoy it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m dying of\r\nhunger; and in spite of the doctor and all he may say, to deny me food\r\nis the way to take my life instead of prolonging it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour worship is right, se\xc3\xb1or governor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the physician; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ntherefore your worship, I consider, should not eat of those stewed\r\nrabbits there, because it is a furry kind of food; if that veal were\r\nnot roasted and served with pickles, you might try it; but it is out of\r\nthe question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat big dish that is smoking farther off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cseems to me\r\nto be an olla podrida, and out of the diversity of things in such\r\nollas, I can\xe2\x80\x99t fail to light upon something tasty and good for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np47b.jpg (372K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Absit_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cfar from us be any such base thought!\r\nThere is nothing in the world less nourishing than an olla podrida; to\r\ncanons, or rectors of colleges, or peasants\xe2\x80\x99 weddings with your ollas\r\npodridas, but let us have none of them on the tables of governors,\r\nwhere everything that is present should be delicate and refined; and\r\nthe reason is, that always, everywhere and by everybody, simple\r\nmedicines are more esteemed than compound ones, for we cannot go wrong\r\nin those that are simple, while in the compound we may, by merely\r\naltering the quantity of the things composing them. But what I am of\r\nopinion the governor should eat now in order to preserve and fortify\r\nhis health is a hundred or so of wafer cakes and a few thin slices of\r\nconserve of quinces, which will settle his stomach and help his\r\ndigestion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho on hearing this threw himself back in his chair and surveyed the\r\ndoctor steadily, and in a solemn tone asked him what his name was and\r\nwhere he had studied.\r\n\r\nHe replied, \xe2\x80\x9cMy name, se\xc3\xb1or governor, is Doctor Pedro Recio de Aguero I\r\nam a native of a place called Tirteafuera which lies between Caracuel\r\nand Almod\xc3\xb3var del Campo, on the right-hand side, and I have the degree\r\nof doctor from the university of Osuna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Sancho, glowing all over with rage, returned, \xe2\x80\x9cThen let Doctor\r\nPedro Recio de Malaguero, native of Tirteafuera, a place that\xe2\x80\x99s on the\r\nright-hand side as we go from Caracuel to Almod\xc3\xb3var del Campo, graduate\r\nof Osuna, get out of my presence at once; or I swear by the sun I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake a cudgel, and by dint of blows, beginning with him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not leave\r\na doctor in the whole island; at least of those I know to be ignorant;\r\nfor as to learned, wise, sensible physicians, them I will reverence and\r\nhonour as divine persons. Once more I say let Pedro Recio get out of\r\nthis or I\xe2\x80\x99ll take this chair I am sitting on and break it over his\r\nhead. And if they call me to account for it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll clear myself by\r\nsaying I served God in killing a bad doctor\xe2\x80\x94a general executioner. And\r\nnow give me something to eat, or else take your government; for a trade\r\nthat does not feed its master is not worth two beans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor was dismayed when he saw the governor in such a passion, and\r\nhe would have made a Tirteafuera out of the room but that the same\r\ninstant a post-horn sounded in the street; and the carver putting his\r\nhead out of the window turned round and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a courier from my\r\nlord the duke, no doubt with some despatch of importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe courier came in all sweating and flurried, and taking a paper from\r\nhis bosom, placed it in the governor\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Sancho handed it to the\r\nmajordomo and bade him read the superscription, which ran thus:\r\n\r\n_To Don Sancho Panza, Governor of the Island of Barataria, into his own\r\nhands or those of his secretary._\r\n\r\nSancho when he heard this said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhich of you is my secretary?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI am,\r\nse\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of those present, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I can read and write, and am a\r\nBiscayan.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWith that addition,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cyou might be secretary\r\nto the emperor himself; open this paper and see what it says.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nnew-born secretary obeyed, and having read the contents said the matter\r\nwas one to be discussed in private. Sancho ordered the chamber to be\r\ncleared, the majordomo and the carver only remaining; so the doctor and\r\nthe others withdrew, and then the secretary read the letter, which was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nIt has come to my knowledge, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Sancho Panza, that certain\r\nenemies of mine and of the island are about to make a furious attack\r\nupon it some night, I know not when. It behoves you to be on the alert\r\nand keep watch, that they surprise you not. I also know by trustworthy\r\nspies that four persons have entered the town in disguise in order to\r\ntake your life, because they stand in dread of your great capacity;\r\nkeep your eyes open and take heed who approaches you to address you,\r\nand eat nothing that is presented to you. I will take care to send you\r\naid if you find yourself in difficulty, but in all things you will act\r\nas may be expected of your judgment. From this place, the Sixteenth of\r\nAugust, at four in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\nTHE DUKE\r\n\r\n\r\nSancho was astonished, and those who stood by made believe to be so\r\ntoo, and turning to the majordomo he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we have got to\r\ndo first, and it must be done at once, is to put Doctor Recio in the\r\nlock-up; for if anyone wants to kill me it is he, and by a slow death\r\nand the worst of all, which is hunger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikewise,\xe2\x80\x9d said the carver, \xe2\x80\x9cit is my opinion your worship should not\r\neat anything that is on this table, for the whole was a present from\r\nsome nuns; and as they say, \xe2\x80\x98behind the cross there\xe2\x80\x99s the devil.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cso for the present give me a piece of\r\nbread and four pounds or so of grapes; no poison can come in them; for\r\nthe fact is I can\xe2\x80\x99t go on without eating; and if we are to be prepared\r\nfor these battles that are threatening us we must be well provisioned;\r\nfor it is the tripes that carry the heart and not the heart the tripes.\r\nAnd you, secretary, answer my lord the duke and tell him that all his\r\ncommands shall be obeyed to the letter, as he directs; and say from me\r\nto my lady the duchess that I kiss her hands, and that I beg of her not\r\nto forget to send my letter and bundle to my wife Teresa Panza by a\r\nmessenger; and I will take it as a great favour and will not fail to\r\nserve her in all that may lie within my power; and as you are about it\r\nyou may enclose a kiss of the hand to my master Don Quixote that he may\r\nsee I am grateful bread; and as a good secretary and a good Biscayan\r\nyou may add whatever you like and whatever will come in best; and now\r\ntake away this cloth and give me something to eat, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready to\r\nmeet all the spies and assassins and enchanters that may come against\r\nme or my island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this instant a page entered saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHere is a farmer on business,\r\nwho wants to speak to your lordship on a matter of great importance, he\r\nsays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very odd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ways of these men on business; is it\r\npossible they can be such fools as not to see that an hour like this is\r\nno hour for coming on business? We who govern and we who are judges\xe2\x80\x94are\r\nwe not men of flesh and blood, and are we not to be allowed the time\r\nrequired for taking rest, unless they\xe2\x80\x99d have us made of marble? By God\r\nand on my conscience, if the government remains in my hands (which I\r\nhave a notion it won\xe2\x80\x99t), I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring more than one man on business to\r\norder. However, tell this good man to come in; but take care first of\r\nall that he is not some spy or one of my assassins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he looks like a simple fellow, and\r\neither I know very little or he is as good as good bread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to be afraid of,\xe2\x80\x9d said the majordomo, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we are all\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it be possible, carver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cnow that Doctor Pedro\r\nRecio is not here, to let me eat something solid and substantial, if it\r\nwere even a piece of bread and an onion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night at supper,\xe2\x80\x9d said the carver, \xe2\x80\x9cthe shortcomings of the dinner\r\nshall be made good, and your lordship shall be fully contented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\nThe farmer now came in, a well-favoured man that one might see a\r\nthousand leagues off was an honest fellow and a good soul. The first\r\nthing he said was, \xe2\x80\x9cWhich is the lord governor here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich should it be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the secretary, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he who is seated in the\r\nchair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I humble myself before him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer; and going on his\r\nknees he asked for his hand, to kiss it. Sancho refused it, and bade\r\nhim stand up and say what he wanted. The farmer obeyed, and then said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a farmer, se\xc3\xb1or, a native of Miguelturra, a village two leagues\r\nfrom Ciudad Real.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother Tirteafuera!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9csay on, brother; I know\r\nMiguelturra very well I can tell you, for it\xe2\x80\x99s not very far from my own\r\ntown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe case is this, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the farmer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat by God\xe2\x80\x99s mercy I\r\nam married with the leave and licence of the holy Roman Catholic\r\nChurch; I have two sons, students, and the younger is studying to\r\nbecome bachelor, and the elder to be licentiate; I am a widower, for my\r\nwife died, or more properly speaking, a bad doctor killed her on my\r\nhands, giving her a purge when she was with child; and if it had\r\npleased God that the child had been born, and was a boy, I would have\r\nput him to study for doctor, that he might not envy his brothers the\r\nbachelor and the licentiate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that if your wife had not died, or had not been killed, you would\r\nnot now be a widower,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, se\xc3\xb1or, certainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got that much settled,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cget on, brother, for it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore bed-time than business-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer, \xe2\x80\x9cthis son of mine who is going to be a\r\nbachelor, fell in love in the said town with a damsel called Clara\r\nPerlerina, daughter of Andres Perlerino, a very rich farmer; and this\r\nname of Perlerines does not come to them by ancestry or descent, but\r\nbecause all the family are paralytics, and for a better name they call\r\nthem Perlerines; though to tell the truth the damsel is as fair as an\r\nOriental pearl, and like a flower of the field, if you look at her on\r\nthe right side; on the left not so much, for on that side she wants an\r\neye that she lost by small-pox; and though her face is thickly and\r\ndeeply pitted, those who love her say they are not pits that are there,\r\nbut the graves where the hearts of her lovers are buried. She is so\r\ncleanly that not to soil her face she carries her nose turned up, as\r\nthey say, so that one would fancy it was running away from her mouth;\r\nand with all this she looks extremely well, for she has a wide mouth;\r\nand but for wanting ten or a dozen teeth and grinders she might compare\r\nand compete with the comeliest. Of her lips I say nothing, for they are\r\nso fine and thin that, if lips might be reeled, one might make a skein\r\nof them; but being of a different colour from ordinary lips they are\r\nwonderful, for they are mottled, blue, green, and purple\xe2\x80\x94let my lord\r\nthe governor pardon me for painting so minutely the charms of her who\r\nsome time or other will be my daughter; for I love her, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind her amiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaint what you will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI enjoy your painting, and if I\r\nhad dined there could be no dessert more to my taste than your\r\nportrait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I have still to furnish,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut a time will come\r\nwhen we may be able if we are not now; and I can tell you, se\xc3\xb1or, if I\r\ncould paint her gracefulness and her tall figure, it would astonish\r\nyou; but that is impossible because she is bent double with her knees\r\nup to her mouth; but for all that it is easy to see that if she could\r\nstand up she\xe2\x80\x99d knock her head against the ceiling; and she would have\r\ngiven her hand to my bachelor ere this, only that she can\xe2\x80\x99t stretch it\r\nout, for it\xe2\x80\x99s contracted; but still one can see its elegance and fine\r\nmake by its long furrowed nails.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cconsider you have painted her\r\nfrom head to foot; what is it you want now? Come to the point without\r\nall this beating about the bush, and all these scraps and additions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want your worship, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer, \xe2\x80\x9cto do me the favour of\r\ngiving me a letter of recommendation to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s father, begging him\r\nto be so good as to let this marriage take place, as we are not\r\nill-matched either in the gifts of fortune or of nature; for to tell\r\nthe truth, se\xc3\xb1or governor, my son is possessed of a devil, and there is\r\nnot a day but the evil spirits torment him three or four times; and\r\nfrom having once fallen into the fire, he has his face puckered up like\r\na piece of parchment, and his eyes watery and always running; but he\r\nhas the disposition of an angel, and if it was not for belabouring and\r\npummelling himself he\xe2\x80\x99d be a saint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything else you want, good man?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s another thing I\xe2\x80\x99d like,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid to\r\nmention it; however, out it must; for after all I can\xe2\x80\x99t let it be\r\nrotting in my breast, come what may. I mean, se\xc3\xb1or, that I\xe2\x80\x99d like your\r\nworship to give me three hundred or six hundred ducats as a help to my\r\nbachelor\xe2\x80\x99s portion, to help him in setting up house; for they must, in\r\nshort, live by themselves, without being subject to the interferences\r\nof their fathers-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything else you\xe2\x80\x99d like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhold back from mentioning it out of bashfulness or modesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed there is not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe moment he said this the governor started to his feet, and seizing\r\nthe chair he had been sitting on exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cBy all that\xe2\x80\x99s good, you\r\nill-bred, boorish Don Bumpkin, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get out of this at once and\r\nhide yourself from my sight, I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay your head open with this chair.\r\nYou whoreson rascal, you devil\xe2\x80\x99s own painter, and is it at this hour\r\nyou come to ask me for six hundred ducats! How should I have them, you\r\nstinking brute? And why should I give them to you if I had them, you\r\nknave and blockhead? What have I to do with Miguelturra or the whole\r\nfamily of the Perlerines? Get out I say, or by the life of my lord the\r\nduke I\xe2\x80\x99ll do as I said. You\xe2\x80\x99re not from Miguelturra, but some knave\r\nsent here from hell to tempt me. Why, you villain, I have not yet had\r\nthe government half a day, and you want me to have six hundred ducats\r\nalready!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe carver made signs to the farmer to leave the room, which he did\r\nwith his head down, and to all appearance in terror lest the governor\r\nshould carry his threats into effect, for the rogue knew very well how\r\nto play his part.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave Sancho in his wrath, and peace be with them all; and\r\nlet us return to Don Quixote, whom we left with his face bandaged and\r\ndoctored after the cat wounds, of which he was not cured for eight\r\ndays; and on one of these there befell him what Cide Hamete promises to\r\nrelate with that exactitude and truth with which he is wont to set\r\nforth everything connected with this great history, however minute it\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np47e.jpg (12K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\nOF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH DO\xc3\x91A RODRIGUEZ, THE DUCHESS\xe2\x80\x99S DUENNA,\r\nTOGETHER WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY OF RECORD AND ETERNAL\r\nREMEMBRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np48a.jpg (131K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExceedingly moody and dejected was the sorely wounded Don Quixote, with\r\nhis face bandaged and marked, not by the hand of God, but by the claws\r\nof a cat, mishaps incidental to knight-errantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np48b.jpg (316K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSix days he remained without appearing in public, and one night as he\r\nlay awake thinking of his misfortunes and of Altisidora\xe2\x80\x99s pursuit of\r\nhim, he perceived that someone was opening the door of his room with a\r\nkey, and he at once made up his mind that the enamoured damsel was\r\ncoming to make an assault upon his chastity and put him in danger of\r\nfailing in the fidelity he owed to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, firmly persuaded of the truth of his idea (and he said it loud\r\nenough to be heard), \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest beauty upon earth shall not avail to\r\nmake me renounce my adoration of her whom I bear stamped and graved in\r\nthe core of my heart and the secret depths of my bowels; be thou, lady\r\nmine, transformed into a clumsy country wench, or into a nymph of\r\ngolden Tagus weaving a web of silk and gold, let Merlin or Montesinos\r\nhold thee captive where they will; where\xe2\x80\x99er thou art, thou art mine,\r\nand where\xe2\x80\x99er I am, must be thine.\xe2\x80\x9d The very instant he had uttered\r\nthese words, the door opened. He stood up on the bed wrapped from head\r\nto foot in a yellow satin coverlet, with a cap on his head, and his\r\nface and his moustaches tied up, his face because of the scratches, and\r\nhis moustaches to keep them from drooping and falling down, in which\r\ntrim he looked the most extraordinary scarecrow that could be\r\nconceived. He kept his eyes fixed on the door, and just as he was\r\nexpecting to see the love-smitten and unhappy Altisidora make her\r\nappearance, he saw coming in a most venerable duenna, in a long\r\nwhite-bordered veil that covered and enveloped her from head to foot.\r\nBetween the fingers of her left hand she held a short lighted candle,\r\nwhile with her right she shaded it to keep the light from her eyes,\r\nwhich were covered by spectacles of great size, and she advanced with\r\nnoiseless steps, treading very softly.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote kept an eye upon her from his watchtower, and observing her\r\ncostume and noting her silence, he concluded that it must be some witch\r\nor sorceress that was coming in such a guise to work him some mischief,\r\nand he began crossing himself at a great rate. The spectre still\r\nadvanced, and on reaching the middle of the room, looked up and saw the\r\nenergy with which Don Quixote was crossing himself; and if he was\r\nscared by seeing such a figure as hers, she was terrified at the sight\r\nof his; for the moment she saw his tall yellow form with the coverlet\r\nand the bandages that disfigured him, she gave a loud scream, and\r\nexclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cJesus! what\xe2\x80\x99s this I see?\xe2\x80\x9d let fall the candle in her\r\nfright, and then finding herself in the dark, turned about to make off,\r\nbut stumbling on her skirts in her consternation, she measured her\r\nlength with a mighty fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np48c.jpg (249K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote in his trepidation began saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI conjure thee, phantom,\r\nor whatever thou art, tell me what thou art and what thou wouldst with\r\nme. If thou art a soul in torment, say so, and all that my powers can\r\ndo I will do for thee; for I am a Catholic Christian and love to do\r\ngood to all the world, and to this end I have embraced the order of\r\nknight-errantry to which I belong, the province of which extends to\r\ndoing good even to souls in purgatory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate duenna hearing herself thus conjured, by her own fear\r\nguessed Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s and in a low plaintive voice answered, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x94if so be you are indeed Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x94I am no phantom or spectre\r\nor soul in purgatory, as you seem to think, but Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez, duenna\r\nof honour to my lady the duchess, and I come to you with one of those\r\ngrievances your worship is wont to redress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Se\xc3\xb1ora Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you perchance\r\ncome to transact any go-between business? Because I must tell you I am\r\nnot available for anybody\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, thanks to the peerless beauty of\r\nmy lady Dulcinea del Toboso. In short, Se\xc3\xb1ora Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez, if you\r\nwill leave out and put aside all love messages, you may go and light\r\nyour candle and come back, and we will discuss all the commands you\r\nhave for me and whatever you wish, saving only, as I said, all\r\nseductive communications.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI carry nobody\xe2\x80\x99s messages, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duenna; \xe2\x80\x9clittle you know\r\nme. Nay, I\xe2\x80\x99m not far enough advanced in years to take to any such\r\nchildish tricks. God be praised I have a soul in my body still, and all\r\nmy teeth and grinders in my mouth, except one or two that the colds, so\r\ncommon in this Aragon country, have robbed me of. But wait a little,\r\nwhile I go and light my candle, and I will return immediately and lay\r\nmy sorrows before you as before one who relieves those of all the\r\nworld;\xe2\x80\x9d and without staying for an answer she quitted the room and left\r\nDon Quixote tranquilly meditating while he waited for her. A thousand\r\nthoughts at once suggested themselves to him on the subject of this new\r\nadventure, and it struck him as being ill done and worse advised in him\r\nto expose himself to the danger of breaking his plighted faith to his\r\nlady; and said he to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWho knows but that the devil, being wily\r\nand cunning, may be trying now to entrap me with a duenna, having\r\nfailed with empresses, queens, duchesses, marchionesses, and\r\ncountesses? Many a time have I heard it said by many a man of sense\r\nthat he will sooner offer you a flat-nosed wench than a roman-nosed\r\none; and who knows but this privacy, this opportunity, this silence,\r\nmay awaken my sleeping desires, and lead me in these my latter years to\r\nfall where I have never tripped? In cases of this sort it is better to\r\nflee than to await the battle. But I must be out of my senses to think\r\nand utter such nonsense; for it is impossible that a long, white-hooded\r\nspectacled duenna could stir up or excite a wanton thought in the most\r\ngraceless bosom in the world. Is there a duenna on earth that has fair\r\nflesh? Is there a duenna in the world that escapes being ill-tempered,\r\nwrinkled, and prudish? Avaunt, then, ye duenna crew, undelightful to\r\nall mankind. Oh, but that lady did well who, they say, had at the end\r\nof her reception room a couple of figures of duennas with spectacles\r\nand lace-cushions, as if at work, and those statues served quite as\r\nwell to give an air of propriety to the room as if they had been real\r\nduennas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying he leaped off the bed, intending to close the door and not\r\nallow Se\xc3\xb1ora Rodriguez to enter; but as he went to shut it Se\xc3\xb1ora\r\nRodriguez returned with a wax candle lighted, and having a closer view\r\nof Don Quixote, with the coverlet round him, and his bandages and\r\nnight-cap, she was alarmed afresh, and retreating a couple of paces,\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cAm I safe, sir knight? for I don\xe2\x80\x99t look upon it as a sign\r\nof very great virtue that your worship should have got up out of bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may well ask the same, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand I do ask\r\nwhether I shall be safe from being assailed and forced?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf whom and against whom do you demand that security, sir knight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the duenna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf you and against you I ask it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am not\r\nmarble, nor are you brass, nor is it now ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning,\r\nbut midnight, or a trifle past it I fancy, and we are in a room more\r\nsecluded and retired than the cave could have been where the\r\ntreacherous and daring \xc3\x86neas enjoyed the fair soft-hearted Dido. But\r\ngive me your hand, se\xc3\xb1ora; I require no better protection than my own\r\ncontinence, and my own sense of propriety; as well as that which is\r\ninspired by that venerable head-dress;\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying he kissed her\r\nright hand and took it in his own, she yielding it to him with equal\r\nceremoniousness. And here Cide Hamete inserts a parenthesis in which he\r\nsays that to have seen the pair marching from the door to the bed,\r\nlinked hand in hand in this way, he would have given the best of the\r\ntwo tunics he had.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote finally got into bed, and Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez took her seat on a\r\nchair at some little distance from his couch, without taking off her\r\nspectacles or putting aside the candle. Don Quixote wrapped the\r\nbedclothes round him and covered himself up completely, leaving nothing\r\nbut his face visible, and as soon as they had both regained their\r\ncomposure he broke silence, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Se\xc3\xb1ora Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez, you\r\nmay unbosom yourself and out with everything you have in your sorrowful\r\nheart and afflicted bowels; and by me you shall be listened to with\r\nchaste ears, and aided by compassionate exertions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the duenna; \xe2\x80\x9cfrom your worship\xe2\x80\x99s gentle and\r\nwinning presence only such a Christian answer could be expected. The\r\nfact is, then, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, that though you see me seated in this\r\nchair, here in the middle of the kingdom of Aragon, and in the attire\r\nof a despised outcast duenna, I am from the Asturias of Oviedo, and of\r\na family with which many of the best of the province are connected by\r\nblood; but my untoward fate and the improvidence of my parents, who, I\r\nknow not how, were unseasonably reduced to poverty, brought me to the\r\ncourt of Madrid, where as a provision and to avoid greater misfortunes,\r\nmy parents placed me as seamstress in the service of a lady of quality,\r\nand I would have you know that for hemming and sewing I have never been\r\nsurpassed by any all my life. My parents left me in service and\r\nreturned to their own country, and a few years later went, no doubt, to\r\nheaven, for they were excellent good Catholic Christians. I was left an\r\norphan with nothing but the miserable wages and trifling presents that\r\nare given to servants of my sort in palaces; but about this time,\r\nwithout any encouragement on my part, one of the esquires of the\r\nhousehold fell in love with me, a man somewhat advanced in years,\r\nfull-bearded and personable, and above all as good a gentleman as the\r\nking himself, for he came of a mountain stock. We did not carry on our\r\nloves with such secrecy but that they came to the knowledge of my lady,\r\nand she, not to have any fuss about it, had us married with the full\r\nsanction of the holy mother Roman Catholic Church, of which marriage a\r\ndaughter was born to put an end to my good fortune, if I had any; not\r\nthat I died in childbirth, for I passed through it safely and in due\r\nseason, but because shortly afterwards my husband died of a certain\r\nshock he received, and had I time to tell you of it I know your worship\r\nwould be surprised;\xe2\x80\x9d and here she began to weep bitterly and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, if I am unable to control myself, for\r\nevery time I think of my unfortunate husband my eyes fill up with\r\ntears. God bless me, with what an air of dignity he used to carry my\r\nlady behind him on a stout mule as black as jet! for in those days they\r\ndid not use coaches or chairs, as they say they do now, and ladies rode\r\nbehind their squires. This much at least I cannot help telling you,\r\nthat you may observe the good breeding and punctiliousness of my worthy\r\nhusband. As he was turning into the Calle de Santiago in Madrid, which\r\nis rather narrow, one of the alcaldes of the Court, with two alguacils\r\nbefore him, was coming out of it, and as soon as my good squire saw him\r\nhe wheeled his mule about and made as if he would turn and accompany\r\nhim. My lady, who was riding behind him, said to him in a low voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you about, you sneak, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see that I am here?\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\nalcalde like a polite man pulled up his horse and said to him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Proceed, se\xc3\xb1or, for it is I, rather, who ought to accompany my lady\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Casilda\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94for that was my mistress\xe2\x80\x99s name. Still my husband, cap in\r\nhand, persisted in trying to accompany the alcalde, and seeing this my\r\nlady, filled with rage and vexation, pulled out a big pin, or, I rather\r\nthink, a bodkin, out of her needle-case and drove it into his back with\r\nsuch force that my husband gave a loud yell, and writhing fell to the\r\nground with his lady. Her two lacqueys ran to rise her up, and the\r\nalcalde and the alguacils did the same; the Guadalajara gate was all in\r\ncommotion\xe2\x80\x94I mean the idlers congregated there; my mistress came back on\r\nfoot, and my husband hurried away to a barber\xe2\x80\x99s shop protesting that he\r\nwas run right through the guts. The courtesy of my husband was noised\r\nabroad to such an extent, that the boys gave him no peace in the\r\nstreet; and on this account, and because he was somewhat shortsighted,\r\nmy lady dismissed him; and it was chagrin at this I am convinced beyond\r\na doubt that brought on his death. I was left a helpless widow, with a\r\ndaughter on my hands growing up in beauty like the sea-foam; at length,\r\nhowever, as I had the character of being an excellent needlewoman, my\r\nlady the duchess, then lately married to my lord the duke, offered to\r\ntake me with her to this kingdom of Aragon, and my daughter also, and\r\nhere as time went by my daughter grew up and with her all the graces in\r\nthe world; she sings like a lark, dances quick as thought, foots it\r\nlike a gipsy, reads and writes like a schoolmaster, and does sums like\r\na miser; of her neatness I say nothing, for the running water is not\r\npurer, and her age is now, if my memory serves me, sixteen years five\r\nmonths and three days, one more or less. To come to the point, the son\r\nof a very rich farmer, living in a village of my lord the duke\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nvery far from here, fell in love with this girl of mine; and in short,\r\nhow I know not, they came together, and under the promise of marrying\r\nher he made a fool of my daughter, and will not keep his word. And\r\nthough my lord the duke is aware of it (for I have complained to him,\r\nnot once but many and many a time, and entreated him to order the\r\nfarmer to marry my daughter), he turns a deaf ear and will scarcely\r\nlisten to me; the reason being that as the deceiver\xe2\x80\x99s father is so\r\nrich, and lends him money, and is constantly going security for his\r\ndebts, he does not like to offend or annoy him in any way. Now, se\xc3\xb1or,\r\nI want your worship to take it upon yourself to redress this wrong\r\neither by entreaty or by arms; for by what all the world says you came\r\ninto it to redress grievances and right wrongs and help the\r\nunfortunate. Let your worship put before you the unprotected condition\r\nof my daughter, her youth, and all the perfections I have said she\r\npossesses; and before God and on my conscience, out of all the damsels\r\nmy lady has, there is not one that comes up to the sole of her shoe,\r\nand the one they call Altisidora, and look upon as the boldest and\r\ngayest of them, put in comparison with my daughter, does not come\r\nwithin two leagues of her. For I would have you know, se\xc3\xb1or, all is not\r\ngold that glitters, and that same little Altisidora has more\r\nforwardness than good looks, and more impudence than modesty; besides\r\nbeing not very sound, for she has such a disagreeable breath that one\r\ncannot bear to be near her for a moment; and even my lady the\r\nduchess\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold my tongue, for they say that walls have ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez, what ails my lady the duchess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdjured in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the duenna, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot help answering the\r\nquestion and telling the whole truth. Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, have you\r\nobserved the comeliness of my lady the duchess, that smooth complexion\r\nof hers like a burnished polished sword, those two cheeks of milk and\r\ncarmine, that gay lively step with which she treads or rather seems to\r\nspurn the earth, so that one would fancy she went radiating health\r\nwherever she passed? Well then, let me tell you she may thank, first of\r\nall God, for this, and next, two issues that she has, one in each leg,\r\nby which all the evil humours, of which the doctors say she is full,\r\nare discharged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlessed Virgin!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand is it possible that my\r\nlady the duchess has drains of that sort? I would not have believed it\r\nif the barefoot friars had told it me; but as the lady Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez\r\nsays so, it must be so. But surely such issues, and in such places, do\r\nnot discharge humours, but liquid amber. Verily, I do believe now that\r\nthis practice of opening issues is a very important matter for the\r\nhealth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote had hardly said this, when the chamber door flew open with\r\na loud bang, and with the start the noise gave her Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez let\r\nthe candle fall from her hand, and the room was left as dark as a\r\nwolf\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, as the saying is. Suddenly the poor duenna felt two hands\r\nseize her by the throat, so tightly that she could not croak, while\r\nsomeone else, without uttering a word, very briskly hoisted up her\r\npetticoats, and with what seemed to be a slipper began to lay on so\r\nheartily that anyone would have felt pity for her; but although Don\r\nQuixote felt it he never stirred from his bed, but lay quiet and\r\nsilent, nay apprehensive that his turn for a drubbing might be coming.\r\nNor was the apprehension an idle one; for leaving the duenna (who did\r\nnot dare to cry out) well basted, the silent executioners fell upon Don\r\nQuixote, and stripping him of the sheet and the coverlet, they pinched\r\nhim so fast and so hard that he was driven to defend himself with his\r\nfists, and all this in marvellous silence. The battle lasted nearly\r\nhalf an hour, and then the phantoms fled; Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez gathered up\r\nher skirts, and bemoaning her fate went out without saying a word to\r\nDon Quixote, and he, sorely pinched, puzzled, and dejected, remained\r\nalone, and there we will leave him, wondering who could have been the\r\nperverse enchanter who had reduced him to such a state; but that shall\r\nbe told in due season, for Sancho claims our attention, and the\r\nmethodical arrangement of the story demands it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np48e.jpg (28K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\nOF WHAT HAPPENED SANCHO IN MAKING THE ROUND OF HIS ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np49a.jpg (170K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left the great governor angered and irritated by that\r\nportrait-painting rogue of a farmer who, instructed the majordomo, as\r\nthe majordomo was by the duke, tried to practise upon him; he however,\r\nfool, boor, and clown as he was, held his own against them all, saying\r\nto those round him and to Doctor Pedro Recio, who as soon as the\r\nprivate business of the duke\xe2\x80\x99s letter was disposed of had returned to\r\nthe room, \xe2\x80\x9cNow I see plainly enough that judges and governors ought to\r\nbe and must be made of brass not to feel the importunities of the\r\napplicants that at all times and all seasons insist on being heard, and\r\nhaving their business despatched, and their own affairs and no others\r\nattended to, come what may; and if the poor judge does not hear them\r\nand settle the matter\xe2\x80\x94either because he cannot or because that is not\r\nthe time set apart for hearing them\xe2\x80\x94forthwith they abuse him, and run\r\nhim down, and gnaw at his bones, and even pick holes in his pedigree.\r\nYou silly, stupid applicant, don\xe2\x80\x99t be in a hurry; wait for the proper\r\ntime and season for doing business; don\xe2\x80\x99t come at dinner-hour, or at\r\nbed-time; for judges are only flesh and blood, and must give to Nature\r\nwhat she naturally demands of them; all except myself, for in my case I\r\ngive her nothing to eat, thanks to Se\xc3\xb1or Doctor Pedro Recio Tirteafuera\r\nhere, who would have me die of hunger, and declares that death to be\r\nlife; and the same sort of life may God give him and all his kind\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmean the bad doctors; for the good ones deserve palms and laurels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll who knew Sancho Panza were astonished to hear him speak so\r\nelegantly, and did not know what to attribute it to unless it were that\r\noffice and grave responsibility either smarten or stupefy men\xe2\x80\x99s wits.\r\nAt last Doctor Pedro Recio Agilers of Tirteafuera promised to let him\r\nhave supper that night though it might be in contravention of all the\r\naphorisms of Hippocrates. With this the governor was satisfied and\r\nlooked forward to the approach of night and supper-time with great\r\nanxiety; and though time, to his mind, stood still and made no\r\nprogress, nevertheless the hour he so longed for came, and they gave\r\nhim a beef salad with onions and some boiled calves\xe2\x80\x99 feet rather far\r\ngone. At this he fell to with greater relish than if they had given him\r\nfrancolins from Milan, pheasants from Rome, veal from Sorrento,\r\npartridges from Moron, or geese from Lavajos, and turning to the doctor\r\nat supper he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, se\xc3\xb1or doctor, for the future\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself about giving me dainty things or choice dishes\r\nto eat, for it will be only taking my stomach off its hinges; it is\r\naccustomed to goat, cow, bacon, hung beef, turnips and onions; and if\r\nby any chance it is given these palace dishes, it receives them\r\nsqueamishly, and sometimes with loathing. What the head-carver had best\r\ndo is to serve me with what they call ollas podridas (and the rottener\r\nthey are the better they smell); and he can put whatever he likes into\r\nthem, so long as it is good to eat, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be obliged to him, and\r\nwill requite him some day. But let nobody play pranks on me, for either\r\nwe are or we are not; let us live and eat in peace and good-fellowship,\r\nfor when God sends the dawn, he sends it for all. I mean to govern this\r\nisland without giving up a right or taking a bribe; let everyone keep\r\nhis eye open, and look out for the arrow; for I can tell them \xe2\x80\x98the\r\ndevil\xe2\x80\x99s in Cantillana,\xe2\x80\x99 and if they drive me to it they\xe2\x80\x99ll see\r\nsomething that will astonish them. Nay! make yourself honey and the\r\nflies eat you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf a truth, se\xc3\xb1or governor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the carver, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship is in the\r\nright of it in everything you have said; and I promise you in the name\r\nof all the inhabitants of this island that they will serve your worship\r\nwith all zeal, affection, and good-will, for the mild kind of\r\ngovernment you have given a sample of to begin with, leaves them no\r\nground for doing or thinking anything to your worship\xe2\x80\x99s disadvantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand they would be great fools if they\r\ndid or thought otherwise; once more I say, see to my feeding and my\r\nDapple\xe2\x80\x99s for that is the great point and what is most to the purpose;\r\nand when the hour comes let us go the rounds, for it is my intention to\r\npurge this island of all manner of uncleanness and of all idle\r\ngood-for-nothing vagabonds; for I would have you know that lazy idlers\r\nare the same thing in a State as the drones in a hive, that eat up the\r\nhoney the industrious bees make. I mean to protect the husbandman, to\r\npreserve to the gentleman his privileges, to reward the virtuous, and\r\nabove all to respect religion and honour its ministers. What say you to\r\nthat, my friends? Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to\r\nno purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is so much in what your worship says, se\xc3\xb1or governor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nmajordomo, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am filled with wonder when I see a man like your\r\nworship, entirely without learning (for I believe you have none at\r\nall), say such things, and so full of sound maxims and sage remarks,\r\nvery different from what was expected of your worship\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence by\r\nthose who sent us or by us who came here. Every day we see something\r\nnew in this world; jokes become realities, and the jokers find the\r\ntables turned upon them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNight came, and with the permission of Doctor Pedro Recio, the governor\r\nhad supper. They then got ready to go the rounds, and he started with\r\nthe majordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, the chronicler charged\r\nwith recording his deeds, and alguacils and notaries enough to form a\r\nfair-sized squadron. In the midst marched Sancho with his staff, as\r\nfine a sight as one could wish to see, and but a few streets of the\r\ntown had been traversed when they heard a noise as of a clashing of\r\nswords. They hastened to the spot, and found that the combatants were\r\nbut two, who seeing the authorities approaching stood still, and one of\r\nthem exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp, in the name of God and the king! Are men to be\r\nallowed to rob in the middle of this town, and rush out and attack\r\npeople in the very streets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe calm, my good man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell me what the cause of\r\nthis quarrel is; for I am the governor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaid the other combatant, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or governor, I will tell you in a very\r\nfew words. Your worship must know that this gentleman has just now won\r\nmore than a thousand reals in that gambling house opposite, and God\r\nknows how. I was there, and gave more than one doubtful point in his\r\nfavour, very much against what my conscience told me. He made off with\r\nhis winnings, and when I made sure he was going to give me a crown or\r\nso at least by way of a present, as it is usual and customary to give\r\nmen of quality of my sort who stand by to see fair or foul play, and\r\nback up swindles, and prevent quarrels, he pocketed his money and left\r\nthe house. Indignant at this I followed him, and speaking to him fairly\r\nand civilly asked him to give me if it were only eight reals, for he\r\nknows I am an honest man and that I have neither profession nor\r\nproperty, for my parents never brought me up to any or left me any; but\r\nthe rogue, who is a greater thief than Cacus and a greater sharper than\r\nAndradilla, would not give me more than four reals; so your worship may\r\nsee how little shame and conscience he has. But by my faith if you had\r\nnot come up I\xe2\x80\x99d have made him disgorge his winnings, and he\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nlearned what the range of the steel-yard was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat say you to this?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sancho. The other replied that all his\r\nantagonist said was true, and that he did not choose to give him more\r\nthan four reals because he very often gave him money; and that those\r\nwho expected presents ought to be civil and take what is given them\r\nwith a cheerful countenance, and not make any claim against winners\r\nunless they know them for certain to be sharpers and their winnings to\r\nbe unfairly won; and that there could be no better proof that he\r\nhimself was an honest man than his having refused to give anything; for\r\nsharpers always pay tribute to lookers-on who know them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the majordomo; \xe2\x80\x9clet your worship consider what is\r\nto be done with these men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cis this; you, the winner, be you\r\ngood, bad, or indifferent, give this assailant of yours a hundred reals\r\nat once, and you must disburse thirty more for the poor prisoners; and\r\nyou who have neither profession nor property, and hang about the island\r\nin idleness, take these hundred reals now, and some time of the day\r\nto-morrow quit the island under sentence of banishment for ten years,\r\nand under pain of completing it in another life if you violate the\r\nsentence, for I\xe2\x80\x99ll hang you on a gibbet, or at least the hangman will\r\nby my orders; not a word from either of you, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll make him feel my\r\nhand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe one paid down the money and the other took it, and the latter\r\nquitted the island, while the other went home; and then the governor\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cEither I am not good for much, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll get rid of these gambling\r\nhouses, for it strikes me they are very mischievous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis one at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the notaries, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship will not\r\nbe able to get rid of, for a great man owns it, and what he loses every\r\nyear is beyond all comparison more than what he makes by the cards. On\r\nthe minor gambling houses your worship may exercise your power, and it\r\nis they that do most harm and shelter the most barefaced practices; for\r\nin the houses of lords and gentlemen of quality the notorious sharpers\r\ndare not attempt to play their tricks; and as the vice of gambling has\r\nbecome common, it is better that men should play in houses of repute\r\nthan in some tradesman\xe2\x80\x99s, where they catch an unlucky fellow in the\r\nsmall hours of the morning and skin him alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know already, notary, that there is a good deal to be said on that\r\npoint,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\nAnd now a tipstaff came up with a young man in his grasp, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or governor, this youth was coming towards us, and as soon as he\r\nsaw the officers of justice he turned about and ran like a deer, a sure\r\nproof that he must be some evil-doer; I ran after him, and had it not\r\nbeen that he stumbled and fell, I should never have caught him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you run for, fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\nTo which the young man replied, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, it was to avoid answering all\r\nthe questions officers of justice put.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you by trade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA weaver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you weave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLance heads, with your worship\xe2\x80\x99s good leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re facetious with me! You plume yourself on being a wag? Very\r\ngood; and where were you going just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo take the air, se\xc3\xb1or.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where does one take the air in this island?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere it blows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! your answers are very much to the point; you are a smart youth;\r\nbut take notice that I am the air, and that I blow upon you a-stern,\r\nand send you to gaol. Ho there! lay hold of him and take him off; I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake him sleep there to-night without air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship will make me sleep in gaol\r\njust as soon as make me king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shan\xe2\x80\x99t I make thee sleep in gaol?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I not the\r\npower to arrest thee and release thee whenever I like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the power your worship has,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t be able to\r\nmake me sleep in gaol.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? not able!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9ctake him away at once where he\xe2\x80\x99ll see\r\nhis mistake with his own eyes, even if the gaoler is willing to exert\r\nhis interested generosity on his behalf; for I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay a penalty of two\r\nthousand ducats on him if he allows him to stir a step from the\r\nprison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man; \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact is, all the men on\r\nearth will not make me sleep in prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, you devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9chave you got any angel that will\r\ndeliver you, and take off the irons I am going to order them to put\r\nupon you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, se\xc3\xb1or governor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man in a sprightly manner, \xe2\x80\x9clet\r\nus be reasonable and come to the point. Granted your worship may order\r\nme to be taken to prison, and to have irons and chains put on me, and\r\nto be shut up in a cell, and may lay heavy penalties on the gaoler if\r\nhe lets me out, and that he obeys your orders; still, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t choose\r\nto sleep, and choose to remain awake all night without closing an eye,\r\nwill your worship with all your power be able to make me sleep if I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t choose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, truly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the secretary, \xe2\x80\x9cand the fellow has made his point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be entirely of your own choice you\r\nwould keep from sleeping; not in opposition to my will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth, \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, go, and God be with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbe off home to\r\nsleep, and God give you sound sleep, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to rob you of it;\r\nbut for the future, let me advise you don\xe2\x80\x99t joke with the authorities,\r\nbecause you may come across someone who will bring down the joke on\r\nyour own skull.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man went his way, and the governor continued his round, and\r\nshortly afterwards two tipstaffs came up with a man in custody, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or governor, this person, who seems to be a man, is not so,\r\nbut a woman, and not an ill-favoured one, in man\xe2\x80\x99s clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\nraised two or three lanterns to her face, and by their light they\r\ndistinguished the features of a woman to all appearance of the age of\r\nsixteen or a little more, with her hair gathered into a gold and green\r\nsilk net, and fair as a thousand pearls. They scanned her from head to\r\nfoot, and observed that she had on red silk stockings with garters of\r\nwhite taffety bordered with gold and pearl; her breeches were of green\r\nand gold stuff, and under an open jacket or jerkin of the same she wore\r\na doublet of the finest white and gold cloth; her shoes were white and\r\nsuch as men wear; she carried no sword at her belt, but only a richly\r\nornamented dagger, and on her fingers she had several handsome rings.\r\nIn short, the girl seemed fair to look at in the eyes of all, and none\r\nof those who beheld her knew her, the people of the town said they\r\ncould not imagine who she was, and those who were in on the secret of\r\nthe jokes that were to be practised upon Sancho were the ones who were\r\nmost surprised, for this incident or discovery had not been arranged by\r\nthem; and they watched anxiously to see how the affair would end.\r\n\r\nSancho was fascinated by the girl\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, and he asked her who she\r\nwas, where she was going, and what had induced her to dress herself in\r\nthat garb. She with her eyes fixed on the ground answered in modest\r\nconfusion, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you, se\xc3\xb1or, before so many people what it is\r\nof such consequence to me to have kept secret; one thing I wish to be\r\nknown, that I am no thief or evildoer, but only an unhappy maiden whom\r\nthe power of jealousy has led to break through the respect that is due\r\nto modesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing this the majordomo said to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cMake the people stand back,\r\nse\xc3\xb1or governor, that this lady may say what she wishes with less\r\nembarrassment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho gave the order, and all except the majordomo, the head-carver,\r\nand the secretary fell back. Finding herself then in the presence of no\r\nmore, the damsel went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI am the daughter, sirs, of Pedro\r\nPerez Mazorca, the wool-farmer of this town, who is in the habit of\r\ncoming very often to my father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t do, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said the majordomo; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I know Pedro Perez\r\nvery well, and I know he has no child at all, either son or daughter;\r\nand besides, though you say he is your father, you add then that he\r\ncomes very often to your father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had already noticed that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am confused just now, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the damsel, \xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nI am saying; but the truth is that I am the daughter of Diego de la\r\nLlana, whom you must all know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the majordomo; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I know Diego de la Llana,\r\nand know that he is a gentleman of position and a rich man, and that he\r\nhas a son and a daughter, and that since he was left a widower nobody\r\nin all this town can speak of having seen his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s face; for he\r\nkeeps her so closely shut up that he does not give even the sun a\r\nchance of seeing her; and for all that report says she is extremely\r\nbeautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the damsel, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am that daughter; whether report\r\nlies or not as to my beauty, you, sirs, will have decided by this time,\r\nas you have seen me;\xe2\x80\x9d and with this she began to weep bitterly.\r\n\r\nOn seeing this the secretary leant over to the head-carver\xe2\x80\x99s ear, and\r\nsaid to him in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cSomething serious has no doubt happened\r\nthis poor maiden, that she goes wandering from home in such a dress and\r\nat such an hour, and one of her rank too.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no doubt about\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the carver, \xe2\x80\x9cand moreover her tears confirm your\r\nsuspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d Sancho gave her the best comfort he could, and entreated\r\nher to tell them without any fear what had happened her, as they would\r\nall earnestly and by every means in their power endeavour to relieve\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my father has kept me shut up\r\nthese ten years, for so long is it since the earth received my mother.\r\nMass is said at home in a sumptuous chapel, and all this time I have\r\nseen but the sun in the heaven by day, and the moon and the stars by\r\nnight; nor do I know what streets are like, or plazas, or churches, or\r\neven men, except my father and a brother I have, and Pedro Perez the\r\nwool-farmer; whom, because he came frequently to our house, I took it\r\ninto my head to call my father, to avoid naming my own. This seclusion\r\nand the restrictions laid upon my going out, were it only to church,\r\nhave been keeping me unhappy for many a day and month past; I longed to\r\nsee the world, or at least the town where I was born, and it did not\r\nseem to me that this wish was inconsistent with the respect maidens of\r\ngood quality should have for themselves. When I heard them talking of\r\nbull-fights taking place, and of javelin games, and of acting plays, I\r\nasked my brother, who is a year younger than myself, to tell me what\r\nsort of things these were, and many more that I had never seen; he\r\nexplained them to me as well as he could, but the only effect was to\r\nkindle in me a still stronger desire to see them. At last, to cut short\r\nthe story of my ruin, I begged and entreated my brother\xe2\x80\x94O that I had\r\nnever made such an entreaty\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d And once more she gave way to a burst of\r\nweeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProceed, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said the majordomo, \xe2\x80\x9cand finish your story of what\r\nhas happened to you, for your words and tears are keeping us all in\r\nsuspense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have but little more to say, though many a tear to shed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ndamsel; \xe2\x80\x9cfor ill-placed desires can only be paid for in some such way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maiden\xe2\x80\x99s beauty had made a deep impression on the head-carver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart, and he again raised his lantern for another look at her, and\r\nthought they were not tears she was shedding, but seed-pearl or dew of\r\nthe meadow, nay, he exalted them still higher, and made Oriental pearls\r\nof them, and fervently hoped her misfortune might not be so great a one\r\nas her tears and sobs seemed to indicate. The governor was losing\r\npatience at the length of time the girl was taking to tell her story,\r\nand told her not to keep them waiting any longer; for it was late, and\r\nthere still remained a good deal of the town to be gone over.\r\n\r\nShe, with broken sobs and half-suppressed sighs, went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nmisfortune, my misadventure, is simply this, that I entreated my\r\nbrother to dress me up as a man in a suit of his clothes, and take me\r\nsome night, when our father was asleep, to see the whole town; he,\r\novercome by my entreaties, consented, and dressing me in this suit and\r\nhimself in clothes of mine that fitted him as if made for him (for he\r\nhas not a hair on his chin, and might pass for a very beautiful young\r\ngirl), to-night, about an hour ago, more or less, we left the house,\r\nand guided by our youthful and foolish impulse we made the circuit of\r\nthe whole town, and then, as we were about to return home, we saw a\r\ngreat troop of people coming, and my brother said to me, \xe2\x80\x98Sister, this\r\nmust be the round, stir your feet and put wings to them, and follow me\r\nas fast as you can, lest they recognise us, for that would be a bad\r\nbusiness for us;\xe2\x80\x99 and so saying he turned about and began, I cannot say\r\nto run but to fly; in less than six paces I fell from fright, and then\r\nthe officer of justice came up and carried me before your worships,\r\nwhere I find myself put to shame before all these people as whimsical\r\nand vicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cno other mishap has befallen you, nor\r\nwas it jealousy that made you leave home, as you said at the beginning\r\nof your story?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing has happened me,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cnor was it jealousy that brought\r\nme out, but merely a longing to see the world, which did not go beyond\r\nseeing the streets of this town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the tipstaffs with her brother in custody, whom one\r\nof them had overtaken as he ran away from his sister, now fully\r\nconfirmed the truth of what the damsel said. He had nothing on but a\r\nrich petticoat and a short blue damask cloak with fine gold lace, and\r\nhis head was uncovered and adorned only with its own hair, which looked\r\nlike rings of gold, so bright and curly was it. The governor, the\r\nmajordomo, and the carver went aside with him, and, unheard by his\r\nsister, asked him how he came to be in that dress, and he with no less\r\nshame and embarrassment told exactly the same story as his sister, to\r\nthe great delight of the enamoured carver; the governor, however, said\r\nto them, \xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, young lady and gentleman, this has been a very\r\nchildish affair, and to explain your folly and rashness there was no\r\nnecessity for all this delay and all these tears and sighs; for if you\r\nhad said we are so-and-so, and we escaped from our father\xe2\x80\x99s house in\r\nthis way in order to ramble about, out of mere curiosity and with no\r\nother object, there would have been an end of the matter, and none of\r\nthese little sobs and tears and all the rest of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the damsel, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you see the confusion I was in\r\nwas so great it did not let me behave as I ought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo harm has been done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9ccome, we will leave you at your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house; perhaps they will not have missed you; and another time\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t be so childish or eager to see the world; for a respectable\r\ndamsel should have a broken leg and keep at home; and the woman and the\r\nhen by gadding about are soon lost; and she who is eager to see is also\r\neager to be seen; I say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth thanked the governor for his kind offer to take them home,\r\nand they directed their steps towards the house, which was not far off.\r\nOn reaching it the youth threw a pebble up at a grating, and\r\nimmediately a woman-servant who was waiting for them came down and\r\nopened the door to them, and they went in, leaving the party marvelling\r\nas much at their grace and beauty as at the fancy they had for seeing\r\nthe world by night and without quitting the village; which, however,\r\nthey set down to their youth.\r\n\r\nThe head-carver was left with a heart pierced through and through, and\r\nhe made up his mind on the spot to demand the damsel in marriage of her\r\nfather on the morrow, making sure she would not be refused him as he\r\nwas a servant of the duke\xe2\x80\x99s; and even to Sancho ideas and schemes of\r\nmarrying the youth to his daughter Sanchica suggested themselves, and\r\nhe resolved to open the negotiation at the proper season, persuading\r\nhimself that no husband could be refused to a governor\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. And\r\nso the night\xe2\x80\x99s round came to an end, and a couple of days later the\r\ngovernment, whereby all his plans were overthrown and swept away, as\r\nwill be seen farther on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np49e.jpg (55K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\nWHEREIN IS SET FORTH WHO THE ENCHANTERS AND EXECUTIONERS WERE WHO\r\nFLOGGED THE DUENNA AND PINCHED DON QUIXOTE, AND ALSO WHAT BEFELL THE\r\nPAGE WHO CARRIED THE LETTER TO TERESA PANZA, SANCHO PANZA\xe2\x80\x99S WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np50a.jpg (104K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCide Hamete, the painstaking investigator of the minute points of this\r\nveracious history, says that when Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez left her own room to\r\ngo to Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s, another duenna who slept with her observed her,\r\nand as all duennas are fond of prying, listening, and sniffing, she\r\nfollowed her so silently that the good Rodriguez never perceived it;\r\nand as soon as the duenna saw her enter Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s room, not to fail\r\nin a duenna\xe2\x80\x99s invariable practice of tattling, she hurried off that\r\ninstant to report to the duchess how Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez was closeted with\r\nDon Quixote. The duchess told the duke, and asked him to let her and\r\nAltisidora go and see what the said duenna wanted with Don Quixote. The\r\nduke gave them leave, and the pair cautiously and quietly crept to the\r\ndoor of the room and posted themselves so close to it that they could\r\nhear all that was said inside. But when the duchess heard how the\r\nRodriguez had made public the Aranjuez of her issues she could not\r\nrestrain herself, nor Altisidora either; and so, filled with rage and\r\nthirsting for vengeance, they burst into the room and tormented Don\r\nQuixote and flogged the duenna in the manner already described; for\r\nindignities offered to their charms and self-esteem mightily provoke\r\nthe anger of women and make them eager for revenge. The duchess told\r\nthe duke what had happened, and he was much amused by it; and she, in\r\npursuance of her design of making merry and diverting herself with Don\r\nQuixote, despatched the page who had played the part of Dulcinea in the\r\nnegotiations for her disenchantment (which Sancho Panza in the cares of\r\ngovernment had forgotten all about) to Teresa Panza his wife with her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s letter and another from herself, and also a great string of\r\nfine coral beads as a present.\r\n\r\nNow the history says this page was very sharp and quick-witted; and\r\neager to serve his lord and lady he set off very willingly for Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvillage. Before he entered it he observed a number of women washing in\r\na brook, and asked them if they could tell him whether there lived\r\nthere a woman of the name of Teresa Panza, wife of one Sancho Panza,\r\nsquire to a knight called Don Quixote of La Mancha. At the question a\r\nyoung girl who was washing stood up and said, \xe2\x80\x9cTeresa Panza is my\r\nmother, and that Sancho is my father, and that knight is our master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page, \xe2\x80\x9ccome and show me where your mother\r\nis, for I bring her a letter and a present from your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will with all my heart, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, who seemed to be\r\nabout fourteen, more or less; and leaving the clothes she was washing\r\nto one of her companions, and without putting anything on her head or\r\nfeet, for she was bare-legged and had her hair hanging about her, away\r\nshe skipped in front of the page\xe2\x80\x99s horse, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, your worship,\r\nour house is at the entrance of the town, and my mother is there,\r\nsorrowful enough at not having had any news of my father this ever so\r\nlong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page, \xe2\x80\x9cI am bringing her such good news that she will\r\nhave reason to thank God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, skipping, running, and capering, the girl reached the town,\r\nbut before going into the house she called out at the door, \xe2\x80\x9cCome out,\r\nmother Teresa, come out, come out; here\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman with letters and\r\nother things from my good father.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words her mother Teresa\r\nPanza came out spinning a bundle of flax, in a grey petticoat (so short\r\nwas it one would have fancied \xe2\x80\x9cthey to her shame had cut it short\xe2\x80\x9d), a\r\ngrey bodice of the same stuff, and a smock. She was not very old,\r\nthough plainly past forty, strong, healthy, vigorous, and sun-dried;\r\nand seeing her daughter and the page on horseback, she exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this, child? What gentleman is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA servant of my lady, Do\xc3\xb1a Teresa Panza,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the page; and\r\nsuiting the action to the word he flung himself off his horse, and with\r\ngreat humility advanced to kneel before the lady Teresa, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nme kiss your hand, Se\xc3\xb1ora Do\xc3\xb1a Teresa, as the lawful and only wife of\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Don Sancho Panza, rightful governor of the island of Barataria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, se\xc3\xb1or, get up, do that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit of a\r\ncourt lady, but only a poor country woman, the daughter of a\r\nclodcrusher, and the wife of a squire-errant and not of any governor at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most worthy wife of a most arch-worthy\r\ngovernor; and as a proof of what I say accept this letter and this\r\npresent;\xe2\x80\x9d and at the same time he took out of his pocket a string of\r\ncoral beads with gold clasps, and placed it on her neck, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis letter is from his lordship the governor, and the other as well\r\nas these coral beads from my lady the duchess, who sends me to your\r\nworship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTeresa stood lost in astonishment, and her daughter just as much, and\r\nthe girl said, \xe2\x80\x9cMay I die but our master Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s at the bottom of\r\nthis; he must have given father the government or county he so often\r\npromised him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page; \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is through Se\xc3\xb1or Don\r\nQuixote that Se\xc3\xb1or Sancho is now governor of the island of Barataria,\r\nas will be seen by this letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill your worship read it to me, noble sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa; \xe2\x80\x9cfor though\r\nI can spin I can\xe2\x80\x99t read, not a scrap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I either,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sanchica; \xe2\x80\x9cbut wait a bit, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and fetch\r\nsomeone who can read it, either the curate himself or the bachelor\r\nSamson Carrasco, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll come gladly to hear any news of my\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to fetch anybody,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page; \xe2\x80\x9cfor though I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspin I can read, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll read it;\xe2\x80\x9d and so he read it through, but as\r\nit has been already given it is not inserted here; and then he took out\r\nthe other one from the duchess, which ran as follows:\r\n\r\nFriend Teresa,\xe2\x80\x94Your husband Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s good qualities, of heart as well\r\nas of head, induced and compelled me to request my husband the duke to\r\ngive him the government of one of his many islands. I am told he\r\ngoverns like a gerfalcon, of which I am very glad, and my lord the\r\nduke, of course, also; and I am very thankful to heaven that I have not\r\nmade a mistake in choosing him for that same government; for I would\r\nhave Se\xc3\xb1ora Teresa know that a good governor is hard to find in this\r\nworld and may God make me as good as Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s way of governing.\r\nHerewith I send you, my dear, a string of coral beads with gold clasps;\r\nI wish they were Oriental pearls; but \xe2\x80\x9che who gives thee a bone does\r\nnot wish to see thee dead;\xe2\x80\x9d a time will come when we shall become\r\nacquainted and meet one another, but God knows the future. Commend me\r\nto your daughter Sanchica, and tell her from me to hold herself in\r\nreadiness, for I mean to make a high match for her when she least\r\nexpects it. They tell me there are big acorns in your village; send me\r\na couple of dozen or so, and I shall value them greatly as coming from\r\nyour hand; and write to me at length to assure me of your health and\r\nwell-being; and if there be anything you stand in need of, it is but to\r\nopen your mouth, and that shall be the measure; and so God keep you.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this place.\r\nYour loving friend,\r\nTHE DUCHESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, what a good, plain, lowly lady!\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa when she heard the\r\nletter; \xe2\x80\x9cthat I may be buried with ladies of that sort, and not the\r\ngentlewomen we have in this town, that fancy because they are\r\ngentlewomen the wind must not touch them, and go to church with as much\r\nairs as if they were queens, no less, and seem to think they are\r\ndisgraced if they look at a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife! And see here how this good\r\nlady, for all she\xe2\x80\x99s a duchess, calls me \xe2\x80\x98friend,\xe2\x80\x99 and treats me as if I\r\nwas her equal\xe2\x80\x94and equal may I see her with the tallest church-tower in\r\nLa Mancha! And as for the acorns, se\xc3\xb1or, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send her ladyship a peck\r\nand such big ones that one might come to see them as a show and a\r\nwonder. And now, Sanchica, see that the gentleman is comfortable; put\r\nup his horse, and get some eggs out of the stable, and cut plenty of\r\nbacon, and let\xe2\x80\x99s give him his dinner like a prince; for the good news\r\nhe has brought, and his own bonny face deserve it all; and meanwhile\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll run out and give the neighbours the news of our good luck, and\r\nfather curate, and Master Nicholas the barber, who are and always have\r\nbeen such friends of thy father\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sanchica; \xe2\x80\x9cbut mind, you must give me half\r\nof that string; for I don\xe2\x80\x99t think my lady the duchess could have been\r\nso stupid as to send it all to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all for thee, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa; \xe2\x80\x9cbut let me wear it round\r\nmy neck for a few days; for verily it seems to make my heart glad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be glad too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you see the bundle there\r\nis in this portmanteau, for it is a suit of the finest cloth, that the\r\ngovernor only wore one day out hunting and now sends, all for Se\xc3\xb1ora\r\nSanchica.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay he live a thousand years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sanchica, \xe2\x80\x9cand the bearer as many,\r\nnay two thousand, if needful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this Teresa hurried out of the house with the letters, and with\r\nthe string of beads round her neck, and went along thrumming the\r\nletters as if they were a tambourine, and by chance coming across the\r\ncurate and Samson Carrasco she began capering and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNone of us\r\npoor now, faith! We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a little government! Ay, let the finest fine\r\nlady tackle me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give her a setting down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s all this, Teresa Panza,\xe2\x80\x9d said they; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat madness is this, and\r\nwhat papers are those?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe madness is only this,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthat these are the letters of\r\nduchesses and governors, and these I have on my neck are fine coral\r\nbeads, with ave-marias and paternosters of beaten gold, and I am a\r\ngoverness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod help us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, Teresa, or\r\nknow what you are talking about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you may see it yourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa, and she handed them\r\nthe letters.\r\n\r\nThe curate read them out for Samson Carrasco to hear, and Samson and he\r\nregarded one another with looks of astonishment at what they had read,\r\nand the bachelor asked who had brought the letters. Teresa in reply\r\nbade them come with her to her house and they would see the messenger,\r\na most elegant youth, who had brought another present which was worth\r\nas much more. The curate took the coral beads from her neck and\r\nexamined them again and again, and having satisfied himself as to their\r\nfineness he fell to wondering afresh, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBy the gown I wear I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say or think of these letters and presents; on the\r\none hand I can see and feel the fineness of these coral beads, and on\r\nthe other I read how a duchess sends to beg for a couple of dozen of\r\nacorns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSquare that if you can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carrasco; \xe2\x80\x9cwell, let\xe2\x80\x99s go and see the\r\nmessenger, and from him we\xe2\x80\x99ll learn something about this mystery that\r\nhas turned up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did so, and Teresa returned with them. They found the page sifting\r\na little barley for his horse, and Sanchica cutting a rasher of bacon\r\nto be paved with eggs for his dinner. His looks and his handsome\r\napparel pleased them both greatly; and after they had saluted him\r\ncourteously, and he them, Samson begged him to give them his news, as\r\nwell of Don Quixote as of Sancho Panza, for, he said, though they had\r\nread the letters from Sancho and her ladyship the duchess, they were\r\nstill puzzled and could not make out what was meant by Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngovernment, and above all of an island, when all or most of those in\r\nthe Mediterranean belonged to his Majesty.\r\n\r\nTo this the page replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAs to Se\xc3\xb1or Sancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s being a governor\r\nthere is no doubt whatever; but whether it is an island or not that he\r\ngoverns, with that I have nothing to do; suffice it that it is a town\r\nof more than a thousand inhabitants; with regard to the acorns I may\r\ntell you my lady the duchess is so unpretending and unassuming that,\r\nnot to speak of sending to beg for acorns from a peasant woman, she has\r\nbeen known to send to ask for the loan of a comb from one of her\r\nneighbours; for I would have your worships know that the ladies of\r\nAragon, though they are just as illustrious, are not so punctilious and\r\nhaughty as the Castilian ladies; they treat people with greater\r\nfamiliarity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this conversation Sanchica came in with her skirt full\r\nof eggs, and said she to the page, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, se\xc3\xb1or, does my father wear\r\ntrunk-hose since he has been governor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not noticed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page; \xe2\x80\x9cbut no doubt he wears them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sanchica, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a sight it must be to see my father\r\nin tights! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it odd that ever since I was born I have had a longing\r\nto see my father in trunk-hose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs things go you will see that if you live,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page; \xe2\x80\x9cby God he\r\nis in the way to take the road with a sunshade if the government only\r\nlasts him two months more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe curate and the bachelor could see plainly enough that the page\r\nspoke in a waggish vein; but the fineness of the coral beads, and the\r\nhunting suit that Sancho sent (for Teresa had already shown it to them)\r\ndid away with the impression; and they could not help laughing at\r\nSanchica\xe2\x80\x99s wish, and still more when Teresa said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or curate, look\r\nabout if there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody here going to Madrid or Toledo, to buy me a\r\nhooped petticoat, a proper fashionable one of the best quality; for\r\nindeed and indeed I must do honour to my husband\xe2\x80\x99s government as well\r\nas I can; nay, if I am put to it and have to, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Court and set\r\na coach like all the world; for she who has a governor for her husband\r\nmay very well have one and keep one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not, mother!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sanchica; \xe2\x80\x9cwould to God it were to-day\r\ninstead of to-morrow, even though they were to say when they saw me\r\nseated in the coach with my mother, \xe2\x80\x98See that rubbish, that\r\ngarlic-stuffed fellow\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, how she goes stretched at her ease in\r\na coach as if she was a she-pope!\xe2\x80\x99 But let them tramp through the mud,\r\nand let me go in my coach with my feet off the ground. Bad luck to\r\nbackbiters all over the world; \xe2\x80\x98let me go warm and the people may\r\nlaugh.\xe2\x80\x99 Do I say right, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure you do, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa; \xe2\x80\x9cand all this good luck,\r\nand even more, my good Sancho foretold me; and thou wilt see, my\r\ndaughter, he won\xe2\x80\x99t stop till he has made me a countess; for to make a\r\nbeginning is everything in luck; and as I have heard thy good father\r\nsay many a time (for besides being thy father he\xe2\x80\x99s the father of\r\nproverbs too), \xe2\x80\x98When they offer thee a heifer, run with a halter; when\r\nthey offer thee a government, take it; when they would give thee a\r\ncounty, seize it; when they say, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, here!\xe2\x80\x9d to thee with something\r\ngood, swallow it.\xe2\x80\x99 Oh no! go to sleep, and don\xe2\x80\x99t answer the strokes of\r\ngood fortune and the lucky chances that are knocking at the door of\r\nyour house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do I care,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sanchica, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether anybody says when he\r\nsees me holding my head up, \xe2\x80\x98The dog saw himself in hempen breeches,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand the rest of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing this the curate said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do believe that all this family of the\r\nPanzas are born with a sackful of proverbs in their insides, every one\r\nof them; I never saw one of them that does not pour them out at all\r\ntimes and on all occasions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page, \xe2\x80\x9cfor Se\xc3\xb1or Governor Sancho utters them\r\nat every turn; and though a great many of them are not to the purpose,\r\nstill they amuse one, and my lady the duchess and the duke praise them\r\nhighly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you still maintain that all this about Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s government is\r\ntrue, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bachelor, \xe2\x80\x9cand that there actually is a duchess\r\nwho sends him presents and writes to him? Because we, although we have\r\nhandled the present and read the letters, don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it and suspect\r\nit to be something in the line of our fellow-townsman Don Quixote, who\r\nfancies that everything is done by enchantment; and for this reason I\r\nam almost ready to say that I\xe2\x80\x99d like to touch and feel your worship to\r\nsee whether you are a mere ambassador of the imagination or a man of\r\nflesh and blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I know, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the page, \xe2\x80\x9cis that I am a real ambassador,\r\nand that Se\xc3\xb1or Sancho Panza is governor as a matter of fact, and that\r\nmy lord and lady the duke and duchess can give, and have given him this\r\nsame government, and that I have heard it said Sancho Panza bears\r\nhimself very stoutly therein; whether there be any enchantment in all\r\nthis or not, it is for your worships to settle between you; for that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall I know by the oath I swear, and that is by the life of my parents\r\nwhom I have still alive, and love dearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bachelor; \xe2\x80\x9cbut _dubitat Augustinus_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubt who will,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I have told you is the truth,\r\nand that will always rise above falsehood as oil above water; if not\r\n_operibus credite, et non verbis_. Let one of you come with me, and he\r\nwill see with his eyes what he does not believe with his ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for me to make that trip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sanchica; \xe2\x80\x9ctake me with you,\r\nse\xc3\xb1or, behind you on your horse; for I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with all my heart to see\r\nmy father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGovernors\xe2\x80\x99 daughters,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page, \xe2\x80\x9cmust not travel along the roads\r\nalone, but accompanied by coaches and litters and a great number of\r\nattendants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sanchica, \xe2\x80\x9cI can go just as well mounted on a she-ass as\r\nin a coach; what a dainty lass you must take me for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa; \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about;\r\nthe gentleman is quite right, for \xe2\x80\x98as the time so the behaviour;\xe2\x80\x99 when\r\nit was Sancho it was \xe2\x80\x98Sancha;\xe2\x80\x99 when it is governor it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98se\xc3\xb1ora;\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99m right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1ora Teresa says more than she is aware of,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page; \xe2\x80\x9cand now\r\ngive me something to eat and let me go at once, for I mean to return\r\nthis evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and do penance with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate at this; \xe2\x80\x9cfor Se\xc3\xb1ora\r\nTeresa has more will than means to serve so worthy a guest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe page refused, but had to consent at last for his own sake; and the\r\ncurate took him home with him very gladly, in order to have an\r\nopportunity of questioning him at leisure about Don Quixote and his\r\ndoings. The bachelor offered to write the letters in reply for Teresa;\r\nbut she did not care to let him mix himself up in her affairs, for she\r\nthought him somewhat given to joking; and so she gave a cake and a\r\ncouple of eggs to a young acolyte who was a penman, and he wrote for\r\nher two letters, one for her husband and the other for the duchess,\r\ndictated out of her own head, which are not the worst inserted in this\r\ngreat history, as will be seen farther on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np50e.jpg (19K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\nOF THE PROGRESS OF SANCHO\xe2\x80\x99S GOVERNMENT, AND OTHER SUCH ENTERTAINING\r\nMATTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np51a.jpg (188K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDay came after the night of the governor\xe2\x80\x99s round; a night which the\r\nhead-carver passed without sleeping, so were his thoughts of the face\r\nand air and beauty of the disguised damsel, while the majordomo spent\r\nwhat was left of it in writing an account to his lord and lady of all\r\nSancho said and did, being as much amazed at his sayings as at his\r\ndoings, for there was a mixture of shrewdness and simplicity in all his\r\nwords and deeds. The se\xc3\xb1or governor got up, and by Doctor Pedro Recio\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndirections they made him break his fast on a little conserve and four\r\nsups of cold water, which Sancho would have readily exchanged for a\r\npiece of bread and a bunch of grapes; but seeing there was no help for\r\nit, he submitted with no little sorrow of heart and discomfort of\r\nstomach; Pedro Recio having persuaded him that light and delicate diet\r\nenlivened the wits, and that was what was most essential for persons\r\nplaced in command and in responsible situations, where they have to\r\nemploy not only the bodily powers but those of the mind also.\r\n\r\nBy means of this sophistry Sancho was made to endure hunger, and hunger\r\nso keen that in his heart he cursed the government, and even him who\r\nhad given it to him; however, with his hunger and his conserve he\r\nundertook to deliver judgments that day, and the first thing that came\r\nbefore him was a question that was submitted to him by a stranger, in\r\nthe presence of the majordomo and the other attendants, and it was in\r\nthese words: \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, a large river separated two districts of one and\r\nthe same lordship\xe2\x80\x94will your worship please to pay attention, for the\r\ncase is an important and a rather knotty one? Well then, on this river\r\nthere was a bridge, and at one end of it a gallows, and a sort of\r\ntribunal, where four judges commonly sat to administer the law which\r\nthe lord of river, bridge and the lordship had enacted, and which was\r\nto this effect, \xe2\x80\x98If anyone crosses by this bridge from one side to the\r\nother he shall declare on oath where he is going to and with what\r\nobject; and if he swears truly, he shall be allowed to pass, but if\r\nfalsely, he shall be put to death for it by hanging on the gallows\r\nerected there, without any remission.\xe2\x80\x99 Though the law and its severe\r\npenalty were known, many persons crossed, but in their declarations it\r\nwas easy to see at once they were telling the truth, and the judges let\r\nthem pass free. It happened, however, that one man, when they came to\r\ntake his declaration, swore and said that by the oath he took he was\r\ngoing to die upon that gallows that stood there, and nothing else. The\r\njudges held a consultation over the oath, and they said, \xe2\x80\x98If we let\r\nthis man pass free he has sworn falsely, and by the law he ought to\r\ndie; but if we hang him, as he swore he was going to die on that\r\ngallows, and therefore swore the truth, by the same law he ought to go\r\nfree.\xe2\x80\x99 It is asked of your worship, se\xc3\xb1or governor, what are the judges\r\nto do with this man? For they are still in doubt and perplexity; and\r\nhaving heard of your worship\xe2\x80\x99s acute and exalted intellect, they have\r\nsent me to entreat your worship on their behalf to give your opinion on\r\nthis very intricate and puzzling case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Sancho made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed those gentlemen the judges that\r\nsend you to me might have spared themselves the trouble, for I have\r\nmore of the obtuse than the acute in me; but repeat the case over\r\nagain, so that I may understand it, and then perhaps I may be able to\r\nhit the point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe querist repeated again and again what he had said before, and then\r\nSancho said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me I can set the matter right in a moment,\r\nand in this way; the man swears that he is going to die upon the\r\ngallows; but if he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the law\r\nenacted deserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhang him, then he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be\r\nhanged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as the se\xc3\xb1or governor says,\xe2\x80\x9d said the messenger; \xe2\x80\x9cand as regards\r\na complete comprehension of the case, there is nothing left to desire\r\nor hesitate about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then I say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat of this man they should let pass\r\nthe part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has lied; and in\r\nthis way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, se\xc3\xb1or governor,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the querist, \xe2\x80\x9cthe man will have to\r\nbe divided into two parts; and if he is divided of course he will die;\r\nand so none of the requirements of the law will be carried out, and it\r\nis absolutely necessary to comply with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, my good sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9ceither I\xe2\x80\x99m a numskull or else\r\nthere is the same reason for this passenger dying as for his living and\r\npassing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him the falsehood\r\nequally condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion you\r\nshould say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments\r\nfor condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they\r\nshould let him pass freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do\r\ngood than to do evil; this I would give signed with my name if I knew\r\nhow to sign; and what I have said in this case is not out of my own\r\nhead, but one of the many precepts my master Don Quixote gave me the\r\nnight before I left to become governor of this island, that came into\r\nmy mind, and it was this, that when there was any doubt about the\r\njustice of a case I should lean to mercy; and it is God\xe2\x80\x99s will that I\r\nshould recollect it now, for it fits this case as if it was made for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the majordomo; \xe2\x80\x9cand I maintain that Lycurgus\r\nhimself, who gave laws to the Lacedemonians, could not have pronounced\r\na better decision than the great Panza has given; let the morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naudience close with this, and I will see that the se\xc3\xb1or governor has\r\ndinner entirely to his liking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all I ask for\xe2\x80\x94fair play,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cgive me my dinner, and\r\nthen let it rain cases and questions on me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll despatch them in a\r\ntwinkling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe majordomo kept his word, for he felt it against his conscience to\r\nkill so wise a governor by hunger; particularly as he intended to have\r\ndone with him that same night, playing off the last joke he was\r\ncommissioned to practise upon him.\r\n\r\nIt came to pass, then, that after he had dined that day, in opposition\r\nto the rules and aphorisms of Doctor Tirteafuera, as they were taking\r\naway the cloth there came a courier with a letter from Don Quixote for\r\nthe governor. Sancho ordered the secretary to read it to himself, and\r\nif there was nothing in it that demanded secrecy to read it aloud. The\r\nsecretary did so, and after he had skimmed the contents he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nmay well be read aloud, for what Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote writes to your\r\nworship deserves to be printed or written in letters of gold, and it is\r\nas follows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA\xe2\x80\x99S LETTER TO SANCHO PANZA, GOVERNOR OF THE\r\nISLAND OF BARATARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was expecting to hear of thy stupidities and blunders, friend\r\nSancho, I have received intelligence of thy displays of good sense, for\r\nwhich I give special thanks to heaven that can raise the poor from the\r\ndunghill and of fools to make wise men. They tell me thou dost govern\r\nas if thou wert a man, and art a man as if thou wert a beast, so great\r\nis the humility wherewith thou dost comport thyself. But I would have\r\nthee bear in mind, Sancho, that very often it is fitting and necessary\r\nfor the authority of office to resist the humility of the heart; for\r\nthe seemly array of one who is invested with grave duties should be\r\nsuch as they require and not measured by what his own humble tastes may\r\nlead him to prefer. Dress well; a stick dressed up does not look like a\r\nstick; I do not say thou shouldst wear trinkets or fine raiment, or\r\nthat being a judge thou shouldst dress like a soldier, but that thou\r\nshouldst array thyself in the apparel thy office requires, and that at\r\nthe same time it be neat and handsome. To win the good-will of the\r\npeople thou governest there are two things, among others, that thou\r\nmust do; one is to be civil to all (this, however, I told thee before),\r\nand the other to take care that food be abundant, for there is nothing\r\nthat vexes the heart of the poor more than hunger and high prices. Make\r\nnot many proclamations; but those thou makest take care that they be\r\ngood ones, and above all that they be observed and carried out; for\r\nproclamations that are not observed are the same as if they did not\r\nexist; nay, they encourage the idea that the prince who had the wisdom\r\nand authority to make them had not the power to enforce them; and laws\r\nthat threaten and are not enforced come to be like the log, the king of\r\nthe frogs, that frightened them at first, but that in time they\r\ndespised and mounted upon. Be a father to virtue and a stepfather to\r\nvice. Be not always strict, nor yet always lenient, but observe a mean\r\nbetween these two extremes, for in that is the aim of wisdom. Visit the\r\ngaols, the slaughter-houses, and the market-places; for the presence of\r\nthe governor is of great importance in such places; it comforts the\r\nprisoners who are in hopes of a speedy release, it is the bugbear of\r\nthe butchers who have then to give just weight, and it is the terror of\r\nthe market-women for the same reason. Let it not be seen that thou art\r\n(even if perchance thou art, which I do not believe) covetous, a\r\nfollower of women, or a glutton; for when the people and those that\r\nhave dealings with thee become aware of thy special weakness they will\r\nbring their batteries to bear upon thee in that quarter, till they have\r\nbrought thee down to the depths of perdition. Consider and reconsider,\r\ncon and con over again the advices and the instructions I gave thee\r\nbefore thy departure hence to thy government, and thou wilt see that in\r\nthem, if thou dost follow them, thou hast a help at hand that will\r\nlighten for thee the troubles and difficulties that beset governors at\r\nevery step. Write to thy lord and lady and show thyself grateful to\r\nthem, for ingratitude is the daughter of pride, and one of the greatest\r\nsins we know of; and he who is grateful to those who have been good to\r\nhim shows that he will be so to God also who has bestowed and still\r\nbestows so many blessings upon him.\r\n    My lady the duchess sent off a messenger with thy suit and another\r\n    present to thy wife Teresa Panza; we expect the answer every\r\n    moment. I have been a little indisposed through a certain\r\n    scratching I came in for, not very much to the benefit of my nose;\r\n    but it was nothing; for if there are enchanters who maltreat me,\r\n    there are also some who defend me. Let me know if the majordomo who\r\n    is with thee had any share in the Trifaldi performance, as thou\r\n    didst suspect; and keep me informed of everything that happens\r\n    thee, as the distance is so short; all the more as I am thinking of\r\n    giving over very shortly this idle life I am now leading, for I was\r\n    not born for it. A thing has occurred to me which I am inclined to\r\n    think will put me out of favour with the duke and duchess; but\r\n    though I am sorry for it I do not care, for after all I must obey\r\n    my calling rather than their pleasure, in accordance with the\r\n    common saying, _amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas_. I quote\r\n    this Latin to thee because I conclude that since thou hast been a\r\n    governor thou wilt have learned it. Adieu; God keep thee from being\r\n    an object of pity to anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nThy friend,\r\nDON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSancho listened to the letter with great attention, and it was praised\r\nand considered wise by all who heard it; he then rose up from table,\r\nand calling his secretary shut himself in with him in his own room, and\r\nwithout putting it off any longer set about answering his master Don\r\nQuixote at once; and he bade the secretary write down what he told him\r\nwithout adding or suppressing anything, which he did, and the answer\r\nwas to the following effect.\r\n\r\nSANCHO PANZA\xe2\x80\x99S LETTER TO DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pressure of business is so great upon me that I have no time to\r\nscratch my head or even to cut my nails; and I have them so long\xe2\x80\x94God\r\nsend a remedy for it. I say this, master of my soul, that you may not\r\nbe surprised if I have not until now sent you word of how I fare, well\r\nor ill, in this government, in which I am suffering more hunger than\r\nwhen we two were wandering through the woods and wastes.\r\n    My lord the duke wrote to me the other day to warn me that certain\r\n    spies had got into this island to kill me; but up to the present I\r\n    have not found out any except a certain doctor who receives a\r\n    salary in this town for killing all the governors that come here;\r\n    he is called Doctor Pedro Recio, and is from Tirteafuera; so you\r\n    see what a name he has to make me dread dying under his hands. This\r\n    doctor says of himself that he does not cure diseases when there\r\n    are any, but prevents them coming, and the medicines he uses are\r\n    diet and more diet until he brings one down to bare bones; as if\r\n    leanness was not worse than fever.\r\n    In short he is killing me with hunger, and I am dying myself of\r\n    vexation; for when I thought I was coming to this government to get\r\n    my meat hot and my drink cool, and take my ease between holland\r\n    sheets on feather beds, I find I have come to do penance as if I\r\n    was a hermit; and as I don\xe2\x80\x99t do it willingly I suspect that in the\r\n    end the devil will carry me off.\r\n    So far I have not handled any dues or taken any bribes, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n    know what to think of it; for here they tell me that the governors\r\n    that come to this island, before entering it have plenty of money\r\n    either given to them or lent to them by the people of the town, and\r\n    that this is the usual custom not only here but with all who enter\r\n    upon governments.\r\n    Last night going the rounds I came upon a fair damsel in man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n    clothes, and a brother of hers dressed as a woman; my head-carver\r\n    has fallen in love with the girl, and has in his own mind chosen\r\n    her for a wife, so he says, and I have chosen the youth for a\r\n    son-in-law; to-day we are going to explain our intentions to the\r\n    father of the pair, who is one Diego de la Llana, a gentleman and\r\n    an old Christian as much as you please.\r\n    I have visited the market-places, as your worship advises me, and\r\n    yesterday I found a stall-keeper selling new hazel nuts and proved\r\n    her to have mixed a bushel of old empty rotten nuts with a bushel\r\n    of new; I confiscated the whole for the children of the\r\n    charity-school, who will know how to distinguish them well enough,\r\n    and I sentenced her not to come into the market-place for a\r\n    fortnight; they told me I did bravely. I can tell your worship it\r\n    is commonly said in this town that there are no people worse than\r\n    the market-women, for they are all barefaced, unconscionable, and\r\n    impudent, and I can well believe it from what I have seen of them\r\n    in other towns.\r\n    I am very glad my lady the duchess has written to my wife Teresa\r\n    Panza and sent her the present your worship speaks of; and I will\r\n    strive to show myself grateful when the time comes; kiss her hands\r\n    for me, and tell her I say she has not thrown it into a sack with a\r\n    hole in it, as she will see in the end. I should not like your\r\n    worship to have any difference with my lord and lady; for if you\r\n    fall out with them it is plain it must do me harm; and as you give\r\n    me advice to be grateful it will not do for your worship not to be\r\n    so yourself to those who have shown you such kindness, and by whom\r\n    you have been treated so hospitably in their castle.\r\n    That about the scratching I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand; but I suppose it must\r\n    be one of the ill-turns the wicked enchanters are always doing your\r\n    worship; when we meet I shall know all about it. I wish I could\r\n    send your worship something; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to send, unless\r\n    it be some very curious clyster pipes, to work with bladders, that\r\n    they make in this island; but if the office remains with me I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\n    find out something to send, one way or another. If my wife Teresa\r\n    Panza writes to me, pay the postage and send me the letter, for I\r\n    have a very great desire to hear how my house and wife and children\r\n    are going on. And so, may God deliver your worship from evil-minded\r\n    enchanters, and bring me well and peacefully out of this\r\n    government, which I doubt, for I expect to take leave of it and my\r\n    life together, from the way Doctor Pedro Recio treats me.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour worship\xe2\x80\x99s servant\r\nSANCHO PANZA THE GOVERNOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe secretary sealed the letter, and immediately dismissed the courier;\r\nand those who were carrying on the joke against Sancho putting their\r\nheads together arranged how he was to be dismissed from the government.\r\nSancho spent the afternoon in drawing up certain ordinances relating to\r\nthe good government of what he fancied the island; and he ordained that\r\nthere were to be no provision hucksters in the State, and that men\r\nmight import wine into it from any place they pleased, provided they\r\ndeclared the quarter it came from, so that a price might be put upon it\r\naccording to its quality, reputation, and the estimation it was held\r\nin; and he that watered his wine, or changed the name, was to forfeit\r\nhis life for it. He reduced the prices of all manner of shoes, boots,\r\nand stockings, but of shoes in particular, as they seemed to him to run\r\nextravagantly high. He established a fixed rate for servants\xe2\x80\x99 wages,\r\nwhich were becoming recklessly exorbitant. He laid extremely heavy\r\npenalties upon those who sang lewd or loose songs either by day or\r\nnight. He decreed that no blind man should sing of any miracle in\r\nverse, unless he could produce authentic evidence that it was true, for\r\nit was his opinion that most of those the blind men sing are trumped\r\nup, to the detriment of the true ones. He established and created an\r\nalguacil of the poor, not to harass them, but to examine them and see\r\nwhether they really were so; for many a sturdy thief or drunkard goes\r\nabout under cover of a make-believe crippled limb or a sham sore. In a\r\nword, he made so many good rules that to this day they are preserved\r\nthere, and are called _The constitutions of the great governor Sancho\r\nPanza_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np51e.jpg (32K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND DISTRESSED OR AFFLICTED\r\nDUENNA, OTHERWISE CALLED DO\xc3\x91A RODRIGUEZ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np52a.jpg (131K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCide Hamete relates that Don Quixote being now cured of his scratches\r\nfelt that the life he was leading in the castle was entirely\r\ninconsistent with the order of chivalry he professed, so he determined\r\nto ask the duke and duchess to permit him to take his departure for\r\nSaragossa, as the time of the festival was now drawing near, and he\r\nhoped to win there the suit of armour which is the prize at festivals\r\nof the sort. But one day at table with the duke and duchess, just as he\r\nwas about to carry his resolution into effect and ask for their\r\npermission, lo and behold suddenly there came in through the door of\r\nthe great hall two women, as they afterwards proved to be, draped in\r\nmourning from head to foot, one of whom approaching Don Quixote flung\r\nherself at full length at his feet, pressing her lips to them, and\r\nuttering moans so sad, so deep, and so doleful that she put all who\r\nheard and saw her into a state of perplexity; and though the duke and\r\nduchess supposed it must be some joke their servants were playing off\r\nupon Don Quixote, still the earnest way the woman sighed and moaned and\r\nwept puzzled them and made them feel uncertain, until Don Quixote,\r\ntouched with compassion, raised her up and made her unveil herself and\r\nremove the mantle from her tearful face. She complied and disclosed\r\nwhat no one could have ever anticipated, for she disclosed the\r\ncountenance of Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez, the duenna of the house; the other\r\nfemale in mourning being her daughter, who had been made a fool of by\r\nthe rich farmer\xe2\x80\x99s son. All who knew her were filled with astonishment,\r\nand the duke and duchess more than any; for though they thought her a\r\nsimpleton and a weak creature, they did not think her capable of crazy\r\npranks. Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez, at length, turning to her master and mistress\r\nsaid to them, \xe2\x80\x9cWill your excellences be pleased to permit me to speak\r\nto this gentleman for a moment, for it is requisite I should do so in\r\norder to get successfully out of the business in which the boldness of\r\nan evil-minded clown has involved me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke said that for his part he gave her leave, and that she might\r\nspeak with Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote as much as she liked.\r\n\r\nShe then, turning to Don Quixote and addressing herself to him said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome days since, valiant knight, I gave you an account of the\r\ninjustice and treachery of a wicked farmer to my dearly beloved\r\ndaughter, the unhappy damsel here before you, and you promised me to\r\ntake her part and right the wrong that has been done her; but now it\r\nhas come to my hearing that you are about to depart from this castle in\r\nquest of such fair adventures as God may vouchsafe to you; therefore,\r\nbefore you take the road, I would that you challenge this froward\r\nrustic, and compel him to marry my daughter in fulfillment of the\r\npromise he gave her to become her husband before he seduced her; for to\r\nexpect that my lord the duke will do me justice is to ask pears from\r\nthe elm tree, for the reason I stated privately to your worship; and so\r\nmay our Lord grant you good health and forsake us not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo these words Don Quixote replied very gravely and solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cWorthy\r\nduenna, check your tears, or rather dry them, and spare your sighs, for\r\nI take it upon myself to obtain redress for your daughter, for whom it\r\nwould have been better not to have been so ready to believe lovers\xe2\x80\x99\r\npromises, which are for the most part quickly made and very slowly\r\nperformed; and so, with my lord the duke\xe2\x80\x99s leave, I will at once go in\r\nquest of this inhuman youth, and will find him out and challenge him\r\nand slay him, if so be he refuses to keep his promised word; for the\r\nchief object of my profession is to spare the humble and chastise the\r\nproud; I mean, to help the distressed and destroy the oppressors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no necessity,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cfor your worship to take the\r\ntrouble of seeking out the rustic of whom this worthy duenna complains,\r\nnor is there any necessity, either, for asking my leave to challenge\r\nhim; for I admit him duly challenged, and will take care that he is\r\ninformed of the challenge, and accepts it, and comes to answer it in\r\nperson to this castle of mine, where I shall afford to both a fair\r\nfield, observing all the conditions which are usually and properly\r\nobserved in such trials, and observing too justice to both sides, as\r\nall princes who offer a free field to combatants within the limits of\r\ntheir lordships are bound to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen with that assurance and your highness\xe2\x80\x99s good leave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI hereby for this once waive my privilege of gentle blood,\r\nand come down and put myself on a level with the lowly birth of the\r\nwrong-doer, making myself equal with him and enabling him to enter into\r\ncombat with me; and so, I challenge and defy him, though absent, on the\r\nplea of his malfeasance in breaking faith with this poor damsel, who\r\nwas a maiden and now by his misdeed is none; and say that he shall\r\nfulfill the promise he gave her to become her lawful husband, or else\r\nstake his life upon the question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then plucking off a glove he threw it down in the middle of the\r\nhall, and the duke picked it up, saying, as he had said before, that he\r\naccepted the challenge in the name of his vassal, and fixed six days\r\nthence as the time, the courtyard of the castle as the place, and for\r\narms the customary ones of knights, lance and shield and full armour,\r\nwith all the other accessories, without trickery, guile, or charms of\r\nany sort, and examined and passed by the judges of the field. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nfirst of all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is requisite that this worthy duenna and\r\nunworthy damsel should place their claim for justice in the hands of\r\nDon Quixote; for otherwise nothing can be done, nor can the said\r\nchallenge be brought to a lawful issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do so place it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the duenna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I too,\xe2\x80\x9d added her daughter, all in tears and covered with shame\r\nand confusion.\r\n\r\nThis declaration having been made, and the duke having settled in his\r\nown mind what he would do in the matter, the ladies in black withdrew,\r\nand the duchess gave orders that for the future they were not to be\r\ntreated as servants of hers, but as lady adventurers who came to her\r\nhouse to demand justice; so they gave them a room to themselves and\r\nwaited on them as they would on strangers, to the consternation of the\r\nother women-servants, who did not know where the folly and imprudence\r\nof Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez and her unlucky daughter would stop.\r\n\r\nAnd now, to complete the enjoyment of the feast and bring the dinner to\r\na satisfactory end, lo and behold the page who had carried the letters\r\nand presents to Teresa Panza, the wife of the governor Sancho, entered\r\nthe hall; and the duke and duchess were very well pleased to see him,\r\nbeing anxious to know the result of his journey; but when they asked\r\nhim the page said in reply that he could not give it before so many\r\npeople or in a few words, and begged their excellences to be pleased to\r\nlet it wait for a private opportunity, and in the meantime amuse\r\nthemselves with these letters; and taking out the letters he placed\r\nthem in the duchess\xe2\x80\x99s hand. One bore by way of address, _Letter for my\r\nlady the Duchess So-and-so, of I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where; and the other To my\r\nhusband Sancho Panza, governor of the island of Barataria, whom God\r\nprosper longer than me_. The duchess\xe2\x80\x99s bread would not bake, as the\r\nsaying is, until she had read her letter; and having looked over it\r\nherself and seen that it might be read aloud for the duke and all\r\npresent to hear, she read out as follows.\r\n\r\nTERESA PANZA\xe2\x80\x99S LETTER TO THE DUCHESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter your highness wrote me, my lady, gave me great pleasure, for\r\nindeed I found it very welcome. The string of coral beads is very fine,\r\nand my husband\xe2\x80\x99s hunting suit does not fall short of it. All this\r\nvillage is very much pleased that your ladyship has made a governor of\r\nmy good man Sancho; though nobody will believe it, particularly the\r\ncurate, and Master Nicholas the barber, and the bachelor Samson\r\nCarrasco; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for that, for so long as it is true, as it\r\nis, they may all say what they like; though, to tell the truth, if the\r\ncoral beads and the suit had not come I would not have believed it\r\neither; for in this village everybody thinks my husband a numskull, and\r\nexcept for governing a flock of goats, they cannot fancy what sort of\r\ngovernment he can be fit for. God grant it, and direct him according as\r\nhe sees his children stand in need of it. I am resolved with your\r\nworship\xe2\x80\x99s leave, lady of my soul, to make the most of this fair day,\r\nand go to Court to stretch myself at ease in a coach, and make all\r\nthose I have envying me already burst their eyes out; so I beg your\r\nexcellence to order my husband to send me a small trifle of money, and\r\nto let it be something to speak of, because one\xe2\x80\x99s expenses are heavy at\r\nthe Court; for a loaf costs a real, and meat thirty maravedis a pound,\r\nwhich is beyond everything; and if he does not want me to go let him\r\ntell me in time, for my feet are on the fidgets to be off; and my\r\nfriends and neighbours tell me that if my daughter and I make a figure\r\nand a brave show at Court, my husband will come to be known far more by\r\nme than I by him, for of course plenty of people will ask, \xe2\x80\x9cWho are\r\nthose ladies in that coach?\xe2\x80\x9d and some servant of mine will answer, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nwife and daughter of Sancho Panza, governor of the island of\r\nBarataria;\xe2\x80\x9d and in this way Sancho will become known, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nthought well of, and \xe2\x80\x9cto Rome for everything.\xe2\x80\x9d I am as vexed as vexed\r\ncan be that they have gathered no acorns this year in our village; for\r\nall that I send your highness about half a peck that I went to the wood\r\nto gather and pick out one by one myself, and I could find no bigger\r\nones; I wish they were as big as ostrich eggs.\r\n    Let not your high mightiness forget to write to me; and I will take\r\n    care to answer, and let you know how I am, and whatever news there\r\n    may be in this place, where I remain, praying our Lord to have your\r\n    highness in his keeping and not to forget me.\r\n    Sancha my daughter, and my son, kiss your worship\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n    She who would rather see your ladyship than write to you,\r\n\r\n\r\nYour servant,\r\nTERESA PANZA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll were greatly amused by Teresa Panza\xe2\x80\x99s letter, but particularly the\r\nduke and duchess; and the duchess asked Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s opinion whether\r\nthey might open the letter that had come for the governor, which she\r\nsuspected must be very good. Don Quixote said that to gratify them he\r\nwould open it, and did so, and found that it ran as follows.\r\n\r\nTERESA PANZA\xe2\x80\x99S LETTER TO HER HUSBAND SANCHO PANZA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI got thy letter, Sancho of my soul, and I promise thee and swear as a\r\nCatholic Christian that I was within two fingers\xe2\x80\x99 breadth of going mad\r\nI was so happy. I can tell thee, brother, when I came to hear that thou\r\nwert a governor I thought I should have dropped dead with pure joy; and\r\nthou knowest they say sudden joy kills as well as great sorrow; and as\r\nfor Sanchica thy daughter, she leaked from sheer happiness. I had\r\nbefore me the suit thou didst send me, and the coral beads my lady the\r\nduchess sent me round my neck, and the letters in my hands, and there\r\nwas the bearer of them standing by, and in spite of all this I verily\r\nbelieved and thought that what I saw and handled was all a dream; for\r\nwho could have thought that a goatherd would come to be a governor of\r\nislands? Thou knowest, my friend, what my mother used to say, that one\r\nmust live long to see much; I say it because I expect to see more if I\r\nlive longer; for I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to stop until I see thee a farmer of\r\ntaxes or a collector of revenue, which are offices where, though the\r\ndevil carries off those who make a bad use of them, still they make and\r\nhandle money. My lady the duchess will tell thee the desire I have to\r\ngo to the Court; consider the matter and let me know thy pleasure; I\r\nwill try to do honour to thee by going in a coach.\r\n    Neither the curate, nor the barber, nor the bachelor, nor even the\r\n    sacristan, can believe that thou art a governor, and they say the\r\n    whole thing is a delusion or an enchantment affair, like everything\r\n    belonging to thy master Don Quixote; and Samson says he must go in\r\n    search of thee and drive the government out of thy head and the\r\n    madness out of Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s skull; I only laugh, and look at my\r\n    string of beads, and plan out the dress I am going to make for our\r\n    daughter out of thy suit. I sent some acorns to my lady the\r\n    duchess; I wish they had been gold. Send me some strings of pearls\r\n    if they are in fashion in that island. Here is the news of the\r\n    village; La Berrueca has married her daughter to a good-for-nothing\r\n    painter, who came here to paint anything that might turn up. The\r\n    council gave him an order to paint his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s arms over the door\r\n    of the town-hall; he asked two ducats, which they paid him in\r\n    advance; he worked for eight days, and at the end of them had\r\n    nothing painted, and then said he had no turn for painting such\r\n    trifling things; he returned the money, and for all that has\r\n    married on the pretence of being a good workman; to be sure he has\r\n    now laid aside his paint-brush and taken a spade in hand, and goes\r\n    to the field like a gentleman. Pedro Lobo\xe2\x80\x99s son has received the\r\n    first orders and tonsure, with the intention of becoming a priest.\r\n    Minguilla, Mingo Silvato\xe2\x80\x99s granddaughter, found it out, and has\r\n    gone to law with him on the score of having given her promise of\r\n    marriage. Evil tongues say she is with child by him, but he denies\r\n    it stoutly. There are no olives this year, and there is not a drop\r\n    of vinegar to be had in the whole village. A company of soldiers\r\n    passed through here; when they left they took away with them three\r\n    of the girls of the village; I will not tell thee who they are;\r\n    perhaps they will come back, and they will be sure to find those\r\n    who will take them for wives with all their blemishes, good or bad.\r\n    Sanchica is making bonelace; she earns eight maravedis a day clear,\r\n    which she puts into a moneybox as a help towards house furnishing;\r\n    but now that she is a governor\xe2\x80\x99s daughter thou wilt give her a\r\n    portion without her working for it. The fountain in the plaza has\r\n    run dry. A flash of lightning struck the gibbet, and I wish they\r\n    all lit there. I look for an answer to this, and to know thy mind\r\n    about my going to the Court; and so, God keep thee longer than me,\r\n    or as long, for I would not leave thee in this world without me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThy wife,\r\nTERESA PANZA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letters were applauded, laughed over, relished, and admired; and\r\nthen, as if to put the seal to the business, the courier arrived,\r\nbringing the one Sancho sent to Don Quixote, and this, too, was read\r\nout, and it raised some doubts as to the governor\xe2\x80\x99s simplicity. The\r\nduchess withdrew to hear from the page about his adventures in Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvillage, which he narrated at full length without leaving a single\r\ncircumstance unmentioned. He gave her the acorns, and also a cheese\r\nwhich Teresa had given him as being particularly good and superior to\r\nthose of Tronchon. The duchess received it with greatest delight, in\r\nwhich we will leave her, to describe the end of the government of the\r\ngreat Sancho Panza, flower and mirror of all governors of islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np52e.jpg (13K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\nOF THE TROUBLOUS END AND TERMINATION SANCHO PANZA\xe2\x80\x99S GOVERNMENT CAME TO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np53a.jpg (109K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo fancy that in this life anything belonging to it will remain for\r\never in the same state is an idle fancy; on the contrary, in it\r\neverything seems to go in a circle, I mean round and round. The spring\r\nsucceeds the summer, the summer the fall, the fall the autumn, the\r\nautumn the winter, and the winter the spring, and so time rolls with\r\nnever-ceasing wheel. Man\xe2\x80\x99s life alone, swifter than time, speeds onward\r\nto its end without any hope of renewal, save it be in that other life\r\nwhich is endless and boundless. Thus saith Cide Hamete the Mahometan\r\nphilosopher; for there are many that by the light of nature alone,\r\nwithout the light of faith, have a comprehension of the fleeting nature\r\nand instability of this present life and the endless duration of that\r\neternal life we hope for; but our author is here speaking of the\r\nrapidity with which Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s government came to an end, melted away,\r\ndisappeared, vanished as it were in smoke and shadow. For as he lay in\r\nbed on the night of the seventh day of his government, sated, not with\r\nbread and wine, but with delivering judgments and giving opinions and\r\nmaking laws and proclamations, just as sleep, in spite of hunger, was\r\nbeginning to close his eyelids, he heard such a noise of bell-ringing\r\nand shouting that one would have fancied the whole island was going to\r\nthe bottom. He sat up in bed and remained listening intently to try if\r\nhe could make out what could be the cause of so great an uproar; not\r\nonly, however, was he unable to discover what it was, but as countless\r\ndrums and trumpets now helped to swell the din of the bells and shouts,\r\nhe was more puzzled than ever, and filled with fear and terror; and\r\ngetting up he put on a pair of slippers because of the dampness of the\r\nfloor, and without throwing a dressing gown or anything of the kind\r\nover him he rushed out of the door of his room, just in time to see\r\napproaching along a corridor a band of more than twenty persons with\r\nlighted torches and naked swords in their hands, all shouting out, \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\narms, to arms, se\xc3\xb1or governor, to arms! The enemy is in the island in\r\ncountless numbers, and we are lost unless your skill and valour come to\r\nour support.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKeeping up this noise, tumult, and uproar, they came to where Sancho\r\nstood dazed and bewildered by what he saw and heard, and as they\r\napproached one of them called out to him, \xe2\x80\x9cArm at once, your lordship,\r\nif you would not have yourself destroyed and the whole island lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I to do with arming?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I know about\r\narms or supports? Better leave all that to my master Don Quixote, who\r\nwill settle it and make all safe in a trice; for I, sinner that I am,\r\nGod help me, don\xe2\x80\x99t understand these scuffles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, se\xc3\xb1or governor,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat slackness of mettle this is!\r\nArm yourself; here are arms for you, offensive and defensive; come out\r\nto the plaza and be our leader and captain; it falls upon you by right,\r\nfor you are our governor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArm me then, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, and they at once produced\r\ntwo large shields they had come provided with, and placed them upon him\r\nover his shirt, without letting him put on anything else, one shield in\r\nfront and the other behind, and passing his arms through openings they\r\nhad made, they bound him tight with ropes, so that there he was walled\r\nand boarded up as straight as a spindle and unable to bend his knees or\r\nstir a single step. In his hand they placed a lance, on which he leant\r\nto keep himself from falling, and as soon as they had him thus fixed\r\nthey bade him march forward and lead them on and give them all courage;\r\nfor with him for their guide and lamp and morning star, they were sure\r\nto bring their business to a successful issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np53b.jpg (332K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to march, unlucky being that I am?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stir my knee-caps, for these boards I have bound so tight to my\r\nbody won\xe2\x80\x99t let me. What you must do is carry me in your arms, and lay\r\nme across or set me upright in some postern, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold it either\r\nwith this lance or with my body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn, se\xc3\xb1or governor!\xe2\x80\x9d cried another, \xe2\x80\x9cit is fear more than the boards\r\nthat keeps you from moving; make haste, stir yourself, for there is no\r\ntime to lose; the enemy is increasing in numbers, the shouts grow\r\nlouder, and the danger is pressing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUrged by these exhortations and reproaches the poor governor made an\r\nattempt to advance, but fell to the ground with such a crash that he\r\nfancied he had broken himself all to pieces. There he lay like a\r\ntortoise enclosed in its shell, or a side of bacon between two\r\nkneading-troughs, or a boat bottom up on the beach; nor did the gang of\r\njokers feel any compassion for him when they saw him down; so far from\r\nthat, extinguishing their torches they began to shout afresh and to\r\nrenew the calls to arms with such energy, trampling on poor Sancho, and\r\nslashing at him over the shield with their swords in such a way that,\r\nif he had not gathered himself together and made himself small and\r\ndrawn in his head between the shields, it would have fared badly with\r\nthe poor governor, as, squeezed into that narrow compass, he lay,\r\nsweating and sweating again, and commending himself with all his heart\r\nto God to deliver him from his present peril. Some stumbled over him,\r\nothers fell upon him, and one there was who took up a position on top\r\nof him for some time, and from thence as if from a watchtower issued\r\norders to the troops, shouting out, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, our side! Here the enemy is\r\nthickest! Hold the breach there! Shut that gate! Barricade those\r\nladders! Here with your stink-pots of pitch and resin, and kettles of\r\nboiling oil! Block the streets with feather beds!\xe2\x80\x9d In short, in his\r\nardour he mentioned every little thing, and every implement and engine\r\nof war by means of which an assault upon a city is warded off, while\r\nthe bruised and battered Sancho, who heard and suffered all, was saying\r\nto himself, \xe2\x80\x9cO if it would only please the Lord to let the island be\r\nlost at once, and I could see myself either dead or out of this\r\ntorture!\xe2\x80\x9d Heaven heard his prayer, and when he least expected it he\r\nheard voices exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cVictory, victory! The enemy retreats beaten!\r\nCome, se\xc3\xb1or governor, get up, and come and enjoy the victory, and\r\ndivide the spoils that have been won from the foe by the might of that\r\ninvincible arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLift me up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wretched Sancho in a woebegone voice. They\r\nhelped him to rise, and as soon as he was on his feet said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe enemy\r\nI have beaten you may nail to my forehead; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to divide the\r\nspoils of the foe, I only beg and entreat some friend, if I have one,\r\nto give me a sup of wine, for I\xe2\x80\x99m parched with thirst, and wipe me dry,\r\nfor I\xe2\x80\x99m turning to water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey rubbed him down, fetched him wine and unbound the shields, and he\r\nseated himself upon his bed, and with fear, agitation, and fatigue he\r\nfainted away. Those who had been concerned in the joke were now sorry\r\nthey had pushed it so far; however, the anxiety his fainting away had\r\ncaused them was relieved by his returning to himself. He asked what\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock it was; they told him it was just daybreak. He said no more,\r\nand in silence began to dress himself, while all watched him, waiting\r\nto see what the haste with which he was putting on his clothes meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np53c.jpg (389K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe got himself dressed at last, and then, slowly, for he was sorely\r\nbruised and could not go fast, he proceeded to the stable, followed by\r\nall who were present, and going up to Dapple embraced him and gave him\r\na loving kiss on the forehead, and said to him, not without tears in\r\nhis eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cCome along, comrade and friend and partner of my toils and\r\nsorrows; when I was with you and had no cares to trouble me except\r\nmending your harness and feeding your little carcass, happy were my\r\nhours, my days, and my years; but since I left you, and mounted the\r\ntowers of ambition and pride, a thousand miseries, a thousand troubles,\r\nand four thousand anxieties have entered into my soul;\xe2\x80\x9d and all the\r\nwhile he was speaking in this strain he was fixing the pack-saddle on\r\nthe ass, without a word from anyone. Then having Dapple saddled, he,\r\nwith great pain and difficulty, got up on him, and addressing himself\r\nto the majordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, and Pedro Recio the\r\ndoctor and several others who stood by, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMake way, gentlemen,\r\nand let me go back to my old freedom; let me go look for my past life,\r\nand raise myself up from this present death. I was not born to be a\r\ngovernor or protect islands or cities from the enemies that choose to\r\nattack them. Ploughing and digging, vinedressing and pruning, are more\r\nin my way than defending provinces or kingdoms. Saint Peter is very\r\nwell at Rome; I mean each of us is best following the trade he was born\r\nto. A reaping-hook fits my hand better than a governor\xe2\x80\x99s sceptre; I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nrather have my fill of gazpacho than be subject to the misery of a\r\nmeddling doctor who kills me with hunger, and I\xe2\x80\x99d rather lie in summer\r\nunder the shade of an oak, and in winter wrap myself in a double\r\nsheepskin jacket in freedom, than go to bed between holland sheets and\r\ndress in sables under the restraint of a government. God be with your\r\nworships, and tell my lord the duke that \xe2\x80\x98naked I was born, naked I\r\nfind myself, I neither lose nor gain;\xe2\x80\x99 I mean that without a farthing I\r\ncame into this government, and without a farthing I go out of it, very\r\ndifferent from the way governors commonly leave other islands. Stand\r\naside and let me go; I have to plaster myself, for I believe every one\r\nof my ribs is crushed, thanks to the enemies that have been trampling\r\nover me to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is unnecessary, se\xc3\xb1or governor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Recio, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I will\r\ngive your worship a draught against falls and bruises that will soon\r\nmake you as sound and strong as ever; and as for your diet I promise\r\nyour worship to behave better, and let you eat plentifully of whatever\r\nyou like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou spoke late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d as soon turn Turk as stay any\r\nlonger. Those jokes won\xe2\x80\x99t pass a second time. By God I\xe2\x80\x99d as soon remain\r\nin this government, or take another, even if it was offered me between\r\ntwo plates, as fly to heaven without wings. I am of the breed of the\r\nPanzas, and they are every one of them obstinate, and if they once say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98odds,\xe2\x80\x99 odds it must be, no matter if it is evens, in spite of all the\r\nworld. Here in this stable I leave the ant\xe2\x80\x99s wings that lifted me up\r\ninto the air for the swifts and other birds to eat me, and let\xe2\x80\x99s take\r\nto level ground and our feet once more; and if they\xe2\x80\x99re not shod in\r\npinked shoes of cordovan, they won\xe2\x80\x99t want for rough sandals of hemp;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98every ewe to her like,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98and let no one stretch his leg beyond the\r\nlength of the sheet;\xe2\x80\x99 and now let me pass, for it\xe2\x80\x99s growing late with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this the majordomo said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or governor, we would let your worship\r\ngo with all our hearts, though it sorely grieves us to lose you, for\r\nyour wit and Christian conduct naturally make us regret you; but it is\r\nwell known that every governor, before he leaves the place where he has\r\nbeen governing, is bound first of all to render an account. Let your\r\nworship do so for the ten days you have held the government, and then\r\nyou may go and the peace of God go with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one can demand it of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he whom my lord the\r\nduke shall appoint; I am going to meet him, and to him I will render an\r\nexact one; besides, when I go forth naked as I do, there is no other\r\nproof needed to show that I have governed like an angel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God the great Sancho is right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Recio, \xe2\x80\x9cand we should\r\nlet him go, for the duke will be beyond measure glad to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all agreed to this, and allowed him to go, first offering to bear\r\nhim company and furnish him with all he wanted for his own comfort or\r\nfor the journey. Sancho said he did not want anything more than a\r\nlittle barley for Dapple, and half a cheese and half a loaf for\r\nhimself; for the distance being so short there was no occasion for any\r\nbetter or bulkier provant. They all embraced him, and he with tears\r\nembraced all of them, and left them filled with admiration not only at\r\nhis remarks but at his firm and sensible resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np53e.jpg (56K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\nWHICH DEALS WITH MATTERS RELATING TO THIS HISTORY AND NO OTHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np54a.jpg (109K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duke and duchess resolved that the challenge Don Quixote had, for\r\nthe reason already mentioned, given their vassal, should be proceeded\r\nwith; and as the young man was in Flanders, whither he had fled to\r\nescape having Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez for a mother-in-law, they arranged to\r\nsubstitute for him a Gascon lacquey, named Tosilos, first of all\r\ncarefully instructing him in all he had to do. Two days later the duke\r\ntold Don Quixote that in four days from that time his opponent would\r\npresent himself on the field of battle armed as a knight, and would\r\nmaintain that the damsel lied by half a beard, nay a whole beard, if\r\nshe affirmed that he had given her a promise of marriage. Don Quixote\r\nwas greatly pleased at the news, and promised himself to do wonders in\r\nthe lists, and reckoned it rare good fortune that an opportunity should\r\nhave offered for letting his noble hosts see what the might of his\r\nstrong arm was capable of; and so in high spirits and satisfaction he\r\nawaited the expiration of the four days, which measured by his\r\nimpatience seemed spinning themselves out into four hundred ages. Let\r\nus leave them to pass as we do other things, and go and bear Sancho\r\ncompany, as mounted on Dapple, half glad, half sad, he paced along on\r\nhis road to join his master, in whose society he was happier than in\r\nbeing governor of all the islands in the world. Well then, it so\r\nhappened that before he had gone a great way from the island of his\r\ngovernment (and whether it was island, city, town, or village that he\r\ngoverned he never troubled himself to inquire) he saw coming along the\r\nroad he was travelling six pilgrims with staves, foreigners of that\r\nsort that beg for alms singing; who as they drew near arranged\r\nthemselves in a line and lifting up their voices all together began to\r\nsing in their own language something that Sancho could not understand,\r\nwith the exception of one word which sounded plainly \xe2\x80\x9calms,\xe2\x80\x9d from which\r\nhe gathered that it was alms they asked for in their song; and being,\r\nas Cide Hamete says, remarkably charitable, he took out of his alforjas\r\nthe half loaf and half cheese he had been provided with, and gave them\r\nto them, explaining to them by signs that he had nothing else to give\r\nthem. They received them very gladly, but exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cGeld! Geld!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you want of me, good people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho.\r\n\r\nOn this one of them took a purse out of his bosom and showed it to\r\nSancho, by which he comprehended they were asking for money, and\r\nputting his thumb to his throat and spreading his hand upwards he gave\r\nthem to understand that he had not the sign of a coin about him, and\r\nurging Dapple forward he broke through them. But as he was passing, one\r\nof them who had been examining him very closely rushed towards him, and\r\nflinging his arms round him exclaimed in a loud voice and good Spanish,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless me! What\xe2\x80\x99s this I see? Is it possible that I hold in my arms\r\nmy dear friend, my good neighbour Sancho Panza? But there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt\r\nabout it, for I\xe2\x80\x99m not asleep, nor am I drunk just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho was surprised to hear himself called by his name and find\r\nhimself embraced by a foreign pilgrim, and after regarding him steadily\r\nwithout speaking he was still unable to recognise him; but the pilgrim\r\nperceiving his perplexity cried, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! and is it possible, Sancho\r\nPanza, that thou dost not know thy neighbour Ricote, the Morisco\r\nshopkeeper of thy village?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho upon this looking at him more carefully began to recall his\r\nfeatures, and at last recognised him perfectly, and without getting off\r\nthe ass threw his arms round his neck saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil could have\r\nknown thee, Ricote, in this mummer\xe2\x80\x99s dress thou art in? Tell me, who\r\nhas frenchified thee, and how dost thou dare to return to Spain, where\r\nif they catch thee and recognise thee it will go hard enough with\r\nthee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou dost not betray me, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the pilgrim, \xe2\x80\x9cI am safe; for\r\nin this dress no one will recognise me; but let us turn aside out of\r\nthe road into that grove there where my comrades are going to eat and\r\nrest, and thou shalt eat with them there, for they are very good\r\nfellows; I\xe2\x80\x99ll have time enough to tell thee then all that has happened\r\nme since I left our village in obedience to his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s edict that\r\nthreatened such severities against the unfortunate people of my nation,\r\nas thou hast heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho complied, and Ricote having spoken to the other pilgrims they\r\nwithdrew to the grove they saw, turning a considerable distance out of\r\nthe road. They threw down their staves, took off their pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s cloaks\r\nand remained in their under-clothing; they were all good-looking young\r\nfellows, except Ricote, who was a man somewhat advanced in years. They\r\ncarried alforjas all of them, and all apparently well filled, at least\r\nwith things provocative of thirst, such as would summon it from two\r\nleagues off. They stretched themselves on the ground, and making a\r\ntablecloth of the grass they spread upon it bread, salt, knives,\r\nwalnut, scraps of cheese, and well-picked ham-bones which if they were\r\npast gnawing were not past sucking. They also put down a black dainty\r\ncalled, they say, caviar, and made of the eggs of fish, a great\r\nthirst-wakener. Nor was there any lack of olives, dry, it is true, and\r\nwithout any seasoning, but for all that toothsome and pleasant. But\r\nwhat made the best show in the field of the banquet was half a dozen\r\nbotas of wine, for each of them produced his own from his alforjas;\r\neven the good Ricote, who from a Morisco had transformed himself into a\r\nGerman or Dutchman, took out his, which in size might have vied with\r\nthe five others. They then began to eat with very great relish and very\r\nleisurely, making the most of each morsel\xe2\x80\x94very small ones of\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x94they took up on the point of the knife; and then all at the\r\nsame moment raised their arms and botas aloft, the mouths placed in\r\ntheir mouths, and all eyes fixed on heaven just as if they were taking\r\naim at it; and in this attitude they remained ever so long, wagging\r\ntheir heads from side to side as if in acknowledgment of the pleasure\r\nthey were enjoying while they decanted the bowels of the bottles into\r\ntheir own stomachs.\r\n\r\nSancho beheld all, \xe2\x80\x9cand nothing gave him pain;\xe2\x80\x9d so far from that,\r\nacting on the proverb he knew so well, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen thou art at Rome do as\r\nthou seest,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Ricote for his bota and took aim like the rest of\r\nthem, and with not less enjoyment. Four times did the botas bear being\r\nuplifted, but the fifth it was all in vain, for they were drier and\r\nmore sapless than a rush by that time, which made the jollity that had\r\nbeen kept up so far begin to flag.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then someone of them would grasp Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s right hand in\r\nhis own saying, \xe2\x80\x9cEspa\xc3\xb1ol y Tudesqui tuto uno: bon compa\xc3\xb1o;\xe2\x80\x9d and Sancho\r\nwould answer, \xe2\x80\x9cBon compa\xc3\xb1o, jur a Di!\xe2\x80\x9d and then go off into a fit of\r\nlaughter that lasted an hour, without a thought for the moment of\r\nanything that had befallen him in his government; for cares have very\r\nlittle sway over us while we are eating and drinking. At length, the\r\nwine having come to an end with them, drowsiness began to come over\r\nthem, and they dropped asleep on their very table and tablecloth.\r\nRicote and Sancho alone remained awake, for they had eaten more and\r\ndrunk less, and Ricote drawing Sancho aside, they seated themselves at\r\nthe foot of a beech, leaving the pilgrims buried in sweet sleep; and\r\nwithout once falling into his own Morisco tongue Ricote spoke as\r\nfollows in pure Castilian:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou knowest well, neighbour and friend Sancho Panza, how the\r\nproclamation or edict his Majesty commanded to be issued against those\r\nof my nation filled us all with terror and dismay; me at least it did,\r\ninsomuch that I think before the time granted us for quitting Spain was\r\nout, the full force of the penalty had already fallen upon me and upon\r\nmy children. I decided, then, and I think wisely (just like one who\r\nknows that at a certain date the house he lives in will be taken from\r\nhim, and looks out beforehand for another to change into), I decided, I\r\nsay, to leave the town myself, alone and without my family, and go to\r\nseek out some place to remove them to comfortably and not in the\r\nhurried way in which the others took their departure; for I saw very\r\nplainly, and so did all the older men among us, that the proclamations\r\nwere not mere threats, as some said, but positive enactments which\r\nwould be enforced at the appointed time; and what made me believe this\r\nwas what I knew of the base and extravagant designs which our people\r\nharboured, designs of such a nature that I think it was a divine\r\ninspiration that moved his Majesty to carry out a resolution so\r\nspirited; not that we were all guilty, for some there were true and\r\nsteadfast Christians; but they were so few that they could make no head\r\nagainst those who were not; and it was not prudent to cherish a viper\r\nin the bosom by having enemies in the house. In short it was with just\r\ncause that we were visited with the penalty of banishment, a mild and\r\nlenient one in the eyes of some, but to us the most terrible that could\r\nbe inflicted upon us. Wherever we are we weep for Spain; for after all\r\nwe were born there and it is our natural fatherland. Nowhere do we find\r\nthe reception our unhappy condition needs; and in Barbary and all the\r\nparts of Africa where we counted upon being received, succoured, and\r\nwelcomed, it is there they insult and ill-treat us most. We knew not\r\nour good fortune until we lost it; and such is the longing we almost\r\nall of us have to return to Spain, that most of those who like myself\r\nknow the language, and there are many who do, come back to it and leave\r\ntheir wives and children forsaken yonder, so great is their love for\r\nit; and now I know by experience the meaning of the saying, sweet is\r\nthe love of one\xe2\x80\x99s country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left our village, as I said, and went to France, but though they\r\ngave us a kind reception there I was anxious to see all I could. I\r\ncrossed into Italy, and reached Germany, and there it seemed to me we\r\nmight live with more freedom, as the inhabitants do not pay any\r\nattention to trifling points; everyone lives as he likes, for in most\r\nparts they enjoy liberty of conscience. I took a house in a town near\r\nAugsburg, and then joined these pilgrims, who are in the habit of\r\ncoming to Spain in great numbers every year to visit the shrines there,\r\nwhich they look upon as their Indies and a sure and certain source of\r\ngain. They travel nearly all over it, and there is no town out of which\r\nthey do not go full up of meat and drink, as the saying is, and with a\r\nreal, at least, in money, and they come off at the end of their travels\r\nwith more than a hundred crowns saved, which, changed into gold, they\r\nsmuggle out of the kingdom either in the hollow of their staves or in\r\nthe patches of their pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s cloaks or by some device of their own,\r\nand carry to their own country in spite of the guards at the posts and\r\npasses where they are searched. Now my purpose is, Sancho, to carry\r\naway the treasure that I left buried, which, as it is outside the town,\r\nI shall be able to do without risk, and to write, or cross over from\r\nValencia, to my daughter and wife, who I know are at Algiers, and find\r\nsome means of bringing them to some French port and thence to Germany,\r\nthere to await what it may be God\xe2\x80\x99s will to do with us; for, after all,\r\nSancho, I know well that Ricota my daughter and Francisca Ricota my\r\nwife are Catholic Christians, and though I am not so much so, still I\r\nam more of a Christian than a Moor, and it is always my prayer to God\r\nthat he will open the eyes of my understanding and show me how I am to\r\nserve him; but what amazes me and I cannot understand is why my wife\r\nand daughter should have gone to Barbary rather than to France, where\r\nthey could live as Christians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Sancho replied, \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, Ricote, that may not have been open\r\nto them, for Juan Tiopieyo thy wife\xe2\x80\x99s brother took them, and being a\r\ntrue Moor he went where he could go most easily; and another thing I\r\ncan tell thee, it is my belief thou art going in vain to look for what\r\nthou hast left buried, for we heard they took from thy brother-in-law\r\nand thy wife a great quantity of pearls and money in gold which they\r\nbrought to be passed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ricote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know they did not touch my hoard,\r\nfor I did not tell them where it was, for fear of accidents; and so, if\r\nthou wilt come with me, Sancho, and help me to take it away and conceal\r\nit, I will give thee two hundred crowns wherewith thou mayest relieve\r\nthy necessities, and, as thou knowest, I know they are many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am not at all covetous, for I gave\r\nup an office this morning in which, if I was, I might have made the\r\nwalls of my house of gold and dined off silver plates before six months\r\nwere over; and so for this reason, and because I feel I would be guilty\r\nof treason to my king if I helped his enemies, I would not go with thee\r\nif instead of promising me two hundred crowns thou wert to give me four\r\nhundred here in hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what office is this thou hast given up, Sancho?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ricote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have given up being governor of an island,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand such a\r\none, faith, as you won\xe2\x80\x99t find the like of easily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is this island?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ricote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9ctwo leagues from here, and it is called the\r\nisland of Barataria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ricote; \xe2\x80\x9cislands are away out in the sea;\r\nthere are no islands on the mainland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? No islands!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI tell thee, friend Ricote, I left it\r\nthis morning, and yesterday I was governing there as I pleased like a\r\nsagittarius; but for all that I gave it up, for it seemed to me a\r\ndangerous office, a governor\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what hast thou gained by the government?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ricote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have gained,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthe knowledge that I am no good for\r\ngoverning, unless it is a drove of cattle, and that the riches that are\r\nto be got by these governments are got at the cost of one\xe2\x80\x99s rest and\r\nsleep, ay and even one\xe2\x80\x99s food; for in islands the governors must eat\r\nlittle, especially if they have doctors to look after their health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand thee, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ricote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it seems to me all\r\nnonsense thou art talking. Who would give thee islands to govern? Is\r\nthere any scarcity in the world of cleverer men than thou art for\r\ngovernors? Hold thy peace, Sancho, and come back to thy senses, and\r\nconsider whether thou wilt come with me as I said to help me to take\r\naway treasure I left buried (for indeed it may be called a treasure, it\r\nis so large), and I will give thee wherewithal to keep thee, as I told\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have told thee already, Ricote, that I will not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet it content thee that by me thou shalt not be betrayed, and go thy\r\nway in God\xe2\x80\x99s name and let me go mine; for I know that well-gotten gain\r\nmay be lost, but ill-gotten gain is lost, itself and its owner\r\nlikewise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not press thee, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ricote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut tell me, wert thou\r\nin our village when my wife and daughter and brother-in-law left it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand I can tell thee thy daughter left it\r\nlooking so lovely that all the village turned out to see her, and\r\neverybody said she was the fairest creature in the world. She wept as\r\nshe went, and embraced all her friends and acquaintances and those who\r\ncame out to see her, and she begged them all to commend her to God and\r\nOur Lady his mother, and this in such a touching way that it made me\r\nweep myself, though I\xe2\x80\x99m not much given to tears commonly; and, faith,\r\nmany a one would have liked to hide her, or go out and carry her off on\r\nthe road; but the fear of going against the king\xe2\x80\x99s command kept them\r\nback. The one who showed himself most moved was Don Pedro Gregorio, the\r\nrich young heir thou knowest of, and they say he was deep in love with\r\nher; and since she left he has not been seen in our village again, and\r\nwe all suspect he has gone after her to steal her away, but so far\r\nnothing has been heard of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always had a suspicion that gentleman had a passion for my\r\ndaughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ricote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as I felt sure of my Ricota\xe2\x80\x99s virtue it\r\ngave me no uneasiness to know that he loved her; for thou must have\r\nheard it said, Sancho, that the Morisco women seldom or never engage in\r\namours with the old Christians; and my daughter, who I fancy thought\r\nmore of being a Christian than of lovemaking, would not trouble herself\r\nabout the attentions of this heir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it would be a bad business for both\r\nof them; but now let me be off, friend Ricote, for I want to reach\r\nwhere my master Don Quixote is to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be with thee, brother Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ricote; \xe2\x80\x9cmy comrades are\r\nbeginning to stir, and it is time, too, for us to continue our\r\njourney;\xe2\x80\x9d and then they both embraced, and Sancho mounted Dapple, and\r\nRicote leant upon his staff, and so they parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np54e.jpg (40K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\nOF WHAT BEFELL SANCHO ON THE ROAD, AND OTHER THINGS THAT CANNOT BE\r\nSURPASSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np55a.jpg (126K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe length of time he delayed with Ricote prevented Sancho from\r\nreaching the duke\xe2\x80\x99s castle that day, though he was within half a league\r\nof it when night, somewhat dark and cloudy, overtook him. This,\r\nhowever, as it was summer time, did not give him much uneasiness, and\r\nhe turned aside out of the road intending to wait for morning; but his\r\nill luck and hard fate so willed it that as he was searching about for\r\na place to make himself as comfortable as possible, he and Dapple fell\r\ninto a deep dark hole that lay among some very old buildings. As he\r\nfell he commended himself with all his heart to God, fancying he was\r\nnot going to stop until he reached the depths of the bottomless pit;\r\nbut it did not turn out so, for at little more than thrice a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheight Dapple touched bottom, and he found himself sitting on him\r\nwithout having received any hurt or damage whatever. He felt himself\r\nall over and held his breath to try whether he was quite sound or had a\r\nhole made in him anywhere, and finding himself all right and whole and\r\nin perfect health he was profuse in his thanks to God our Lord for the\r\nmercy that had been shown him, for he made sure he had been broken into\r\na thousand pieces. He also felt along the sides of the pit with his\r\nhands to see if it were possible to get out of it without help, but he\r\nfound they were quite smooth and afforded no hold anywhere, at which he\r\nwas greatly distressed, especially when he heard how pathetically and\r\ndolefully Dapple was bemoaning himself, and no wonder he complained,\r\nnor was it from ill-temper, for in truth he was not in a very good\r\ncase. \xe2\x80\x9cAlas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat unexpected accidents happen at every\r\nstep to those who live in this miserable world! Who would have said\r\nthat one who saw himself yesterday sitting on a throne, governor of an\r\nisland, giving orders to his servants and his vassals, would see\r\nhimself to-day buried in a pit without a soul to help him, or servant\r\nor vassal to come to his relief? Here must we perish with hunger, my\r\nass and myself, if indeed we don\xe2\x80\x99t die first, he of his bruises and\r\ninjuries, and I of grief and sorrow. At any rate I\xe2\x80\x99ll not be as lucky\r\nas my master Don Quixote of La Mancha, when he went down into the cave\r\nof that enchanted Montesinos, where he found people to make more of him\r\nthan if he had been in his own house; for it seems he came in for a\r\ntable laid out and a bed ready made. There he saw fair and pleasant\r\nvisions, but here I\xe2\x80\x99ll see, I imagine, toads and adders. Unlucky wretch\r\nthat I am, what an end my follies and fancies have come to! They\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake up my bones out of this, when it is heaven\xe2\x80\x99s will that I\xe2\x80\x99m found,\r\npicked clean, white and polished, and my good Dapple\xe2\x80\x99s with them, and\r\nby that, perhaps, it will be found out who we are, at least by such as\r\nhave heard that Sancho Panza never separated from his ass, nor his ass\r\nfrom Sancho Panza. Unlucky wretches, I say again, that our hard fate\r\nshould not let us die in our own country and among our own people,\r\nwhere if there was no help for our misfortune, at any rate there would\r\nbe someone to grieve for it and to close our eyes as we passed away! O\r\ncomrade and friend, how ill have I repaid thy faithful services!\r\nForgive me, and entreat Fortune, as well as thou canst, to deliver us\r\nout of this miserable strait we are both in; and I promise to put a\r\ncrown of laurel on thy head, and make thee look like a poet laureate,\r\nand give thee double feeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np55b.jpg (273K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this strain did Sancho bewail himself, and his ass listened to him,\r\nbut answered him never a word, such was the distress and anguish the\r\npoor beast found himself in. At length, after a night spent in bitter\r\nmoanings and lamentations, day came, and by its light Sancho perceived\r\nthat it was wholly impossible to escape out of that pit without help,\r\nand he fell to bemoaning his fate and uttering loud shouts to find out\r\nif there was anyone within hearing; but all his shouting was only\r\ncrying in the wilderness, for there was not a soul anywhere in the\r\nneighbourhood to hear him, and then at last he gave himself up for\r\ndead. Dapple was lying on his back, and Sancho helped him to his feet,\r\nwhich he was scarcely able to keep; and then taking a piece of bread\r\nout of his alforjas which had shared their fortunes in the fall, he\r\ngave it to the ass, to whom it was not unwelcome, saying to him as if\r\nhe understood him, \xe2\x80\x9cWith bread all sorrows are less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now he perceived on one side of the pit a hole large enough to\r\nadmit a person if he stooped and squeezed himself into a small compass.\r\nSancho made for it, and entered it by creeping, and found it wide and\r\nspacious on the inside, which he was able to see as a ray of sunlight\r\nthat penetrated what might be called the roof showed it all plainly. He\r\nobserved too that it opened and widened out into another spacious\r\ncavity; seeing which he made his way back to where the ass was, and\r\nwith a stone began to pick away the clay from the hole until in a short\r\ntime he had made room for the beast to pass easily, and this\r\naccomplished, taking him by the halter, he proceeded to traverse the\r\ncavern to see if there was any outlet at the other end. He advanced,\r\nsometimes in the dark, sometimes without light, but never without fear;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod Almighty help me!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cthis that is a\r\nmisadventure to me would make a good adventure for my master Don\r\nQuixote. He would have been sure to take these depths and dungeons for\r\nflowery gardens or the palaces of Galiana, and would have counted upon\r\nissuing out of this darkness and imprisonment into some blooming\r\nmeadow; but I, unlucky that I am, hopeless and spiritless, expect at\r\nevery step another pit deeper than the first to open under my feet and\r\nswallow me up for good; \xe2\x80\x98welcome evil, if thou comest alone.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this way and with these reflections he seemed to himself to have\r\ntravelled rather more than half a league, when at last he perceived a\r\ndim light that looked like daylight and found its way in on one side,\r\nshowing that this road, which appeared to him the road to the other\r\nworld, led to some opening.\r\n\r\nHere Cide Hamete leaves him, and returns to Don Quixote, who in high\r\nspirits and satisfaction was looking forward to the day fixed for the\r\nbattle he was to fight with him who had robbed Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter of her honour, for whom he hoped to obtain satisfaction for\r\nthe wrong and injury shamefully done to her. It came to pass, then,\r\nthat having sallied forth one morning to practise and exercise himself\r\nin what he would have to do in the encounter he expected to find\r\nhimself engaged in the next day, as he was putting Rocinante through\r\nhis paces or pressing him to the charge, he brought his feet so close\r\nto a pit that but for reining him in tightly it would have been\r\nimpossible for him to avoid falling into it. He pulled him up, however,\r\nwithout a fall, and coming a little closer examined the hole without\r\ndismounting; but as he was looking at it he heard loud cries proceeding\r\nfrom it, and by listening attentively was able to make out that he who\r\nuttered them was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHo, above there! is there any Christian that\r\nhears me, or any charitable gentleman that will take pity on a sinner\r\nburied alive, on an unfortunate disgoverned governor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt struck Don Quixote that it was the voice of Sancho Panza he heard,\r\nwhereat he was taken aback and amazed, and raising his own voice as\r\nmuch as he could, he cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is below there? Who is that\r\ncomplaining?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho should be here, or who should complain,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the\r\nforlorn Sancho Panza, for his sins and for his ill-luck governor of the\r\nisland of Barataria, squire that was to the famous knight Don Quixote\r\nof La Mancha?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Don Quixote heard this his amazement was redoubled and his\r\nperturbation grew greater than ever, for it suggested itself to his\r\nmind that Sancho must be dead, and that his soul was in torment down\r\nthere; and carried away by this idea he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI conjure thee by\r\neverything that as a Catholic Christian I can conjure thee by, tell me\r\nwho thou art; and if thou art a soul in torment, tell me what thou\r\nwouldst have me do for thee; for as my profession is to give aid and\r\nsuccour to those that need it in this world, it will also extend to\r\naiding and succouring the distressed of the other, who cannot help\r\nthemselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the voice, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship who speaks to me must\r\nbe my master Don Quixote of La Mancha; nay, from the tone of the voice\r\nit is plain it can be nobody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote I am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9che whose profession it is to\r\naid and succour the living and the dead in their necessities; wherefore\r\ntell me who thou art, for thou art keeping me in suspense; because, if\r\nthou art my squire Sancho Panza, and art dead, since the devils have\r\nnot carried thee off, and thou art by God\xe2\x80\x99s mercy in purgatory, our\r\nholy mother the Roman Catholic Church has intercessory means sufficient\r\nto release thee from the pains thou art in; and I for my part will\r\nplead with her to that end, so far as my substance will go; without\r\nfurther delay, therefore, declare thyself, and tell me who thou art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all that\xe2\x80\x99s good,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, \xe2\x80\x9cand by the birth of whomsoever\r\nyour worship chooses, I swear, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote of La Mancha, that I\r\nam your squire Sancho Panza, and that I have never died all my life;\r\nbut that, having given up my government for reasons that would require\r\nmore time to explain, I fell last night into this pit where I am now,\r\nand Dapple is witness and won\xe2\x80\x99t let me lie, for more by token he is\r\nhere with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNor was this all; one would have fancied the ass understood what Sancho\r\nsaid, because that moment he began to bray so loudly that the whole\r\ncave rang again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFamous testimony!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cI know that bray as well as\r\nif I was its mother, and thy voice too, my Sancho. Wait while I go to\r\nthe duke\xe2\x80\x99s castle, which is close by, and I will bring someone to take\r\nthee out of this pit into which thy sins no doubt have brought thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand come back quick for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake;\r\nfor I cannot bear being buried alive any longer, and I\xe2\x80\x99m dying of\r\nfear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote left him, and hastened to the castle to tell the duke and\r\nduchess what had happened Sancho, and they were not a little astonished\r\nat it; they could easily understand his having fallen, from the\r\nconfirmatory circumstance of the cave which had been in existence there\r\nfrom time immemorial; but they could not imagine how he had quitted the\r\ngovernment without their receiving any intimation of his coming. To be\r\nbrief, they fetched ropes and tackle, as the saying is, and by dint of\r\nmany hands and much labour they drew up Dapple and Sancho Panza out of\r\nthe darkness into the light of day. A student who saw him remarked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way all bad governors should come out of their governments,\r\nas this sinner comes out of the depths of the pit, dead with hunger,\r\npale, and I suppose without a farthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho overheard him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is eight or ten days, brother\r\ngrowler, since I entered upon the government of the island they gave\r\nme, and all that time I never had a bellyful of victuals, no not for an\r\nhour; doctors persecuted me and enemies crushed my bones; nor had I any\r\nopportunity of taking bribes or levying taxes; and if that be the case,\r\nas it is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve, I think, to come out in this fashion; but\r\n\xe2\x80\x98man proposes and God disposes;\xe2\x80\x99 and God knows what is best, and what\r\nsuits each one best; and \xe2\x80\x98as the occasion, so the behaviour;\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98let\r\nnobody say \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t drink of this water;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98where one thinks there\r\nare flitches, there are no pegs;\xe2\x80\x99 God knows my meaning and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenough; I say no more, though I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe not angry or annoyed at what thou hearest, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote, \xe2\x80\x9cor there will never be an end of it; keep a safe conscience\r\nand let them say what they like; for trying to stop slanderers\xe2\x80\x99 tongues\r\nis like trying to put gates to the open plain. If a governor comes out\r\nof his government rich, they say he has been a thief; and if he comes\r\nout poor, that he has been a noodle and a blockhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be pretty sure this time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cto set me down for a\r\nfool rather than a thief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus talking, and surrounded by boys and a crowd of people, they\r\nreached the castle, where in one of the corridors the duke and duchess\r\nstood waiting for them; but Sancho would not go up to see the duke\r\nuntil he had first put up Dapple in the stable, for he said he had\r\npassed a very bad night in his last quarters; then he went upstairs to\r\nsee his lord and lady, and kneeling before them he said, \xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\r\nwas your highnesses\xe2\x80\x99 pleasure, not because of any desert of my own, I\r\nwent to govern your island of Barataria, which \xe2\x80\x98I entered naked, and\r\nnaked I find myself; I neither lose nor gain.\xe2\x80\x99 Whether I have governed\r\nwell or ill, I have had witnesses who will say what they think fit. I\r\nhave answered questions, I have decided causes, and always dying of\r\nhunger, for Doctor Pedro Recio of Tirteafuera, the island and governor\r\ndoctor, would have it so. Enemies attacked us by night and put us in a\r\ngreat quandary, but the people of the island say they came off safe and\r\nvictorious by the might of my arm; and may God give them as much health\r\nas there\xe2\x80\x99s truth in what they say. In short, during that time I have\r\nweighed the cares and responsibilities governing brings with it, and by\r\nmy reckoning I find my shoulders can\xe2\x80\x99t bear them, nor are they a load\r\nfor my loins or arrows for my quiver; and so, before the government\r\nthrew me over I preferred to throw the government over; and yesterday\r\nmorning I left the island as I found it, with the same streets, houses,\r\nand roofs it had when I entered it. I asked no loan of anybody, nor did\r\nI try to fill my pocket; and though I meant to make some useful laws, I\r\nmade hardly any, as I was afraid they would not be kept; for in that\r\ncase it comes to the same thing to make them or not to make them. I\r\nquitted the island, as I said, without any escort except my ass; I fell\r\ninto a pit, I pushed on through it, until this morning by the light of\r\nthe sun I saw an outlet, but not so easy a one but that, had not heaven\r\nsent me my master Don Quixote, I\xe2\x80\x99d have stayed there till the end of\r\nthe world. So now my lord and lady duke and duchess, here is your\r\ngovernor Sancho Panza, who in the bare ten days he has held the\r\ngovernment has come by the knowledge that he would not give anything to\r\nbe governor, not to say of an island, but of the whole world; and that\r\npoint being settled, kissing your worships\xe2\x80\x99 feet, and imitating the\r\ngame of the boys when they say, \xe2\x80\x98leap thou, and give me one,\xe2\x80\x99 I take a\r\nleap out of the government and pass into the service of my master Don\r\nQuixote; for after all, though in it I eat my bread in fear and\r\ntrembling, at any rate I take my fill; and for my part, so long as I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nfull, it\xe2\x80\x99s all alike to me whether it\xe2\x80\x99s with carrots or with\r\npartridges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Sancho brought his long speech to an end, Don Quixote having been\r\nthe whole time in dread of his uttering a host of absurdities; and when\r\nhe found him leave off with so few, he thanked heaven in his heart. The\r\nduke embraced Sancho and told him he was heartily sorry he had given up\r\nthe government so soon, but that he would see that he was provided with\r\nsome other post on his estate less onerous and more profitable. The\r\nduchess also embraced him, and gave orders that he should be taken good\r\ncare of, as it was plain to see he had been badly treated and worse\r\nbruised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np55e.jpg (18K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.br/> OF THE PRODIGIOUS AND UNPARALLELED BATTLE THAT TOOK\r\nPLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA AND THE LACQUEY TOSILOS IN\r\nDEFENCE OF THE DAUGHTER OF DO\xc3\x91A RODRIGUEZ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np56a.jpg (158K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duke and duchess had no reason to regret the joke that had been\r\nplayed upon Sancho Panza in giving him the government; especially as\r\ntheir majordomo returned the same day, and gave them a minute account\r\nof almost every word and deed that Sancho uttered or did during the\r\ntime; and to wind up with, eloquently described to them the attack upon\r\nthe island and Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s fright and departure, with which they were not\r\na little amused. After this the history goes on to say that the day\r\nfixed for the battle arrived, and that the duke, after having\r\nrepeatedly instructed his lacquey Tosilos how to deal with Don Quixote\r\nso as to vanquish him without killing or wounding him, gave orders to\r\nhave the heads removed from the lances, telling Don Quixote that\r\nChristian charity, on which he plumed himself, could not suffer the\r\nbattle to be fought with so much risk and danger to life; and that he\r\nmust be content with the offer of a battlefield on his territory\r\n(though that was against the decree of the holy Council, which\r\nprohibits all challenges of the sort) and not push such an arduous\r\nventure to its extreme limits. Don Quixote bade his excellence arrange\r\nall matters connected with the affair as he pleased, as on his part he\r\nwould obey him in everything. The dread day, then, having arrived, and\r\nthe duke having ordered a spacious stand to be erected facing the court\r\nof the castle for the judges of the field and the appellant duennas,\r\nmother and daughter, vast crowds flocked from all the villages and\r\nhamlets of the neighbourhood to see the novel spectacle of the battle;\r\nnobody, dead or alive, in those parts having ever seen or heard of such\r\na one.\r\n\r\nThe first person to enter the field and the lists was the master of the\r\nceremonies, who surveyed and paced the whole ground to see that there\r\nwas nothing unfair and nothing concealed to make the combatants stumble\r\nor fall; then the duennas entered and seated themselves, enveloped in\r\nmantles covering their eyes, nay even their bosoms, and displaying no\r\nslight emotion as Don Quixote appeared in the lists. Shortly\r\nafterwards, accompanied by several trumpets and mounted on a powerful\r\nsteed that threatened to crush the whole place, the great lacquey\r\nTosilos made his appearance on one side of the courtyard with his visor\r\ndown and stiffly cased in a suit of stout shining armour. The horse was\r\na manifest Frieslander, broad-backed and flea-bitten, and with half a\r\nhundred of wool hanging to each of his fetlocks. The gallant combatant\r\ncame well primed by his master the duke as to how he was to bear\r\nhimself against the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha; being warned that\r\nhe must on no account slay him, but strive to shirk the first encounter\r\nso as to avoid the risk of killing him, as he was sure to do if he met\r\nhim full tilt. He crossed the courtyard at a walk, and coming to where\r\nthe duennas were placed stopped to look at her who demanded him for a\r\nhusband; the marshal of the field summoned Don Quixote, who had already\r\npresented himself in the courtyard, and standing by the side of Tosilos\r\nhe addressed the duennas, and asked them if they consented that Don\r\nQuixote of La Mancha should do battle for their right. They said they\r\ndid, and that whatever he should do in that behalf they declared\r\nrightly done, final and valid. By this time the duke and duchess had\r\ntaken their places in a gallery commanding the enclosure, which was\r\nfilled to overflowing with a multitude of people eager to see this\r\nperilous and unparalleled encounter. The conditions of the combat were\r\nthat if Don Quixote proved the victor his antagonist was to marry the\r\ndaughter of Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez; but if he should be vanquished his opponent\r\nwas released from the promise that was claimed against him and from all\r\nobligations to give satisfaction. The master of the ceremonies\r\napportioned the sun to them, and stationed them, each on the spot where\r\nhe was to stand. The drums beat, the sound of the trumpets filled the\r\nair, the earth trembled under foot, the hearts of the gazing crowd were\r\nfull of anxiety, some hoping for a happy issue, some apprehensive of an\r\nuntoward ending to the affair, and lastly, Don Quixote, commending\r\nhimself with all his heart to God our Lord and to the lady Dulcinea del\r\nToboso, stood waiting for them to give the necessary signal for the\r\nonset. Our lacquey, however, was thinking of something very different;\r\nhe only thought of what I am now going to mention.\r\n\r\nIt seems that as he stood contemplating his enemy she struck him as the\r\nmost beautiful woman he had ever seen all his life; and the little\r\nblind boy whom in our streets they commonly call Love had no mind to\r\nlet slip the chance of triumphing over a lacquey heart, and adding it\r\nto the list of his trophies; and so, stealing gently upon him unseen,\r\nhe drove a dart two yards long into the poor lacquey\xe2\x80\x99s left side and\r\npierced his heart through and through; which he was able to do quite at\r\nhis ease, for Love is invisible, and comes in and goes out as he likes,\r\nwithout anyone calling him to account for what he does. Well then, when\r\nthey gave the signal for the onset our lacquey was in an ecstasy,\r\nmusing upon the beauty of her whom he had already made mistress of his\r\nliberty, and so he paid no attention to the sound of the trumpet,\r\nunlike Don Quixote, who was off the instant he heard it, and, at the\r\nhighest speed Rocinante was capable of, set out to meet his enemy, his\r\ngood squire Sancho shouting lustily as he saw him start, \xe2\x80\x9cGod guide\r\nthee, cream and flower of knights-errant! God give thee the victory,\r\nfor thou hast the right on thy side!\xe2\x80\x9d But though Tosilos saw Don\r\nQuixote coming at him he never stirred a step from the spot where he\r\nwas posted; and instead of doing so called loudly to the marshal of the\r\nfield, to whom when he came up to see what he wanted he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\r\nis not this battle to decide whether I marry or do not marry that\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lacquey, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nfeel qualms of conscience, and I should lay a heavy burden upon it if I\r\nwere to proceed any further with the combat; I therefore declare that I\r\nyield myself vanquished, and that I am willing to marry the lady at\r\nonce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marshal of the field was lost in astonishment at the words of\r\nTosilos; and as he was one of those who were privy to the arrangement\r\nof the affair he knew not what to say in reply. Don Quixote pulled up\r\nin mid career when he saw that his enemy was not coming on to the\r\nattack. The duke could not make out the reason why the battle did not\r\ngo on; but the marshal of the field hastened to him to let him know\r\nwhat Tosilos said, and he was amazed and extremely angry at it. In the\r\nmeantime Tosilos advanced to where Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez sat and said in a\r\nloud voice, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1ora, I am willing to marry your daughter, and I have no\r\nwish to obtain by strife and fighting what I can obtain in peace and\r\nwithout any risk to my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe valiant Don Quixote heard him, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAs that is the case I am\r\nreleased and absolved from my promise; let them marry by all means, and\r\nas \xe2\x80\x98God our Lord has given her, may Saint Peter add his blessing.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke had now descended to the courtyard of the castle, and going up\r\nto Tosilos he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it true, sir knight, that you yield\r\nyourself vanquished, and that moved by scruples of conscience you wish\r\nto marry this damsel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Tosilos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he does well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor what thou hast to give to the\r\nmouse, give to the cat, and it will save thee all trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTosilos meanwhile was trying to unlace his helmet, and he begged them\r\nto come to his help at once, as his power of breathing was failing him,\r\nand he could not remain so long shut up in that confined space. They\r\nremoved it in all haste, and his lacquey features were revealed to\r\npublic gaze. At this sight Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez and her daughter raised a\r\nmighty outcry, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a trick! This is a trick! They have\r\nput Tosilos, my lord the duke\xe2\x80\x99s lacquey, upon us in place of the real\r\nhusband. The justice of God and the king against such trickery, not to\r\nsay roguery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not distress yourselves, ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cfor this is no\r\ntrickery or roguery; or if it is, it is not the duke who is at the\r\nbottom of it, but those wicked enchanters who persecute me, and who,\r\njealous of my reaping the glory of this victory, have turned your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s features into those of this person, who you say is a lacquey\r\nof the duke\xe2\x80\x99s; take my advice, and notwithstanding the malice of my\r\nenemies marry him, for beyond a doubt he is the one you wish for a\r\nhusband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the duke heard this all his anger was near vanishing in a fit of\r\nlaughter, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe things that happen to Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote are\r\nso extraordinary that I am ready to believe this lacquey of mine is not\r\none; but let us adopt this plan and device; let us put off the marriage\r\nfor, say, a fortnight, and let us keep this person about whom we are\r\nuncertain in close confinement, and perhaps in the course of that time\r\nhe may return to his original shape; for the spite which the enchanters\r\nentertain against Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote cannot last so long, especially as\r\nit is of so little advantage to them to practise these deceptions and\r\ntransformations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthose scoundrels are well used to changing\r\nwhatever concerns my master from one thing into another. A knight that\r\nhe overcame some time back, called the Knight of the Mirrors, they\r\nturned into the shape of the bachelor Samson Carrasco of our town and a\r\ngreat friend of ours; and my lady Dulcinea del Toboso they have turned\r\ninto a common country wench; so I suspect this lacquey will have to\r\nlive and die a lacquey all the days of his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s daughter exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cLet him be who he may, this\r\nman that claims me for a wife; I am thankful to him for the same, for I\r\nhad rather be the lawful wife of a lacquey than the cheated mistress of\r\na gentleman; though he who played me false is nothing of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo be brief, all the talk and all that had happened ended in Tosilos\r\nbeing shut up until it was seen how his transformation turned out. All\r\nhailed Don Quixote as victor, but the greater number were vexed and\r\ndisappointed at finding that the combatants they had been so anxiously\r\nwaiting for had not battered one another to pieces, just as the boys\r\nare disappointed when the man they are waiting to see hanged does not\r\ncome out, because the prosecution or the court has pardoned him. The\r\npeople dispersed, the duke and Don Quixote returned to the castle, they\r\nlocked up Tosilos, Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez and her daughter remained perfectly\r\ncontented when they saw that any way the affair must end in marriage,\r\nand Tosilos wanted nothing else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np56e.jpg (46K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF HOW DON QUIXOTE TOOK LEAVE OF THE DUKE, AND OF WHAT\r\nFOLLOWED WITH THE WITTY AND IMPUDENT ALTISIDORA, ONE OF THE DUCHESS\xe2\x80\x99S\r\nDAMSELS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np57a.jpg (119K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote now felt it right to quit a life of such idleness as he was\r\nleading in the castle; for he fancied that he was making himself sorely\r\nmissed by suffering himself to remain shut up and inactive amid the\r\ncountless luxuries and enjoyments his hosts lavished upon him as a\r\nknight, and he felt too that he would have to render a strict account\r\nto heaven of that indolence and seclusion; and so one day he asked the\r\nduke and duchess to grant him permission to take his departure. They\r\ngave it, showing at the same time that they were very sorry he was\r\nleaving them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np57b.jpg (370K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duchess gave his wife\xe2\x80\x99s letters to Sancho Panza, who shed tears\r\nover them, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWho would have thought that such grand hopes as the\r\nnews of my government bred in my wife Teresa Panza\xe2\x80\x99s breast would end\r\nin my going back now to the vagabond adventures of my master Don\r\nQuixote of La Mancha? Still I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see my Teresa behaved as she\r\nought in sending the acorns, for if she had not sent them I\xe2\x80\x99d have been\r\nsorry, and she\xe2\x80\x99d have shown herself ungrateful. It is a comfort to me\r\nthat they can\xe2\x80\x99t call that present a bribe; for I had got the government\r\nalready when she sent them, and it\xe2\x80\x99s but reasonable that those who have\r\nhad a good turn done them should show their gratitude, if it\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nwith a trifle. After all I went into the government naked, and I come\r\nout of it naked; so I can say with a safe conscience\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nsmall matter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98naked I was born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor\r\ngain.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus did Sancho soliloquise on the day of their departure, as Don\r\nQuixote, who had the night before taken leave of the duke and duchess,\r\ncoming out made his appearance at an early hour in full armour in the\r\ncourtyard of the castle. The whole household of the castle were\r\nwatching him from the corridors, and the duke and duchess, too, came\r\nout to see him. Sancho was mounted on his Dapple, with his alforjas,\r\nvalise, and proven supremely happy because the duke\xe2\x80\x99s majordomo, the\r\nsame that had acted the part of the Trifaldi, had given him a little\r\npurse with two hundred gold crowns to meet the necessary expenses of\r\nthe road, but of this Don Quixote knew nothing as yet. While all were,\r\nas has been said, observing him, suddenly from among the duennas and\r\nhandmaidens the impudent and witty Altisidora lifted up her voice and\r\nsaid in pathetic tones:\r\n\r\nGive ear, cruel knight;\r\nDraw rein; where\xe2\x80\x99s the need\r\nOf spurring the flanks\r\nOf that ill-broken steed?\r\nFrom what art thou flying?\r\nNo dragon I am,\r\nNot even a sheep,\r\nBut a tender young lamb.\r\nThou hast jilted a maiden\r\nAs fair to behold\r\nAs nymph of Diana\r\nOr Venus of old.\r\nBireno, \xc3\x86neas, what worse shall I call thee?\r\nBarabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!\r\n\r\nIn thy claws, ruthless robber,\r\nThou bearest away\r\nThe heart of a meek\r\nLoving maid for thy prey,\r\nThree kerchiefs thou stealest,\r\nAnd garters a pair,\r\nFrom legs than the whitest\r\nOf marble more fair;\r\nAnd the sighs that pursue thee\r\nWould burn to the ground\r\nTwo thousand Troy Towns,\r\nIf so many were found.\r\nBireno, \xc3\x86neas, what worse shall I call thee?\r\nBarabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!\r\n\r\nMay no bowels of mercy\r\nTo Sancho be granted,\r\nAnd thy Dulcinea\r\nBe left still enchanted,\r\nMay thy falsehood to me\r\nFind its punishment in her,\r\nFor in my land the just\r\nOften pays for the sinner.\r\nMay thy grandest adventures\r\nDiscomfitures prove,\r\nMay thy joys be all dreams,\r\nAnd forgotten thy love.\r\nBireno, \xc3\x86neas, what worse shall I call thee?\r\nBarabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!\r\n\r\nMay thy name be abhorred\r\nFor thy conduct to ladies,\r\nFrom London to England,\r\nFrom Seville to Cadiz;\r\nMay thy cards be unlucky,\r\nThy hands contain ne\xe2\x80\x99er a\r\nKing, seven, or ace\r\nWhen thou playest primera;\r\nWhen thy corns are cut\r\nMay it be to the quick;\r\nWhen thy grinders are drawn\r\nMay the roots of them stick.\r\nBireno, \xc3\x86neas, what worse shall I call thee?\r\nBarabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the while the unhappy Altisidora was bewailing herself in the above\r\nstrain Don Quixote stood staring at her; and without uttering a word in\r\nreply to her he turned round to Sancho and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho my friend, I\r\nconjure thee by the life of thy forefathers tell me the truth; say,\r\nhast thou by any chance taken the three kerchiefs and the garters this\r\nlove-sick maid speaks of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Sancho made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cThe three kerchiefs I have; but the\r\ngarters, as much as \xe2\x80\x98over the hills of \xc3\x9abeda.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duchess was amazed at Altisidora\xe2\x80\x99s assurance; she knew that she was\r\nbold, lively, and impudent, but not so much so as to venture to make\r\nfree in this fashion; and not being prepared for the joke, her\r\nastonishment was all the greater. The duke had a mind to keep up the\r\nsport, so he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt does not seem to me well done in you, sir\r\nknight, that after having received the hospitality that has been\r\noffered you in this very castle, you should have ventured to carry off\r\neven three kerchiefs, not to say my handmaid\xe2\x80\x99s garters. It shows a bad\r\nheart and does not tally with your reputation. Restore her garters, or\r\nelse I defy you to mortal combat, for I am not afraid of rascally\r\nenchanters changing or altering my features as they changed his who\r\nencountered you into those of my lacquey, Tosilos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should draw my sword against\r\nyour illustrious person from which I have received such great favours.\r\nThe kerchiefs I will restore, as Sancho says he has them; as to the\r\ngarters that is impossible, for I have not got them, neither has he;\r\nand if your handmaiden here will look in her hiding-places, depend upon\r\nit she will find them. I have never been a thief, my lord duke, nor do\r\nI mean to be so long as I live, if God cease not to have me in his\r\nkeeping. This damsel by her own confession speaks as one in love, for\r\nwhich I am not to blame, and therefore need not ask pardon, either of\r\nher or of your excellence, whom I entreat to have a better opinion of\r\nme, and once more to give me leave to pursue my journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd may God so prosper it, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nwe may always hear good news of your exploits; God speed you; for the\r\nlonger you stay, the more you inflame the hearts of the damsels who\r\nbehold you; and as for this one of mine, I will so chastise her that\r\nshe will not transgress again, either with her eyes or with her words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word and no more, O valiant Don Quixote, I ask you to hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAltisidora, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is that I beg your pardon about the theft of the\r\ngarters; for by God and upon my soul I have got them on, and I have\r\nfallen into the same blunder as he did who went looking for his ass\r\nbeing all the while mounted on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I say so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a likely one to hide thefts! Why\r\nif I wanted to deal in them, opportunities came ready enough to me in\r\nmy government.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote bowed his head, and saluted the duke and duchess and all\r\nthe bystanders, and wheeling Rocinante round, Sancho following him on\r\nDapple, he rode out of the castle, shaping his course for Saragossa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np57e.jpg (71K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\nWHICH TELLS HOW ADVENTURES CAME CROWDING ON DON QUIXOTE IN SUCH NUMBERS\r\nTHAT THEY GAVE ONE ANOTHER NO BREATHING-TIME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np58a.jpg (105K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Don Quixote saw himself in open country, free, and relieved from\r\nthe attentions of Altisidora, he felt at his ease, and in fresh spirits\r\nto take up the pursuit of chivalry once more; and turning to Sancho, he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cFreedom, Sancho, is one of the most precious gifts that heaven\r\nhas bestowed upon men; no treasures that the earth holds buried or the\r\nsea conceals can compare with it; for freedom, as for honour, life may\r\nand should be ventured; and on the other hand, captivity is the\r\ngreatest evil that can fall to the lot of man. I say this, Sancho,\r\nbecause thou hast seen the good cheer, the abundance we have enjoyed in\r\nthis castle we are leaving; well then, amid those dainty banquets and\r\nsnow-cooled beverages I felt as though I were undergoing the straits of\r\nhunger, because I did not enjoy them with the same freedom as if they\r\nhad been mine own; for the sense of being under an obligation to return\r\nbenefits and favours received is a restraint that checks the\r\nindependence of the spirit. Happy he, to whom heaven has given a piece\r\nof bread for which he is not bound to give thanks to any but heaven\r\nitself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all your worship says,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not becoming that\r\nthere should be no thanks on our part for two hundred gold crowns that\r\nthe duke\xe2\x80\x99s majordomo has given me in a little purse which I carry next\r\nmy heart, like a warming plaster or comforter, to meet any chance\r\ncalls; for we shan\xe2\x80\x99t always find castles where they\xe2\x80\x99ll entertain us;\r\nnow and then we may light upon roadside inns where they\xe2\x80\x99ll cudgel us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn conversation of this sort the knight and squire errant were pursuing\r\ntheir journey, when, after they had gone a little more than half a\r\nleague, they perceived some dozen men dressed like labourers stretched\r\nupon their cloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner.\r\nThey had beside them what seemed to be white sheets concealing some\r\nobjects under them, standing upright or lying flat, and arranged at\r\nintervals. Don Quixote approached the diners, and, saluting them\r\ncourteously first, he asked them what it was those cloths covered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d answered one of the party, \xe2\x80\x9cunder these cloths are some images\r\ncarved in relief intended for a retablo we are putting up in our\r\nvillage; we carry them covered up that they may not be soiled, and on\r\nour shoulders that they may not be broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith your good leave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see them;\r\nfor images that are carried so carefully no doubt must be fine ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think they were!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other; \xe2\x80\x9clet the money they cost\r\nspeak for that; for as a matter of fact there is not one of them that\r\ndoes not stand us in more than fifty ducats; and that your worship may\r\njudge; wait a moment, and you shall see with your own eyes;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ngetting up from his dinner he went and uncovered the first image, which\r\nproved to be one of Saint George on horseback with a serpent writhing\r\nat his feet and the lance thrust down its throat with all that\r\nfierceness that is usually depicted. The whole group was one blaze of\r\ngold, as the saying is. On seeing it Don Quixote said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat knight was\r\none of the best knights-errant the army of heaven ever owned; he was\r\ncalled Don Saint George, and he was moreover a defender of maidens. Let\r\nus see this next one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man uncovered it, and it was seen to be that of Saint Martin on his\r\nhorse, dividing his cloak with the beggar. The instant Don Quixote saw\r\nit he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis knight too was one of the Christian adventurers, but\r\nI believe he was generous rather than valiant, as thou mayest perceive,\r\nSancho, by his dividing his cloak with the beggar and giving him half\r\nof it; no doubt it was winter at the time, for otherwise he would have\r\ngiven him the whole of it, so charitable was he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not that, most likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that he held with the\r\nproverb that says, \xe2\x80\x98For giving and keeping there\xe2\x80\x99s need of brains.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote laughed, and asked them to take off the next cloth,\r\nunderneath which was seen the image of the patron saint of the Spains\r\nseated on horseback, his sword stained with blood, trampling on Moors\r\nand treading heads underfoot; and on seeing it Don Quixote exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, this is a knight, and of the squadrons of Christ! This one is\r\ncalled Don Saint James the Moorslayer, one of the bravest saints and\r\nknights the world ever had or heaven has now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey then raised another cloth which it appeared covered Saint Paul\r\nfalling from his horse, with all the details that are usually given in\r\nrepresentations of his conversion. When Don Quixote saw it, rendered in\r\nsuch lifelike style that one would have said Christ was speaking and\r\nPaul answering, \xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas in his time the greatest enemy\r\nthat the Church of God our Lord had, and the greatest champion it will\r\never have; a knight-errant in life, a steadfast saint in death, an\r\nuntiring labourer in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s vineyard, a teacher of the Gentiles,\r\nwhose school was heaven, and whose instructor and master was Jesus\r\nChrist himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were no more images, so Don Quixote bade them cover them up\r\nagain, and said to those who had brought them, \xe2\x80\x9cI take it as a happy\r\nomen, brothers, to have seen what I have; for these saints and knights\r\nwere of the same profession as myself, which is the calling of arms;\r\nonly there is this difference between them and me, that they were\r\nsaints, and fought with divine weapons, and I am a sinner and fight\r\nwith human ones. They won heaven by force of arms, for heaven suffereth\r\nviolence; and I, so far, know not what I have won by dint of my\r\nsufferings; but if my Dulcinea del Toboso were to be released from\r\nhers, perhaps with mended fortunes and a mind restored to itself I\r\nmight direct my steps in a better path than I am following at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay God hear and sin be deaf,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho to this.\r\n\r\nThe men were filled with wonder, as well at the figure as at the words\r\nof Don Quixote, though they did not understand one half of what he\r\nmeant by them. They finished their dinner, took their images on their\r\nbacks, and bidding farewell to Don Quixote resumed their journey.\r\n\r\nSancho was amazed afresh at the extent of his master\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, as\r\nmuch as if he had never known him, for it seemed to him that there was\r\nno story or event in the world that he had not at his fingers\xe2\x80\x99 ends and\r\nfixed in his memory, and he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, master mine, if\r\nthis that has happened to us to-day is to be called an adventure, it\r\nhas been one of the sweetest and pleasantest that have befallen us in\r\nthe whole course of our travels; we have come out of it unbelaboured\r\nand undismayed, neither have we drawn sword nor have we smitten the\r\nearth with our bodies, nor have we been left famishing; blessed be God\r\nthat he has let me see such a thing with my own eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou sayest well, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut remember all times\r\nare not alike nor do they always run the same way; and these things the\r\nvulgar commonly call omens, which are not based upon any natural\r\nreason, will by him who is wise be esteemed and reckoned happy\r\naccidents merely. One of these believers in omens will get up of a\r\nmorning, leave his house, and meet a friar of the order of the blessed\r\nSaint Francis, and, as if he had met a griffin, he will turn about and\r\ngo home. With another Mendoza the salt is spilt on his table, and gloom\r\nis spilt over his heart, as if nature was obliged to give warning of\r\ncoming misfortunes by means of such trivial things as these. The wise\r\nman and the Christian should not trifle with what it may please heaven\r\nto do. Scipio on coming to Africa stumbled as he leaped on shore; his\r\nsoldiers took it as a bad omen; but he, clasping the soil with his\r\narms, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Thou canst not escape me, Africa, for I hold thee\r\ntight between my arms.\xe2\x80\x99 Thus, Sancho, meeting those images has been to\r\nme a most happy occurrence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can well believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wish your worship would\r\ntell me what is the reason that the Spaniards, when they are about to\r\ngive battle, in calling on that Saint James the Moorslayer, say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Santiago and close Spain!\xe2\x80\x99 Is Spain, then, open, so that it is needful\r\nto close it; or what is the meaning of this form?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art very simple, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cGod, look you, gave\r\nthat great knight of the Red Cross to Spain as her patron saint and\r\nprotector, especially in those hard struggles the Spaniards had with\r\nthe Moors; and therefore they invoke and call upon him as their\r\ndefender in all their battles; and in these he has been many a time\r\nseen beating down, trampling under foot, destroying and slaughtering\r\nthe Hagarene squadrons in the sight of all; of which fact I could give\r\nthee many examples recorded in truthful Spanish histories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho changed the subject, and said to his master, \xe2\x80\x9cI marvel, se\xc3\xb1or,\r\nat the boldness of Altisidora, the duchess\xe2\x80\x99s handmaid; he whom they\r\ncall Love must have cruelly pierced and wounded her; they say he is a\r\nlittle blind urchin who, though blear-eyed, or more properly speaking\r\nsightless, if he aims at a heart, be it ever so small, hits it and\r\npierces it through and through with his arrows. I have heard it said\r\ntoo that the arrows of Love are blunted and robbed of their points by\r\nmaidenly modesty and reserve; but with this Altisidora it seems they\r\nare sharpened rather than blunted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBear in mind, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat love is influenced by\r\nno consideration, recognises no restraints of reason, and is of the\r\nsame nature as death, that assails alike the lofty palaces of kings and\r\nthe humble cabins of shepherds; and when it takes entire possession of\r\na heart, the first thing it does is to banish fear and shame from it;\r\nand so without shame Altisidora declared her passion, which excited in\r\nmy mind embarrassment rather than commiseration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNotable cruelty!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cunheard-of ingratitude! I can\r\nonly say for myself that the very smallest loving word of hers would\r\nhave subdued me and made a slave of me. The devil! What a heart of\r\nmarble, what bowels of brass, what a soul of mortar! But I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nimagine what it is that this damsel saw in your worship that could have\r\nconquered and captivated her so. What gallant figure was it, what bold\r\nbearing, what sprightly grace, what comeliness of feature, which of\r\nthese things by itself, or what all together, could have made her fall\r\nin love with you? For indeed and in truth many a time I stop to look at\r\nyour worship from the sole of your foot to the topmost hair of your\r\nhead, and I see more to frighten one than to make one fall in love;\r\nmoreover I have heard say that beauty is the first and main thing that\r\nexcites love, and as your worship has none at all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nthe poor creature fell in love with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecollect, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are two sorts of\r\nbeauty, one of the mind, the other of the body; that of the mind\r\ndisplays and exhibits itself in intelligence, in modesty, in honourable\r\nconduct, in generosity, in good breeding; and all these qualities are\r\npossible and may exist in an ugly man; and when it is this sort of\r\nbeauty and not that of the body that is the attraction, love is apt to\r\nspring up suddenly and violently. I, Sancho, perceive clearly enough\r\nthat I am not beautiful, but at the same time I know I am not hideous;\r\nand it is enough for an honest man not to be a monster to be an object\r\nof love, if only he possesses the endowments of mind I have mentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in this discourse they were making their way through a\r\nwood that lay beyond the road, when suddenly, without expecting\r\nanything of the kind, Don Quixote found himself caught in some nets of\r\ngreen cord stretched from one tree to another; and unable to conceive\r\nwhat it could be, he said to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho, it strikes me this affair\r\nof these nets will prove one of the strangest adventures imaginable.\r\nMay I die if the enchanters that persecute me are not trying to\r\nentangle me in them and delay my journey, by way of revenge for my\r\nobduracy towards Altisidora. Well then let me tell them that if these\r\nnets, instead of being green cord, were made of the hardest diamonds,\r\nor stronger than that wherewith the jealous god of blacksmiths enmeshed\r\nVenus and Mars, I would break them as easily as if they were made of\r\nrushes or cotton threads.\xe2\x80\x9d But just as he was about to press forward\r\nand break through all, suddenly from among some trees two shepherdesses\r\nof surpassing beauty presented themselves to his sight\xe2\x80\x94or at least\r\ndamsels dressed like shepherdesses, save that their jerkins and sayas\r\nwere of fine brocade; that is to say, the sayas were rich farthingales\r\nof gold embroidered tabby. Their hair, that in its golden brightness\r\nvied with the beams of the sun itself, fell loose upon their shoulders\r\nand was crowned with garlands twined with green laurel and red\r\neverlasting; and their years to all appearance were not under fifteen\r\nnor above eighteen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np58b.jpg (452K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the spectacle that filled Sancho with amazement, fascinated\r\nDon Quixote, made the sun halt in his course to behold them, and held\r\nall four in a strange silence. One of the shepherdesses, at length, was\r\nthe first to speak and said to Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cHold, sir knight, and do\r\nnot break these nets; for they are not spread here to do you any harm,\r\nbut only for our amusement; and as I know you will ask why they have\r\nbeen put up, and who we are, I will tell you in a few words. In a\r\nvillage some two leagues from this, where there are many people of\r\nquality and rich gentlefolk, it was agreed upon by a number of friends\r\nand relations to come with their wives, sons and daughters, neighbours,\r\nfriends and kinsmen, and make holiday in this spot, which is one of the\r\npleasantest in the whole neighbourhood, setting up a new pastoral\r\nArcadia among ourselves, we maidens dressing ourselves as shepherdesses\r\nand the youths as shepherds. We have prepared two eclogues, one by the\r\nfamous poet Garcilasso, the other by the most excellent Camoens, in its\r\nown Portuguese tongue, but we have not as yet acted them. Yesterday was\r\nthe first day of our coming here; we have a few of what they say are\r\ncalled field-tents pitched among the trees on the bank of an ample\r\nbrook that fertilises all these meadows; last night we spread these\r\nnets in the trees here to snare the silly little birds that startled by\r\nthe noise we make may fly into them. If you please to be our guest,\r\nse\xc3\xb1or, you will be welcomed heartily and courteously, for here just now\r\nneither care nor sorrow shall enter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held her peace and said no more, and Don Quixote made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cOf a\r\ntruth, fairest lady, Actaeon when he unexpectedly beheld Diana bathing\r\nin the stream could not have been more fascinated and wonderstruck than\r\nI at the sight of your beauty. I commend your mode of entertainment,\r\nand thank you for the kindness of your invitation; and if I can serve\r\nyou, you may command me with full confidence of being obeyed, for my\r\nprofession is none other than to show myself grateful, and ready to\r\nserve persons of all conditions, but especially persons of quality such\r\nas your appearance indicates; and if, instead of taking up, as they\r\nprobably do, but a small space, these nets took up the whole surface of\r\nthe globe, I would seek out new worlds through which to pass, so as not\r\nto break them; and that ye may give some degree of credence to this\r\nexaggerated language of mine, know that it is no less than Don Quixote\r\nof La Mancha that makes this declaration to you, if indeed it be that\r\nsuch a name has reached your ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! friend of my soul,\xe2\x80\x9d instantly exclaimed the other shepherdess,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat great good fortune has befallen us! Seest thou this gentleman we\r\nhave before us? Well then let me tell thee he is the most valiant and\r\nthe most devoted and the most courteous gentleman in all the world,\r\nunless a history of his achievements that has been printed and I have\r\nread is telling lies and deceiving us. I will lay a wager that this\r\ngood fellow who is with him is one Sancho Panza his squire, whose\r\ndrolleries none can equal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI am that same droll and squire you speak\r\nof, and this gentleman is my master Don Quixote of La Mancha, the same\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s in the history and that they talk about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9clet us entreat him to stay; for it\r\nwill give our fathers and brothers infinite pleasure; I too have heard\r\njust what thou hast told me of the valour of the one and the drolleries\r\nof the other; and what is more, of him they say that he is the most\r\nconstant and loyal lover that was ever heard of, and that his lady is\r\none Dulcinea del Toboso, to whom all over Spain the palm of beauty is\r\nawarded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd justly awarded,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cunless, indeed, your\r\nunequalled beauty makes it a matter of doubt. But spare yourselves the\r\ntrouble, ladies, of pressing me to stay, for the urgent calls of my\r\nprofession do not allow me to take rest under any circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this instant there came up to the spot where the four stood a\r\nbrother of one of the two shepherdesses, like them in shepherd costume,\r\nand as richly and gaily dressed as they were. They told him that their\r\ncompanion was the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, and the other\r\nSancho his squire, of whom he knew already from having read their\r\nhistory. The gay shepherd offered him his services and begged that he\r\nwould accompany him to their tents, and Don Quixote had to give way and\r\ncomply. And now the game was started, and the nets were filled with a\r\nvariety of birds that deceived by the colour fell into the danger they\r\nwere flying from. Upwards of thirty persons, all gaily attired as\r\nshepherds and shepherdesses, assembled on the spot, and were at once\r\ninformed who Don Quixote and his squire were, whereat they were not a\r\nlittle delighted, as they knew of him already through his history. They\r\nrepaired to the tents, where they found tables laid out, and choicely,\r\nplentifully, and neatly furnished. They treated Don Quixote as a person\r\nof distinction, giving him the place of honour, and all observed him,\r\nand were full of astonishment at the spectacle. At last the cloth being\r\nremoved, Don Quixote with great composure lifted up his voice and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the greatest sins that men are guilty of is\xe2\x80\x94some will say\r\npride\xe2\x80\x94but I say ingratitude, going by the common saying that hell is\r\nfull of ingrates. This sin, so far as it has lain in my power, I have\r\nendeavoured to avoid ever since I have enjoyed the faculty of reason;\r\nand if I am unable to requite good deeds that have been done me by\r\nother deeds, I substitute the desire to do so; and if that be not\r\nenough I make them known publicly; for he who declares and makes known\r\nthe good deeds done to him would repay them by others if it were in his\r\npower, and for the most part those who receive are the inferiors of\r\nthose who give. Thus, God is superior to all because he is the supreme\r\ngiver, and the offerings of man fall short by an infinite distance of\r\nbeing a full return for the gifts of God; but gratitude in some degree\r\nmakes up for this deficiency and shortcoming. I therefore, grateful for\r\nthe favour that has been extended to me here, and unable to make a\r\nreturn in the same measure, restricted as I am by the narrow limits of\r\nmy power, offer what I can and what I have to offer in my own way; and\r\nso I declare that for two full days I will maintain in the middle of\r\nthis highway leading to Saragossa, that these ladies disguised as\r\nshepherdesses, who are here present, are the fairest and most courteous\r\nmaidens in the world, excepting only the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso,\r\nsole mistress of my thoughts, be it said without offence to those who\r\nhear me, ladies and gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this Sancho, who had been listening with great attention,\r\ncried out in a loud voice, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible there is anyone in the world\r\nwho will dare to say and swear that this master of mine is a madman?\r\nSay, gentlemen shepherds, is there a village priest, be he ever so wise\r\nor learned, who could say what my master has said; or is there\r\nknight-errant, whatever renown he may have as a man of valour, that\r\ncould offer what my master has offered now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote turned upon Sancho, and with a countenance glowing with\r\nanger said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible, Sancho, there is anyone in the\r\nwhole world who will say thou art not a fool, with a lining to match,\r\nand I know not what trimmings of impertinence and roguery? Who asked\r\nthee to meddle in my affairs, or to inquire whether I am a wise man or\r\na blockhead? Hold thy peace; answer me not a word; saddle Rocinante if\r\nhe be unsaddled; and let us go to put my offer into execution; for with\r\nthe right that I have on my side thou mayest reckon as vanquished all\r\nwho shall venture to question it;\xe2\x80\x9d and in a great rage, and showing his\r\nanger plainly, he rose from his seat, leaving the company lost in\r\nwonder, and making them feel doubtful whether they ought to regard him\r\nas a madman or a rational being. In the end, though they sought to\r\ndissuade him from involving himself in such a challenge, assuring him\r\nthey admitted his gratitude as fully established, and needed no fresh\r\nproofs to be convinced of his valiant spirit, as those related in the\r\nhistory of his exploits were sufficient, still Don Quixote persisted in\r\nhis resolve; and mounted on Rocinante, bracing his buckler on his arm\r\nand grasping his lance, he posted himself in the middle of a high road\r\nthat was not far from the green meadow. Sancho followed on Dapple,\r\ntogether with all the members of the pastoral gathering, eager to see\r\nwhat would be the upshot of his vainglorious and extraordinary\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote, then, having, as has been said, planted himself in the\r\nmiddle of the road, made the welkin ring with words to this effect: \xe2\x80\x9cHo\r\nye travellers and wayfarers, knights, squires, folk on foot or on\r\nhorseback, who pass this way or shall pass in the course of the next\r\ntwo days! Know that Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant, is posted\r\nhere to maintain by arms that the beauty and courtesy enshrined in the\r\nnymphs that dwell in these meadows and groves surpass all upon earth,\r\nputting aside the lady of my heart, Dulcinea del Toboso. Wherefore, let\r\nhim who is of the opposite opinion come on, for here I await him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwice he repeated the same words, and twice they fell unheard by any\r\nadventurer; but fate, that was guiding affairs for him from better to\r\nbetter, so ordered it that shortly afterwards there appeared on the\r\nroad a crowd of men on horseback, many of them with lances in their\r\nhands, all riding in a compact body and in great haste. No sooner had\r\nthose who were with Don Quixote seen them than they turned about and\r\nwithdrew to some distance from the road, for they knew that if they\r\nstayed some harm might come to them; but Don Quixote with intrepid\r\nheart stood his ground, and Sancho Panza shielded himself with\r\nRocinante\xe2\x80\x99s hind-quarters. The troop of lancers came up, and one of\r\nthem who was in advance began shouting to Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cGet out of the\r\nway, you son of the devil, or these bulls will knock you to pieces!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRabble!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI care nothing for bulls, be they the\r\nfiercest Jarama breeds on its banks. Confess at once, scoundrels, that\r\nwhat I have declared is true; else ye have to deal with me in combat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe herdsman had no time to reply, nor Don Quixote to get out of the\r\nway even if he wished; and so the drove of fierce bulls and tame\r\nbullocks, together with the crowd of herdsmen and others who were\r\ntaking them to be penned up in a village where they were to be run the\r\nnext day, passed over Don Quixote and over Sancho, Rocinante and\r\nDapple, hurling them all to the earth and rolling them over on the\r\nground. Sancho was left crushed, Don Quixote scared, Dapple belaboured\r\nand Rocinante in no very sound condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np58c.jpg (399K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey all got up, however, at length, and Don Quixote in great haste,\r\nstumbling here and falling there, started off running after the drove,\r\nshouting out, \xe2\x80\x9cHold! stay! ye rascally rabble, a single knight awaits\r\nyou, and he is not of the temper or opinion of those who say, \xe2\x80\x98For a\r\nflying enemy make a bridge of silver.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The retreating party in their\r\nhaste, however, did not stop for that, or heed his menaces any more\r\nthan last year\xe2\x80\x99s clouds. Weariness brought Don Quixote to a halt, and\r\nmore enraged than avenged he sat down on the road to wait until Sancho,\r\nRocinante and Dapple came up. When they reached him master and man\r\nmounted once more, and without going back to bid farewell to the mock\r\nor imitation Arcadia, and more in humiliation than contentment, they\r\ncontinued their journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np58e.jpg (68K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE STRANGE THING, WHICH MAY BE REGARDED AS AN\r\nADVENTURE, THAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np59a.jpg (126K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA clear limpid spring which they discovered in a cool grove relieved\r\nDon Quixote and Sancho of the dust and fatigue due to the unpolite\r\nbehaviour of the bulls, and by the side of this, having turned Dapple\r\nand Rocinante loose without headstall or bridle, the forlorn pair,\r\nmaster and man, seated themselves. Sancho had recourse to the larder of\r\nhis alforjas and took out of them what he called the prog; Don Quixote\r\nrinsed his mouth and bathed his face, by which cooling process his\r\nflagging energies were revived. Out of pure vexation he remained\r\nwithout eating, and out of pure politeness Sancho did not venture to\r\ntouch a morsel of what was before him, but waited for his master to act\r\nas taster. Seeing, however, that, absorbed in thought, he was\r\nforgetting to carry the bread to his mouth, he said never a word, and\r\ntrampling every sort of good breeding under foot, began to stow away in\r\nhis paunch the bread and cheese that came to his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np59b.jpg (370K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEat, Sancho my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9csupport life, which is of\r\nmore consequence to thee than to me, and leave me to die under the pain\r\nof my thoughts and pressure of my misfortunes. I was born, Sancho, to\r\nlive dying, and thou to die eating; and to prove the truth of what I\r\nsay, look at me, printed in histories, famed in arms, courteous in\r\nbehaviour, honoured by princes, courted by maidens; and after all, when\r\nI looked forward to palms, triumphs, and crowns, won and earned by my\r\nvaliant deeds, I have this morning seen myself trampled on, kicked, and\r\ncrushed by the feet of unclean and filthy animals. This thought blunts\r\nmy teeth, paralyses my jaws, cramps my hands, and robs me of all\r\nappetite for food; so much so that I have a mind to let myself die of\r\nhunger, the cruelest death of all deaths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, munching hard all the time, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship does\r\nnot agree with the proverb that says, \xe2\x80\x98Let Martha die, but let her die\r\nwith a full belly.\xe2\x80\x99 I, at any rate, have no mind to kill myself; so far\r\nfrom that, I mean to do as the cobbler does, who stretches the leather\r\nwith his teeth until he makes it reach as far as he wants. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stretch\r\nout my life by eating until it reaches the end heaven has fixed for it;\r\nand let me tell you, se\xc3\xb1or, there\xe2\x80\x99s no greater folly than to think of\r\ndying of despair as your worship does; take my advice, and after eating\r\nlie down and sleep a bit on this green grass-mattress, and you will see\r\nthat when you awake you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel something better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote did as he recommended, for it struck him that Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreasoning was more like a philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s than a blockhead\xe2\x80\x99s, and said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho, if thou wilt do for me what I am going to tell thee my\r\nease of mind would be more assured and my heaviness of heart not so\r\ngreat; and it is this; to go aside a little while I am sleeping in\r\naccordance with thy advice, and, making bare thy carcase to the air, to\r\ngive thyself three or four hundred lashes with Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s reins, on\r\naccount of the three thousand and odd thou art to give thyself for the\r\ndisenchantment of Dulcinea; for it is a great pity that the poor lady\r\nshould be left enchanted through thy carelessness and negligence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a good deal to be said on that point,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9clet us\r\nboth go to sleep now, and after that, God has decreed what will happen.\r\nLet me tell your worship that for a man to whip himself in cold blood\r\nis a hard thing, especially if the stripes fall upon an ill-nourished\r\nand worse-fed body. Let my lady Dulcinea have patience, and when she is\r\nleast expecting it, she will see me made a riddle of with whipping, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x98until death it\xe2\x80\x99s all life;\xe2\x80\x99 I mean that I have still life in me, and\r\nthe desire to make good what I have promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote thanked him, and ate a little, and Sancho a good deal, and\r\nthen they both lay down to sleep, leaving those two inseparable friends\r\nand comrades, Rocinante and Dapple, to their own devices and to feed\r\nunrestrained upon the abundant grass with which the meadow was\r\nfurnished. They woke up rather late, mounted once more and resumed\r\ntheir journey, pushing on to reach an inn which was in sight,\r\napparently a league off. I say an inn, because Don Quixote called it\r\nso, contrary to his usual practice of calling all inns castles. They\r\nreached it, and asked the landlord if they could put up there. He said\r\nyes, with as much comfort and as good fare as they could find in\r\nSaragossa. They dismounted, and Sancho stowed away his larder in a room\r\nof which the landlord gave him the key. He took the beasts to the\r\nstable, fed them, and came back to see what orders Don Quixote, who was\r\nseated on a bench at the door, had for him, giving special thanks to\r\nheaven that this inn had not been taken for a castle by his master.\r\nSupper-time came, and they repaired to their room, and Sancho asked the\r\nlandlord what he had to give them for supper. To this the landlord\r\nreplied that his mouth should be the measure; he had only to ask what\r\nhe would; for that inn was provided with the birds of the air and the\r\nfowls of the earth and the fish of the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no need of all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cif they\xe2\x80\x99ll roast us a\r\ncouple of chickens we\xe2\x80\x99ll be satisfied, for my master is delicate and\r\neats little, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not over and above gluttonous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord replied he had no chickens, for the kites had stolen them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9clet se\xc3\xb1or landlord tell them to roast a\r\npullet, so that it is a tender one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPullet! My father!\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord; \xe2\x80\x9cindeed and in truth it\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nyesterday I sent over fifty to the city to sell; but saving pullets ask\r\nwhat you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will not be without veal or kid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s none in the house, for it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nfinished; but next week there will be enough and to spare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch good that does us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll lay a bet that all these\r\nshort-comings are going to wind up in plenty of bacon and eggs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, \xe2\x80\x9cmy guest\xe2\x80\x99s wits must be precious dull; I\r\ntell him I have neither pullets nor hens, and he wants me to have eggs!\r\nTalk of other dainties, if you please, and don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for hens again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBody o\xe2\x80\x99 me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s settle the matter; say at once what\r\nyou have got, and let us have no more words about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth and earnest, se\xc3\xb1or guest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, \xe2\x80\x9call I have is\r\na couple of cow-heels like calves\xe2\x80\x99 feet, or a couple of calves\xe2\x80\x99 feet\r\nlike cowheels; they are boiled with chick-peas, onions, and bacon, and\r\nat this moment they are crying \xe2\x80\x98Come eat me, come eat me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mark them for mine on the spot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9clet nobody touch\r\nthem; I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay better for them than anyone else, for I could not wish\r\nfor anything more to my taste; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a pin whether they are\r\nfeet or heels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody shall touch them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord; \xe2\x80\x9cfor the other guests I\r\nhave, being persons of high quality, bring their own cook and caterer\r\nand larder with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you come to people of quality,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody more\r\nso than my master; but the calling he follows does not allow of larders\r\nor store-rooms; we lay ourselves down in the middle of a meadow, and\r\nfill ourselves with acorns or medlars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere ended Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with the landlord, Sancho not caring\r\nto carry it any farther by answering him; for he had already asked him\r\nwhat calling or what profession it was his master was of.\r\n\r\nSupper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room,\r\nthe landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself\r\ndown to sup very resolutely. It seems that in another room, which was\r\nnext to Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s, with nothing but a thin partition to separate\r\nit, he overheard these words, \xe2\x80\x9cAs you live, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Jeronimo, while\r\nthey are bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the Second\r\nPart of \xe2\x80\x98Don Quixote of La Mancha.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe instant Don Quixote heard his own name he started to his feet and\r\nlistened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heard\r\nthe Don Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would you\r\nhave us read that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible for\r\nanyone who has read the First Part of the history of \xe2\x80\x98Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha\xe2\x80\x99 to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he who was addressed as Don Juan, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall do\r\nwell to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something good\r\nin it. What displeases me most in it is that it represents Don Quixote\r\nas now cured of his love for Dulcinea del Toboso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up\r\nhis voice and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever he may be who says that Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha has forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teach\r\nhim with equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for\r\nneither can the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor can\r\nforgetfulness have a place in Don Quixote; his motto is constancy, and\r\nhis profession to maintain the same with his life and never wrong it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this that answers us?\xe2\x80\x9d said they in the next room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho should it be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut Don Quixote of La Mancha himself,\r\nwho will make good all he has said and all he will say; for pledges\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble a good payer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such they\r\nseemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his arms\r\nround Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s neck, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cYour appearance cannot leave\r\nany question as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify your\r\nappearance; unquestionably, se\xc3\xb1or, you are the real Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha, cynosure and morning star of knight-errantry, despite and in\r\ndefiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught\r\nyour achievements, as the author of this book which I here present to\r\nyou has done;\xe2\x80\x9d and with this he put a book which his companion carried\r\ninto the hands of Don Quixote, who took it, and without replying began\r\nto run his eye over it; but he presently returned it saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the\r\nlittle I have seen I have discovered three things in this author that\r\ndeserve to be censured. The first is some words that I have read in the\r\npreface; the next that the language is Aragonese, for sometimes he\r\nwrites without articles; and the third, which above all stamps him as\r\nignorant, is that he goes wrong and departs from the truth in the most\r\nimportant part of the history, for here he says that my squire Sancho\r\nPanza\xe2\x80\x99s wife is called Mari Gutierrez, when she is called nothing of\r\nthe sort, but Teresa Panza; and when a man errs on such an important\r\npoint as this there is good reason to fear that he is in error on every\r\nother point in the history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice sort of historian, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sancho at this; \xe2\x80\x9che must\r\nknow a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife Teresa Panza, Mari\r\nGutierrez; take the book again, se\xc3\xb1or, and see if I am in it and if he\r\nhas changed my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom your talk, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Jeronimo, \xe2\x80\x9cno doubt you are Sancho\r\nPanza, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s squire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cthis new author does not handle you\r\nwith the decency that displays itself in your person; he makes you out\r\na heavy feeder and a fool, and not in the least droll, and a very\r\ndifferent being from the Sancho described in the First Part of your\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9che might have left me in my corner\r\nwithout troubling his head about me; \xe2\x80\x98let him who knows how ring the\r\nbells; \xe2\x80\x98Saint Peter is very well in Rome.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen pressed Don Quixote to come into their room and have\r\nsupper with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn\r\nfit for one of his sort. Don Quixote, who was always polite, yielded to\r\ntheir request and supped with them. Sancho stayed behind with the stew.\r\nand invested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at the\r\nhead of the table, and the landlord sat down with him, for he was no\r\nless fond of cow-heel and calves\xe2\x80\x99 feet than Sancho was.\r\n\r\nWhile at supper Don Juan asked Don Quixote what news he had of the lady\r\nDulcinea del Toboso, was she married, had she been brought to bed, or\r\nwas she with child, or did she in maidenhood, still preserving her\r\nmodesty and delicacy, cherish the remembrance of the tender passion of\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote?\r\n\r\nTo this he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cDulcinea is a maiden still, and my passion more\r\nfirmly rooted than ever, our intercourse unsatisfactory as before, and\r\nher beauty transformed into that of a foul country wench;\xe2\x80\x9d and then he\r\nproceeded to give them a full and particular account of the enchantment\r\nof Dulcinea, and of what had happened him in the cave of Montesinos,\r\ntogether with what the sage Merlin had prescribed for her\r\ndisenchantment, namely the scourging of Sancho.\r\n\r\nExceedingly great was the amusement the two gentlemen derived from\r\nhearing Don Quixote recount the strange incidents of his history; and\r\nif they were amazed by his absurdities they were equally amazed by the\r\nelegant style in which he delivered them. On the one hand they regarded\r\nhim as a man of wit and sense, and on the other he seemed to them a\r\nmaundering blockhead, and they could not make up their minds\r\nwhereabouts between wisdom and folly they ought to place him.\r\n\r\nSancho having finished his supper, and left the landlord in the X\r\ncondition, repaired to the room where his master was, and as he came in\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cMay I die, sirs, if the author of this book your worships have\r\ngot has any mind that we should agree; as he calls me glutton\r\n(according to what your worships say) I wish he may not call me\r\ndrunkard too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Jeronimo; \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot remember, however, in what\r\nway, though I know his words are offensive, and what is more, lying, as\r\nI can see plainly by the physiognomy of the worthy Sancho before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Sancho and the Don Quixote of this\r\nhistory must be different persons from those that appear in the one\r\nCide Hamete Benengeli wrote, who are ourselves; my master valiant,\r\nwise, and true in love, and I simple, droll, and neither glutton nor\r\ndrunkard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Juan; \xe2\x80\x9cand were it possible, an order should\r\nbe issued that no one should have the presumption to deal with anything\r\nrelating to Don Quixote, save his original author Cide Hamete; just as\r\nAlexander commanded that no one should presume to paint his portrait\r\nsave Apelles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np60b.jpg (336K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him who will paint me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut let him not abuse\r\nme; for patience will often break down when they heap insults upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone can be offered to Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Juan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he\r\nhimself will not be able to avenge, if he does not ward it off with the\r\nshield of his patience, which, I take it, is great and strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the night passed in conversation of this\r\nsort, and though Don Juan wished Don Quixote to read more of the book\r\nto see what it was all about, he was not to be prevailed upon, saying\r\nthat he treated it as read and pronounced it utterly silly; and, if by\r\nany chance it should come to its author\xe2\x80\x99s ears that he had it in his\r\nhand, he did not want him to flatter himself with the idea that he had\r\nread it; for our thoughts, and still more our eyes, should keep\r\nthemselves aloof from what is obscene and filthy.\r\n\r\nThey asked him whither he meant to direct his steps. He replied, to\r\nSaragossa, to take part in the harness jousts which were held in that\r\ncity every year. Don Juan told him that the new history described how\r\nDon Quixote, let him be who he might, took part there in a tilting at\r\nthe ring, utterly devoid of invention, poor in mottoes, very poor in\r\ncostume, though rich in sillinesses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor that very reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not set foot in\r\nSaragossa; and by that means I shall expose to the world the lie of\r\nthis new history writer, and people will see that I am not the Don\r\nQuixote he speaks of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Jeronimo; \xe2\x80\x9cand there are other\r\njousts at Barcelona in which Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote may display his\r\nprowess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I mean to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand as it is now time,\r\nI pray your worships to give me leave to retire to bed, and to place\r\nand retain me among the number of your greatest friends and servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cmaybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll be good for something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this they exchanged farewells, and Don Quixote and Sancho retired\r\nto their room, leaving Don Juan and Don Jeronimo amazed to see the\r\nmedley he made of his good sense and his craziness; and they felt\r\nthoroughly convinced that these, and not those their Aragonese author\r\ndescribed, were the genuine Don Quixote and Sancho. Don Quixote rose\r\nbetimes, and bade adieu to his hosts by knocking at the partition of\r\nthe other room. Sancho paid the landlord magnificently, and recommended\r\nhim either to say less about the providing of his inn or to keep it\r\nbetter provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np59e.jpg (48K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\nOF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE ON HIS WAY TO BARCELONA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np60a.jpg (129K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a fresh morning giving promise of a cool day as Don Quixote\r\nquitted the inn, first of all taking care to ascertain the most direct\r\nroad to Barcelona without touching upon Saragossa; so anxious was he to\r\nmake out this new historian, who they said abused him so, to be a liar.\r\nWell, as it fell out, nothing worthy of being recorded happened him for\r\nsix days, at the end of which, having turned aside out of the road, he\r\nwas overtaken by night in a thicket of oak or cork trees; for on this\r\npoint Cide Hamete is not as precise as he usually is on other matters.\r\n\r\nMaster and man dismounted from their beasts, and as soon as they had\r\nsettled themselves at the foot of the trees, Sancho, who had had a good\r\nnoontide meal that day, let himself, without more ado, pass the gates\r\nof sleep. But Don Quixote, whom his thoughts, far more than hunger,\r\nkept awake, could not close an eye, and roamed in fancy to and fro\r\nthrough all sorts of places. At one moment it seemed to him that he was\r\nin the cave of Montesinos and saw Dulcinea, transformed into a country\r\nwench, skipping and mounting upon her she-ass; again that the words of\r\nthe sage Merlin were sounding in his ears, setting forth the conditions\r\nto be observed and the exertions to be made for the disenchantment of\r\nDulcinea. He lost all patience when he considered the laziness and want\r\nof charity of his squire Sancho; for to the best of his belief he had\r\nonly given himself five lashes, a number paltry and disproportioned to\r\nthe vast number required. At this thought he felt such vexation and\r\nanger that he reasoned the matter thus: \xe2\x80\x9cIf Alexander the Great cut the\r\nGordian knot, saying, \xe2\x80\x98To cut comes to the same thing as to untie,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nyet did not fail to become lord paramount of all Asia, neither more nor\r\nless could happen now in Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s disenchantment if I scourge Sancho\r\nagainst his will; for, if it is the condition of the remedy that Sancho\r\nshall receive three thousand and odd lashes, what does it matter to me\r\nwhether he inflicts them himself, or someone else inflicts them, when\r\nthe essential point is that he receives them, let them come from\r\nwhatever quarter they may?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this idea he went over to Sancho, having first taken Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreins and arranged them so as to be able to flog him with them, and\r\nbegan to untie the points (the common belief is he had but one in\r\nfront) by which his breeches were held up; but the instant he\r\napproached him Sancho woke up in his full senses and cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nis this? Who is touching me and untrussing me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand I come to make good thy shortcomings\r\nand relieve my own distresses; I come to whip thee, Sancho, and wipe\r\noff some portion of the debt thou hast undertaken. Dulcinea is\r\nperishing, thou art living on regardless, I am dying of hope deferred;\r\ntherefore untruss thyself with a good will, for mine it is, here, in\r\nthis retired spot, to give thee at least two thousand lashes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9clet your worship keep quiet, or else\r\nby the living God the deaf shall hear us; the lashes I pledged myself\r\nto must be voluntary and not forced upon me, and just now I have no\r\nfancy to whip myself; it is enough if I give you my word to flog and\r\nflap myself when I have a mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not do to leave it to thy courtesy, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor thou art hard of heart and, though a clown, tender of flesh;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nat the same time he strove and struggled to untie him.\r\n\r\nSeeing this Sancho got up, and grappling with his master he gripped him\r\nwith all his might in his arms, giving him a trip with the heel\r\nstretched him on the ground on his back, and pressing his right knee on\r\nhis chest held his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow now, traitor!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Don Quixote. \xe2\x80\x9cDost thou revolt against\r\nthy master and natural lord? Dost thou rise against him who gives thee\r\nhis bread?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI neither put down king, nor set up king,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI only stand\r\nup for myself who am my own lord; if your worship promises me to be\r\nquiet, and not to offer to whip me now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you go free and\r\nunhindered; if not\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nTraitor and Do\xc3\xb1a Sancha\xe2\x80\x99s foe,\r\nThou diest on the spot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote gave his promise, and swore by the life of his thoughts not\r\nto touch so much as a hair of his garments, and to leave him entirely\r\nfree and to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he pleased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np60c.jpg (250K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSancho rose and removed some distance from the spot, but as he was\r\nabout to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something\r\ntouch his head, and putting up his hands encountered somebody\xe2\x80\x99s two\r\nfeet with shoes and stockings on them. He trembled with fear and made\r\nfor another tree, where the very same thing happened to him, and he\r\nfell a-shouting, calling upon Don Quixote to come and protect him. Don\r\nQuixote did so, and asked him what had happened to him, and what he was\r\nafraid of. Sancho replied that all the trees were full of men\xe2\x80\x99s feet\r\nand legs. Don Quixote felt them, and guessed at once what it was, and\r\nsaid to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cThou hast nothing to be afraid of, for these feet and\r\nlegs that thou feelest but canst not see belong no doubt to some\r\noutlaws and freebooters that have been hanged on these trees; for the\r\nauthorities in these parts are wont to hang them up by twenties and\r\nthirties when they catch them; whereby I conjecture that I must be near\r\nBarcelona;\xe2\x80\x9d and it was, in fact, as he supposed; with the first light\r\nthey looked up and saw that the fruit hanging on those trees were\r\nfreebooters\xe2\x80\x99 bodies.\r\n\r\nAnd now day dawned; and if the dead freebooters had scared them, their\r\nhearts were no less troubled by upwards of forty living ones, who all\r\nof a sudden surrounded them, and in the Catalan tongue bade them stand\r\nand wait until their captain came up. Don Quixote was on foot with his\r\nhorse unbridled and his lance leaning against a tree, and in short\r\ncompletely defenceless; he thought it best therefore to fold his arms\r\nand bow his head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion and\r\nopportunity. The robbers made haste to search Dapple, and did not leave\r\nhim a single thing of all he carried in the alforjas and in the valise;\r\nand lucky it was for Sancho that the duke\xe2\x80\x99s crowns and those he brought\r\nfrom home were in a girdle that he wore round him; but for all that\r\nthese good folk would have stripped him, and even looked to see what he\r\nhad hidden between the skin and flesh, but for the arrival at that\r\nmoment of their captain, who was about thirty-four years of age\r\napparently, strongly built, above the middle height, of stern aspect\r\nand swarthy complexion. He was mounted upon a powerful horse, and had\r\non a coat of mail, with four of the pistols they call petronels in that\r\ncountry at his waist. He saw that his squires (for so they call those\r\nwho follow that trade) were about to rifle Sancho Panza, but he ordered\r\nthem to desist and was at once obeyed, so the girdle escaped. He\r\nwondered to see the lance leaning against the tree, the shield on the\r\nground, and Don Quixote in armour and dejected, with the saddest and\r\nmost melancholy face that sadness itself could produce; and going up to\r\nhim he said, \xe2\x80\x9cBe not so cast down, good man, for you have not fallen\r\ninto the hands of any inhuman Busiris, but into Roque Guinart\xe2\x80\x99s, which\r\nare more merciful than cruel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cause of my dejection,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cis not that I have\r\nfallen into thy hands, O valiant Roque, whose fame is bounded by no\r\nlimits on earth, but that my carelessness should have been so great\r\nthat thy soldiers should have caught me unbridled, when it is my duty,\r\naccording to the rule of knight-errantry which I profess, to be always\r\non the alert and at all times my own sentinel; for let me tell thee,\r\ngreat Roque, had they found me on my horse, with my lance and shield,\r\nit would not have been very easy for them to reduce me to submission,\r\nfor I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, he who hath filled the whole world\r\nwith his achievements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoque Guinart at once perceived that Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s weakness was more\r\nakin to madness than to swagger; and though he had sometimes heard him\r\nspoken of, he never regarded the things attributed to him as true, nor\r\ncould he persuade himself that such a humour could become dominant in\r\nthe heart of man; he was extremely glad, therefore, to meet him and\r\ntest at close quarters what he had heard of him at a distance; so he\r\nsaid to him, \xe2\x80\x9cDespair not, valiant knight, nor regard as an untoward\r\nfate the position in which thou findest thyself; it may be that by\r\nthese slips thy crooked fortune will make itself straight; for heaven\r\nby strange circuitous ways, mysterious and incomprehensible to man,\r\nraises up the fallen and makes rich the poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was about to thank him, when they heard behind them a noise\r\nas of a troop of horses; there was, however, but one, riding on which\r\nat a furious pace came a youth, apparently about twenty years of age,\r\nclad in green damask edged with gold and breeches and a loose frock,\r\nwith a hat looped up in the Walloon fashion, tight-fitting polished\r\nboots, gilt spurs, dagger and sword, and in his hand a musketoon, and a\r\npair of pistols at his waist.\r\n\r\nRoque turned round at the noise and perceived this comely figure, which\r\ndrawing near thus addressed him, \xe2\x80\x9cI came in quest of thee, valiant\r\nRoque, to find in thee if not a remedy at least relief in my\r\nmisfortune; and not to keep thee in suspense, for I see thou dost not\r\nrecognise me, I will tell thee who I am; I am Claudia Jeronima, the\r\ndaughter of Simon Forte, thy good friend, and special enemy of Clauquel\r\nTorrellas, who is thine also as being of the faction opposed to thee.\r\nThou knowest that this Torrellas has a son who is called, or at least\r\nwas not two hours since, Don Vicente Torrellas. Well, to cut short the\r\ntale of my misfortune, I will tell thee in a few words what this youth\r\nhas brought upon me. He saw me, he paid court to me, I listened to him,\r\nand, unknown to my father, I loved him; for there is no woman, however\r\nsecluded she may live or close she may be kept, who will not have\r\nopportunities and to spare for following her headlong impulses. In a\r\nword, he pledged himself to be mine, and I promised to be his, without\r\ncarrying matters any further. Yesterday I learned that, forgetful of\r\nhis pledge to me, he was about to marry another, and that he was to go\r\nthis morning to plight his troth, intelligence which overwhelmed and\r\nexasperated me; my father not being at home I was able to adopt this\r\ncostume you see, and urging my horse to speed I overtook Don Vicente\r\nabout a league from this, and without waiting to utter reproaches or\r\nhear excuses I fired this musket at him, and these two pistols besides,\r\nand to the best of my belief I must have lodged more than two bullets\r\nin his body, opening doors to let my honour go free, enveloped in his\r\nblood. I left him there in the hands of his servants, who did not dare\r\nand were not able to interfere in his defence, and I come to seek from\r\nthee a safe-conduct into France, where I have relatives with whom I can\r\nlive; and also to implore thee to protect my father, so that Don\r\nVicente\xe2\x80\x99s numerous kinsmen may not venture to wreak their lawless\r\nvengeance upon him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoque, filled with admiration at the gallant bearing, high spirit,\r\ncomely figure, and adventure of the fair Claudia, said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nse\xc3\xb1ora, let us go and see if thy enemy is dead; and then we will\r\nconsider what will be best for thee.\xe2\x80\x9d Don Quixote, who had been\r\nlistening to what Claudia said and Roque Guinart said in reply to her,\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cNobody need trouble himself with the defence of this lady,\r\nfor I take it upon myself. Give me my horse and arms, and wait for me\r\nhere; I will go in quest of this knight, and dead or alive I will make\r\nhim keep his word plighted to so great beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody need have any doubt about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor my master\r\nhas a very happy knack of matchmaking; it\xe2\x80\x99s not many days since he\r\nforced another man to marry, who in the same way backed out of his\r\npromise to another maiden; and if it had not been for his persecutors\r\nthe enchanters changing the man\xe2\x80\x99s proper shape into a lacquey\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nsaid maiden would not be one this minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoque, who was paying more attention to the fair Claudia\xe2\x80\x99s adventure\r\nthan to the words of master or man, did not hear them; and ordering his\r\nsquires to restore to Sancho everything they had stripped Dapple of, he\r\ndirected them to return to the place where they had been quartered\r\nduring the night, and then set off with Claudia at full speed in search\r\nof the wounded or slain Don Vicente. They reached the spot where\r\nClaudia met him, but found nothing there save freshly spilt blood;\r\nlooking all round, however, they descried some people on the slope of a\r\nhill above them, and concluded, as indeed it proved to be, that it was\r\nDon Vicente, whom either dead or alive his servants were removing to\r\nattend to his wounds or to bury him. They made haste to overtake them,\r\nwhich, as the party moved slowly, they were able to do with ease. They\r\nfound Don Vicente in the arms of his servants, whom he was entreating\r\nin a broken feeble voice to leave him there to die, as the pain of his\r\nwounds would not suffer him to go any farther. Claudia and Roque threw\r\nthemselves off their horses and advanced towards him; the servants were\r\noverawed by the appearance of Roque, and Claudia was moved by the sight\r\nof Don Vicente, and going up to him half tenderly half sternly, she\r\nseized his hand and said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cHadst thou given me this according to\r\nour compact thou hadst never come to this pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wounded gentleman opened his all but closed eyes, and recognising\r\nClaudia said, \xe2\x80\x9cI see clearly, fair and mistaken lady, that it is thou\r\nthat hast slain me, a punishment not merited or deserved by my feelings\r\ntowards thee, for never did I mean to, nor could I, wrong thee in\r\nthought or deed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not true, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Claudia, \xe2\x80\x9cthat thou wert going this\r\nmorning to marry Leonora the daughter of the rich Balvastro?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Vicente; \xe2\x80\x9cmy cruel fortune must have\r\ncarried those tidings to thee to drive thee in thy jealousy to take my\r\nlife; and to assure thyself of this, press my hands and take me for thy\r\nhusband if thou wilt; I have no better satisfaction to offer thee for\r\nthe wrong thou fanciest thou hast received from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClaudia wrung his hands, and her own heart was so wrung that she lay\r\nfainting on the bleeding breast of Don Vicente, whom a death spasm\r\nseized the same instant. Roque was in perplexity and knew not what to\r\ndo; the servants ran to fetch water to sprinkle their faces, and\r\nbrought some and bathed them with it. Claudia recovered from her\r\nfainting fit, but not so Don Vicente from the paroxysm that had\r\novertaken him, for his life had come to an end. On perceiving this,\r\nClaudia, when she had convinced herself that her beloved husband was no\r\nmore, rent the air with her sighs and made the heavens ring with her\r\nlamentations; she tore her hair and scattered it to the winds, she beat\r\nher face with her hands and showed all the signs of grief and sorrow\r\nthat could be conceived to come from an afflicted heart. \xe2\x80\x9cCruel,\r\nreckless woman!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9chow easily wert thou moved to carry out a\r\nthought so wicked! O furious force of jealousy, to what desperate\r\nlengths dost thou lead those that give thee lodging in their bosoms! O\r\nhusband, whose unhappy fate in being mine hath borne thee from the\r\nmarriage bed to the grave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo vehement and so piteous were the lamentations of Claudia that they\r\ndrew tears from Roque\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, unused as they were to shed them on any\r\noccasion. The servants wept, Claudia swooned away again and again, and\r\nthe whole place seemed a field of sorrow and an abode of misfortune. In\r\nthe end Roque Guinart directed Don Vicente\xe2\x80\x99s servants to carry his body\r\nto his father\xe2\x80\x99s village, which was close by, for burial. Claudia told\r\nhim she meant to go to a monastery of which an aunt of hers was abbess,\r\nwhere she intended to pass her life with a better and everlasting\r\nspouse. He applauded her pious resolution, and offered to accompany her\r\nwhithersoever she wished, and to protect her father against the kinsmen\r\nof Don Vicente and all the world, should they seek to injure him.\r\nClaudia would not on any account allow him to accompany her; and\r\nthanking him for his offers as well as she could, took leave of him in\r\ntears. The servants of Don Vicente carried away his body, and Roque\r\nreturned to his comrades, and so ended the love of Claudia Jeronima;\r\nbut what wonder, when it was the insuperable and cruel might of\r\njealousy that wove the web of her sad story?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np60d.jpg (439K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoque Guinart found his squires at the place to which he had ordered\r\nthem, and Don Quixote on Rocinante in the midst of them delivering a\r\nharangue to them in which he urged them to give up a mode of life so\r\nfull of peril, as well to the soul as to the body; but as most of them\r\nwere Gascons, rough lawless fellows, his speech did not make much\r\nimpression on them. Roque on coming up asked Sancho if his men had\r\nreturned and restored to him the treasures and jewels they had stripped\r\noff Dapple. Sancho said they had, but that three kerchiefs that were\r\nworth three cities were missing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about, man?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the bystanders; \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\ngot them, and they are not worth three reals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut my squire values them at the\r\nrate he says, as having been given me by the person who gave them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoque Guinart ordered them to be restored at once; and making his men\r\nfall in in line he directed all the clothing, jewellery, and money that\r\nthey had taken since the last distribution to be produced; and making a\r\nhasty valuation, and reducing what could not be divided into money, he\r\nmade shares for the whole band so equitably and carefully, that in no\r\ncase did he exceed or fall short of strict distributive justice.\r\n\r\nWhen this had been done, and all left satisfied, Roque observed to Don\r\nQuixote, \xe2\x80\x9cIf this scrupulous exactness were not observed with these\r\nfellows there would be no living with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon this Sancho remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom what I have seen here, justice is such\r\na good thing that there is no doing without it, even among the thieves\r\nthemselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the squires heard this, and raising the butt-end of his\r\nharquebuss would no doubt have broken Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s head with it had not\r\nRoque Guinart called out to him to hold his hand. Sancho was frightened\r\nout of his wits, and vowed not to open his lips so long as he was in\r\nthe company of these people.\r\n\r\nAt this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as\r\nsentinels on the roads, to watch who came along them and report what\r\npassed to their chief, came up and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, there is a great troop\r\nof people not far off coming along the road to Barcelona.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Roque replied, \xe2\x80\x9cHast thou made out whether they are of the\r\nsort that are after us, or of the sort we are after?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sort we are after,\xe2\x80\x9d said the squire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, away with you all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Roque, \xe2\x80\x9cand bring them here to me\r\nat once without letting one of them escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np60e.jpg (420K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey obeyed, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and Roque, left by themselves,\r\nwaited to see what the squires brought, and while they were waiting\r\nRoque said to Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cIt must seem a strange sort of life to\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, this of ours, strange adventures, strange incidents,\r\nand all full of danger; and I do not wonder that it should seem so, for\r\nin truth I must own there is no mode of life more restless or anxious\r\nthan ours. What led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance,\r\nwhich is strong enough to disturb the quietest hearts. I am by nature\r\ntender-hearted and kindly, but, as I said, the desire to revenge myself\r\nfor a wrong that was done me so overturns all my better impulses that I\r\nkeep on in this way of life in spite of what conscience tells me; and\r\nas one depth calls to another, and one sin to another sin, revenges\r\nhave linked themselves together, and I have taken upon myself not only\r\nmy own but those of others: it pleases God, however, that, though I see\r\nmyself in this maze of entanglements, I do not lose all hope of\r\nescaping from it and reaching a safe port.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was amazed to hear Roque utter such excellent and just\r\nsentiments, for he did not think that among those who followed such\r\ntrades as robbing, murdering, and waylaying, there could be anyone\r\ncapable of a virtuous thought, and he said in reply, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or Roque, the\r\nbeginning of health lies in knowing the disease and in the sick man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwillingness to take the medicines which the physician prescribes; you\r\nare sick, you know what ails you, and heaven, or more properly speaking\r\nGod, who is our physician, will administer medicines that will cure\r\nyou, and cure gradually, and not of a sudden or by a miracle; besides,\r\nsinners of discernment are nearer amendment than those who are fools;\r\nand as your worship has shown good sense in your remarks, all you have\r\nto do is to keep up a good heart and trust that the weakness of your\r\nconscience will be strengthened. And if you have any desire to shorten\r\nthe journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation, come with\r\nme, and I will show you how to become a knight-errant, a calling\r\nwherein so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be\r\ntaken as penances they will lodge you in heaven in a trice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoque laughed at Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s exhortation, and changing the\r\nconversation he related the tragic affair of Claudia Jeronima, at which\r\nSancho was extremely grieved; for he had not found the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeauty, boldness, and spirit at all amiss.\r\n\r\nAnd now the squires despatched to make the prize came up, bringing with\r\nthem two gentlemen on horseback, two pilgrims on foot, and a coach full\r\nof women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance\r\non them, and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them.\r\nThe squires made a ring round them, both victors and vanquished\r\nmaintaining profound silence, waiting for the great Roque Guinart to\r\nspeak. He asked the gentlemen who they were, whither they were going,\r\nand what money they carried with them; \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied one of them,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe are two captains of Spanish infantry; our companies are at Naples,\r\nand we are on our way to embark in four galleys which they say are at\r\nBarcelona under orders for Sicily; and we have about two or three\r\nhundred crowns, with which we are, according to our notions, rich and\r\ncontented, for a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s poverty does not allow a more extensive\r\nhoard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoque asked the pilgrims the same questions he had put to the captains,\r\nand was answered that they were going to take ship for Rome, and that\r\nbetween them they might have about sixty reals. He asked also who was\r\nin the coach, whither they were bound and what money they had, and one\r\nof the men on horseback replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThe persons in the coach are my lady\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Guiomar de Qui\xc3\xb1ones, wife of the regent of the Vicaria at Naples,\r\nher little daughter, a handmaid and a duenna; we six servants are in\r\nattendance upon her, and the money amounts to six hundred crowns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Roque Guinart, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have got here nine hundred crowns\r\nand sixty reals; my soldiers must number some sixty; see how much there\r\nfalls to each, for I am a bad arithmetician.\xe2\x80\x9d As soon as the robbers\r\nheard this they raised a shout of \xe2\x80\x9cLong life to Roque Guinart, in spite\r\nof the lladres that seek his ruin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captains showed plainly the concern they felt, the regent\xe2\x80\x99s lady\r\nwas downcast, and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their\r\nproperty confiscated. Roque kept them in suspense in this way for a\r\nwhile; but he had no desire to prolong their distress, which might be\r\nseen a bowshot off, and turning to the captains he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSirs, will\r\nyour worships be pleased of your courtesy to lend me sixty crowns, and\r\nher ladyship the regent\xe2\x80\x99s wife eighty, to satisfy this band that\r\nfollows me, for \xe2\x80\x98it is by his singing the abbot gets his dinner;\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nthen you may at once proceed on your journey, free and unhindered, with\r\na safe-conduct which I shall give you, so that if you come across any\r\nother bands of mine that I have scattered in these parts, they may do\r\nyou no harm; for I have no intention of doing injury to soldiers, or to\r\nany woman, especially one of quality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProfuse and hearty were the expressions of gratitude with which the\r\ncaptains thanked Roque for his courtesy and generosity; for such they\r\nregarded his leaving them their own money. Se\xc3\xb1ora Do\xc3\xb1a Guiomar de\r\nQui\xc3\xb1ones wanted to throw herself out of the coach to kiss the feet and\r\nhands of the great Roque, but he would not suffer it on any account; so\r\nfar from that, he begged her pardon for the wrong he had done her under\r\npressure of the inexorable necessities of his unfortunate calling. The\r\nregent\xe2\x80\x99s lady ordered one of her servants to give the eighty crowns\r\nthat had been assessed as her share at once, for the captains had\r\nalready paid down their sixty. The pilgrims were about to give up the\r\nwhole of their little hoard, but Roque bade them keep quiet, and\r\nturning to his men he said, \xe2\x80\x9cOf these crowns two fall to each man and\r\ntwenty remain over; let ten be given to these pilgrims, and the other\r\nten to this worthy squire that he may be able to speak favourably of\r\nthis adventure;\xe2\x80\x9d and then having writing materials, with which he\r\nalways went provided, brought to him, he gave them in writing a\r\nsafe-conduct to the leaders of his bands; and bidding them farewell let\r\nthem go free and filled with admiration at his magnanimity, his\r\ngenerous disposition, and his unusual conduct, and inclined to regard\r\nhim as an Alexander the Great rather than a notorious robber.\r\n\r\nOne of the squires observed in his mixture of Gascon and Catalan, \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\ncaptain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman; if he wants\r\nto be so generous another time, let it be with his own property and not\r\nours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np60f.jpg (426K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unlucky wight did not speak so low but that Roque overheard him,\r\nand drawing his sword almost split his head in two, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThat is\r\nthe way I punish impudent saucy fellows.\xe2\x80\x9d They were all taken aback,\r\nand not one of them dared to utter a word, such deference did they pay\r\nhim. Roque then withdrew to one side and wrote a letter to a friend of\r\nhis at Barcelona, telling him that the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha,\r\nthe knight-errant of whom there was so much talk, was with him, and\r\nwas, he assured him, the drollest and wisest man in the world; and that\r\nin four days from that date, that is to say, on Saint John the\r\nBaptist\xe2\x80\x99s Day, he was going to deposit him in full armour mounted on\r\nhis horse Rocinante, together with his squire Sancho on an ass, in the\r\nmiddle of the strand of the city; and bidding him give notice of this\r\nto his friends the Niarros, that they might divert themselves with him.\r\nHe wished, he said, his enemies the Cadells could be deprived of this\r\npleasure; but that was impossible, because the crazes and shrewd\r\nsayings of Don Quixote and the humours of his squire Sancho Panza could\r\nnot help giving general pleasure to all the world. He despatched the\r\nletter by one of his squires, who, exchanging the costume of a\r\nhighwayman for that of a peasant, made his way into Barcelona and gave\r\nit to the person to whom it was directed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np60g.jpg (42K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\nOF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE ON ENTERING BARCELONA, TOGETHER WITH OTHER\r\nMATTERS THAT PARTAKE OF THE TRUE RATHER THAN OF THE INGENIOUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np61a.jpg (143K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote passed three days and three nights with Roque, and had he\r\npassed three hundred years he would have found enough to observe and\r\nwonder at in his mode of life. At daybreak they were in one spot, at\r\ndinner-time in another; sometimes they fled without knowing from whom,\r\nat other times they lay in wait, not knowing for what. They slept\r\nstanding, breaking their slumbers to shift from place to place. There\r\nwas nothing but sending out spies and scouts, posting sentinels and\r\nblowing the matches of harquebusses, though they carried but few, for\r\nalmost all used flintlocks. Roque passed his nights in some place or\r\nother apart from his men, that they might not know where he was, for\r\nthe many proclamations the viceroy of Barcelona had issued against his\r\nlife kept him in fear and uneasiness, and he did not venture to trust\r\nanyone, afraid that even his own men would kill him or deliver him up\r\nto the authorities; of a truth, a weary miserable life! At length, by\r\nunfrequented roads, short cuts, and secret paths, Roque, Don Quixote,\r\nand Sancho, together with six squires, set out for Barcelona. They\r\nreached the strand on Saint John\xe2\x80\x99s Eve during the night; and Roque,\r\nafter embracing Don Quixote and Sancho (to whom he presented the ten\r\ncrowns he had promised but had not until then given), left them with\r\nmany expressions of good-will on both sides.\r\n\r\nRoque went back, while Don Quixote remained on horseback, just as he\r\nwas, waiting for day, and it was not long before the countenance of the\r\nfair Aurora began to show itself at the balconies of the east,\r\ngladdening the grass and flowers, if not the ear, though to gladden\r\nthat too there came at the same moment a sound of clarions and drums,\r\nand a din of bells, and a tramp, tramp, and cries of \xe2\x80\x9cClear the way\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x9d of some runners, that seemed to issue from the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np61b.jpg (271K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dawn made way for the sun that with a face broader than a buckler\r\nbegan to rise slowly above the low line of the horizon; Don Quixote and\r\nSancho gazed all round them; they beheld the sea, a sight until then\r\nunseen by them; it struck them as exceedingly spacious and broad, much\r\nmore so than the lakes of Ruidera which they had seen in La Mancha.\r\nThey saw the galleys along the beach, which, lowering their awnings,\r\ndisplayed themselves decked with streamers and pennons that trembled in\r\nthe breeze and kissed and swept the water, while on board the bugles,\r\ntrumpets, and clarions were sounding and filling the air far and near\r\nwith melodious warlike notes. Then they began to move and execute a\r\nkind of skirmish upon the calm water, while a vast number of horsemen\r\non fine horses and in showy liveries, issuing from the city, engaged on\r\ntheir side in a somewhat similar movement. The soldiers on board the\r\ngalleys kept up a ceaseless fire, which they on the walls and forts of\r\nthe city returned, and the heavy cannon rent the air with the\r\ntremendous noise they made, to which the gangway guns of the galleys\r\nreplied. The bright sea, the smiling earth, the clear air\xe2\x80\x94though at\r\ntimes darkened by the smoke of the guns\xe2\x80\x94all seemed to fill the whole\r\nmultitude with unexpected delight. Sancho could not make out how it was\r\nthat those great masses that moved over the sea had so many feet.\r\n\r\nAnd now the horsemen in livery came galloping up with shouts and\r\noutlandish cries and cheers to where Don Quixote stood amazed and\r\nwondering; and one of them, he to whom Roque had sent word, addressing\r\nhim exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to our city, mirror, beacon, star and cynosure\r\nof all knight-errantry in its widest extent! Welcome, I say, valiant\r\nDon Quixote of La Mancha; not the false, the fictitious, the\r\napocryphal, that these latter days have offered us in lying histories,\r\nbut the true, the legitimate, the real one that Cide Hamete Benengeli,\r\nflower of historians, has described to us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote made no answer, nor did the horsemen wait for one, but\r\nwheeling again with all their followers, they began curvetting round\r\nDon Quixote, who, turning to Sancho, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThese gentlemen have\r\nplainly recognised us; I will wager they have read our history, and\r\neven that newly printed one by the Aragonese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cavalier who had addressed Don Quixote again approached him and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cCome with us, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, for we are all of us your\r\nservants and great friends of Roque Guinart\xe2\x80\x99s;\xe2\x80\x9d to which Don Quixote\r\nreturned, \xe2\x80\x9cIf courtesy breeds courtesy, yours, sir knight, is daughter\r\nor very nearly akin to the great Roque\xe2\x80\x99s; carry me where you please; I\r\nwill have no will but yours, especially if you deign to employ it in\r\nyour service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np61c.jpg (448K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cavalier replied with words no less polite, and then, all closing\r\nin around him, they set out with him for the city, to the music of the\r\nclarions and the drums. As they were entering it, the wicked one, who\r\nis the author of all mischief, and the boys who are wickeder than the\r\nwicked one, contrived that a couple of these audacious irrepressible\r\nurchins should force their way through the crowd, and lifting up, one\r\nof them Dapple\xe2\x80\x99s tail and the other Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s, insert a bunch of\r\nfurze under each. The poor beasts felt the strange spurs and added to\r\ntheir anguish by pressing their tails tight, so much so that, cutting a\r\nmultitude of capers, they flung their masters to the ground. Don\r\nQuixote, covered with shame and out of countenance, ran to pluck the\r\nplume from his poor jade\xe2\x80\x99s tail, while Sancho did the same for Dapple.\r\nHis conductors tried to punish the audacity of the boys, but there was\r\nno possibility of doing so, for they hid themselves among the hundreds\r\nof others that were following them. Don Quixote and Sancho mounted once\r\nmore, and with the same music and acclamations reached their\r\nconductor\xe2\x80\x99s house, which was large and stately, that of a rich\r\ngentleman, in short; and there for the present we will leave them, for\r\nsuch is Cide Hamete\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np61e.jpg (32K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\nWHICH DEALS WITH THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENCHANTED HEAD, TOGETHER WITH\r\nOTHER TRIVIAL MATTERS WHICH CANNOT BE LEFT UNTOLD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np62a.jpg (156K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s host was one Don Antonio Moreno by name, a gentleman of\r\nwealth and intelligence, and very fond of diverting himself in any fair\r\nand good-natured way; and having Don Quixote in his house he set about\r\ndevising modes of making him exhibit his mad points in some harmless\r\nfashion; for jests that give pain are no jests, and no sport is worth\r\nanything if it hurts another. The first thing he did was to make Don\r\nQuixote take off his armour, and lead him, in that tight chamois suit\r\nwe have already described and depicted more than once, out on a balcony\r\noverhanging one of the chief streets of the city, in full view of the\r\ncrowd and of the boys, who gazed at him as they would at a monkey. The\r\ncavaliers in livery careered before him again as though it were for him\r\nalone, and not to enliven the festival of the day, that they wore it,\r\nand Sancho was in high delight, for it seemed to him that, how he knew\r\nnot, he had fallen upon another Camacho\xe2\x80\x99s wedding, another house like\r\nDon Diego de Miranda\xe2\x80\x99s, another castle like the duke\xe2\x80\x99s. Some of Don\r\nAntonio\xe2\x80\x99s friends dined with him that day, and all showed honour to Don\r\nQuixote and treated him as a knight-errant, and he becoming puffed up\r\nand exalted in consequence could not contain himself for satisfaction.\r\nSuch were the drolleries of Sancho that all the servants of the house,\r\nand all who heard him, were kept hanging upon his lips. While at table\r\nDon Antonio said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cWe hear, worthy Sancho, that you are so fond\r\nof manjar blanco and forced-meat balls, that if you have any left, you\r\nkeep them in your bosom for the next day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, se\xc3\xb1or, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am more cleanly than\r\ngreedy, and my master Don Quixote here knows well that we two are used\r\nto live for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts. To be sure, if it so\r\nhappens that they offer me a heifer, I run with a halter; I mean, I eat\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99m given, and make use of opportunities as I find them; but\r\nwhoever says that I\xe2\x80\x99m an out-of-the-way eater or not cleanly, let me\r\ntell him that he is wrong; and I\xe2\x80\x99d put it in a different way if I did\r\nnot respect the honourable beards that are at the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho\xe2\x80\x99s moderation and cleanliness in\r\neating might be inscribed and graved on plates of brass, to be kept in\r\neternal remembrance in ages to come. It is true that when he is hungry\r\nthere is a certain appearance of voracity about him, for he eats at a\r\ngreat pace and chews with both jaws; but cleanliness he is always\r\nmindful of; and when he was governor he learned how to eat daintily, so\r\nmuch so that he eats grapes, and even pomegranate pips, with a fork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Antonio, \xe2\x80\x9chas Sancho been a governor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cand of an island called Barataria. I governed it to\r\nperfection for ten days; and lost my rest all the time; and learned to\r\nlook down upon all the governments in the world; I got out of it by\r\ntaking to flight, and fell into a pit where I gave myself up for dead,\r\nand out of which I escaped alive by a miracle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote then gave them a minute account of the whole affair of\r\nSancho\xe2\x80\x99s government, with which he greatly amused his hearers.\r\n\r\nOn the cloth being removed Don Antonio, taking Don Quixote by the hand,\r\npassed with him into a distant room in which there was nothing in the\r\nway of furniture except a table, apparently of jasper, resting on a\r\npedestal of the same, upon which was set up, after the fashion of the\r\nbusts of the Roman emperors, a head which seemed to be of bronze. Don\r\nAntonio traversed the whole apartment with Don Quixote and walked round\r\nthe table several times, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, that I\r\nam satisfied that no one is listening to us, and that the door is shut,\r\nI will tell you of one of the rarest adventures, or more properly\r\nspeaking strange things, that can be imagined, on condition that you\r\nwill keep what I say to you in the remotest recesses of secrecy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand for greater security I will put a\r\nflag-stone over it; for I would have you know, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Antonio\xe2\x80\x9d (he\r\nhad by this time learned his name), \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are addressing one who,\r\nthough he has ears to hear, has no tongue to speak; so that you may\r\nsafely transfer whatever you have in your bosom into mine, and rely\r\nupon it that you have consigned it to the depths of silence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn reliance upon that promise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Antonio, \xe2\x80\x9cI will astonish you\r\nwith what you shall see and hear, and relieve myself of some of the\r\nvexation it gives me to have no one to whom I can confide my secrets,\r\nfor they are not of a sort to be entrusted to everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was puzzled, wondering what could be the object of such\r\nprecautions; whereupon Don Antonio taking his hand passed it over the\r\nbronze head and the whole table and the pedestal of jasper on which it\r\nstood, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis head, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote, has been made and\r\nfabricated by one of the greatest magicians and wizards the world ever\r\nsaw, a Pole, I believe, by birth, and a pupil of the famous Escotillo\r\nof whom such marvellous stories are told. He was here in my house, and\r\nfor a consideration of a thousand crowns that I gave him he constructed\r\nthis head, which has the property and virtue of answering whatever\r\nquestions are put to its ear. He observed the points of the compass, he\r\ntraced figures, he studied the stars, he watched favourable moments,\r\nand at length brought it to the perfection we shall see to-morrow, for\r\non Fridays it is mute, and this being Friday we must wait till the next\r\nday. In the interval your worship may consider what you would like to\r\nask it; and I know by experience that in all its answers it tells the\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was amazed at the virtue and property of the head, and was\r\ninclined to disbelieve Don Antonio; but seeing what a short time he had\r\nto wait to test the matter, he did not choose to say anything except\r\nthat he thanked him for having revealed to him so mighty a secret. They\r\nthen quitted the room, Don Antonio locked the door, and they repaired\r\nto the chamber where the rest of the gentlemen were assembled. In the\r\nmeantime Sancho had recounted to them several of the adventures and\r\naccidents that had happened his master.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon they took Don Quixote out for a stroll, not in his\r\narmour but in street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him,\r\nthat at that season would have made ice itself sweat. Orders were left\r\nwith the servants to entertain Sancho so as not to let him leave the\r\nhouse. Don Quixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall mule\r\nof easy pace and handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on him,\r\nand on the back, without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment\r\non which they wrote in large letters, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha.\xe2\x80\x9d As they set out upon their excursion the placard attracted the\r\neyes of all who chanced to see him, and as they read out, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Don\r\nQuixote of La Mancha,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Quixote was amazed to see how many people\r\ngazed at him, called him by his name, and recognised him, and turning\r\nto Don Antonio, who rode at his side, he observed to him, \xe2\x80\x9cGreat are\r\nthe privileges knight-errantry involves, for it makes him who professes\r\nit known and famous in every region of the earth; see, Don Antonio,\r\neven the very boys of this city know me without ever having seen me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Antonio; \xe2\x80\x9cfor as fire cannot be\r\nhidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being recognised; and that\r\nwhich is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished above\r\nall others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was proceeding amid the\r\nacclamations that have been described, a Castilian, reading the\r\ninscription on his back, cried out in a loud voice, \xe2\x80\x9cThe devil take\r\nthee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha! What! art thou here, and not dead\r\nof the countless drubbings that have fallen on thy ribs? Thou art mad;\r\nand if thou wert so by thyself, and kept thyself within thy madness, it\r\nwould not be so bad; but thou hast the gift of making fools and\r\nblockheads of all who have anything to do with thee or say to thee.\r\nWhy, look at these gentlemen bearing thee company! Get thee home,\r\nblockhead, and see after thy affairs, and thy wife and children, and\r\ngive over these fooleries that are sapping thy brains and skimming away\r\nthy wits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo your own way, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Antonio, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t offer advice\r\nto those who don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you for it. Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote is in his full\r\nsenses, and we who bear him company are not fools; virtue is to be\r\nhonoured wherever it may be found; go, and bad luck to you, and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmeddle where you are not wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, your worship is right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Castilian; \xe2\x80\x9cfor to advise\r\nthis good man is to kick against the pricks; still for all that it\r\nfills me with pity that the sound wit they say the blockhead has in\r\neverything should dribble away by the channel of his knight-errantry;\r\nbut may the bad luck your worship talks of follow me and all my\r\ndescendants, if, from this day forth, though I should live longer than\r\nMethuselah, I ever give advice to anybody even if he asks me for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe advice-giver took himself off, and they continued their stroll; but\r\nso great was the press of the boys and people to read the placard, that\r\nDon Antonio was forced to remove it as if he were taking off something\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np62b.jpg (373K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNight came and they went home, and there was a ladies\xe2\x80\x99 dancing party,\r\nfor Don Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s wife, a lady of rank and gaiety, beauty and wit, had\r\ninvited some friends of hers to come and do honour to her guest and\r\namuse themselves with his strange delusions. Several of them came, they\r\nsupped sumptuously, the dance began at about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Among the\r\nladies were two of a mischievous and frolicsome turn, and, though\r\nperfectly modest, somewhat free in playing tricks for harmless\r\ndiversion\xe2\x80\x99s sake. These two were so indefatigable in taking Don Quixote\r\nout to dance that they tired him down, not only in body but in spirit.\r\nIt was a sight to see the figure Don Quixote made, long, lank, lean,\r\nand yellow, his garments clinging tight to him, ungainly, and above all\r\nanything but agile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np62c.jpg (342K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gay ladies made secret love to him, and he on his part secretly\r\nrepelled them, but finding himself hard pressed by their blandishments\r\nhe lifted up his voice and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9c_Fugite, partes advers\xc3\xa6!_ Leave\r\nme in peace, unwelcome overtures; avaunt, with your desires, ladies,\r\nfor she who is queen of mine, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, suffers\r\nnone but hers to lead me captive and subdue me;\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying he sat\r\ndown on the floor in the middle of the room, tired out and broken down\r\nby all this exertion in the dance.\r\n\r\nDon Antonio directed him to be taken up bodily and carried to bed, and\r\nthe first that laid hold of him was Sancho, saying as he did so, \xe2\x80\x9cIn an\r\nevil hour you took to dancing, master mine; do you fancy all mighty men\r\nof valour are dancers, and all knights-errant given to capering? If you\r\ndo, I can tell you you are mistaken; there\xe2\x80\x99s many a man would rather\r\nundertake to kill a giant than cut a caper. If it had been the\r\nshoe-fling you were at I could take your place, for I can do the\r\nshoe-fling like a gerfalcon; but I\xe2\x80\x99m no good at dancing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these and other observations Sancho set the whole ball-room\r\nlaughing, and then put his master to bed, covering him up well so that\r\nhe might sweat out any chill caught after his dancing.\r\n\r\nThe next day Don Antonio thought he might as well make trial of the\r\nenchanted head, and with Don Quixote, Sancho, and two others, friends\r\nof his, besides the two ladies that had tired out Don Quixote at the\r\nball, who had remained for the night with Don Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s wife, he locked\r\nhimself up in the chamber where the head was. He explained to them the\r\nproperty it possessed and entrusted the secret to them, telling them\r\nthat now for the first time he was going to try the virtue of the\r\nenchanted head; but except Don Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s two friends no one else was\r\nprivy to the mystery of the enchantment, and if Don Antonio had not\r\nfirst revealed it to them they would have been inevitably reduced to\r\nthe same state of amazement as the rest, so artfully and skilfully was\r\nit contrived.\r\n\r\nThe first to approach the ear of the head was Don Antonio himself, and\r\nin a low voice but not so low as not to be audible to all, he said to\r\nit, \xe2\x80\x9cHead, tell me by the virtue that lies in thee what am I at this\r\nmoment thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe head, without any movement of the lips, answered in a clear and\r\ndistinct voice, so as to be heard by all, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot judge of thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll were thunderstruck at this, and all the more so as they saw that\r\nthere was nobody anywhere near the table or in the whole room that\r\ncould have answered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many of us are here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Antonio once\r\nmore; and it was answered him in the same way softly, \xe2\x80\x9cThou and thy\r\nwife, with two friends of thine and two of hers, and a famous knight\r\ncalled Don Quixote of La Mancha, and a squire of his, Sancho Panza by\r\nname.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow there was fresh astonishment; now everyone\xe2\x80\x99s hair was standing on\r\nend with awe; and Don Antonio retiring from the head exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nsuffices to show me that I have not been deceived by him who sold thee\r\nto me, O sage head, talking head, answering head, wonderful head! Let\r\nsomeone else go and put what question he likes to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as women are commonly impulsive and inquisitive, the first to come\r\nforward was one of the two friends of Don Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and her\r\nquestion was, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Head, what shall I do to be very beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand the answer she got was, \xe2\x80\x9cBe very modest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI question thee no further,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fair querist.\r\n\r\nHer companion then came up and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know, Head,\r\nwhether my husband loves me or not;\xe2\x80\x9d the answer given to her was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink how he uses thee, and thou mayest guess;\xe2\x80\x9d and the married lady\r\nwent off saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThat answer did not need a question; for of course\r\nthe treatment one receives shows the disposition of him from whom it is\r\nreceived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen one of Don Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s two friends advanced and asked it, \xe2\x80\x9cWho am\r\nI?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThou knowest,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not what I ask thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cbut to tell me if thou knowest me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know thee,\r\nthou art Don Pedro Noriz,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not seek to know more,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cfor this is enough\r\nto convince me, O Head, that thou knowest everything;\xe2\x80\x9d and as he\r\nretired the other friend came forward and asked it, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Head,\r\nwhat are the wishes of my eldest son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said already,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I cannot judge of wishes;\r\nhowever, I can tell thee the wish of thy son is to bury thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98what I see with my eyes I point out with my finger,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ngentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cso I ask no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s wife came up and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know not what to ask thee,\r\nHead; I would only seek to know of thee if I shall have many years of\r\nenjoyment of my good husband;\xe2\x80\x9d and the answer she received was, \xe2\x80\x9cThou\r\nshalt, for his vigour and his temperate habits promise many years of\r\nlife, which by their intemperance others so often cut short.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Don Quixote came forward and said, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, thou that answerest,\r\nwas that which I describe as having happened to me in the cave of\r\nMontesinos the truth or a dream? Will Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s whipping be accomplished\r\nwithout fail? Will the disenchantment of Dulcinea be brought about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np62d.jpg (391K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to the question of the cave,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is much to be\r\nsaid; there is something of both in it. Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s whipping will proceed\r\nleisurely. The disenchantment of Dulcinea will attain its due\r\nconsummation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seek to know no more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9clet me but see Dulcinea\r\ndisenchanted, and I will consider that all the good fortune I could\r\nwish for has come upon me all at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last questioner was Sancho, and his questions were, \xe2\x80\x9cHead, shall I\r\nby any chance have another government? Shall I ever escape from the\r\nhard life of a squire? Shall I get back to see my wife and children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTo which the answer came, \xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt govern in thy house; and if thou\r\nreturnest to it thou shalt see thy wife and children; and on ceasing to\r\nserve thou shalt cease to be a squire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, by God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho Panza; \xe2\x80\x9cI could have told myself that; the\r\nprophet Perogrullo could have said no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat answer wouldst thou have, beast?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cis it not\r\nenough that the replies this head has given suit the questions put to\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I should have liked it to have\r\nmade itself plainer and told me more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder with\r\nwhich all were filled, except Don Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s two friends who were in the\r\nsecret. This Cide Hamete Benengeli thought fit to reveal at once, not\r\nto keep the world in suspense, fancying that the head had some strange\r\nmagical mystery in it. He says, therefore, that on the model of another\r\nhead, the work of an image maker, which he had seen at Madrid, Don\r\nAntonio made this one at home for his own amusement and to astonish\r\nignorant people; and its mechanism was as follows. The table was of\r\nwood painted and varnished to imitate jasper, and the pedestal on which\r\nit stood was of the same material, with four eagles\xe2\x80\x99 claws projecting\r\nfrom it to support the weight more steadily. The head, which resembled\r\na bust or figure of a Roman emperor, and was coloured like bronze, was\r\nhollow throughout, as was the table, into which it was fitted so\r\nexactly that no trace of the joining was visible. The pedestal of the\r\ntable was also hollow and communicated with the throat and neck of the\r\nhead, and the whole was in communication with another room underneath\r\nthe chamber in which the head stood. Through the entire cavity in the\r\npedestal, table, throat and neck of the bust or figure, there passed a\r\ntube of tin carefully adjusted and concealed from sight. In the room\r\nbelow corresponding to the one above was placed the person who was to\r\nanswer, with his mouth to the tube, and the voice, as in an\r\near-trumpet, passed from above downwards, and from below upwards, the\r\nwords coming clearly and distinctly; it was impossible, thus, to detect\r\nthe trick. A nephew of Don Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s, a smart sharp-witted student, was\r\nthe answerer, and as he had been told beforehand by his uncle who the\r\npersons were that would come with him that day into the chamber where\r\nthe head was, it was an easy matter for him to answer the first\r\nquestion at once and correctly; the others he answered by guess-work,\r\nand, being clever, cleverly. Cide Hamete adds that this marvellous\r\ncontrivance stood for some ten or twelve days; but that, as it became\r\nnoised abroad through the city that he had in his house an enchanted\r\nhead that answered all who asked questions of it, Don Antonio, fearing\r\nit might come to the ears of the watchful sentinels of our faith,\r\nexplained the matter to the inquisitors, who commanded him to break it\r\nup and have done with it, lest the ignorant vulgar should be\r\nscandalised. By Don Quixote, however, and by Sancho the head was still\r\nheld to be an enchanted one, and capable of answering questions, though\r\nmore to Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction than Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen of the city, to gratify Don Antonio and also to do the\r\nhonours to Don Quixote, and give him an opportunity of displaying his\r\nfolly, made arrangements for a tilting at the ring in six days from\r\nthat time, which, however, for reason that will be mentioned hereafter,\r\ndid not take place.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote took a fancy to stroll about the city quietly and on foot,\r\nfor he feared that if he went on horseback the boys would follow him;\r\nso he and Sancho and two servants that Don Antonio gave him set out for\r\na walk. Thus it came to pass that going along one of the streets Don\r\nQuixote lifted up his eyes and saw written in very large letters over a\r\ndoor, \xe2\x80\x9cBooks printed here,\xe2\x80\x9d at which he was vastly pleased, for until\r\nthen he had never seen a printing office, and he was curious to know\r\nwhat it was like. He entered with all his following, and saw them\r\ndrawing sheets in one place, correcting in another, setting up type\r\nhere, revising there; in short all the work that is to be seen in great\r\nprinting offices. He went up to one case and asked what they were about\r\nthere; the workmen told him, he watched them with wonder, and passed\r\non. He approached one man, among others, and asked him what he was\r\ndoing. The workman replied, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, this gentleman here\xe2\x80\x9d (pointing to a\r\nman of prepossessing appearance and a certain gravity of look) \xe2\x80\x9chas\r\ntranslated an Italian book into our Spanish tongue, and I am setting it\r\nup in type for the press.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the title of the book?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Quixote; to which the author\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or, in Italian the book is called _Le Bagatelle_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does _Le Bagatelle_ import in our Spanish?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don\r\nQuixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Le Bagatelle_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the author, \xe2\x80\x9cis as though we should say in\r\nSpanish _Los Juguetes;_ but though the book is humble in name it has\r\ngood solid matter in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9chave some little smattering of Italian, and I\r\nplume myself on singing some of Ariosto\xe2\x80\x99s stanzas; but tell me, se\xc3\xb1or\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndo not say this to test your ability, but merely out of curiosity\xe2\x80\x94have\r\nyou ever met with the word _pignatta_ in your book?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, often,\xe2\x80\x9d said the author.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you render that in Spanish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I render it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the author, \xe2\x80\x9cbut by _olla_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBody o\xe2\x80\x99 me,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a proficient you are in the\r\nItalian language! I would lay a good wager that where they say in\r\nItalian _piace_ you say in Spanish _place_, and where they say _piu_\r\nyou say _mas_, and you translate _s\xc3\xb9_ by _arriba_ and _gi\xc3\xb9_ by\r\n_abajo_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI translate them so of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said the author, \xe2\x80\x9cfor those are their\r\nproper equivalents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would venture to swear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your worship is not\r\nknown in the world, which always begrudges their reward to rare wits\r\nand praiseworthy labours. What talents lie wasted there! What genius\r\nthrust away into corners! What worth left neglected! Still it seems to\r\nme that translation from one language into another, if it be not from\r\nthe queens of languages, the Greek and the Latin, is like looking at\r\nFlemish tapestries on the wrong side; for though the figures are\r\nvisible, they are full of threads that make them indistinct, and they\r\ndo not show with the smoothness and brightness of the right side; and\r\ntranslation from easy languages argues neither ingenuity nor command of\r\nwords, any more than transcribing or copying out one document from\r\nanother. But I do not mean by this to draw the inference that no credit\r\nis to be allowed for the work of translating, for a man may employ\r\nhimself in ways worse and less profitable to himself. This estimate\r\ndoes not include two famous translators, Doctor Crist\xc3\xb3bal de Figueroa,\r\nin his _Pastor Fido_, and Don Juan de J\xc3\xa1uregui, in his _Aminta_,\r\nwherein by their felicity they leave it in doubt which is the\r\ntranslation and which the original. But tell me, are you printing this\r\nbook at your own risk, or have you sold the copyright to some\r\nbookseller?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI print at my own risk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the author, \xe2\x80\x9cand I expect to make a\r\nthousand ducats at least by this first edition, which is to be of two\r\nthousand copies that will go off in a twinkling at six reals apiece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine calculation you are making!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cit is plain you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know the ins and outs of the printers, and how they play into one\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s hands. I promise you when you find yourself saddled with two\r\nthousand copies you will feel so sore that it will astonish you,\r\nparticularly if the book is a little out of the common and not in any\r\nway highly spiced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said the author, \xe2\x80\x9cwould your worship, then, have me give it to\r\na bookseller who will give three maravedis for the copyright and think\r\nhe is doing me a favour? I do not print my books to win fame in the\r\nworld, for I am known in it already by my works; I want to make money,\r\nwithout which reputation is not worth a rap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod send your worship good luck,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; and he moved on to\r\nanother case, where he saw them correcting a sheet of a book with the\r\ntitle of \xe2\x80\x9cLight of the Soul;\xe2\x80\x9d noticing it he observed, \xe2\x80\x9cBooks like\r\nthis, though there are many of the kind, are the ones that deserve to\r\nbe printed, for many are the sinners in these days, and lights\r\nunnumbered are needed for all that are in darkness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe passed on, and saw they were also correcting another book, and when\r\nhe asked its title they told him it was called, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Second Part of the\r\nIngenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha,\xe2\x80\x9d by one of Tordesillas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of this book already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand verily and\r\non my conscience I thought it had been by this time burned to ashes as\r\na meddlesome intruder; but its Martinmas will come to it as it does to\r\nevery pig; for fictions have the more merit and charm about them the\r\nmore nearly they approach the truth or what looks like it; and true\r\nstories, the truer they are the better they are;\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying he\r\nwalked out of the printing office with a certain amount of displeasure\r\nin his looks. That same day Don Antonio arranged to take him to see the\r\ngalleys that lay at the beach, whereat Sancho was in high delight, as\r\nhe had never seen any all his life. Don Antonio sent word to the\r\ncommandant of the galleys that he intended to bring his guest, the\r\nfamous Don Quixote of La Mancha, of whom the commandant and all the\r\ncitizens had already heard, that afternoon to see them; and what\r\nhappened on board of them will be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np62e.jpg (18K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\nOF THE MISHAP THAT BEFELL SANCHO PANZA THROUGH THE VISIT TO THE\r\nGALLEYS, AND THE STRANGE ADVENTURE OF THE FAIR MORISCO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np63a.jpg (151K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProfound were Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s reflections on the reply of the enchanted\r\nhead, not one of them, however, hitting on the secret of the trick, but\r\nall concentrated on the promise, which he regarded as a certainty, of\r\nDulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s disenchantment. This he turned over in his mind again and\r\nagain with great satisfaction, fully persuaded that he would shortly\r\nsee its fulfillment; and as for Sancho, though, as has been said, he\r\nhated being a governor, still he had a longing to be giving orders and\r\nfinding himself obeyed once more; this is the misfortune that being in\r\nauthority, even in jest, brings with it.\r\n\r\nTo resume; that afternoon their host Don Antonio Moreno and his two\r\nfriends, with Don Quixote and Sancho, went to the galleys. The\r\ncommandant had been already made aware of his good fortune in seeing\r\ntwo such famous persons as Don Quixote and Sancho, and the instant they\r\ncame to the shore all the galleys struck their awnings and the clarions\r\nrang out. A skiff covered with rich carpets and cushions of crimson\r\nvelvet was immediately lowered into the water, and as Don Quixote\r\nstepped on board of it, the leading galley fired her gangway gun, and\r\nthe other galleys did the same; and as he mounted the starboard ladder\r\nthe whole crew saluted him (as is the custom when a personage of\r\ndistinction comes on board a galley) by exclaiming \xe2\x80\x9cHu, hu, hu,\xe2\x80\x9d three\r\ntimes. The general, for so we shall call him, a Valencian gentleman of\r\nrank, gave him his hand and embraced him, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall mark this\r\nday with a white stone as one of the happiest I can expect to enjoy in\r\nmy lifetime, since I have seen Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote of La Mancha, pattern\r\nand image wherein we see contained and condensed all that is worthy in\r\nknight-errantry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote delighted beyond measure with such a lordly reception,\r\nreplied to him in words no less courteous. All then proceeded to the\r\npoop, which was very handsomely decorated, and seated themselves on the\r\nbulwark benches; the boatswain passed along the gangway and piped all\r\nhands to strip, which they did in an instant. Sancho, seeing such a\r\nnumber of men stripped to the skin, was taken aback, and still more\r\nwhen he saw them spread the awning so briskly that it seemed to him as\r\nif all the devils were at work at it; but all this was cakes and fancy\r\nbread to what I am going to tell now. Sancho was seated on the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s stage, close to the aftermost rower on the right-hand side.\r\nHe, previously instructed in what he was to do, laid hold of Sancho,\r\nhoisting him up in his arms, and the whole crew, who were standing\r\nready, beginning on the right, proceeded to pass him on, whirling him\r\nalong from hand to hand and from bench to bench with such rapidity that\r\nit took the sight out of poor Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and he made quite sure\r\nthat the devils themselves were flying away with him; nor did they\r\nleave off with him until they had sent him back along the left side and\r\ndeposited him on the poop; and the poor fellow was left bruised and\r\nbreathless and all in a sweat, and unable to comprehend what it was\r\nthat had happened to him.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote when he saw Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s flight without wings asked the general\r\nif this was a usual ceremony with those who came on board the galleys\r\nfor the first time; for, if so, as he had no intention of adopting them\r\nas a profession, he had no mind to perform such feats of agility, and\r\nif anyone offered to lay hold of him to whirl him about, he vowed to\r\nGod he would kick his soul out; and as he said this he stood up and\r\nclapped his hand upon his sword. At this instant they struck the awning\r\nand lowered the yard with a prodigious rattle. Sancho thought heaven\r\nwas coming off its hinges and going to fall on his head, and full of\r\nterror he ducked it and buried it between his knees; nor were Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s knees altogether under control, for he too shook a little,\r\nsqueezed his shoulders together and lost colour. The crew then hoisted\r\nthe yard with the same rapidity and clatter as when they lowered it,\r\nall the while keeping silence as though they had neither voice nor\r\nbreath. The boatswain gave the signal to weigh anchor, and leaping upon\r\nthe middle of the gangway began to lay on to the shoulders of the crew\r\nwith his courbash or whip, and to haul out gradually to sea.\r\n\r\nWhen Sancho saw so many red feet (for such he took the oars to be)\r\nmoving all together, he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s these that are the real\r\nchanted things, and not the ones my master talks of. What can those\r\nwretches have done to be so whipped; and how does that one man who goes\r\nalong there whistling dare to whip so many? I declare this is hell, or\r\nat least purgatory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote, observing how attentively Sancho regarded what was going\r\non, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Sancho my friend, how quickly and cheaply might\r\nyou finish off the disenchantment of Dulcinea, if you would strip to\r\nthe waist and take your place among those gentlemen! Amid the pain and\r\nsufferings of so many you would not feel your own much; and moreover\r\nperhaps the sage Merlin would allow each of these lashes, being laid on\r\nwith a good hand, to count for ten of those which you must give\r\nyourself at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe general was about to ask what these lashes were, and what was\r\nDulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s disenchantment, when a sailor exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cMonjui signals\r\nthat there is an oared vessel off the coast to the west.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this the general sprang upon the gangway crying, \xe2\x80\x9cNow then,\r\nmy sons, don\xe2\x80\x99t let her give us the slip! It must be some Algerine\r\ncorsair brigantine that the watchtower signals to us.\xe2\x80\x9d The three others\r\nimmediately came alongside the chief galley to receive their orders.\r\nThe general ordered two to put out to sea while he with the other kept\r\nin shore, so that in this way the vessel could not escape them. The\r\ncrews plied the oars driving the galleys so furiously that they seemed\r\nto fly. The two that had put out to sea, after a couple of miles\r\nsighted a vessel which, so far as they could make out, they judged to\r\nbe one of fourteen or fifteen banks, and so she proved. As soon as the\r\nvessel discovered the galleys she went about with the object and in the\r\nhope of making her escape by her speed; but the attempt failed, for the\r\nchief galley was one of the fastest vessels afloat, and overhauled her\r\nso rapidly that they on board the brigantine saw clearly there was no\r\npossibility of escaping, and the rais therefore would have had them\r\ndrop their oars and give themselves up so as not to provoke the captain\r\nin command of our galleys to anger. But chance, directing things\r\notherwise, so ordered it that just as the chief galley came close\r\nenough for those on board the vessel to hear the shouts from her\r\ncalling on them to surrender, two Toraquis, that is to say two Turks,\r\nboth drunken, that with a dozen more were on board the brigantine,\r\ndischarged their muskets, killing two of the soldiers that lined the\r\nsides of our vessel. Seeing this the general swore he would not leave\r\none of those he found on board the vessel alive, but as he bore down\r\nfuriously upon her she slipped away from him underneath the oars. The\r\ngalley shot a good way ahead; those on board the vessel saw their case\r\nwas desperate, and while the galley was coming about they made sail,\r\nand by sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off; but their\r\nactivity did not do them as much good as their rashness did them harm,\r\nfor the galley coming up with them in a little more than half a mile\r\nthrew her oars over them and took the whole of them alive. The other\r\ntwo galleys now joined company and all four returned with the prize to\r\nthe beach, where a vast multitude stood waiting for them, eager to see\r\nwhat they brought back. The general anchored close in, and perceived\r\nthat the viceroy of the city was on the shore. He ordered the skiff to\r\npush off to fetch him, and the yard to be lowered for the purpose of\r\nhanging forthwith the rais and the rest of the men taken on board the\r\nvessel, about six-and-thirty in number, all smart fellows and most of\r\nthem Turkish musketeers. He asked which was the rais of the brigantine,\r\nand was answered in Spanish by one of the prisoners (who afterwards\r\nproved to be a Spanish renegade), \xe2\x80\x9cThis young man, se\xc3\xb1or that you see\r\nhere is our rais,\xe2\x80\x9d and he pointed to one of the handsomest and most\r\ngallant-looking youths that could be imagined. He did not seem to be\r\ntwenty years of age.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said the general, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat led thee to kill my soldiers,\r\nwhen thou sawest it was impossible for thee to escape? Is that the way\r\nto behave to chief galleys? Knowest thou not that rashness is not\r\nvalour? Faint prospects of success should make men bold, but not rash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rais was about to reply, but the general could not at that moment\r\nlisten to him, as he had to hasten to receive the viceroy, who was now\r\ncoming on board the galley, and with him certain of his attendants and\r\nsome of the people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have had a good chase, se\xc3\xb1or general,\xe2\x80\x9d said the viceroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency shall soon see how good, by the game strung up to this\r\nyard,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the general.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the viceroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said the general, \xe2\x80\x9cagainst all law, reason, and usages of\r\nwar they have killed on my hands two of the best soldiers on board\r\nthese galleys, and I have sworn to hang every man that I have taken,\r\nbut above all this youth who is the rais of the brigantine,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\npointed to him as he stood with his hands already bound and the rope\r\nround his neck, ready for death.\r\n\r\nThe viceroy looked at him, and seeing him so well-favoured, so\r\ngraceful, and so submissive, he felt a desire to spare his life, the\r\ncomeliness of the youth furnishing him at once with a letter of\r\nrecommendation. He therefore questioned him, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, rais,\r\nart thou Turk, Moor, or renegade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which the youth replied, also in Spanish, \xe2\x80\x9cI am neither Turk, nor\r\nMoor, nor renegade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said the viceroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Christian woman,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman and a Christian, in such a dress and in such circumstances! It\r\nis more marvellous than credible,\xe2\x80\x9d said the viceroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuspend the execution of the sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth; \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nvengeance will not lose much by waiting while I tell you the story of\r\nmy life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat heart could be so hard as not to be softened by these words, at\r\nany rate so far as to listen to what the unhappy youth had to say? The\r\ngeneral bade him say what he pleased, but not to expect pardon for his\r\nflagrant offence. With this permission the youth began in these words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBorn of Morisco parents, I am of that nation, more unhappy than wise,\r\nupon which of late a sea of woes has poured down. In the course of our\r\nmisfortune I was carried to Barbary by two uncles of mine, for it was\r\nin vain that I declared I was a Christian, as in fact I am, and not a\r\nmere pretended one, or outwardly, but a true Catholic Christian. It\r\navailed me nothing with those charged with our sad expatriation to\r\nprotest this, nor would my uncles believe it; on the contrary, they\r\ntreated it as an untruth and a subterfuge set up to enable me to remain\r\nbehind in the land of my birth; and so, more by force than of my own\r\nwill, they took me with them. I had a Christian mother, and a father\r\nwho was a man of sound sense and a Christian too; I imbibed the\r\nCatholic faith with my mother\xe2\x80\x99s milk, I was well brought up, and\r\nneither in word nor in deed did I, I think, show any sign of being a\r\nMorisco. To accompany these virtues, for such I hold them, my beauty,\r\nif I possess any, grew with my growth; and great as was the seclusion\r\nin which I lived it was not so great but that a young gentleman, Don\r\nGaspar Gregorio by name, eldest son of a gentleman who is lord of a\r\nvillage near ours, contrived to find opportunities of seeing me. How he\r\nsaw me, how we met, how his heart was lost to me, and mine not kept\r\nfrom him, would take too long to tell, especially at a moment when I am\r\nin dread of the cruel cord that threatens me interposing between tongue\r\nand throat; I will only say, therefore, that Don Gregorio chose to\r\naccompany me in our banishment. He joined company with the Moriscoes\r\nwho were going forth from other villages, for he knew their language\r\nvery well, and on the voyage he struck up a friendship with my two\r\nuncles who were carrying me with them; for my father, like a wise and\r\nfar-sighted man, as soon as he heard the first edict for our expulsion,\r\nquitted the village and departed in quest of some refuge for us abroad.\r\nHe left hidden and buried, at a spot of which I alone have knowledge, a\r\nlarge quantity of pearls and precious stones of great value, together\r\nwith a sum of money in gold cruzadoes and doubloons. He charged me on\r\nno account to touch the treasure, if by any chance they expelled us\r\nbefore his return. I obeyed him, and with my uncles, as I have said,\r\nand others of our kindred and neighbours, passed over to Barbary, and\r\nthe place where we took up our abode was Algiers, much the same as if\r\nwe had taken it up in hell itself. The king heard of my beauty, and\r\nreport told him of my wealth, which was in some degree fortunate for\r\nme. He summoned me before him, and asked me what part of Spain I came\r\nfrom, and what money and jewels I had. I mentioned the place, and told\r\nhim the jewels and money were buried there; but that they might easily\r\nbe recovered if I myself went back for them. All this I told him, in\r\ndread lest my beauty and not his own covetousness should influence him.\r\nWhile he was engaged in conversation with me, they brought him word\r\nthat in company with me was one of the handsomest and most graceful\r\nyouths that could be imagined. I knew at once that they were speaking\r\nof Don Gaspar Gregorio, whose comeliness surpasses the most highly\r\nvaunted beauty. I was troubled when I thought of the danger he was in,\r\nfor among those barbarous Turks a fair youth is more esteemed than a\r\nwoman, be she ever so beautiful. The king immediately ordered him to be\r\nbrought before him that he might see him, and asked me if what they\r\nsaid about the youth was true. I then, almost as if inspired by heaven,\r\ntold him it was, but that I would have him to know it was not a man,\r\nbut a woman like myself, and I entreated him to allow me to go and\r\ndress her in the attire proper to her, so that her beauty might be seen\r\nto perfection, and that she might present herself before him with less\r\nembarrassment. He bade me go by all means, and said that the next day\r\nwe should discuss the plan to be adopted for my return to Spain to\r\ncarry away the hidden treasure. I saw Don Gaspar, I told him the danger\r\nhe was in if he let it be seen he was a man, I dressed him as a Moorish\r\nwoman, and that same afternoon I brought him before the king, who was\r\ncharmed when he saw him, and resolved to keep the damsel and make a\r\npresent of her to the Grand Signor; and to avoid the risk she might run\r\namong the women of his seraglio, and distrustful of himself, he\r\ncommanded her to be placed in the house of some Moorish ladies of rank\r\nwho would protect and attend to her; and thither he was taken at once.\r\nWhat we both suffered (for I cannot deny that I love him) may be left\r\nto the imagination of those who are separated if they love one another\r\ndearly. The king then arranged that I should return to Spain in this\r\nbrigantine, and that two Turks, those who killed your soldiers, should\r\naccompany me. There also came with me this Spanish renegade\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and here\r\nshe pointed to him who had first spoken\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhom I know to be secretly a\r\nChristian, and to be more desirous of being left in Spain than of\r\nreturning to Barbary. The rest of the crew of the brigantine are Moors\r\nand Turks, who merely serve as rowers. The two Turks, greedy and\r\ninsolent, instead of obeying the orders we had to land me and this\r\nrenegade in Christian dress (with which we came provided) on the first\r\nSpanish ground we came to, chose to run along the coast and make some\r\nprize if they could, fearing that if they put us ashore first, we\r\nmight, in case of some accident befalling us, make it known that the\r\nbrigantine was at sea, and thus, if there happened to be any galleys on\r\nthe coast, they might be taken. We sighted this shore last night, and\r\nknowing nothing of these galleys, we were discovered, and the result\r\nwas what you have seen. To sum up, there is Don Gregorio in woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndress, among women, in imminent danger of his life; and here am I, with\r\nhands bound, in expectation, or rather in dread, of losing my life, of\r\nwhich I am already weary. Here, sirs, ends my sad story, as true as it\r\nis unhappy; all I ask of you is to allow me to die like a Christian,\r\nfor, as I have already said, I am not to be charged with the offence of\r\nwhich those of my nation are guilty;\xe2\x80\x9d and she stood silent, her eyes\r\nfilled with moving tears, accompanied by plenty from the bystanders.\r\nThe viceroy, touched with compassion, went up to her without speaking\r\nand untied the cord that bound the hands of the Moorish girl.\r\n\r\nBut all the while the Morisco Christian was telling her strange story,\r\nan elderly pilgrim, who had come on board of the galley at the same\r\ntime as the viceroy, kept his eyes fixed upon her; and the instant she\r\nceased speaking he threw himself at her feet, and embracing them said\r\nin a voice broken by sobs and sighs, \xe2\x80\x9cO Ana Felix, my unhappy daughter,\r\nI am thy father Ricote, come back to look for thee, unable to live\r\nwithout thee, my soul that thou art!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words of his, Sancho opened his eyes and raised his head,\r\nwhich he had been holding down, brooding over his unlucky excursion;\r\nand looking at the pilgrim he recognised in him that same Ricote he met\r\nthe day he quitted his government, and felt satisfied that this was his\r\ndaughter. She being now unbound embraced her father, mingling her tears\r\nwith his, while he addressing the general and the viceroy said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis,\r\nsirs, is my daughter, more unhappy in her adventures than in her name.\r\nShe is Ana Felix, surnamed Ricote, celebrated as much for her own\r\nbeauty as for my wealth. I quitted my native land in search of some\r\nshelter or refuge for us abroad, and having found one in Germany I\r\nreturned in this pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s dress, in the company of some other German\r\npilgrims, to seek my daughter and take up a large quantity of treasure\r\nI had left buried. My daughter I did not find, the treasure I found and\r\nhave with me; and now, in this strange roundabout way you have seen, I\r\nfind the treasure that more than all makes me rich, my beloved\r\ndaughter. If our innocence and her tears and mine can with strict\r\njustice open the door to clemency, extend it to us, for we never had\r\nany intention of injuring you, nor do we sympathise with the aims of\r\nour people, who have been justly banished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know Ricote well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho at this, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know too that what he\r\nsays about Ana Felix being his daughter is true; but as to those other\r\nparticulars about going and coming, and having good or bad intentions,\r\nI say nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile all present stood amazed at this strange occurrence the general\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate your tears will not allow me to keep my oath; live,\r\nfair Ana Felix, all the years that heaven has allotted you; but these\r\nrash insolent fellows must pay the penalty of the crime they have\r\ncommitted;\xe2\x80\x9d and with that he gave orders to have the two Turks who had\r\nkilled his two soldiers hanged at once at the yard-arm. The viceroy,\r\nhowever, begged him earnestly not to hang them, as their behaviour\r\nsavoured rather of madness than of bravado. The general yielded to the\r\nviceroy\xe2\x80\x99s request, for revenge is not easily taken in cold blood. They\r\nthen tried to devise some scheme for rescuing Don Gaspar Gregorio from\r\nthe danger in which he had been left. Ricote offered for that object\r\nmore than two thousand ducats that he had in pearls and gems; they\r\nproposed several plans, but none so good as that suggested by the\r\nrenegade already mentioned, who offered to return to Algiers in a small\r\nvessel of about six banks, manned by Christian rowers, as he knew\r\nwhere, how, and when he could and should land, nor was he ignorant of\r\nthe house in which Don Gaspar was staying. The general and the viceroy\r\nhad some hesitation about placing confidence in the renegade and\r\nentrusting him with the Christians who were to row, but Ana Felix said\r\nshe could answer for him, and her father offered to go and pay the\r\nransom of the Christians if by any chance they should not be\r\nforthcoming. This, then, being agreed upon, the viceroy landed, and Don\r\nAntonio Moreno took the fair Morisco and her father home with him, the\r\nviceroy charging him to give them the best reception and welcome in his\r\npower, while on his own part he offered all that house contained for\r\ntheir entertainment; so great was the good-will and kindliness the\r\nbeauty of Ana Felix had infused into his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np63e.jpg (23K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\nTREATING OF THE ADVENTURE WHICH GAVE DON QUIXOTE MORE UNHAPPINESS THAN\r\nALL THAT HAD HITHERTO BEFALLEN HIM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np64a.jpg (80K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wife of Don Antonio Moreno, so the history says, was extremely\r\nhappy to see Ana Felix in her house. She welcomed her with great\r\nkindness, charmed as well by her beauty as by her intelligence; for in\r\nboth respects the fair Morisco was richly endowed, and all the people\r\nof the city flocked to see her as though they had been summoned by the\r\nringing of the bells.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote told Don Antonio that the plan adopted for releasing Don\r\nGregorio was not a good one, for its risks were greater than its\r\nadvantages, and that it would be better to land himself with his arms\r\nand horse in Barbary; for he would carry him off in spite of the whole\r\nMoorish host, as Don Gaiferos carried off his wife Melisendra.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Sancho on hearing him say so, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or\r\nDon Gaiferos carried off his wife from the mainland, and took her to\r\nFrance by land; but in this case, if by chance we carry off Don\r\nGregorio, we have no way of bringing him to Spain, for there\xe2\x80\x99s the sea\r\nbetween.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a remedy for everything except death,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nthey bring the vessel close to the shore we shall be able to get on\r\nboard though all the world strive to prevent us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour worship hits it off mighty well and mighty easy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a long step from saying to doing;\xe2\x80\x99 and I hold to the\r\nrenegade, for he seems to me an honest good-hearted fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Antonio then said that if the renegade did not prove successful,\r\nthe expedient of the great Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s expedition to Barbary should\r\nbe adopted. Two days afterwards the renegade put to sea in a light\r\nvessel of six oars a-side manned by a stout crew, and two days later\r\nthe galleys made sail eastward, the general having begged the viceroy\r\nto let him know all about the release of Don Gregorio and about Ana\r\nFelix, and the viceroy promised to do as he requested.\r\n\r\nOne morning as Don Quixote went out for a stroll along the beach,\r\narrayed in full armour (for, as he often said, that was \xe2\x80\x9chis only gear,\r\nhis only rest the fray,\xe2\x80\x9d and he never was without it for a moment), he\r\nsaw coming towards him a knight, also in full armour, with a shining\r\nmoon painted on his shield, who, on approaching sufficiently near to be\r\nheard, said in a loud voice, addressing himself to Don Quixote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIllustrious knight, and never sufficiently extolled Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha, I am the Knight of the White Moon, whose unheard-of\r\nachievements will perhaps have recalled him to thy memory. I come to do\r\nbattle with thee and prove the might of thy arm, to the end that I make\r\nthee acknowledge and confess that my lady, let her be who she may, is\r\nincomparably fairer than thy Dulcinea del Toboso. If thou dost\r\nacknowledge this fairly and openly, thou shalt escape death and save me\r\nthe trouble of inflicting it upon thee; if thou fightest and I vanquish\r\nthee, I demand no other satisfaction than that, laying aside arms and\r\nabstaining from going in quest of adventures, thou withdraw and betake\r\nthyself to thine own village for the space of a year, and live there\r\nwithout putting hand to sword, in peace and quiet and beneficial\r\nrepose, the same being needful for the increase of thy substance and\r\nthe salvation of thy soul; and if thou dost vanquish me, my head shall\r\nbe at thy disposal, my arms and horse thy spoils, and the renown of my\r\ndeeds transferred and added to thine. Consider which will be thy best\r\ncourse, and give me thy answer speedily, for this day is all the time I\r\nhave for the despatch of this business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was amazed and astonished, as well at the Knight of the\r\nWhite Moon\xe2\x80\x99s arrogance, as at his reason for delivering the defiance,\r\nand with calm dignity he answered him, \xe2\x80\x9cKnight of the White Moon, of\r\nwhose achievements I have never heard until now, I will venture to\r\nswear you have never seen the illustrious Dulcinea; for had you seen\r\nher I know you would have taken care not to venture yourself upon this\r\nissue, because the sight would have removed all doubt from your mind\r\nthat there ever has been or can be a beauty to be compared with hers;\r\nand so, not saying you lie, but merely that you are not correct in what\r\nyou state, I accept your challenge, with the conditions you have\r\nproposed, and at once, that the day you have fixed may not expire; and\r\nfrom your conditions I except only that of the renown of your\r\nachievements being transferred to me, for I know not of what sort they\r\nare nor what they may amount to; I am satisfied with my own, such as\r\nthey be. Take, therefore, the side of the field you choose, and I will\r\ndo the same; and to whom God shall give it may Saint Peter add his\r\nblessing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Knight of the White Moon had been seen from the city, and it was\r\ntold the viceroy how he was in conversation with Don Quixote. The\r\nviceroy, fancying it must be some fresh adventure got up by Don Antonio\r\nMoreno or some other gentleman of the city, hurried out at once to the\r\nbeach accompanied by Don Antonio and several other gentlemen, just as\r\nDon Quixote was wheeling Rocinante round in order to take up the\r\nnecessary distance. The viceroy upon this, seeing that the pair of them\r\nwere evidently preparing to come to the charge, put himself between\r\nthem, asking them what it was that led them to engage in combat all of\r\na sudden in this way. The Knight of the White Moon replied that it was\r\na question of precedence of beauty; and briefly told him what he had\r\nsaid to Don Quixote, and how the conditions of the defiance agreed upon\r\non both sides had been accepted. The viceroy went over to Don Antonio,\r\nand asked in a low voice did he know who the Knight of the White Moon\r\nwas, or was it some joke they were playing on Don Quixote. Don Antonio\r\nreplied that he neither knew who he was nor whether the defiance was in\r\njoke or in earnest. This answer left the viceroy in a state of\r\nperplexity, not knowing whether he ought to let the combat go on or\r\nnot; but unable to persuade himself that it was anything but a joke he\r\nfell back, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIf there be no other way out of it, gallant\r\nknights, except to confess or die, and Don Quixote is inflexible, and\r\nyour worship of the White Moon still more so, in God\xe2\x80\x99s hand be it, and\r\nfall on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe of the White Moon thanked the viceroy in courteous and well-chosen\r\nwords for the permission he gave them, and so did Don Quixote, who\r\nthen, commending himself with all his heart to heaven and to his\r\nDulcinea, as was his custom on the eve of any combat that awaited him,\r\nproceeded to take a little more distance, as he saw his antagonist was\r\ndoing the same; then, without blast of trumpet or other warlike\r\ninstrument to give them the signal to charge, both at the same instant\r\nwheeled their horses; and he of the White Moon, being the swifter, met\r\nDon Quixote after having traversed two-thirds of the course, and there\r\nencountered him with such violence that, without touching him with his\r\nlance (for he held it high, to all appearance purposely), he hurled Don\r\nQuixote and Rocinante to the earth, a perilous fall. He sprang upon him\r\nat once, and placing the lance over his visor said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nvanquished, sir knight, nay dead unless you admit the conditions of our\r\ndefiance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote, bruised and stupefied, without raising his visor said in a\r\nweak feeble voice as if he were speaking out of a tomb, \xe2\x80\x9cDulcinea del\r\nToboso is the fairest woman in the world, and I the most unfortunate\r\nknight on earth; it is not fitting that this truth should suffer by my\r\nfeebleness; drive your lance home, sir knight, and take my life, since\r\nyou have taken away my honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will I not, in sooth,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the White Moon; \xe2\x80\x9clive the fame\r\nof the lady Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s beauty undimmed as ever; all I require is that\r\nthe great Don Quixote retire to his own home for a year, or for so long\r\na time as shall by me be enjoined upon him, as we agreed before\r\nengaging in this combat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe viceroy, Don Antonio, and several others who were present heard all\r\nthis, and heard too how Don Quixote replied that so long as nothing in\r\nprejudice of Dulcinea was demanded of him, he would observe all the\r\nrest like a true and loyal knight. The engagement given, he of the\r\nWhite Moon wheeled about, and making obeisance to the viceroy with a\r\nmovement of the head, rode away into the city at a half gallop. The\r\nviceroy bade Don Antonio hasten after him, and by some means or other\r\nfind out who he was. They raised Don Quixote up and uncovered his face,\r\nand found him pale and bathed with sweat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np64b.jpg (344K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRocinante from the mere hard measure he had received lay unable to stir\r\nfor the present. Sancho, wholly dejected and woebegone, knew not what\r\nto say or do. He fancied that all was a dream, that the whole business\r\nwas a piece of enchantment. Here was his master defeated, and bound not\r\nto take up arms for a year. He saw the light of the glory of his\r\nachievements obscured; the hopes of the promises lately made him swept\r\naway like smoke before the wind; Rocinante, he feared, was crippled for\r\nlife, and his master\xe2\x80\x99s bones out of joint; for if he were only shaken\r\nout of his madness it would be no small luck. In the end they carried\r\nhim into the city in a hand-chair which the viceroy sent for, and\r\nthither the viceroy himself returned, eager to ascertain who this\r\nKnight of the White Moon was who had left Don Quixote in such a sad\r\nplight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np64e.jpg (44K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\nWHEREIN IS MADE KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE WHITE MOON WAS; LIKEWISE\r\nDON GREGORIO\xe2\x80\x99S RELEASE, AND OTHER EVENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np65a.jpg (149K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Antonio Moreno followed the Knight of the White Moon, and a number\r\nof boys followed him too, nay pursued him, until they had him fairly\r\nhoused in a hostel in the heart of the city. Don Antonio, eager to make\r\nhis acquaintance, entered also; a squire came out to meet him and\r\nremove his armour, and he shut himself into a lower room, still\r\nattended by Don Antonio, whose bread would not bake until he had found\r\nout who he was. He of the White Moon, seeing then that the gentleman\r\nwould not leave him, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know very well, se\xc3\xb1or, what you have come\r\nfor; it is to find out who I am; and as there is no reason why I should\r\nconceal it from you, while my servant here is taking off my armour I\r\nwill tell you the true state of the case, without leaving out anything.\r\nYou must know, se\xc3\xb1or, that I am called the bachelor Samson Carrasco. I\r\nam of the same village as Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose craze and\r\nfolly make all of us who know him feel pity for him, and I am one of\r\nthose who have felt it most; and persuaded that his chance of recovery\r\nlay in quiet and keeping at home and in his own house, I hit upon a\r\ndevice for keeping him there. Three months ago, therefore, I went out\r\nto meet him as a knight-errant, under the assumed name of the Knight of\r\nthe Mirrors, intending to engage him in combat and overcome him without\r\nhurting him, making it the condition of our combat that the vanquished\r\nshould be at the disposal of the victor. What I meant to demand of him\r\n(for I regarded him as vanquished already) was that he should return to\r\nhis own village, and not leave it for a whole year, by which time he\r\nmight be cured. But fate ordered it otherwise, for he vanquished me and\r\nunhorsed me, and so my plan failed. He went his way, and I came back\r\nconquered, covered with shame, and sorely bruised by my fall, which was\r\na particularly dangerous one. But this did not quench my desire to meet\r\nhim again and overcome him, as you have seen to-day. And as he is so\r\nscrupulous in his observance of the laws of knight-errantry, he will,\r\nno doubt, in order to keep his word, obey the injunction I have laid\r\nupon him. This, se\xc3\xb1or, is how the matter stands, and I have nothing\r\nmore to tell you. I implore of you not to betray me, or tell Don\r\nQuixote who I am; so that my honest endeavours may be successful, and\r\nthat a man of excellent wits\xe2\x80\x94were he only rid of the fooleries of\r\nchivalry\xe2\x80\x94may get them back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Antonio, \xe2\x80\x9cmay God forgive you the wrong you have\r\ndone the whole world in trying to bring the most amusing madman in it\r\nback to his senses. Do you not see, se\xc3\xb1or, that the gain by Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s sanity can never equal the enjoyment his crazes give? But my\r\nbelief is that all the se\xc3\xb1or bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s pains will be of no avail to\r\nbring a man so hopelessly cracked to his senses again; and if it were\r\nnot uncharitable, I would say may Don Quixote never be cured, for by\r\nhis recovery we lose not only his own drolleries, but his squire Sancho\r\nPanza\xe2\x80\x99s too, any one of which is enough to turn melancholy itself into\r\nmerriment. However, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold my peace and say nothing to him, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll see whether I am right in my suspicion that Se\xc3\xb1or Carrasco\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nefforts will be fruitless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bachelor replied that at all events the affair promised well, and\r\nhe hoped for a happy result from it; and putting his services at Don\r\nAntonio\xe2\x80\x99s commands he took his leave of him; and having had his armour\r\npacked at once upon a mule, he rode away from the city the same day on\r\nthe horse he rode to battle, and returned to his own country without\r\nmeeting any adventure calling for record in this veracious history.\r\n\r\nDon Antonio reported to the viceroy what Carrasco told him, and the\r\nviceroy was not very well pleased to hear it, for with Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nretirement there was an end to the amusement of all who knew anything\r\nof his mad doings.\r\n\r\nSix days did Don Quixote keep his bed, dejected, melancholy, moody and\r\nout of sorts, brooding over the unhappy event of his defeat. Sancho\r\nstrove to comfort him, and among other things he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cHold up\r\nyour head, se\xc3\xb1or, and be of good cheer if you can, and give thanks to\r\nheaven that if you have had a tumble to the ground you have not come\r\noff with a broken rib; and, as you know that \xe2\x80\x98where they give they\r\ntake,\xe2\x80\x99 and that \xe2\x80\x98there are not always fletches where there are pegs,\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nfig for the doctor, for there\xe2\x80\x99s no need of him to cure this ailment.\r\nLet us go home, and give over going about in search of adventures in\r\nstrange lands and places; rightly looked at, it is I that am the\r\ngreater loser, though it is your worship that has had the worse usage.\r\nWith the government I gave up all wish to be a governor again, but I\r\ndid not give up all longing to be a count; and that will never come to\r\npass if your worship gives up becoming a king by renouncing the calling\r\nof chivalry; and so my hopes are going to turn into smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthou seest my suspension and\r\nretirement is not to exceed a year; I shall soon return to my honoured\r\ncalling, and I shall not be at a loss for a kingdom to win and a county\r\nto bestow on thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay God hear it and sin be deaf,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI have always heard\r\nsay that \xe2\x80\x98a good hope is better than a bad holding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they were talking Don Antonio came in looking extremely pleased and\r\nexclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cReward me for my good news, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote! Don\r\nGregorio and the renegade who went for him have come ashore\xe2\x80\x94ashore do I\r\nsay? They are by this time in the viceroy\xe2\x80\x99s house, and will be here\r\nimmediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote cheered up a little and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOf a truth I am almost ready\r\nto say I should have been glad had it turned out just the other way,\r\nfor it would have obliged me to cross over to Barbary, where by the\r\nmight of my arm I should have restored to liberty, not only Don\r\nGregorio, but all the Christian captives there are in Barbary. But what\r\nam I saying, miserable being that I am? Am I not he that has been\r\nconquered? Am I not he that has been overthrown? Am I not he who must\r\nnot take up arms for a year? Then what am I making professions for;\r\nwhat am I bragging about; when it is fitter for me to handle the\r\ndistaff than the sword?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more of that, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98let the hen live, even though\r\nit be with her pip;\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98to-day for thee and to-morrow for me;\xe2\x80\x99 in these\r\naffairs of encounters and whacks one must not mind them, for he that\r\nfalls to-day may get up to-morrow; unless indeed he chooses to lie in\r\nbed, I mean gives way to weakness and does not pluck up fresh spirit\r\nfor fresh battles; let your worship get up now to receive Don Gregorio;\r\nfor the household seems to be in a bustle, and no doubt he has come by\r\nthis time;\xe2\x80\x9d and so it proved, for as soon as Don Gregorio and the\r\nrenegade had given the viceroy an account of the voyage out and home,\r\nDon Gregorio, eager to see Ana Felix, came with the renegade to Don\r\nAntonio\xe2\x80\x99s house. When they carried him away from Algiers he was in\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s dress; on board the vessel, however, he exchanged it for that\r\nof a captive who escaped with him; but in whatever dress he might be he\r\nlooked like one to be loved and served and esteemed, for he was\r\nsurpassingly well-favoured, and to judge by appearances some seventeen\r\nor eighteen years of age. Ricote and his daughter came out to welcome\r\nhim, the father with tears, the daughter with bashfulness. They did not\r\nembrace each other, for where there is deep love there will never be\r\novermuch boldness. Seen side by side, the comeliness of Don Gregorio\r\nand the beauty of Ana Felix were the admiration of all who were\r\npresent. It was silence that spoke for the lovers at that moment, and\r\ntheir eyes were the tongues that declared their pure and happy\r\nfeelings. The renegade explained the measures and means he had adopted\r\nto rescue Don Gregorio, and Don Gregorio at no great length, but in a\r\nfew words, in which he showed that his intelligence was in advance of\r\nhis years, described the peril and embarrassment he found himself in\r\namong the women with whom he had sojourned. To conclude, Ricote\r\nliberally recompensed and rewarded as well the renegade as the men who\r\nhad rowed; and the renegade effected his readmission into the body of\r\nthe Church and was reconciled with it, and from a rotten limb became by\r\npenance and repentance a clean and sound one.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the viceroy discussed with Don Antonio the steps they\r\nshould take to enable Ana Felix and her father to stay in Spain, for it\r\nseemed to them there could be no objection to a daughter who was so\r\ngood a Christian and a father to all appearance so well disposed\r\nremaining there. Don Antonio offered to arrange the matter at the\r\ncapital, whither he was compelled to go on some other business, hinting\r\nthat many a difficult affair was settled there with the help of favour\r\nand bribes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ricote, who was present during the conversation, \xe2\x80\x9cit will\r\nnot do to rely upon favour or bribes, because with the great Don\r\nBernardino de Velasco, Conde de Salazar, to whom his Majesty has\r\nentrusted our expulsion, neither entreaties nor promises, bribes nor\r\nappeals to compassion, are of any use; for though it is true he mingles\r\nmercy with justice, still, seeing that the whole body of our nation is\r\ntainted and corrupt, he applies to it the cautery that burns rather\r\nthan the salve that soothes; and thus, by prudence, sagacity, care and\r\nthe fear he inspires, he has borne on his mighty shoulders the weight\r\nof this great policy and carried it into effect, all our schemes and\r\nplots, importunities and wiles, being ineffectual to blind his Argus\r\neyes, ever on the watch lest one of us should remain behind in\r\nconcealment, and like a hidden root come in course of time to sprout\r\nand bear poisonous fruit in Spain, now cleansed, and relieved of the\r\nfear in which our vast numbers kept it. Heroic resolve of the great\r\nPhilip the Third, and unparalleled wisdom to have entrusted it to the\r\nsaid Don Bernardino de Velasco!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Antonio, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I am there I will make all\r\npossible efforts, and let heaven do as pleases it best; Don Gregorio\r\nwill come with me to relieve the anxiety which his parents must be\r\nsuffering on account of his absence; Ana Felix will remain in my house\r\nwith my wife, or in a monastery; and I know the viceroy will be glad\r\nthat the worthy Ricote should stay with him until we see what terms I\r\ncan make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe viceroy agreed to all that was proposed; but Don Gregorio on\r\nlearning what had passed declared he could not and would not on any\r\naccount leave Ana Felix; however, as it was his purpose to go and see\r\nhis parents and devise some way of returning for her, he fell in with\r\nthe proposed arrangement. Ana Felix remained with Don Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\r\nand Ricote in the viceroy\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nThe day for Don Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s departure came; and two days later that for\r\nDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s and Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s, for Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s fall did not suffer him\r\nto take the road sooner. There were tears and sighs, swoonings and\r\nsobs, at the parting between Don Gregorio and Ana Felix. Ricote offered\r\nDon Gregorio a thousand crowns if he would have them, but he would not\r\ntake any save five which Don Antonio lent him and he promised to repay\r\nat the capital. So the two of them took their departure, and Don\r\nQuixote and Sancho afterwards, as has been already said, Don Quixote\r\nwithout his armour and in travelling gear, and Sancho on foot, Dapple\r\nbeing loaded with the armour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np65e.jpg (43K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\nWHICH TREATS OF WHAT HE WHO READS WILL SEE, OR WHAT HE WHO HAS IT READ\r\nTO HIM WILL HEAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np66a.jpg (125K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he left Barcelona, Don Quixote turned gaze upon the spot where he\r\nhad fallen. \xe2\x80\x9cHere Troy was,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9chere my ill-luck, not my\r\ncowardice, robbed me of all the glory I had won; here Fortune made me\r\nthe victim of her caprices; here the lustre of my achievements was\r\ndimmed; here, in a word, fell my happiness never to rise again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np66b.jpg (251K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho on hearing this, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the part of brave hearts\r\nto be patient in adversity just as much as to be glad in prosperity; I\r\njudge by myself, for, if when I was a governor I was glad, now that I\r\nam a squire and on foot I am not sad; and I have heard say that she\r\nwhom commonly they call Fortune is a drunken whimsical jade, and, what\r\nis more, blind, and therefore neither sees what she does, nor knows\r\nwhom she casts down or whom she sets up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art a great philosopher, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthou\r\nspeakest very sensibly; I know not who taught thee. But I can tell thee\r\nthere is no such thing as Fortune in the world, nor does anything which\r\ntakes place there, be it good or bad, come about by chance, but by the\r\nspecial preordination of heaven; and hence the common saying that \xe2\x80\x98each\r\nof us is the maker of his own Fortune.\xe2\x80\x99 I have been that of mine; but\r\nnot with the proper amount of prudence, and my self-confidence has\r\ntherefore made me pay dearly; for I ought to have reflected that\r\nRocinante\xe2\x80\x99s feeble strength could not resist the mighty bulk of the\r\nKnight of the White Moon\xe2\x80\x99s horse. In a word, I ventured it, I did my\r\nbest, I was overthrown, but though I lost my honour I did not lose nor\r\ncan I lose the virtue of keeping my word. When I was a knight-errant,\r\ndaring and valiant, I supported my achievements by hand and deed, and\r\nnow that I am a humble squire I will support my words by keeping the\r\npromise I have given. Forward then, Sancho my friend, let us go to keep\r\nthe year of the novitiate in our own country, and in that seclusion we\r\nshall pick up fresh strength to return to the by me never-forgotten\r\ncalling of arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9ctravelling on foot is not such a pleasant\r\nthing that it makes me feel disposed or tempted to make long marches.\r\nLet us leave this armour hung up on some tree, instead of someone that\r\nhas been hanged; and then with me on Dapple\xe2\x80\x99s back and my feet off the\r\nground we will arrange the stages as your worship pleases to measure\r\nthem out; but to suppose that I am going to travel on foot, and make\r\nlong ones, is to suppose nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou sayest well, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9clet my armour be hung up\r\nfor a trophy, and under it or round it we will carve on the trees what\r\nwas inscribed on the trophy of Roland\xe2\x80\x99s armour-\r\n\r\nThese let none move\r\nWho dareth not his might with Roland prove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the very thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand if it was not that we should\r\nfeel the want of Rocinante on the road, it would be as well to leave\r\nhim hung up too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, I had rather not have either him or the armour hung up,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDon Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it may not be said, \xe2\x80\x98for good service a bad\r\nreturn.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour worship is right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, as sensible people hold,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98the fault of the ass must not be laid on the pack-saddle;\xe2\x80\x99 and, as in\r\nthis affair the fault is your worship\xe2\x80\x99s, punish yourself and don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nyour anger break out against the already battered and bloody armour, or\r\nthe meekness of Rocinante, or the tenderness of my feet, trying to make\r\nthem travel more than is reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np66c.jpg (389K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn converse of this sort the whole of that day went by, as did the four\r\nsucceeding ones, without anything occurring to interrupt their journey,\r\nbut on the fifth as they entered a village they found a great number of\r\npeople at the door of an inn enjoying themselves, as it was a holiday.\r\nUpon Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s approach a peasant called out, \xe2\x80\x9cOne of these two\r\ngentlemen who come here, and who don\xe2\x80\x99t know the parties, will tell us\r\nwhat we ought to do about our wager.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand according to the\r\nrights of the case, if I can manage to understand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here it is, worthy sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the peasant; \xe2\x80\x9ca man of this\r\nvillage who is so fat that he weighs twenty stone challenged another, a\r\nneighbour of his, who does not weigh more than nine, to run a race. The\r\nagreement was that they were to run a distance of a hundred paces with\r\nequal weights; and when the challenger was asked how the weights were\r\nto be equalised he said that the other, as he weighed nine stone,\r\nshould put eleven in iron on his back, and that in this way the twenty\r\nstone of the thin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sancho at once, before Don Quixote could\r\nanswer; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s for me, that only a few days ago left off being a\r\ngovernor and a judge, as all the world knows, to settle these doubtful\r\nquestions and give an opinion in disputes of all sorts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer in God\xe2\x80\x99s name, Sancho my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am\r\nnot fit to give crumbs to a cat, my wits are so confused and upset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this permission Sancho said to the peasants who stood clustered\r\nround him, waiting with open mouths for the decision to come from his,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrothers, what the fat man requires is not in reason, nor has it a\r\nshadow of justice in it; because, if it be true, as they say, that the\r\nchallenged may choose the weapons, the other has no right to choose\r\nsuch as will prevent and keep him from winning. My decision, therefore,\r\nis that the fat challenger prune, peel, thin, trim and correct himself,\r\nand take eleven stone of his flesh off his body, here or there, as he\r\npleases, and as suits him best; and being in this way reduced to nine\r\nstone weight, he will make himself equal and even with nine stone of\r\nhis opponent, and they will be able to run on equal terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all that\xe2\x80\x99s good,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the peasants as he heard Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndecision, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the gentleman has spoken like a saint, and given\r\njudgment like a canon! But I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound the fat man won\xe2\x80\x99t part with an\r\nounce of his flesh, not to say eleven stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best plan will be for them not to run,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, \xe2\x80\x9cso that\r\nneither the thin man break down under the weight, nor the fat one strip\r\nhimself of his flesh; let half the wager be spent in wine, and let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntake these gentlemen to the tavern where there\xe2\x80\x99s the best, and \xe2\x80\x98over me\r\nbe the cloak when it rains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I cannot stop for an\r\ninstant, for sad thoughts and unhappy circumstances force me to seem\r\ndiscourteous and to travel apace;\xe2\x80\x9d and spurring Rocinante he pushed on,\r\nleaving them wondering at what they had seen and heard, at his own\r\nstrange figure and at the shrewdness of his servant, for such they took\r\nSancho to be; and another of them observed, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the servant is so\r\nclever, what must the master be? I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet, if they are going to\r\nSalamanca to study, they\xe2\x80\x99ll come to be alcaldes of the Court in a\r\ntrice; for it\xe2\x80\x99s a mere joke\xe2\x80\x94only to read and read, and have interest\r\nand good luck; and before a man knows where he is he finds himself with\r\na staff in his hand or a mitre on his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night master and man passed out in the fields in the open air, and\r\nthe next day as they were pursuing their journey they saw coming\r\ntowards them a man on foot with alforjas at the neck and a javelin or\r\nspiked staff in his hand, the very cut of a foot courier; who, as soon\r\nas he came close to Don Quixote, increased his pace and half running\r\ncame up to him, and embracing his right thigh, for he could reach no\r\nhigher, exclaimed with evident pleasure, \xe2\x80\x9cO Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote of La\r\nMancha, what happiness it will be to the heart of my lord the duke when\r\nhe knows your worship is coming back to his castle, for he is still\r\nthere with my lady the duchess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not recognise you, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cnor do I know who\r\nyou are, unless you tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Tosilos, my lord the duke\xe2\x80\x99s lacquey, Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nthe courier; \xe2\x80\x9che who refused to fight your worship about marrying the\r\ndaughter of Do\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless me!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cis it possible that you are the\r\none whom mine enemies the enchanters changed into the lacquey you speak\r\nof in order to rob me of the honour of that battle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, good sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the messenger; \xe2\x80\x9cthere was no enchantment or\r\ntransformation at all; I entered the lists just as much lacquey Tosilos\r\nas I came out of them lacquey Tosilos. I thought to marry without\r\nfighting, for the girl had taken my fancy; but my scheme had a very\r\ndifferent result, for as soon as your worship had left the castle my\r\nlord the duke had a hundred strokes of the stick given me for having\r\nacted contrary to the orders he gave me before engaging in the combat;\r\nand the end of the whole affair is that the girl has become a nun, and\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Rodriguez has gone back to Castile, and I am now on my way to\r\nBarcelona with a packet of letters for the viceroy which my master is\r\nsending him. If your worship would like a drop, sound though warm, I\r\nhave a gourd here full of the best, and some scraps of Tronchon cheese\r\nthat will serve as a provocative and wakener of your thirst if so be it\r\nis asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take the offer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cno more compliments about it; pour\r\nout, good Tosilos, in spite of all the enchanters in the Indies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art indeed the greatest glutton in the world, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand the greatest booby on earth, not to be able to see that\r\nthis courier is enchanted and this Tosilos a sham one; stop with him\r\nand take thy fill; I will go on slowly and wait for thee to come up\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lacquey laughed, unsheathed his gourd, unwalletted his scraps, and\r\ntaking out a small loaf of bread he and Sancho seated themselves on the\r\ngreen grass, and in peace and good fellowship finished off the contents\r\nof the alforjas down to the bottom, so resolutely that they licked the\r\nwrapper of the letters, merely because it smelt of cheese.\r\n\r\nSaid Tosilos to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond a doubt, Sancho my friend, this master\r\nof thine ought to be a madman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOught!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9che owes no man anything; he pays for everything,\r\nparticularly when the coin is madness. I see it plain enough, and I\r\ntell him so plain enough; but what\xe2\x80\x99s the use? especially now that it is\r\nall over with him, for here he is beaten by the Knight of the White\r\nMoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTosilos begged him to explain what had happened him, but Sancho replied\r\nthat it would not be good manners to leave his master waiting for him;\r\nand that some other day if they met there would be time enough for\r\nthat; and then getting up, after shaking his doublet and brushing the\r\ncrumbs out of his beard, he drove Dapple on before him, and bidding\r\nadieu to Tosilos left him and rejoined his master, who was waiting for\r\nhim under the shade of a tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np66e.jpg (29K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\nOF THE RESOLUTION DON QUIXOTE FORMED TO TURN SHEPHERD AND TAKE TO A\r\nLIFE IN THE FIELDS WHILE THE YEAR FOR WHICH HE HAD GIVEN HIS WORD WAS\r\nRUNNING ITS COURSE; WITH OTHER EVENTS TRULY DELECTABLE AND HAPPY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np67a.jpg (145K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a multitude of reflections used to harass Don Quixote before he had\r\nbeen overthrown, a great many more harassed him since his fall. He was\r\nunder the shade of a tree, as has been said, and there, like flies on\r\nhoney, thoughts came crowding upon him and stinging him. Some of them\r\nturned upon the disenchantment of Dulcinea, others upon the life he was\r\nabout to lead in his enforced retirement. Sancho came up and spoke in\r\nhigh praise of the generous disposition of the lacquey Tosilos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat thou dost still think\r\nthat he yonder is a real lacquey? Apparently it has escaped thy memory\r\nthat thou hast seen Dulcinea turned and transformed into a peasant\r\nwench, and the Knight of the Mirrors into the bachelor Carrasco; all\r\nthe work of the enchanters that persecute me. But tell me now, didst\r\nthou ask this Tosilos, as thou callest him, what has become of\r\nAltisidora, did she weep over my absence, or has she already consigned\r\nto oblivion the love thoughts that used to afflict her when I was\r\npresent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thoughts that I had,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwere not such as to leave time\r\nfor asking fool\xe2\x80\x99s questions. Body o\xe2\x80\x99 me, se\xc3\xb1or! is your worship in a\r\ncondition now to inquire into other people\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, above all love\r\nthoughts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook ye, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a great difference\r\nbetween what is done out of love and what is done out of gratitude. A\r\nknight may very possibly be proof against love; but it is impossible,\r\nstrictly speaking, for him to be ungrateful. Altisidora, to all\r\nappearance, loved me truly; she gave me the three kerchiefs thou\r\nknowest of; she wept at my departure, she cursed me, she abused me,\r\ncasting shame to the winds she bewailed herself in public; all signs\r\nthat she adored me; for the wrath of lovers always ends in curses. I\r\nhad no hopes to give her, nor treasures to offer her, for mine are\r\ngiven to Dulcinea, and the treasures of knights-errant are like those\r\nof the fairies,\xe2\x80\x99 illusory and deceptive; all I can give her is the\r\nplace in my memory I keep for her, without prejudice, however, to that\r\nwhich I hold devoted to Dulcinea, whom thou art wronging by thy\r\nremissness in whipping thyself and scourging that flesh\xe2\x80\x94would that I\r\nsaw it eaten by wolves\xe2\x80\x94which would rather keep itself for the worms\r\nthan for the relief of that poor lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cif the truth is to be told, I cannot persuade\r\nmyself that the whipping of my backside has anything to do with the\r\ndisenchantment of the enchanted; it is like saying, \xe2\x80\x98If your head aches\r\nrub ointment on your knees;\xe2\x80\x99 at any rate I\xe2\x80\x99ll make bold to swear that\r\nin all the histories dealing with knight-errantry that your worship has\r\nread you have never come across anybody disenchanted by whipping; but\r\nwhether or no I\xe2\x80\x99ll whip myself when I have a fancy for it, and the\r\nopportunity serves for scourging myself comfortably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand heaven give thee grace to take\r\nit to heart and own the obligation thou art under to help my lady, who\r\nis thine also, inasmuch as thou art mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they pursued their journey talking in this way they came to the very\r\nsame spot where they had been trampled on by the bulls. Don Quixote\r\nrecognised it, and said he to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the meadow where we came\r\nupon those gay shepherdesses and gallant shepherds who were trying to\r\nrevive and imitate the pastoral Arcadia there, an idea as novel as it\r\nwas happy, in emulation whereof, if so be thou dost approve of it,\r\nSancho, I would have ourselves turn shepherds, at any rate for the time\r\nI have to live in retirement. I will buy some ewes and everything else\r\nrequisite for the pastoral calling; and, I under the name of the\r\nshepherd Quixotize and thou as the shepherd Panzino, we will roam the\r\nwoods and groves and meadows singing songs here, lamenting in elegies\r\nthere, drinking of the crystal waters of the springs or limpid brooks\r\nor flowing rivers. The oaks will yield us their sweet fruit with\r\nbountiful hand, the trunks of the hard cork trees a seat, the willows\r\nshade, the roses perfume, the widespread meadows carpets tinted with a\r\nthousand dyes; the clear pure air will give us breath, the moon and\r\nstars lighten the darkness of the night for us, song shall be our\r\ndelight, lamenting our joy, Apollo will supply us with verses, and love\r\nwith conceits whereby we shall make ourselves famed for ever, not only\r\nin this but in ages to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEgad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that sort of life squares, nay corners, with\r\nmy notions; and what is more the bachelor Samson Carrasco and Master\r\nNicholas the barber won\xe2\x80\x99t have well seen it before they\xe2\x80\x99ll want to\r\nfollow it and turn shepherds along with us; and God grant it may not\r\ncome into the curate\xe2\x80\x99s head to join the sheepfold too, he\xe2\x80\x99s so jovial\r\nand fond of enjoying himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art in the right of it, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand the\r\nbachelor Samson Carrasco, if he enters the pastoral fraternity, as no\r\ndoubt he will, may call himself the shepherd Samsonino, or perhaps the\r\nshepherd Carrascon; Nicholas the barber may call himself Niculoso, as\r\nold Boscan formerly was called Nemoroso; as for the curate I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat name we can fit to him unless it be something derived from his\r\ntitle, and we call him the shepherd Curiambro. For the shepherdesses\r\nwhose lovers we shall be, we can pick names as we would pears; and as\r\nmy lady\xe2\x80\x99s name does just as well for a shepherdess\xe2\x80\x99s as for a\r\nprincess\xe2\x80\x99s, I need not trouble myself to look for one that will suit\r\nher better; to thine, Sancho, thou canst give what name thou wilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to give her any but Teresona,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich will\r\ngo well with her stoutness and with her own right name, as she is\r\ncalled Teresa; and then when I sing her praises in my verses I\xe2\x80\x99ll show\r\nhow chaste my passion is, for I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to look \xe2\x80\x98for better bread\r\nthan ever came from wheat\xe2\x80\x99 in other men\xe2\x80\x99s houses. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do for the\r\ncurate to have a shepherdess, for the sake of good example; and if the\r\nbachelor chooses to have one, that is his look-out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless me, Sancho my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a life we\r\nshall lead! What hautboys and Zamora bagpipes we shall hear, what\r\ntabors, timbrels, and rebecks! And then if among all these different\r\nsorts of music that of the albogues is heard, almost all the pastoral\r\ninstruments will be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are albogues?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I never in my life heard tell\r\nof them or saw them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlbogues,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9care brass plates like candlesticks that\r\nstruck against one another on the hollow side make a noise which, if\r\nnot very pleasing or harmonious, is not disagreeable and accords very\r\nwell with the rude notes of the bagpipe and tabor. The word albogue is\r\nMorisco, as are all those in our Spanish tongue that begin with _al;_\r\nfor example, _almohaza, almorzar, alhombra, alguacil, alhucema,\r\nalmacen, alcancia_, and others of the same sort, of which there are not\r\nmany more; our language has only three that are Morisco and end in _i_,\r\nwhich are _borcegu\xc3\xad, zaquizam\xc3\xad_, and _maraved\xc3\xad. Alhel\xc3\xad_ and _alfaqu\xc3\xad_\r\nare seen to be Arabic, as well by the _al_ at the beginning as by the\r\n_\xc3\xad_ they end with. I mention this incidentally, the chance allusion to\r\nalbogues having reminded me of it; and it will be of great assistance\r\nto us in the perfect practice of this calling that I am something of a\r\npoet, as thou knowest, and that besides the bachelor Samson Carrasco is\r\nan accomplished one. Of the curate I say nothing; but I will wager he\r\nhas some spice of the poet in him, and no doubt Master Nicholas too,\r\nfor all barbers, or most of them, are guitar players and stringers of\r\nverses. I will bewail my separation; thou shalt glorify thyself as a\r\nconstant lover; the shepherd Carrascon will figure as a rejected one,\r\nand the curate Curiambro as whatever may please him best; and so all\r\nwill go as gaily as heart could wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Sancho made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so unlucky, se\xc3\xb1or, that I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\nthe day will never come when I\xe2\x80\x99ll see myself at such a calling. O what\r\nneat spoons I\xe2\x80\x99ll make when I\xe2\x80\x99m a shepherd! What messes, creams,\r\ngarlands, pastoral odds and ends! And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t get me a name for\r\nwisdom, they\xe2\x80\x99ll not fail to get me one for ingenuity. My daughter\r\nSanchica will bring us our dinner to the pasture. But stay\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood-looking, and shepherds there are with more mischief than\r\nsimplicity in them; I would not have her \xe2\x80\x98come for wool and go back\r\nshorn;\xe2\x80\x99 love-making and lawless desires are just as common in the\r\nfields as in the cities, and in shepherds\xe2\x80\x99 shanties as in royal\r\npalaces; \xe2\x80\x98do away with the cause, you do away with the sin;\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98if eyes\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see hearts don\xe2\x80\x99t break\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98better a clear escape than good\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s prayers.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA truce to thy proverbs, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cany one of\r\nthose thou hast uttered would suffice to explain thy meaning; many a\r\ntime have I recommended thee not to be so lavish with proverbs and to\r\nexercise some moderation in delivering them; but it seems to me it is\r\nonly \xe2\x80\x98preaching in the desert;\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98my mother beats me and I go on with my\r\ntricks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your worship is like the common\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98Said the frying-pan to the kettle, Get away, blackbreech.\xe2\x80\x99 You\r\nchide me for uttering proverbs, and you string them in couples\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObserve, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI bring in proverbs to the\r\npurpose, and when I quote them they fit like a ring to the finger; thou\r\nbringest them in by the head and shoulders, in such a way that thou\r\ndost drag them in, rather than introduce them; if I am not mistaken, I\r\nhave told thee already that proverbs are short maxims drawn from the\r\nexperience and observation of our wise men of old; but the proverb that\r\nis not to the purpose is a piece of nonsense and not a maxim. But\r\nenough of this; as nightfall is drawing on let us retire some little\r\ndistance from the high road to pass the night; what is in store for us\r\nto-morrow God knoweth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey turned aside, and supped late and poorly, very much against\r\nSancho\xe2\x80\x99s will, who turned over in his mind the hardships attendant upon\r\nknight-errantry in woods and forests, even though at times plenty\r\npresented itself in castles and houses, as at Don Diego de Miranda\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nat the wedding of Camacho the Rich, and at Don Antonio Moreno\xe2\x80\x99s; he\r\nreflected, however, that it could not be always day, nor always night;\r\nand so that night he passed in sleeping, and his master in waking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np67e.jpg (55K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\nOF THE BRISTLY ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np68a.jpg (119K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night was somewhat dark, for though there was a moon in the sky it\r\nwas not in a quarter where she could be seen; for sometimes the lady\r\nDiana goes on a stroll to the antipodes, and leaves the mountains all\r\nblack and the valleys in darkness. Don Quixote obeyed nature so far as\r\nto sleep his first sleep, but did not give way to the second, very\r\ndifferent from Sancho, who never had any second, because with him sleep\r\nlasted from night till morning, wherein he showed what a sound\r\nconstitution and few cares he had. Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s cares kept him\r\nrestless, so much so that he awoke Sancho and said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\namazed, Sancho, at the unconcern of thy temperament. I believe thou art\r\nmade of marble or hard brass, incapable of any emotion or feeling\r\nwhatever. I lie awake while thou sleepest, I weep while thou singest, I\r\nam faint with fasting while thou art sluggish and torpid from pure\r\nrepletion. It is the duty of good servants to share the sufferings and\r\nfeel the sorrows of their masters, if it be only for the sake of\r\nappearances. See the calmness of the night, the solitude of the spot,\r\ninviting us to break our slumbers by a vigil of some sort. Rise as thou\r\nlivest, and retire a little distance, and with a good heart and\r\ncheerful courage give thyself three or four hundred lashes on account\r\nof Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s disenchantment score; and this I entreat of thee, making\r\nit a request, for I have no desire to come to grips with thee a second\r\ntime, as I know thou hast a heavy hand. As soon as thou hast laid them\r\non we will pass the rest of the night, I singing my separation, thou\r\nthy constancy, making a beginning at once with the pastoral life we are\r\nto follow at our village.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no monk to get up out of the middle of my\r\nsleep and scourge myself, nor does it seem to me that one can pass from\r\none extreme of the pain of whipping to the other of music. Will your\r\nworship let me sleep, and not worry me about whipping myself? or you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake me swear never to touch a hair of my doublet, not to say my\r\nflesh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO hard heart!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cO pitiless squire! O bread\r\nill-bestowed and favours ill-acknowledged, both those I have done thee\r\nand those I mean to do thee! Through me hast thou seen thyself a\r\ngovernor, and through me thou seest thyself in immediate expectation of\r\nbeing a count, or obtaining some other equivalent title, for I\xe2\x80\x94_post\r\ntenebras spero lucem_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9call I know is that so long\r\nas I am asleep I have neither fear nor hope, trouble nor glory; and\r\ngood luck betide him that invented sleep, the cloak that covers over\r\nall a man\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, the food that removes hunger, the drink that\r\ndrives away thirst, the fire that warms the cold, the cold that tempers\r\nthe heat, and, to wind up with, the universal coin wherewith everything\r\nis bought, the weight and balance that makes the shepherd equal with\r\nthe king and the fool with the wise man. Sleep, I have heard say, has\r\nonly one fault, that it is like death; for between a sleeping man and a\r\ndead man there is very little difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever have I heard thee speak so elegantly as now, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nQuixote; \xe2\x80\x9cand here I begin to see the truth of the proverb thou dost\r\nsometimes quote, \xe2\x80\x98Not with whom thou art bred, but with whom thou art\r\nfed.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, by my life, master mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not I that am\r\nstringing proverbs now, for they drop in pairs from your worship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth faster than from mine; only there is this difference between mine\r\nand yours, that yours are well-timed and mine are untimely; but anyhow,\r\nthey are all proverbs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point they became aware of a harsh indistinct noise that seemed\r\nto spread through all the valleys around. Don Quixote stood up and laid\r\nhis hand upon his sword, and Sancho ensconced himself under Dapple and\r\nput the bundle of armour on one side of him and the ass\xe2\x80\x99s pack-saddle\r\non the other, in fear and trembling as great as Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperturbation. Each instant the noise increased and came nearer to the\r\ntwo terrified men, or at least to one, for as to the other, his courage\r\nis known to all. The fact of the matter was that some men were taking\r\nabove six hundred pigs to sell at a fair, and were on their way with\r\nthem at that hour, and so great was the noise they made and their\r\ngrunting and blowing, that they deafened the ears of Don Quixote and\r\nSancho Panza, and they could not make out what it was. The wide-spread\r\ngrunting drove came on in a surging mass, and without showing any\r\nrespect for Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s dignity or Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s, passed right over the\r\npair of them, demolishing Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s entrenchments, and not only\r\nupsetting Don Quixote but sweeping Rocinante off his feet into the\r\nbargain; and what with the trampling and the grunting, and the pace at\r\nwhich the unclean beasts went, pack-saddle, armour, Dapple and\r\nRocinante were left scattered on the ground and Sancho and Don Quixote\r\nat their wits\xe2\x80\x99 end.\r\n\r\nSancho got up as well as he could and begged his master to give him his\r\nsword, saying he wanted to kill half a dozen of those dirty unmannerly\r\npigs, for he had by this time found out that that was what they were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them be, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthis insult is the penalty\r\nof my sin; and it is the righteous chastisement of heaven that jackals\r\nshould devour a vanquished knight, and wasps sting him and pigs trample\r\nhim under foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it is the chastisement of heaven, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nflies should prick the squires of vanquished knights, and lice eat\r\nthem, and hunger assail them. If we squires were the sons of the\r\nknights we serve, or their very near relations, it would be no wonder\r\nif the penalty of their misdeeds overtook us, even to the fourth\r\ngeneration. But what have the Panzas to do with the Quixotes? Well,\r\nwell, let\xe2\x80\x99s lie down again and sleep out what little of the night\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s left, and God will send us dawn and we shall be all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np68b.jpg (345K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSleep thou, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor thou wast born to\r\nsleep as I was born to watch; and during the time it now wants of dawn\r\nI will give a loose rein to my thoughts, and seek a vent for them in a\r\nlittle madrigal which, unknown to thee, I composed in my head last\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the thoughts that allow one to\r\nmake verses cannot be of great consequence; let your worship string\r\nverses as much as you like and I\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep as much as I can;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nforthwith, taking the space of ground he required, he muffled himself\r\nup and fell into a sound sleep, undisturbed by bond, debt, or trouble\r\nof any sort. Don Quixote, propped up against the trunk of a beech or a\r\ncork tree\xe2\x80\x94for Cide Hamete does not specify what kind of tree it\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94sang in this strain to the accompaniment of his own sighs:\r\n\r\nWhen in my mind\r\nI muse, O Love, upon thy cruelty,\r\nTo death I flee,\r\nIn hope therein the end of all to find.\r\n\r\nBut drawing near\r\nThat welcome haven in my sea of woe,\r\nSuch joy I know,\r\nThat life revives, and still I linger here.\r\n\r\nThus life doth slay,\r\nAnd death again to life restoreth me;\r\nStrange destiny,\r\nThat deals with life and death as with a play!\r\n\r\n\r\nHe accompanied each verse with many sighs and not a few tears, just\r\nlike one whose heart was pierced with grief at his defeat and his\r\nseparation from Dulcinea.\r\n\r\nAnd now daylight came, and the sun smote Sancho on the eyes with his\r\nbeams. He awoke, roused himself up, shook himself and stretched his\r\nlazy limbs, and seeing the havoc the pigs had made with his stores he\r\ncursed the drove, and more besides. Then the pair resumed their\r\njourney, and as evening closed in they saw coming towards them some ten\r\nmen on horseback and four or five on foot. Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat\r\nquick and Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s quailed with fear, for the persons approaching them\r\ncarried lances and bucklers, and were in very warlike guise. Don\r\nQuixote turned to Sancho and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could make use of my weapons,\r\nand my promise had not tied my hands, I would count this host that\r\ncomes against us but cakes and fancy bread; but perhaps it may prove\r\nsomething different from what we apprehend.\xe2\x80\x9d The men on horseback now\r\ncame up, and raising their lances surrounded Don Quixote in silence,\r\nand pointed them at his back and breast, menacing him with death. One\r\nof those on foot, putting his finger to his lips as a sign to him to be\r\nsilent, seized Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s bridle and drew him out of the road, and the\r\nothers driving Sancho and Dapple before them, and all maintaining a\r\nstrange silence, followed in the steps of the one who led Don Quixote.\r\nThe latter two or three times attempted to ask where they were taking\r\nhim to and what they wanted, but the instant he began to open his lips\r\nthey threatened to close them with the points of their lances; and\r\nSancho fared the same way, for the moment he seemed about to speak one\r\nof those on foot punched him with a goad, and Dapple likewise, as if he\r\ntoo wanted to talk. Night set in, they quickened their pace, and the\r\nfears of the two prisoners grew greater, especially as they heard\r\nthemselves assailed with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGet on, ye Troglodytes;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSilence, ye\r\nbarbarians;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMarch, ye cannibals;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo murmuring, ye Scythians;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t open your eyes, ye murderous Polyphemes, ye blood-thirsty\r\nlions,\xe2\x80\x9d and suchlike names with which their captors harassed the ears\r\nof the wretched master and man. Sancho went along saying to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe, tortolites, barbers, animals! I don\xe2\x80\x99t like those names at all;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s in a bad wind our corn is being winnowed;\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98misfortune comes upon\r\nus all at once like sticks on a dog,\xe2\x80\x99 and God grant it may be no worse\r\nthan them that this unlucky adventure has in store for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote rode completely dazed, unable with the aid of all his wits\r\nto make out what could be the meaning of these abusive names they\r\ncalled them, and the only conclusion he could arrive at was that there\r\nwas no good to be hoped for and much evil to be feared. And now, about\r\nan hour after midnight, they reached a castle which Don Quixote saw at\r\nonce was the duke\xe2\x80\x99s, where they had been but a short time before. \xe2\x80\x9cGod\r\nbless me!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as he recognised the mansion, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does this mean?\r\nIt is all courtesy and politeness in this house; but with the\r\nvanquished good turns into evil, and evil into worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey entered the chief court of the castle and found it prepared and\r\nfitted up in a style that added to their amazement and doubled their\r\nfears, as will be seen in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np68e.jpg (49K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\nOF THE STRANGEST AND MOST EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON\r\nQUIXOTE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF THIS GREAT HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np69a.jpg (141K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe horsemen dismounted, and, together with the men on foot, without a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s delay taking up Sancho and Don Quixote bodily, they carried\r\nthem into the court, all round which near a hundred torches fixed in\r\nsockets were burning, besides above five hundred lamps in the\r\ncorridors, so that in spite of the night, which was somewhat dark, the\r\nwant of daylight could not be perceived. In the middle of the court was\r\na catafalque, raised about two yards above the ground and covered\r\ncompletely by an immense canopy of black velvet, and on the steps all\r\nround it white wax tapers burned in more than a hundred silver\r\ncandlesticks. Upon the catafalque was seen the dead body of a damsel so\r\nlovely that by her beauty she made death itself look beautiful. She lay\r\nwith her head resting upon a cushion of brocade and crowned with a\r\ngarland of sweet-smelling flowers of divers sorts, her hands crossed\r\nupon her bosom, and between them a branch of yellow palm of victory. On\r\none side of the court was erected a stage, where upon two chairs were\r\nseated two persons who from having crowns on their heads and sceptres\r\nin their hands appeared to be kings of some sort, whether real or mock\r\nones. By the side of this stage, which was reached by steps, were two\r\nother chairs on which the men carrying the prisoners seated Don Quixote\r\nand Sancho, all in silence, and by signs giving them to understand that\r\nthey too were to be silent; which, however, they would have been\r\nwithout any signs, for their amazement at all they saw held them\r\ntongue-tied. And now two persons of distinction, who were at once\r\nrecognised by Don Quixote as his hosts the duke and duchess, ascended\r\nthe stage attended by a numerous suite, and seated themselves on two\r\ngorgeous chairs close to the two kings, as they seemed to be. Who would\r\nnot have been amazed at this? Nor was this all, for Don Quixote had\r\nperceived that the dead body on the catafalque was that of the fair\r\nAltisidora. As the duke and duchess mounted the stage Don Quixote and\r\nSancho rose and made them a profound obeisance, which they returned by\r\nbowing their heads slightly. At this moment an official crossed over,\r\nand approaching Sancho threw over him a robe of black buckram painted\r\nall over with flames of fire, and taking off his cap put upon his head\r\na mitre such as those undergoing the sentence of the Holy Office wear;\r\nand whispered in his ear that he must not open his lips, or they would\r\nput a gag upon him, or take his life. Sancho surveyed himself from head\r\nto foot and saw himself all ablaze with flames; but as they did not\r\nburn him, he did not care two farthings for them. He took off the mitre\r\nand seeing it painted with devils he put it on again, saying to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, so far those don\xe2\x80\x99t burn me nor do these carry me off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nDon Quixote surveyed him too, and though fear had got the better of his\r\nfaculties, he could not help smiling to see the figure Sancho\r\npresented. And now from underneath the catafalque, so it seemed, there\r\nrose a low sweet sound of flutes, which, coming unbroken by human voice\r\n(for there silence itself kept silence), had a soft and languishing\r\neffect. Then, beside the pillow of what seemed to be the dead body,\r\nsuddenly appeared a fair youth in a Roman habit, who, to the\r\naccompaniment of a harp which he himself played, sang in a sweet and\r\nclear voice these two stanzas:\r\n\r\nWhile fair Altisidora, who the sport\r\nOf cold Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s cruelty hath been,\r\nReturns to life, and in this magic court\r\nThe dames in sables come to grace the scene,\r\nAnd while her matrons all in seemly sort\r\nMy lady robes in baize and bombazine,\r\nHer beauty and her sorrows will I sing\r\nWith defter quill than touched the Thracian string.\r\n\r\nBut not in life alone, methinks, to me\r\nBelongs the office; Lady, when my tongue\r\nIs cold in death, believe me, unto thee\r\nMy voice shall raise its tributary song.\r\nMy soul, from this strait prison-house set free,\r\nAs o\xe2\x80\x99er the Stygian lake it floats along,\r\nThy praises singing still shall hold its way,\r\nAnd make the waters of oblivion stay.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point one of the two that looked like kings exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cEnough,\r\nenough, divine singer! It would be an endless task to put before us now\r\nthe death and the charms of the peerless Altisidora, not dead as the\r\nignorant world imagines, but living in the voice of fame and in the\r\npenance which Sancho Panza, here present, has to undergo to restore her\r\nto the long-lost light. Do thou, therefore, O Rhadamanthus, who sittest\r\nin judgment with me in the murky caverns of Dis, as thou knowest all\r\nthat the inscrutable fates have decreed touching the resuscitation of\r\nthis damsel, announce and declare it at once, that the happiness we\r\nlook forward to from her restoration be no longer deferred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Minos the fellow judge of Rhadamanthus said this, than\r\nRhadamanthus rising up said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, officials of this house, high and low, great and small, make haste\r\nhither one and all, and print on Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s face four-and-twenty smacks,\r\nand give him twelve pinches and six pin thrusts in the back and arms;\r\nfor upon this ceremony depends the restoration of Altisidora.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this Sancho broke silence and cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cBy all that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood, I\xe2\x80\x99ll as soon let my face be smacked or handled as turn Moor. Body\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 me! What has handling my face got to do with the resurrection of\r\nthis damsel? \xe2\x80\x98The old woman took kindly to the blits; they enchant\r\nDulcinea, and whip me in order to disenchant her; Altisidora dies of\r\nailments God was pleased to send her, and to bring her to life again\r\nthey must give me four-and-twenty smacks, and prick holes in my body\r\nwith pins, and raise weals on my arms with pinches! Try those jokes on\r\na brother-in-law; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m an old dog, and \xe2\x80\x9ctus, tus\xe2\x80\x9d is no use with me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt die,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhadamanthus in a loud voice; \xe2\x80\x9crelent, thou\r\ntiger; humble thyself, proud Nimrod; suffer and he silent, for no\r\nimpossibilities are asked of thee; it is not for thee to inquire into\r\nthe difficulties in this matter; smacked thou must be, pricked thou\r\nshalt see thyself, and with pinches thou must be made to howl. Ho, I\r\nsay, officials, obey my orders; or by the word of an honest man, ye\r\nshall see what ye were born for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this some six duennas, advancing across the court, made their\r\nappearance in procession, one after the other, four of them with\r\nspectacles, and all with their right hands uplifted, showing four\r\nfingers of wrist to make their hands look longer, as is the fashion\r\nnow-a-days. No sooner had Sancho caught sight of them than, bellowing\r\nlike a bull, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI might let myself be handled by all the\r\nworld; but allow duennas to touch me\xe2\x80\x94not a bit of it! Scratch my face,\r\nas my master was served in this very castle; run me through the body\r\nwith burnished daggers; pinch my arms with red-hot pincers; I\xe2\x80\x99ll bear\r\nall in patience to serve these gentlefolk; but I won\xe2\x80\x99t let duennas\r\ntouch me, though the devil should carry me off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Don Quixote, too, broke silence, saying to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cHave patience,\r\nmy son, and gratify these noble persons, and give all thanks to heaven\r\nthat it has infused such virtue into thy person, that by its sufferings\r\nthou canst disenchant the enchanted and restore to life the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duennas were now close to Sancho, and he, having become more\r\ntractable and reasonable, settling himself well in his chair presented\r\nhis face and beard to the first, who delivered him a smack very stoutly\r\nlaid on, and then made him a low curtsey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLess politeness and less paint, se\xc3\xb1ora duenna,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cby God\r\nyour hands smell of vinegar-wash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn line, all the duennas smacked him and several others of the\r\nhousehold pinched him; but what he could not stand was being pricked by\r\nthe pins; and so, apparently out of patience, he started up out of his\r\nchair, and seizing a lighted torch that stood near him fell upon the\r\nduennas and the whole set of his tormentors, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cBegone, ye\r\nministers of hell; I\xe2\x80\x99m not made of brass not to feel such\r\nout-of-the-way tortures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this instant Altisidora, who probably was tired of having been so\r\nlong lying on her back, turned on her side; seeing which the bystanders\r\ncried out almost with one voice, \xe2\x80\x9cAltisidora is alive! Altisidora\r\nlives!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhadamanthus bade Sancho put away his wrath, as the object they had in\r\nview was now attained. When Don Quixote saw Altisidora move, he went on\r\nhis knees to Sancho saying to him, \xe2\x80\x9cNow is the time, son of my bowels,\r\nnot to call thee my squire, for thee to give thyself some of those\r\nlashes thou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment of Dulcinea.\r\nNow, I say, is the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe, and\r\nendowed with efficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Sancho made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s trick upon trick, I think, and not\r\nhoney upon pancakes; a nice thing it would be for a whipping to come\r\nnow, on the top of pinches, smacks, and pin-proddings! You had better\r\ntake a big stone and tie it round my neck, and pitch me into a well; I\r\nshould not mind it much, if I\xe2\x80\x99m to be always made the cow of the\r\nwedding for the cure of other people\xe2\x80\x99s ailments. Leave me alone; or\r\nelse by God I\xe2\x80\x99ll fling the whole thing to the dogs, let come what may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAltisidora had by this time sat up on the catafalque, and as she did so\r\nthe clarions sounded, accompanied by the flutes, and the voices of all\r\npresent exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cLong life to Altisidora! long life to Altisidora!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe duke and duchess and the kings Minos and Rhadamanthus stood up, and\r\nall, together with Don Quixote and Sancho, advanced to receive her and\r\ntake her down from the catafalque; and she, making as though she were\r\nrecovering from a swoon, bowed her head to the duke and duchess and to\r\nthe kings, and looking sideways at Don Quixote, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cGod\r\nforgive thee, insensible knight, for through thy cruelty I have been,\r\nto me it seems, more than a thousand years in the other world; and to\r\nthee, the most compassionate upon earth, I render thanks for the life I\r\nam now in possession of. From this day forth, friend Sancho, count as\r\nthine six smocks of mine which I bestow upon thee, to make as many\r\nshirts for thyself, and if they are not all quite whole, at any rate\r\nthey are all clean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho kissed her hands in gratitude, kneeling, and with the mitre in\r\nhis hand. The duke bade them take it from him, and give him back his\r\ncap and doublet and remove the flaming robe. Sancho begged the duke to\r\nlet them leave him the robe and mitre; as he wanted to take them home\r\nfor a token and memento of that unexampled adventure. The duchess said\r\nthey must leave them with him; for he knew already what a great friend\r\nof his she was. The duke then gave orders that the court should be\r\ncleared, and that all should retire to their chambers, and that Don\r\nQuixote and Sancho should be conducted to their old quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np69e.jpg (60K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\nWHICH FOLLOWS SIXTY-NINE AND DEALS WITH MATTERS INDISPENSABLE FOR THE\r\nCLEAR COMPREHENSION OF THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np70a.jpg (131K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSancho slept that night in a cot in the same chamber with Don Quixote,\r\na thing he would have gladly excused if he could for he knew very well\r\nthat with questions and answers his master would not let him sleep, and\r\nhe was in no humour for talking much, as he still felt the pain of his\r\nlate martyrdom, which interfered with his freedom of speech; and it\r\nwould have been more to his taste to sleep in a hovel alone, than in\r\nthat luxurious chamber in company. And so well founded did his\r\napprehension prove, and so correct was his anticipation, that scarcely\r\nhad his master got into bed when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost thou think of\r\nto-night\xe2\x80\x99s adventure, Sancho? Great and mighty is the power of\r\ncold-hearted scorn, for thou with thine own eyes hast seen Altisidora\r\nslain, not by arrows, nor by the sword, nor by any warlike weapon, nor\r\nby deadly poisons, but by the thought of the sternness and scorn with\r\nwhich I have always treated her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe might have died and welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen she pleased and\r\nhow she pleased; and she might have left me alone, for I never made her\r\nfall in love or scorned her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know nor can I imagine how the\r\nrecovery of Altisidora, a damsel more fanciful than wise, can have, as\r\nI have said before, anything to do with the sufferings of Sancho Panza.\r\nNow I begin to see plainly and clearly that there are enchanters and\r\nenchanted people in the world; and may God deliver me from them, since\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t deliver myself; and so I beg of your worship to let me sleep\r\nand not ask me any more questions, unless you want me to throw myself\r\nout of the window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSleep, Sancho my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cif the pinprodding and\r\npinches thou hast received and the smacks administered to thee will let\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo pain came up to the insult of the smacks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the\r\nsimple reason that it was duennas, confound them, that gave them to me;\r\nbut once more I entreat your worship to let me sleep, for sleep is\r\nrelief from misery to those who are miserable when awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so, and God be with thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote.\r\n\r\nThey fell asleep, both of them, and Cide Hamete, the author of this\r\ngreat history, took this opportunity to record and relate what it was\r\nthat induced the duke and duchess to get up the elaborate plot that has\r\nbeen described. The bachelor Samson Carrasco, he says, not forgetting\r\nhow he as the Knight of the Mirrors had been vanquished and overthrown\r\nby Don Quixote, which defeat and overthrow upset all his plans,\r\nresolved to try his hand again, hoping for better luck than he had\r\nbefore; and so, having learned where Don Quixote was from the page who\r\nbrought the letter and present to Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Teresa Panza, he got\r\nhimself new armour and another horse, and put a white moon upon his\r\nshield, and to carry his arms he had a mule led by a peasant, not by\r\nTom Cecial his former squire for fear he should be recognised by Sancho\r\nor Don Quixote. He came to the duke\xe2\x80\x99s castle, and the duke informed him\r\nof the road and route Don Quixote had taken with the intention of being\r\npresent at the jousts at Saragossa. He told him, too, of the jokes he\r\nhad practised upon him, and of the device for the disenchantment of\r\nDulcinea at the expense of Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s backside; and finally he gave him\r\nan account of the trick Sancho had played upon his master, making him\r\nbelieve that Dulcinea was enchanted and turned into a country wench;\r\nand of how the duchess, his wife, had persuaded Sancho that it was he\r\nhimself who was deceived, inasmuch as Dulcinea was really enchanted; at\r\nwhich the bachelor laughed not a little, and marvelled as well at the\r\nsharpness and simplicity of Sancho as at the length to which Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s madness went. The duke begged of him if he found him (whether\r\nhe overcame him or not) to return that way and let him know the result.\r\nThis the bachelor did; he set out in quest of Don Quixote, and not\r\nfinding him at Saragossa, he went on, and how he fared has been already\r\ntold. He returned to the duke\xe2\x80\x99s castle and told him all, what the\r\nconditions of the combat were, and how Don Quixote was now, like a\r\nloyal knight-errant, returning to keep his promise of retiring to his\r\nvillage for a year, by which time, said the bachelor, he might perhaps\r\nbe cured of his madness; for that was the object that had led him to\r\nadopt these disguises, as it was a sad thing for a gentleman of such\r\ngood parts as Don Quixote to be a madman. And so he took his leave of\r\nthe duke, and went home to his village to wait there for Don Quixote,\r\nwho was coming after him. Thereupon the duke seized the opportunity of\r\npractising this mystification upon him; so much did he enjoy everything\r\nconnected with Sancho and Don Quixote. He had the roads about the\r\ncastle far and near, everywhere he thought Don Quixote was likely to\r\npass on his return, occupied by large numbers of his servants on foot\r\nand on horseback, who were to bring him to the castle, by fair means or\r\nfoul, if they met him. They did meet him, and sent word to the duke,\r\nwho, having already settled what was to be done, as soon as he heard of\r\nhis arrival, ordered the torches and lamps in the court to be lit and\r\nAltisidora to be placed on the catafalque with all the pomp and\r\nceremony that has been described, the whole affair being so well\r\narranged and acted that it differed but little from reality. And Cide\r\nHamete says, moreover, that for his part he considers the concocters of\r\nthe joke as crazy as the victims of it, and that the duke and duchess\r\nwere not two fingers\xe2\x80\x99 breadth removed from being something like fools\r\nthemselves when they took such pains to make game of a pair of fools.\r\n\r\nAs for the latter, one was sleeping soundly and the other lying awake\r\noccupied with his desultory thoughts, when daylight came to them\r\nbringing with it the desire to rise; for the lazy down was never a\r\ndelight to Don Quixote, victor or vanquished. Altisidora, come back\r\nfrom death to life as Don Quixote fancied, following up the freak of\r\nher lord and lady, entered the chamber, crowned with the garland she\r\nhad worn on the catafalque and in a robe of white taffeta embroidered\r\nwith gold flowers, her hair flowing loose over her shoulders, and\r\nleaning upon a staff of fine black ebony. Don Quixote, disconcerted and\r\nin confusion at her appearance, huddled himself up and well-nigh\r\ncovered himself altogether with the sheets and counterpane of the bed,\r\ntongue-tied, and unable to offer her any civility. Altisidora seated\r\nherself on a chair at the head of the bed, and, after a deep sigh, said\r\nto him in a feeble, soft voice, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen women of rank and modest maidens\r\ntrample honour under foot, and give a loose to the tongue that breaks\r\nthrough every impediment, publishing abroad the inmost secrets of their\r\nhearts, they are reduced to sore extremities. Such a one am I, Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nDon Quixote of La Mancha, crushed, conquered, love-smitten, but yet\r\npatient under suffering and virtuous, and so much so that my heart\r\nbroke with grief and I lost my life. For the last two days I have been\r\ndead, slain by the thought of the cruelty with which thou hast treated\r\nme, obdurate knight,\r\n\r\nO harder thou than marble to my plaint;\r\n\r\n\r\nor at least believed to be dead by all who saw me; and had it not been\r\nthat Love, taking pity on me, let my recovery rest upon the sufferings\r\nof this good squire, there I should have remained in the other world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove might very well have let it rest upon the sufferings of my ass,\r\nand I should have been obliged to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho. \xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me,\r\nse\xc3\xb1ora\xe2\x80\x94and may heaven send you a tenderer lover than my master\xe2\x80\x94what did\r\nyou see in the other world? What goes on in hell? For of course that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhere one who dies in despair is bound for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell you the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Altisidora, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot have died outright,\r\nfor I did not go into hell; had I gone in, it is very certain I should\r\nnever have come out again, do what I might. The truth is, I came to the\r\ngate, where some dozen or so of devils were playing tennis, all in\r\nbreeches and doublets, with falling collars trimmed with Flemish\r\nbonelace, and ruffles of the same that served them for wristbands, with\r\nfour fingers\xe2\x80\x99 breadth of the arms exposed to make their hands look\r\nlonger; in their hands they held rackets of fire; but what amazed me\r\nstill more was that books, apparently full of wind and rubbish, served\r\nthem for tennis balls, a strange and marvellous thing; this, however,\r\ndid not astonish me so much as to observe that, although with players\r\nit is usual for the winners to be glad and the losers sorry, there in\r\nthat game all were growling, all were snarling, and all were cursing\r\none another.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor devils, whether\r\nplaying or not, can never be content, win or lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Altisidora; \xe2\x80\x9cbut there is another thing that\r\nsurprises me too, I mean surprised me then, and that was that no ball\r\noutlasted the first throw or was of any use a second time; and it was\r\nwonderful the constant succession there was of books, new and old. To\r\none of them, a brand-new, well-bound one, they gave such a stroke that\r\nthey knocked the guts out of it and scattered the leaves about. \xe2\x80\x98Look\r\nwhat book that is,\xe2\x80\x99 said one devil to another, and the other replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is the \xe2\x80\x9cSecond Part of the History of Don Quixote of La Mancha,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nnot by Cide Hamete, the original author, but by an Aragonese who by his\r\nown account is of Tordesillas.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Out of this with it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the first,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and into the depths of hell with it out of my sight.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Is it so bad?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the other. \xe2\x80\x98So bad is it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the first, \xe2\x80\x98that if I had set\r\nmyself deliberately to make a worse, I could not have done it.\xe2\x80\x99 They\r\nthen went on with their game, knocking other books about; and I, having\r\nheard them mention the name of Don Quixote whom I love and adore so,\r\ntook care to retain this vision in my memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA vision it must have been, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor there is\r\nno other I in the world; this history has been going about here for\r\nsome time from hand to hand, but it does not stay long in any, for\r\neverybody gives it a taste of his foot. I am not disturbed by hearing\r\nthat I am wandering in a fantastic shape in the darkness of the pit or\r\nin the daylight above, for I am not the one that history treats of. If\r\nit should be good, faithful, and true, it will have ages of life; but\r\nif it should be bad, from its birth to its burial will not be a very\r\nlong journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAltisidora was about to proceed with her complaint against Don Quixote,\r\nwhen he said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cI have several times told you, se\xc3\xb1ora that it\r\ngrieves me you should have set your affections upon me, as from mine\r\nthey can only receive gratitude, but no return. I was born to belong to\r\nDulcinea del Toboso, and the fates, if there are any, dedicated me to\r\nher; and to suppose that any other beauty can take the place she\r\noccupies in my heart is to suppose an impossibility. This frank\r\ndeclaration should suffice to make you retire within the bounds of your\r\nmodesty, for no one can bind himself to do impossibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing this, Altisidora, with a show of anger and agitation,\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s life! Don Stockfish, soul of a mortar, stone of a\r\ndate, more obstinate and obdurate than a clown asked a favour when he\r\nhas his mind made up, if I fall upon you I\xe2\x80\x99ll tear your eyes out! Do\r\nyou fancy, Don Vanquished, Don Cudgelled, that I died for your sake?\r\nAll that you have seen to-night has been make-believe; I\xe2\x80\x99m not the\r\nwoman to let the black of my nail suffer for such a camel, much less\r\ndie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I can well believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor all that about lovers\r\npining to death is absurd; they may talk of it, but as for doing\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94Judas may believe that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile they were talking, the musician, singer, and poet, who had sung\r\nthe two stanzas given above came in, and making a profound obeisance to\r\nDon Quixote said, \xe2\x80\x9cWill your worship, sir knight, reckon and retain me\r\nin the number of your most faithful servants, for I have long been a\r\ngreat admirer of yours, as well because of your fame as because of your\r\nachievements?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWill your worship tell me who you are,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don\r\nQuixote, \xe2\x80\x9cso that my courtesy may be answerable to your deserts?\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nyoung man replied that he was the musician and songster of the night\r\nbefore. \xe2\x80\x9cOf a truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cyour worship has a most\r\nexcellent voice; but what you sang did not seem to me very much to the\r\npurpose; for what have Garcilasso\xe2\x80\x99s stanzas to do with the death of\r\nthis lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised at that,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the musician; \xe2\x80\x9cfor with the\r\ncallow poets of our day the way is for every one to write as he pleases\r\nand pilfer where he chooses, whether it be germane to the matter or\r\nnot, and now-a-days there is no piece of silliness they can sing or\r\nwrite that is not set down to poetic licence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote was about to reply, but was prevented by the duke and\r\nduchess, who came in to see him, and with them there followed a long\r\nand delightful conversation, in the course of which Sancho said so many\r\ndroll and saucy things that he left the duke and duchess wondering not\r\nonly at his simplicity but at his sharpness. Don Quixote begged their\r\npermission to take his departure that same day, inasmuch as for a\r\nvanquished knight like himself it was fitter he should live in a\r\npig-sty than in a royal palace. They gave it very readily, and the\r\nduchess asked him if Altisidora was in his good graces.\r\n\r\nHe replied, \xe2\x80\x9cSe\xc3\xb1ora, let me tell your ladyship that this damsel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nailment comes entirely of idleness, and the cure for it is honest and\r\nconstant employment. She herself has told me that lace is worn in hell;\r\nand as she must know how to make it, let it never be out of her hands;\r\nfor when she is occupied in shifting the bobbins to and fro, the image\r\nor images of what she loves will not shift to and fro in her thoughts;\r\nthis is the truth, this is my opinion, and this is my advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mine,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I never in all my life saw a lace-maker\r\nthat died for love; when damsels are at work their minds are more set\r\non finishing their tasks than on thinking of their loves. I speak from\r\nmy own experience; for when I\xe2\x80\x99m digging I never think of my old woman;\r\nI mean my Teresa Panza, whom I love better than my own eyelids.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsay well, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will take care that my\r\nAltisidora employs herself henceforward in needlework of some sort; for\r\nshe is extremely expert at it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no occasion to have recourse\r\nto that remedy, se\xc3\xb1ora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Altisidora; \xe2\x80\x9cfor the mere thought of the\r\ncruelty with which this vagabond villain has treated me will suffice to\r\nblot him out of my memory without any other device; with your\r\nhighness\xe2\x80\x99s leave I will retire, not to have before my eyes, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nhis rueful countenance, but his abominable, ugly looks.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat reminds\r\nme of the common saying, that \xe2\x80\x98he that rails is ready to forgive,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the duke.\r\n\r\nAltisidora then, pretending to wipe away her tears with a handkerchief,\r\nmade an obeisance to her master and mistress and quitted the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIll luck betide thee, poor damsel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cill luck betide\r\nthee! Thou hast fallen in with a soul as dry as a rush and a heart as\r\nhard as oak; had it been me, i\xe2\x80\x99faith \xe2\x80\x98another cock would have crowed to\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote dressed himself and\r\ndined with the duke and duchess, and set out the same evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np70e.jpg (73K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\nOF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE SANCHO ON THE WAY TO\r\nTHEIR VILLAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np71a.jpg (82K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vanquished and afflicted Don Quixote went along very downcast in\r\none respect and very happy in another. His sadness arose from his\r\ndefeat, and his satisfaction from the thought of the virtue that lay in\r\nSancho, as had been proved by the resurrection of Altisidora; though it\r\nwas with difficulty he could persuade himself that the love-smitten\r\ndamsel had been really dead. Sancho went along anything but cheerful,\r\nfor it grieved him that Altisidora had not kept her promise of giving\r\nhim the smocks; and turning this over in his mind he said to his\r\nmaster, \xe2\x80\x9cSurely, se\xc3\xb1or, I\xe2\x80\x99m the most unlucky doctor in the world;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s many a physician that, after killing the sick man he had to\r\ncure, requires to be paid for his work, though it is only signing a bit\r\nof a list of medicines, that the apothecary and not he makes up, and,\r\nthere, his labour is over; but with me though to cure somebody else\r\ncosts me drops of blood, smacks, pinches, pinproddings, and whippings,\r\nnobody gives me a farthing. Well, I swear by all that\xe2\x80\x99s good if they\r\nput another patient into my hands, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to grease them for me\r\nbefore I cure him; for, as they say, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s by his singing the abbot\r\ngets his dinner,\xe2\x80\x99 and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to believe that heaven has bestowed\r\nupon me the virtue I have, that I should be dealing it out to others\r\nall for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art right, Sancho my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cand Altisidora\r\nhas behaved very badly in not giving thee the smocks she promised; and\r\nalthough that virtue of thine is _gratis data_\xe2\x80\x94as it has cost thee no\r\nstudy whatever, any more than such study as thy personal sufferings may\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94I can say for myself that if thou wouldst have payment for the\r\nlashes on account of the disenchant of Dulcinea, I would have given it\r\nto thee freely ere this. I am not sure, however, whether payment will\r\ncomport with the cure, and I would not have the reward interfere with\r\nthe medicine. I think there will be nothing lost by trying it; consider\r\nhow much thou wouldst have, Sancho, and whip thyself at once, and pay\r\nthyself down with thine own hand, as thou hast money of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this proposal Sancho opened his eyes and his ears a palm\xe2\x80\x99s breadth\r\nwide, and in his heart very readily acquiesced in whipping himself, and\r\nsaid he to his master, \xe2\x80\x9cVery well then, se\xc3\xb1or, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold myself in\r\nreadiness to gratify your worship\xe2\x80\x99s wishes if I\xe2\x80\x99m to profit by it; for\r\nthe love of my wife and children forces me to seem grasping. Let your\r\nworship say how much you will pay me for each lash I give myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cI were to requite thee as the\r\nimportance and nature of the cure deserves, the treasures of Venice,\r\nthe mines of Potosi, would be insufficient to pay thee. See what thou\r\nhast of mine, and put a price on each lash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are three thousand three hundred and\r\nodd; of these I have given myself five, the rest remain; let the five\r\ngo for the odd ones, and let us take the three thousand three hundred,\r\nwhich at a quarter real apiece (for I will not take less though the\r\nwhole world should bid me) make three thousand three hundred quarter\r\nreals; the three thousand are one thousand five hundred half reals,\r\nwhich make seven hundred and fifty reals; and the three hundred make a\r\nhundred and fifty half reals, which come to seventy-five reals, which\r\nadded to the seven hundred and fifty make eight hundred and twenty-five\r\nreals in all. These I will stop out of what I have belonging to your\r\nworship, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll return home rich and content, though well whipped,\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s no taking trout\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94but I say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO blessed Sancho! O dear Sancho!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9chow we shall be\r\nbound to serve thee, Dulcinea and I, all the days of our lives that\r\nheaven may grant us! If she returns to her lost shape (and it cannot be\r\nbut that she will) her misfortune will have been good fortune, and my\r\ndefeat a most happy triumph. But look here, Sancho; when wilt thou\r\nbegin the scourging? For if thou wilt make short work of it, I will\r\ngive thee a hundred reals over and above.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cthis night without fail. Let your worship order\r\nit so that we pass it out of doors and in the open air, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nscarify myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNight, longed for by Don Quixote with the greatest anxiety in the\r\nworld, came at last, though it seemed to him that the wheels of\r\nApollo\xe2\x80\x99s car had broken down, and that the day was drawing itself out\r\nlonger than usual, just as is the case with lovers, who never make the\r\nreckoning of their desires agree with time. They made their way at\r\nlength in among some pleasant trees that stood a little distance from\r\nthe road, and there vacating Rocinante\xe2\x80\x99s saddle and Dapple\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npack-saddle, they stretched themselves on the green grass and made\r\ntheir supper off Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s stores, and he making a powerful and flexible\r\nwhip out of Dapple\xe2\x80\x99s halter and headstall retreated about twenty paces\r\nfrom his master among some beech trees. Don Quixote seeing him march\r\noff with such resolution and spirit, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cTake care, my\r\nfriend, not to cut thyself to pieces; allow the lashes to wait for one\r\nanother, and do not be in so great a hurry as to run thyself out of\r\nbreath midway; I mean, do not lay on so strenuously as to make thy life\r\nfail thee before thou hast reached the desired number; and that thou\r\nmayest not lose by a card too much or too little, I will station myself\r\napart and count on my rosary here the lashes thou givest thyself. May\r\nheaven help thee as thy good intention deserves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Pledges don\xe2\x80\x99t distress a good payer,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to lay on\r\nin such a way as without killing myself to hurt myself, for in that, no\r\ndoubt, lies the essence of this miracle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then stripped himself from the waist upwards, and snatching up the\r\nrope he began to lay on and Don Quixote to count the lashes. He might\r\nhave given himself six or eight when he began to think the joke no\r\ntrifle, and its price very low; and holding his hand for a moment, he\r\ntold his master that he cried off on the score of a blind bargain, for\r\neach of those lashes ought to be paid for at the rate of half a real\r\ninstead of a quarter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Sancho my friend, and be not disheartened,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor I double the stakes as to price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cin God\xe2\x80\x99s hand be it, and let it rain\r\nlashes.\xe2\x80\x9d But the rogue no longer laid them on his shoulders, but laid\r\non to the trees, with such groans every now and then, that one would\r\nhave thought at each of them his soul was being plucked up by the\r\nroots. Don Quixote, touched to the heart, and fearing he might make an\r\nend of himself, and that through Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s imprudence he might miss his\r\nown object, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cAs thou livest, my friend, let the matter\r\nrest where it is, for the remedy seems to me a very rough one, and it\r\nwill be well to have patience; \xe2\x80\x98Zamora was not won in an hour.\xe2\x80\x99 If I\r\nhave not reckoned wrong thou hast given thyself over a thousand lashes;\r\nthat is enough for the present; \xe2\x80\x98for the ass,\xe2\x80\x99 to put it in homely\r\nphrase, \xe2\x80\x98bears the load, but not the overload.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cit shall never be said of me, \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nmoney paid, the arms broken;\xe2\x80\x99 go back a little further, your worship,\r\nand let me give myself at any rate a thousand lashes more; for in a\r\ncouple of bouts like this we shall have finished off the lot, and there\r\nwill be even cloth to spare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs thou art in such a willing mood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cmay heaven aid\r\nthee; lay on and I\xe2\x80\x99ll retire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho returned to his task with so much resolution that he soon had\r\nthe bark stripped off several trees, such was the severity with which\r\nhe whipped himself; and one time, raising his voice, and giving a beech\r\na tremendous lash, he cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cHere dies Samson, and all with him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np71b.jpg (349K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his piteous cry and of the stroke of the cruel lash,\r\nDon Quixote ran to him at once, and seizing the twisted halter that\r\nserved him for a courbash, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid, Sancho my\r\nfriend, that to please me thou shouldst lose thy life, which is needed\r\nfor the support of thy wife and children; let Dulcinea wait for a\r\nbetter opportunity, and I will content myself with a hope soon to be\r\nrealised, and have patience until thou hast gained fresh strength so as\r\nto finish off this business to the satisfaction of everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs your worship will have it so, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cso be it; but\r\nthrow your cloak over my shoulders, for I\xe2\x80\x99m sweating and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto take cold; it\xe2\x80\x99s a risk that novice disciplinants run.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote obeyed, and stripping himself covered Sancho, who slept\r\nuntil the sun woke him; they then resumed their journey, which for the\r\ntime being they brought to an end at a village that lay three leagues\r\nfarther on. They dismounted at a hostelry which Don Quixote recognised\r\nas such and did not take to be a castle with moat, turrets, portcullis,\r\nand drawbridge; for ever since he had been vanquished he talked more\r\nrationally about everything, as will be shown presently. They quartered\r\nhim in a room on the ground floor, where in place of leather hangings\r\nthere were pieces of painted serge such as they commonly use in\r\nvillages. On one of them was painted by some very poor hand the Rape of\r\nHelen, when the bold guest carried her off from Menelaus, and on the\r\nother was the story of Dido and \xc3\x86neas, she on a high tower, as though\r\nshe were making signals with a half sheet to her fugitive guest who was\r\nout at sea flying in a frigate or brigantine. He noticed in the two\r\nstories that Helen did not go very reluctantly, for she was laughing\r\nslyly and roguishly; but the fair Dido was shown dropping tears the\r\nsize of walnuts from her eyes. Don Quixote as he looked at them\r\nobserved, \xe2\x80\x9cThose two ladies were very unfortunate not to have been born\r\nin this age, and I unfortunate above all men not to have been born in\r\ntheirs. Had I fallen in with those gentlemen, Troy would not have been\r\nburned or Carthage destroyed, for it would have been only for me to\r\nslay Paris, and all these misfortunes would have been avoided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll lay a bet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cthat before long there won\xe2\x80\x99t be a\r\ntavern, roadside inn, hostelry, or barber\xe2\x80\x99s shop where the story of our\r\ndoings won\xe2\x80\x99t be painted up; but I\xe2\x80\x99d like it painted by the hand of a\r\nbetter painter than painted these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art right, Sancho,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor this painter is like\r\nOrbaneja, a painter there was at \xc3\x9abeda, who when they asked him what he\r\nwas painting, used to say, \xe2\x80\x98Whatever it may turn out; and if he chanced\r\nto paint a cock he would write under it, \xe2\x80\x98This is a cock,\xe2\x80\x99 for fear\r\nthey might think it was a fox. The painter or writer, for it\xe2\x80\x99s all the\r\nsame, who published the history of this new Don Quixote that has come\r\nout, must have been one of this sort I think, Sancho, for he painted or\r\nwrote \xe2\x80\x98whatever it might turn out;\xe2\x80\x99 or perhaps he is like a poet called\r\nMauleon that was about the Court some years ago, who used to answer at\r\nhaphazard whatever he was asked, and on one asking him what _Deum de\r\nDeo_ meant, he replied _D\xc3\xa9 donde diere_. But, putting this aside, tell\r\nme, Sancho, hast thou a mind to have another turn at thyself to-night,\r\nand wouldst thou rather have it indoors or in the open air?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEgad, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cfor what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give myself, it\r\ncomes all the same to me whether it is in a house or in the fields;\r\nstill I\xe2\x80\x99d like it to be among trees; for I think they are company for\r\nme and help me to bear my pain wonderfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet it must not be, Sancho my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, to\r\nenable thee to recover strength, we must keep it for our own village;\r\nfor at the latest we shall get there the day after to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho said he might do as he pleased; but that for his own part he\r\nwould like to finish off the business quickly before his blood cooled\r\nand while he had an appetite, because \xe2\x80\x9cin delay there is apt to be\r\ndanger\xe2\x80\x9d very often, and \xe2\x80\x9cpraying to God and plying the hammer,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cone take was better than two I\xe2\x80\x99ll give thee\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca sparrow in the\r\nhand than a vulture on the wing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Sancho, no more proverbs!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nseems to me thou art becoming _sicut erat_ again; speak in a plain,\r\nsimple, straight-forward way, as I have often told thee, and thou wilt\r\nfind the good of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what bad luck it is of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nutter a word without a proverb that is not as good as an argument to my\r\nmind; however, I mean to mend if I can;\xe2\x80\x9d and so for the present the\r\nconversation ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np71e.jpg (42K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\nOF HOW DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO REACHED THEIR VILLAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np72a.jpg (155K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that day Don Quixote and Sancho remained in the village and inn\r\nwaiting for night, the one to finish off his task of scourging in the\r\nopen country, the other to see it accomplished, for therein lay the\r\naccomplishment of his wishes. Meanwhile there arrived at the hostelry a\r\ntraveller on horseback with three or four servants, one of whom said to\r\nhim who appeared to be the master, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Se\xc3\xb1or Don \xc3\x81lvaro Tarfe, your\r\nworship may take your siesta to-day; the quarters seem clean and cool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he heard this Don Quixote said to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Sancho; on\r\nturning over the leaves of that book of the Second Part of my history I\r\nthink I came casually upon this name of Don \xc3\x81lvaro Tarfe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cwe had better let him dismount, and\r\nby-and-by we can ask about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman dismounted, and the landlady gave him a room on the\r\nground floor opposite Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s and adorned with painted serge\r\nhangings of the same sort. The newly arrived gentleman put on a summer\r\ncoat, and coming out to the gateway of the hostelry, which was wide and\r\ncool, addressing Don Quixote, who was pacing up and down there, he\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cIn what direction is your worship bound, gentle sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo a village near this which is my own village,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Quixote;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand your worship, where are you bound for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to Granada, se\xc3\xb1or,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cto my own\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a goodly country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cbut will your worship do me\r\nthe favour of telling me your name, for it strikes me it is of more\r\nimportance to me to know it than I can tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Don \xc3\x81lvaro Tarfe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the traveller.\r\n\r\nTo which Don Quixote returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt whatever that your\r\nworship is that Don \xc3\x81lvaro Tarfe who appears in print in the Second\r\nPart of the history of Don Quixote of La Mancha, lately printed and\r\npublished by a new author.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the same,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cand that same Don Quixote, the\r\nprincipal personage in the said history, was a very great friend of\r\nmine, and it was I who took him away from home, or at least induced him\r\nto come to some jousts that were to be held at Saragossa, whither I was\r\ngoing myself; indeed, I showed him many kindnesses, and saved him from\r\nhaving his shoulders touched up by the executioner because of his\r\nextreme rashness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Se\xc3\xb1or Don \xc3\x81lvaro,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cam I at all like that\r\nDon Quixote you talk of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the traveller, \xe2\x80\x9cnot a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said our one, \xe2\x80\x9chad he with him a squire called\r\nSancho Panza?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don \xc3\x81lvaro; \xe2\x80\x9cbut though he had the name of being very\r\ndroll, I never heard him say anything that had any drollery in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I can well believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho at this, \xe2\x80\x9cfor to come out with\r\ndrolleries is not in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s line; and that Sancho your worship\r\nspeaks of, gentle sir, must be some great scoundrel, dunderhead, and\r\nthief, all in one; for I am the real Sancho Panza, and I have more\r\ndrolleries than if it rained them; let your worship only try; come\r\nalong with me for a year or so, and you will find they fall from me at\r\nevery turn, and so rich and so plentiful that though mostly I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what I am saying I make everybody that hears me laugh. And the\r\nreal Don Quixote of La Mancha, the famous, the valiant, the wise, the\r\nlover, the righter of wrongs, the guardian of minors and orphans, the\r\nprotector of widows, the killer of damsels, he who has for his sole\r\nmistress the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, is this gentleman before\r\nyou, my master; all other Don Quixotes and all other Sancho Panzas are\r\ndreams and mockeries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God I believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don \xc3\x81lvaro; \xe2\x80\x9cfor you have uttered more\r\ndrolleries, my friend, in the few words you have spoken than the other\r\nSancho Panza in all I ever heard from him, and they were not a few. He\r\nwas more greedy than well-spoken, and more dull than droll; and I am\r\nconvinced that the enchanters who persecute Don Quixote the Good have\r\nbeen trying to persecute me with Don Quixote the Bad. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat to say, for I am ready to swear I left him shut up in the Casa del\r\nNuncio at Toledo, and here another Don Quixote turns up, though a very\r\ndifferent one from mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I am good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can safely\r\nsay I am not \xe2\x80\x98the Bad;\xe2\x80\x99 and to prove it, let me tell you, Se\xc3\xb1or Don\r\n\xc3\x81lvaro Tarfe, I have never in my life been in Saragossa; so far from\r\nthat, when it was told me that this imaginary Don Quixote had been\r\npresent at the jousts in that city, I declined to enter it, in order to\r\ndrag his falsehood before the face of the world; and so I went on\r\nstraight to Barcelona, the treasure-house of courtesy, haven of\r\nstrangers, asylum of the poor, home of the valiant, champion of the\r\nwronged, pleasant exchange of firm friendships, and city unrivalled in\r\nsite and beauty. And though the adventures that befell me there are not\r\nby any means matters of enjoyment, but rather of regret, I do not\r\nregret them, simply because I have seen it. In a word, Se\xc3\xb1or Don \xc3\x81lvaro\r\nTarfe, I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, the one that fame speaks of, and\r\nnot the unlucky one that has attempted to usurp my name and deck\r\nhimself out in my ideas. I entreat your worship by your devoir as a\r\ngentleman to be so good as to make a declaration before the alcalde of\r\nthis village that you never in all your life saw me until now, and that\r\nneither am I the Don Quixote in print in the Second Part, nor this\r\nSancho Panza, my squire, the one your worship knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will do most willingly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don \xc3\x81lvaro; \xe2\x80\x9cthough it amazes\r\nme to find two Don Quixotes and two Sancho Panzas at once, as much\r\nalike in name as they differ in demeanour; and again I say and declare\r\nthat what I saw I cannot have seen, and that what happened me cannot\r\nhave happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt your worship is enchanted, like my lady Dulcinea del Toboso,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9cand would to heaven your disenchantment rested on my\r\ngiving myself another three thousand and odd lashes like what I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngiving myself for her, for I\xe2\x80\x99d lay them on without looking for\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that about the lashes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don \xc3\x81lvaro. Sancho\r\nreplied that it was a long story to tell, but he would tell him if they\r\nhappened to be going the same road.\r\n\r\nBy this dinner-time arrived, and Don Quixote and Don \xc3\x81lvaro dined\r\ntogether. The alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn\r\ntogether with a notary, and Don Quixote laid a petition before him,\r\nshowing that it was requisite for his rights that Don \xc3\x81lvaro Tarfe, the\r\ngentleman there present, should make a declaration before him that he\r\ndid not know Don Quixote of La Mancha, also there present, and that he\r\nwas not the one that was in print in a history entitled \xe2\x80\x9cSecond Part of\r\nDon Quixote of La Mancha, by one Avellaneda of Tordesillas.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nalcalde finally put it in legal form, and the declaration was made with\r\nall the formalities required in such cases, at which Don Quixote and\r\nSancho were in high delight, as if a declaration of the sort was of any\r\ngreat importance to them, and as if their words and deeds did not\r\nplainly show the difference between the two Don Quixotes and the two\r\nSanchos. Many civilities and offers of service were exchanged by Don\r\n\xc3\x81lvaro and Don Quixote, in the course of which the great Manchegan\r\ndisplayed such good taste that he disabused Don \xc3\x81lvaro of the error he\r\nwas under; and he, on his part, felt convinced he must have been\r\nenchanted, now that he had been brought in contact with two such\r\nopposite Don Quixotes.\r\n\r\nEvening came, they set out from the village, and after about half a\r\nleague two roads branched off, one leading to Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s village,\r\nthe other the road Don \xc3\x81lvaro was to follow. In this short interval Don\r\nQuixote told him of his unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenchantment and the remedy, all which threw Don \xc3\x81lvaro into fresh\r\namazement, and embracing Don Quixote and Sancho, he went his way, and\r\nDon Quixote went his. That night he passed among trees again in order\r\nto give Sancho an opportunity of working out his penance, which he did\r\nin the same fashion as the night before, at the expense of the bark of\r\nthe beech trees much more than of his back, of which he took such good\r\ncare that the lashes would not have knocked off a fly had there been\r\none there. The duped Don Quixote did not miss a single stroke of the\r\ncount, and he found that together with those of the night before they\r\nmade up three thousand and twenty-nine. The sun apparently had got up\r\nearly to witness the sacrifice, and with his light they resumed their\r\njourney, discussing the deception practised on Don \xc3\x81lvaro, and saying\r\nhow well done it was to have taken his declaration before a magistrate\r\nin such an unimpeachable form. That day and night they travelled on,\r\nnor did anything worth mention happen to them, unless it was that in\r\nthe course of the night Sancho finished off his task, whereat Don\r\nQuixote was beyond measure joyful. He watched for daylight, to see if\r\nalong the road he should fall in with his already disenchanted lady\r\nDulcinea; and as he pursued his journey there was no woman he met that\r\nhe did not go up to, to see if she was Dulcinea del Toboso, as he held\r\nit absolutely certain that Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s promises could not lie. Full of\r\nthese thoughts and anxieties, they ascended a rising ground wherefrom\r\nthey descried their own village, at the sight of which Sancho fell on\r\nhis knees exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cOpen thine eyes, longed-for home, and see how\r\nthy son Sancho Panza comes back to thee, if not very rich, very well\r\nwhipped! Open thine arms and receive, too, thy son Don Quixote, who, if\r\nhe comes vanquished by the arm of another, comes victor over himself,\r\nwhich, as he himself has told me, is the greatest victory anyone can\r\ndesire. I\xe2\x80\x99m bringing back money, for if I was well whipped, I went\r\nmounted like a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np72b.jpg (375K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave done with these fooleries,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9clet us push on\r\nstraight and get to our own place, where we will give free range to our\r\nfancies, and settle our plans for our future pastoral life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this they descended the slope and directed their steps to their\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np72e.jpg (35K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\nOF THE OMENS DON QUIXOTE HAD AS HE ENTERED HIS OWN VILLAGE, AND OTHER\r\nINCIDENTS THAT EMBELLISH AND GIVE A COLOUR TO THIS GREAT HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np73a.jpg (141K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the village, so says Cide Hamete, Don Quixote saw\r\ntwo boys quarrelling on the village threshing-floor, one of whom said\r\nto the other, \xe2\x80\x9cTake it easy, Periquillo; thou shalt never see it again\r\nas long as thou livest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote heard this, and said he to Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cDost thou not mark,\r\nfriend, what that boy said, \xe2\x80\x98Thou shalt never see it again as long as\r\nthou livest\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does it matter if the boy said so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cdost thou not see that, applied to the\r\nobject of my desires, the words mean that I am never to see Dulcinea\r\nmore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancho was about to answer, when his attention was diverted by seeing a\r\nhare come flying across the plain pursued by several greyhounds and\r\nsportsmen. In its terror it ran to take shelter and hide itself under\r\nDapple. Sancho caught it alive and presented it to Don Quixote, who was\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9c_Malum signum, malum signum!_ a hare flies, greyhounds chase\r\nit, Dulcinea appears not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour worship\xe2\x80\x99s a strange man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s take it for granted\r\nthat this hare is Dulcinea, and these greyhounds chasing it the\r\nmalignant enchanters who turned her into a country wench; she flies,\r\nand I catch her and put her into your worship\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and you hold her\r\nin your arms and cherish her; what bad sign is that, or what ill omen\r\nis there to be found here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two boys who had been quarrelling came over to look at the hare,\r\nand Sancho asked one of them what their quarrel was about. He was\r\nanswered by the one who had said, \xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt never see it again as\r\nlong as thou livest,\xe2\x80\x9d that he had taken a cage full of crickets from\r\nthe other boy, and did not mean to give it back to him as long as he\r\nlived. Sancho took out four cuartos from his pocket and gave them to\r\nthe boy for the cage, which he placed in Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s hands, saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, se\xc3\xb1or! there are the omens broken and destroyed, and they have\r\nno more to do with our affairs, to my thinking, fool as I am, than with\r\nlast year\xe2\x80\x99s clouds; and if I remember rightly I have heard the curate\r\nof our village say that it does not become Christians or sensible\r\npeople to give any heed to these silly things; and even you yourself\r\nsaid the same to me some time ago, telling me that all Christians who\r\nminded omens were fools; but there\xe2\x80\x99s no need of making words about it;\r\nlet us push on and go into our village.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sportsmen came up and asked for their hare, which Don Quixote gave\r\nthem. They then went on, and upon the green at the entrance of the town\r\nthey came upon the curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco busy with\r\ntheir breviaries. It should be mentioned that Sancho had thrown, by way\r\nof a sumpter-cloth, over Dapple and over the bundle of armour, the\r\nbuckram robe painted with flames which they had put upon him at the\r\nduke\xe2\x80\x99s castle the night Altisidora came back to life. He had also fixed\r\nthe mitre on Dapple\xe2\x80\x99s head, the oddest transformation and decoration\r\nthat ever ass in the world underwent. They were at once recognised by\r\nboth the curate and the bachelor, who came towards them with open arms.\r\nDon Quixote dismounted and received them with a close embrace; and the\r\nboys, who are lynxes that nothing escapes, spied out the ass\xe2\x80\x99s mitre\r\nand came running to see it, calling out to one another, \xe2\x80\x9cCome here,\r\nboys, and see Sancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s ass figged out finer than Mingo, and Don\r\nQuixote\xe2\x80\x99s beast leaner than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo at length, with the boys capering round them, and accompanied by the\r\ncurate and the bachelor, they made their entrance into the town, and\r\nproceeded to Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s house, at the door of which they found his\r\nhousekeeper and niece, whom the news of his arrival had already\r\nreached. It had been brought to Teresa Panza, Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s wife, as well,\r\nand she with her hair all loose and half naked, dragging Sanchica her\r\ndaughter by the hand, ran out to meet her husband; but seeing him\r\ncoming in by no means as good case as she thought a governor ought to\r\nbe, she said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it you come this way, husband? It seems to\r\nme you come tramping and footsore, and looking more like a disorderly\r\nvagabond than a governor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, Teresa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho; \xe2\x80\x9coften \xe2\x80\x98where there are pegs\r\nthere are no flitches;\xe2\x80\x99 let\xe2\x80\x99s go into the house and there you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear\r\nstrange things. I bring money, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the main thing, got by my own\r\nindustry without wronging anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bring the money, my good husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa, \xe2\x80\x9cand no matter\r\nwhether it was got this way or that; for, however you may have got it,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll not have brought any new practice into the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSanchica embraced her father and asked him if he brought her anything,\r\nfor she had been looking out for him as for the showers of May; and she\r\ntaking hold of him by the girdle on one side, and his wife by the hand,\r\nwhile the daughter led Dapple, they made for their house, leaving Don\r\nQuixote in his, in the hands of his niece and housekeeper, and in the\r\ncompany of the curate and the bachelor.\r\n\r\nDon Quixote at once, without any regard to time or season, withdrew in\r\nprivate with the bachelor and the curate, and in a few words told them\r\nof his defeat, and of the engagement he was under not to quit his\r\nvillage for a year, which he meant to keep to the letter without\r\ndeparting a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth from it, as became a knight-errant bound by\r\nscrupulous good faith and the laws of knight-errantry; and of how he\r\nthought of turning shepherd for that year, and taking his diversion in\r\nthe solitude of the fields, where he could with perfect freedom give\r\nrange to his thoughts of love while he followed the virtuous pastoral\r\ncalling; and he besought them, if they had not a great deal to do and\r\nwere not prevented by more important business, to consent to be his\r\ncompanions, for he would buy sheep enough to qualify them for\r\nshepherds; and the most important point of the whole affair, he could\r\ntell them, was settled, for he had given them names that would fit them\r\nto a T. The curate asked what they were. Don Quixote replied that he\r\nhimself was to be called the shepherd Quixotize and the bachelor the\r\nshepherd Carrascon, and the curate the shepherd Curambro, and Sancho\r\nPanza the shepherd Pancino.\r\n\r\nBoth were astounded at Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s new craze; however, lest he should\r\nonce more make off out of the village from them in pursuit of his\r\nchivalry, they trusting that in the course of the year he might be\r\ncured, fell in with his new project, applauded his crazy idea as a\r\nbright one, and offered to share the life with him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s more,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Samson Carrasco, \xe2\x80\x9cI am, as all the world knows, a very famous\r\npoet, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be always making verses, pastoral, or courtly, or as it\r\nmay come into my head, to pass away our time in those secluded regions\r\nwhere we shall be roaming. But what is most needful, sirs, is that each\r\nof us should choose the name of the shepherdess he means to glorify in\r\nhis verses, and that we should not leave a tree, be it ever so hard,\r\nwithout writing up and carving her name on it, as is the habit and\r\ncustom of love-smitten shepherds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the very thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cthough I am relieved from\r\nlooking for the name of an imaginary shepherdess, for there\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\npeerless Dulcinea del Toboso, the glory of these brooksides, the\r\nornament of these meadows, the mainstay of beauty, the cream of all the\r\ngraces, and, in a word, the being to whom all praise is appropriate, be\r\nit ever so hyperbolical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we the others must look about for\r\naccommodating shepherdesses that will answer our purpose one way or\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d added Samson Carrasco, \xe2\x80\x9cif they fail us, we can call them by the\r\nnames of the ones in print that the world is filled with, F\xc3\xadlidas,\r\nAmarilises, Dianas, Fleridas, Galateas, Belisardas; for as they sell\r\nthem in the market-places we may fairly buy them and make them our own.\r\nIf my lady, or I should say my shepherdess, happens to be called Ana,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll sing her praises under the name of Anarda, and if Francisca, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncall her Francenia, and if Lucia, Lucinda, for it all comes to the same\r\nthing; and Sancho Panza, if he joins this fraternity, may glorify his\r\nwife Teresa Panza as Teresaina.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Quixote laughed at the adaptation of the name, and the curate\r\nbestowed vast praise upon the worthy and honourable resolution he had\r\nmade, and again offered to bear him company all the time that he could\r\nspare from his imperative duties. And so they took their leave of him,\r\nrecommending and beseeching him to take care of his health and treat\r\nhimself to a suitable diet.\r\n\r\nIt so happened his niece and the housekeeper overheard all the three of\r\nthem said; and as soon as they were gone they both of them came in to\r\nDon Quixote, and said the niece, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this, uncle? Now that we were\r\nthinking you had come back to stay at home and lead a quiet respectable\r\nlife there, are you going to get into fresh entanglements, and turn\r\n\xe2\x80\x98young shepherd, thou that comest here, young shepherd going there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nNay! indeed \xe2\x80\x98the straw is too hard now to make pipes of.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d added the housekeeper, \xe2\x80\x9cwill your worship be able to bear, out\r\nin the fields, the heats of summer, and the chills of winter, and the\r\nhowling of the wolves? Not you; for that\xe2\x80\x99s a life and a business for\r\nhardy men, bred and seasoned to such work almost from the time they\r\nwere in swaddling-clothes. Why, to make choice of evils, it\xe2\x80\x99s better to\r\nbe a knight-errant than a shepherd! Look here, se\xc3\xb1or; take my\r\nadvice\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m not giving it to you full of bread and wine, but\r\nfasting, and with fifty years upon my head\xe2\x80\x94stay at home, look after\r\nyour affairs, go often to confession, be good to the poor, and upon my\r\nsoul be it if any evil comes to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your peace, my daughters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote; \xe2\x80\x9cI know very well\r\nwhat my duty is; help me to bed, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel very well; and rest\r\nassured that, knight-errant now or wandering shepherd to be, I shall\r\nnever fail to have a care for your interests, as you will see in the\r\nend.\xe2\x80\x9d And the good wenches (for that they undoubtedly were), the\r\nhousekeeper and niece, helped him to bed, where they gave him something\r\nto eat and made him as comfortable as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\nOF HOW DON QUIXOTE FELL SICK, AND OF THE WILL HE MADE, AND HOW HE DIED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np74a.jpg (96K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs nothing that is man\xe2\x80\x99s can last for ever, but all tends ever\r\ndownwards from its beginning to its end, and above all man\xe2\x80\x99s life, and\r\nas Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven to stay\r\nits course, its end and close came when he least looked for it.\r\nFor\xe2\x80\x94whether it was of the dejection the thought of his defeat produced,\r\nor of heaven\xe2\x80\x99s will that so ordered it\xe2\x80\x94a fever settled upon him and\r\nkept him in his bed for six days, during which he was often visited by\r\nhis friends the curate, the bachelor, and the barber, while his good\r\nsquire Sancho Panza never quitted his bedside. They, persuaded that it\r\nwas grief at finding himself vanquished, and the object of his heart,\r\nthe liberation and disenchantment of Dulcinea, unattained, that kept\r\nhim in this state, strove by all the means in their power to cheer him\r\nup; the bachelor bidding him take heart and get up to begin his\r\npastoral life, for which he himself, he said, had already composed an\r\neclogue that would take the shine out of all Sannazaro had ever\r\nwritten, and had bought with his own money two famous dogs to guard the\r\nflock, one called Barcino and the other Butron, which a herdsman of\r\nQuintanar had sold him.\r\n\r\nBut for all this Don Quixote could not shake off his sadness. His\r\nfriends called in the doctor, who felt his pulse and was not very well\r\nsatisfied with it, and said that in any case it would be well for him\r\nto attend to the health of his soul, as that of his body was in a bad\r\nway. Don Quixote heard this calmly; but not so his housekeeper, his\r\nniece, and his squire, who fell weeping bitterly, as if they had him\r\nlying dead before them. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion was that melancholy and\r\ndepression were bringing him to his end. Don Quixote begged them to\r\nleave him to himself, as he had a wish to sleep a little. They obeyed,\r\nand he slept at one stretch, as the saying is, more than six hours, so\r\nthat the housekeeper and niece thought he was going to sleep for ever.\r\nBut at the end of that time he woke up, and in a loud voice exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlessed be Almighty God, who has shown me such goodness. In truth his\r\nmercies are boundless, and the sins of men can neither limit them nor\r\nkeep them back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe niece listened with attention to her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s words, and they struck\r\nher as more coherent than what usually fell from him, at least during\r\nhis illness, so she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you saying, se\xc3\xb1or? Has anything\r\nstrange occurred? What mercies or what sins of men are you talking of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mercies, niece,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9care those that God has this\r\nmoment shown me, and with him, as I said, my sins are no impediment to\r\nthem. My reason is now free and clear, rid of the dark shadows of\r\nignorance that my unhappy constant study of those detestable books of\r\nchivalry cast over it. Now I see through their absurdities and\r\ndeceptions, and it only grieves me that this destruction of my\r\nillusions has come so late that it leaves me no time to make some\r\namends by reading other books that might be a light to my soul. Niece,\r\nI feel myself at the point of death, and I would fain meet it in such a\r\nway as to show that my life has not been so ill that I should leave\r\nbehind me the name of a madman; for though I have been one, I would not\r\nthat the fact should be made plainer at my death. Call in to me, my\r\ndear, my good friends the curate, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, and\r\nMaster Nicholas the barber, for I wish to confess and make my will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut his niece was saved the trouble by the entrance of the three. The\r\ninstant Don Quixote saw them he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cGood news for you, good\r\nsirs, that I am no longer Don Quixote of La Mancha, but Alonso Quixano,\r\nwhose way of life won for him the name of Good. Now am I the enemy of\r\nAmadis of Gaul and of the whole countless troop of his descendants;\r\nodious to me now are all the profane stories of knight-errantry; now I\r\nperceive my folly, and the peril into which reading them brought me;\r\nnow, by God\xe2\x80\x99s mercy schooled into my right senses, I loathe them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the three heard him speak in this way, they had no doubt whatever\r\nthat some new craze had taken possession of him; and said Samson,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Se\xc3\xb1or Don Quixote! Now that we have intelligence of the lady\r\nDulcinea being disenchanted, are you taking this line; now, just as we\r\nare on the point of becoming shepherds, to pass our lives singing, like\r\nprinces, are you thinking of turning hermit? Hush, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nbe rational and let\xe2\x80\x99s have no more nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat until now has been a\r\nreality to my hurt, my death will, with heaven\xe2\x80\x99s help, turn to my good.\r\nI feel, sirs, that I am rapidly drawing near death; a truce to jesting;\r\nlet me have a confessor to confess me, and a notary to make my will;\r\nfor in extremities like this, man must not trifle with his soul; and\r\nwhile the curate is confessing me let someone, I beg, go for the\r\nnotary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked at one another, wondering at Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s words; but,\r\nthough uncertain, they were inclined to believe him, and one of the\r\nsigns by which they came to the conclusion he was dying was this so\r\nsudden and complete return to his senses after having been mad; for to\r\nthe words already quoted he added much more, so well expressed, so\r\ndevout, and so rational, as to banish all doubt and convince them that\r\nhe was sound of mind. The curate turned them all out, and left alone\r\nwith him confessed him. The bachelor went for the notary and returned\r\nshortly afterwards with him and with Sancho, who, having already\r\nlearned from the bachelor the condition his master was in, and finding\r\nthe housekeeper and niece weeping, began to blubber and shed tears.\r\n\r\nThe confession over, the curate came out saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAlonso Quixano the\r\nGood is indeed dying, and is indeed in his right mind; we may now go in\r\nto him while he makes his will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis news gave a tremendous impulse to the brimming eyes of the\r\nhousekeeper, niece, and Sancho Panza his good squire, making the tears\r\nburst from their eyes and a host of sighs from their hearts; for of a\r\ntruth, as has been said more than once, whether as plain Alonso Quixano\r\nthe Good, or as Don Quixote of La Mancha, Don Quixote was always of a\r\ngentle disposition and kindly in all his ways, and hence he was\r\nbeloved, not only by those of his own house, but by all who knew him.\r\n\r\nThe notary came in with the rest, and as soon as the preamble of the\r\nwill had been set out and Don Quixote had commended his soul to God\r\nwith all the devout formalities that are usual, coming to the bequests,\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cItem, it is my will that, touching certain moneys in the\r\nhands of Sancho Panza (whom in my madness I made my squire), inasmuch\r\nas between him and me there have been certain accounts and debits and\r\ncredits, no claim be made against him, nor any account demanded of him\r\nin respect of them; but that if anything remain over and above, after\r\nhe has paid himself what I owe him, the balance, which will be but\r\nlittle, shall be his, and much good may it do him; and if, as when I\r\nwas mad I had a share in giving him the government of an island, so,\r\nnow that I am in my senses, I could give him that of a kingdom, it\r\nshould be his, for the simplicity of his character and the fidelity of\r\nhis conduct deserve it.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, turning to Sancho, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cForgive\r\nme, my friend, that I led thee to seem as mad as myself, making thee\r\nfall into the same error I myself fell into, that there were and still\r\nare knights-errant in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancho weeping, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t die, master, but take my advice and\r\nlive many years; for the foolishest thing a man can do in this life is\r\nto let himself die without rhyme or reason, without anybody killing\r\nhim, or any hands but melancholy\xe2\x80\x99s making an end of him. Come, don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nlazy, but get up from your bed and let us take to the fields in\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99s trim as we agreed. Perhaps behind some bush we shall find\r\nthe lady Dulcinea disenchanted, as fine as fine can be. If it be that\r\nyou are dying of vexation at having been vanquished, lay the blame on\r\nme, and say you were overthrown because I had girthed Rocinante badly;\r\nbesides you must have seen in your books of chivalry that it is a\r\ncommon thing for knights to upset one another, and for him who is\r\nconquered to-day to be conqueror to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samson, \xe2\x80\x9cand good Sancho Panza\xe2\x80\x99s view of these cases\r\nis quite right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSirs, not so fast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Quixote, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98in last year\xe2\x80\x99s nests there are\r\nno birds this year.\xe2\x80\x99 I was mad, now I am in my senses; I was Don\r\nQuixote of La Mancha, I am now, as I said, Alonso Quixano the Good; and\r\nmay my repentance and sincerity restore me to the esteem you used to\r\nhave for me; and now let Master Notary proceed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cItem, I leave all my property absolutely to Antonia Quixana my niece,\r\nhere present, after all has been deducted from the most available\r\nportion of it that may be required to satisfy the bequests I have made.\r\nAnd the first disbursement I desire to be made is the payment of the\r\nwages I owe for the time my housekeeper has served me, with twenty\r\nducats, over and above, for a gown. The curate and the bachelor Samson\r\nCarrasco, now present, I appoint my executors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cItem, it is my wish that if Antonia Quixana, my niece, desires to\r\nmarry, she shall marry a man of whom it shall be first of all\r\nascertained by information taken that he does not know what books of\r\nchivalry are; and if it should be proved that he does, and if, in spite\r\nof this, my niece insists upon marrying him, and does marry him, then\r\nthat she shall forfeit the whole of what I have left her, which my\r\nexecutors shall devote to works of charity as they please.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cItem, I entreat the aforesaid gentlemen my executors, that, if any\r\nhappy chance should lead them to discover the author who is said to\r\nhave written a history now going about under the title of \xe2\x80\x98Second Part\r\nof the Achievements of Don Quixote of La Mancha,\xe2\x80\x99 they beg of him on my\r\nbehalf as earnestly as they can to forgive me for having been, without\r\nintending it, the cause of his writing so many and such monstrous\r\nabsurdities as he has written in it; for I am leaving the world with a\r\nfeeling of compunction at having provoked him to write them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this he closed his will, and a faintness coming over him he\r\nstretched himself out at full length on the bed. All were in a flutter\r\nand made haste to relieve him, and during the three days he lived after\r\nthat on which he made his will he fainted away very often. The house\r\nwas all in confusion; but still the niece ate and the housekeeper drank\r\nand Sancho Panza enjoyed himself; for inheriting property wipes out or\r\nsoftens down in the heir the feeling of grief the dead man might be\r\nexpected to leave behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np74b.jpg (391K)\r\n\r\nFull Size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s end came, after he had received all the\r\nsacraments, and had in full and forcible terms expressed his\r\ndetestation of books of chivalry. The notary was there at the time, and\r\nhe said that in no book of chivalry had he ever read of any\r\nknight-errant dying in his bed so calmly and so like a Christian as Don\r\nQuixote, who amid the tears and lamentations of all present yielded up\r\nhis spirit, that is to say died. On perceiving it the curate begged the\r\nnotary to bear witness that Alonso Quixano the Good, commonly called\r\nDon Quixote of La Mancha, had passed away from this present life, and\r\ndied naturally; and said he desired this testimony in order to remove\r\nthe possibility of any other author save Cide Hamete Benengeli bringing\r\nhim to life again falsely and making interminable stories out of his\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\nSuch was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village\r\nCide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the\r\ntowns and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the\r\nright to adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of\r\nGreece contended for Homer. The lamentations of Sancho and the niece\r\nand housekeeper are omitted here, as well as the new epitaphs upon his\r\ntomb; Samson Carrasco, however, put the following lines:\r\n\r\nA doughty gentleman lies here;\r\nA stranger all his life to fear;\r\nNor in his death could Death prevail,\r\nIn that last hour, to make him quail.\r\n\r\nHe for the world but little cared;\r\nAnd at his feats the world was scared;\r\nA crazy man his life he passed,\r\nBut in his senses died at last.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd said most sage Cide Hamete to his pen, \xe2\x80\x9cRest here, hung up by this\r\nbrass wire, upon this shelf, O my pen, whether of skilful make or\r\nclumsy cut I know not; here shalt thou remain long ages hence, unless\r\npresumptuous or malignant story-tellers take thee down to profane thee.\r\nBut ere they touch thee warn them, and, as best thou canst, say to\r\nthem:\r\n\r\nHold off! ye weaklings; hold your hands!\r\nAdventure it let none,\r\nFor this emprise, my lord the king,\r\nWas meant for me alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor me alone was Don Quixote born, and I for him; it was his to act,\r\nmine to write; we two together make but one, notwithstanding and in\r\nspite of that pretended Tordesillesque writer who has ventured or would\r\nventure with his great, coarse, ill-trimmed ostrich quill to write the\r\nachievements of my valiant knight;\xe2\x80\x94no burden for his shoulders, nor\r\nsubject for his frozen wit: whom, if perchance thou shouldst come to\r\nknow him, thou shalt warn to leave at rest where they lie the weary\r\nmouldering bones of Don Quixote, and not to attempt to carry him off,\r\nin opposition to all the privileges of death, to Old Castile, making\r\nhim rise from the grave where in reality and truth he lies stretched at\r\nfull length, powerless to make any third expedition or new sally; for\r\nthe two that he has already made, so much to the enjoyment and approval\r\nof everybody to whom they have become known, in this as well as in\r\nforeign countries, are quite sufficient for the purpose of turning into\r\nridicule the whole of those made by the whole set of the\r\nknights-errant; and so doing shalt thou discharge thy Christian\r\ncalling, giving good counsel to one that bears ill-will to thee. And I\r\nshall remain satisfied, and proud to have been the first who has ever\r\nenjoyed the fruit of his writings as fully as he could desire; for my\r\ndesire has been no other than to deliver over to the detestation of\r\nmankind the false and foolish tales of the books of chivalry, which,\r\nthanks to that of my true Don Quixote, are even now tottering, and\r\ndoubtless doomed to fall for ever.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
