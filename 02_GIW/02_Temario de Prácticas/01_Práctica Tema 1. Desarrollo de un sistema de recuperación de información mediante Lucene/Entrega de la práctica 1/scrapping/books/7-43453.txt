Having served an apprenticeship with a leather dresser,\r\nhe commenced business in Newburyport shortly after he was one and\r\ntwenty, and being industrious and economical, he soon found himself\r\nin good circumstances. In the year 1770 he married, and receiving a\r\nconsiderable amount of money with his wife, he was thus put in possession\r\nof a moderate fortune. In 1776 he had for one of his apprentices the\r\nno less eccentric, and afterwards the no less noted Jonathan Plumer,\r\njun., "travelling preacher, physician and poet," as he was accustomed\r\nto style himself, and of whom we shall hereafter speak. In addition to\r\nhis regular business of selling leather breeches, gloves "soutabel for\r\nwimen\'s ware," &c. he engaged in commercial speculations, and in various\r\nkinds of business, and was unusually successful. He traded with merchants\r\nand speculators in the then Province of Maine, was engaged to some extent\r\nin the West India trade. He also purchased a large amount of what were\r\ncalled State securities, which were eventually redeemed at prices far\r\nexceeding their original cost. Some of his speculations in whalebone\r\nand warming pans are mentioned by himself on page 23 of this work. Thus\r\nin various ways he added to his property, and in a few years he became\r\na wealthy man. With wealth came the desire of distinction, and as his\r\nvanity was inordinate he spared no expence in obtaining the notoriety he\r\nsought. In the first place he purchased an elegant house in High Street,\r\nNewburyport, and embellished it in his peculiar way. Minarets surmounted\r\nwith golden balls were placed on the roof, a large gilt eagle was placed\r\non the top, and a great variety of other ornaments. In front of his house\r\nand land he caused to be erected between forty and fifty wooden statues,\r\nfull length and larger than life. The principal arch stood directly in\r\nfront of his door, and on this stood the figures of Washington, Adams\r\nand Jefferson. There were also the statues of William Pitt, Franklin,\r\nBonaparte, George IV, Lord Nelson, Gen. Morgan, Cornplanter, an Indian\r\nChief, Jack Tar, Traveling Preacher, Maternal Affection, Two Grenadiers,\r\nFour Lions and one Lamb, and conspicuous among them were two images of\r\nDexter himself, one of which held a label with the inscription "_I am the\r\nfirst in the East, the first in the West, and the greatest philosopher\r\nin the Western world_." In order that the interior of his house should\r\ncorrespond with the exterior, the most costly furniture was imported from\r\nFrance, and the walls hung with paintings, brought from Holland and other\r\nparts of Europe. A library was also provided, but how large or valuable\r\nwe are not able to say. An elegant coach with a span of beautiful cream\r\ncolored horses was procured, on which was painted his coat of arms,\r\nwith the baronial supporters, after the manner of the English nobility.\r\nWith this equipage he took the title of Lord Dexter, because, as he said,\r\nit was "the voice of the people at Large." He was sometimes called\r\nthe Marquis of Newburyport. Having completed the embelishments of his\r\nhouse and gardens, Lord Dexter busied himself in receiving the visits of\r\nthe crowds, who were drawn by curiosity to his house. His gardens were\r\nthrown open to their inspection, and he was liberal to all. The fame of\r\nhis hospitality attracted as many visitors as the fame of his images. To\r\ngratify his vanity he selected in imitation of European princes, a poet\r\nlaureate. This was no other than his former apprentice, Jonathan Plumer,\r\njun., a native of Newbury. They had once been associated as master and\r\napprentice, but now stood in the relation of patron and poet. From the\r\nauto-biography of Plumer a very curious and scarce production of 244\r\npages, the following extract is taken, which may serve to give some idea\r\nof the versatility of his genius.--"I had," says he, "some practice as\r\na physician, and earned something with my pen, but for several years\r\nwas obliged chiefly to follow various kinds of business accounted\r\nless honorable, viz: Farming, repeating select passages from authors,\r\nselling halibut, sawing wood, selling books and ballads in the streets,\r\nserving as post boy, filling beds with straw and wheeling them to the\r\nowners thereof, collecting rags, &c." He had previously served one or two\r\ncampaigns as a soldier, and on his return from the wars he taught school\r\nfor some time in New Hampshire. The ballads, which he hawked about, were\r\ngenerally his own composition. Every horrid accident, bloody murder, a\r\nshipwreck, or any other dreadful catastrophe, was sure to be followed by\r\na statement of the facts, a sermon and a poem. In the capacity of ballad\r\nmaker and monger he attracted the notice of Dexter, in whose service he\r\nentered for a small salary as poet laureate. He wore a livery, consisting\r\nof a black frock coat, adorned with stars and fringes, a cocked hat\r\nand black breeches. He was crowned in the garden of his patron with a\r\nwreath of parsley, instead of laurel, but the ceremony was interrupted\r\nbefore its completion by a mob of boys, and both patron and poet put to\r\nflight. One specimen of his laudatory verses may be seen on page 29 of\r\nthis work, which will give the reader some idea of his qualifications\r\nfor the office to which he was elected. How well he was satisfied with\r\nthe praises of the poet we are not informed, but feeling probably that\r\nno person but himself could do justice to the ideas, which he wished\r\nto present to the public, he commenced writing for the press. Several\r\nof these effusions were printed in the newspapers.--The larger part\r\nof them written at different times are embodied in the present work, a\r\nlarge edition of which was published by himself and given away. In this\r\nedition not a stop or a mark was used in any line of his writings, but\r\nin the second edition one entire page was filled with stops and marks,\r\nwith a recommendation from the author to his readers, to use them where\r\nthey were wanted in the work, or in his own language, "to peper and\r\nsoolt it as they pleased." Dexter had two children, Samuel and Nancy,\r\nneither of whom was distinguished for strength of intellect. The son was\r\na dissipated prodigal and died young. The daughter, of whom mention is\r\nmade by the father in the following pages, was married to Abraham Bishop\r\nof New Haven, who we are informed treated her with neglect and cruelty.\r\nA divorce followed and she became intemperate, lost what little reason\r\nshe had, and is still living, a wretched object. Lord Dexter himself,\r\nif we may judge from his own writings and from what we have heard, was\r\nnot happy in his domestic relations. He complains much of his wife,\r\nwhom he calls the "gost," and charges the cause of his separation\r\nfrom her for thirteen years to his son Bishop. His own temper was\r\nirascible, and several stories are told of the excesses, into which\r\nit would sometimes lead him. He ordered his painter, Mr. Babson, to\r\nplace the word "Constitution" on the scroll in the hand of the figure of\r\nJefferson, which the latter, knowing the artist designed it to represent\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, refused to do. Dexter was so incensed\r\nby this refusal, that he went into the house, and brought out a pistol,\r\nwhich he deliberately fired at the painter; but he was a poor shot, and\r\nthe ball missing its object, entered the side of the house. At another\r\ntime, seeing a countryman, as he thought, rather impudently viewing his\r\npremises, he ordered his son to fire at the stranger. He refused to do so,\r\nwhen the father threatened to shoot him unless he complied. His son then\r\nobeyed. The stranger escaped unhurt, but entered a complaint, and Lord\r\nTimothy was, in consequence, sentenced to the house of correction for\r\nseveral months. He went thither in his own coach, priding himself\r\non being the first man who had been to the county house in his own\r\ncarriage, drawn by two splendid horses. He soon grew tired, however, of\r\nhis confinement, and procured a release, which it was said, cost him a\r\nthousand dollars. The individual, who exercised most influence over Dexter\r\nwas a negro woman, named Lucy Lancaster, or as she was commonly called\r\n"Black Luce," a woman of uncommon strength of mind, great shrewdness\r\nand remarkable for her powers of memory and knowledge of human nature,\r\nbut as wicked as she was sagacious. She thought him an honest man, and\r\nnot so deficient in intellect as many people supposed, and attributed\r\nhis eccentricities to an excess of animal spirits.--This was probably to\r\nsome extent true, though it is certain that other spirits contributed in\r\nno small degree to the excesses of his temper and the peculiarities of\r\nhis taste. He was addicted to drunkenness, and with his son and other\r\ncompanions, kept up his revels in the best apartments of his house,\r\nby which in a very short time, all his costly furniture was ruined,\r\nor very much injured.\r\n\r\n"Not insensible that he must share the common lot, Dexter, many years\r\nbefore his death, prepared himself a tomb. It was the basement story of\r\nhis summer-house, magnificently fitted, and open to the light of day. His\r\ncoffin, made of the best mahogany which he could find, superbly lined,\r\nand adorned with silver handles, he kept in a room of the house, and\r\ntook great pleasure in exhibiting it to visitors--at other times it was\r\nlocked up. Soon after his death apparatus was prepared, Dexter got up a\r\nmock funeral, which with all but his family and a few associates was to\r\npass as real. Various people in the town were invited by card, who came\r\nand found the family clad in mourning, and preparations for the funeral\r\ngoing forward. The burial service was read by a wag, who then pronounced\r\na bombastic eulogy upon the deceased. The mourners moved in procession to\r\nthe tomb in the garden, the coffin was deposited, and they returned to\r\nthe large hall, where a sumptuous entertainment was provided. While the\r\nfeast was going on, a loud noise attracted the guests to the kitchen,\r\nwhere they beheld the arisen Lord caning his wife for not having shed\r\na tear during the ceremony! He entered the hall with the astonished\r\nmourners, in high spirits, joined in the rout, threw money from the\r\nwindow to the crowd of boys, and expressed his satisfaction with every\r\nthing except the indifference of his wife, and the silence of the bells."\r\n\r\nLord Dexter died at his house, on the 26th of October, 1806, in his 60th\r\nyear, and by direction of the Board of Health, his remains were interred\r\nin the common burying place. His grave is marked by a simple stone.\r\n\r\nThe Dexter mansion, is yet standing, and is a very fine tenement, but\r\nretains few traces of the whims of its late proprietor. Of the images,\r\nupwards of forty in number, only the three Presidents now remain, the\r\nothers having been cast down by the resistless hand of time. Some of\r\nthem were blown down in the great gale of September, 1815, and were sold\r\nat auction.\r\n\r\nThe cut fronting the Biography gives a very excellent and faithful\r\nrepresentation of Lord Dexter in his walking habits, and the likeness of\r\nthe dog is equally perfect. The dog was perfectly black and the skin as\r\nentirely free from hair as that of an elephant. He differed as much from\r\nother dogs as did his master and his friend, the poet, differ from other\r\npeople. The likenesses of all three were drawn with great accuracy by\r\nJames Aiken, Esq. now a resident of Philadelphia, and could the patron\r\nand the poet be seen in proper person, dressed in the costume of that\r\nday, they would be objects of great curiosity. But they are gone, and\r\nof each it may be truly said,\r\n\r\n\r\n  We ne\'er shall look upon his like again.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of Lord Dexter\'s Mansion, High Street,

Impartial Herald.\r\n\r\n_Messrs. Blunt & March_,\r\n\r\nI say to whom it may concern--to the majesty of the people of Newburyport,\r\nGreeting--\r\n\r\nIt costs Eight hundred Dollars a year to support a watch in this town, and\r\nyer gentlemen\'s windows are broken, fences pulled down and Cellars broken\r\nopen, and much other misdemeanors done at night. Are the watch asleep, or\r\nare they afraid to detect those who are guilty of such practises? Boast\r\nnot of it if you call this Liberty and Equality. Newburyport has had\r\nthe name of being a very civil worthy place; it is a great pity some bad\r\nboys or young men should disgrace it. I hope our worthy and honorable\r\nrulers will bring those rude lads to see themselves and lick the dust\r\nlike serpents, and ask forgiveness of their betters, and do so no more,\r\nbut repent and live.\r\n\r\nNow fellow citizens is it wisdom, is it policy, to use a man or men so\r\nshocking bad as to oblige them to leave the town where they paid one\r\nDollar a day to support government?\r\n\r\nA friend to good order, honor to whom it belongs--to great men a\r\nfriend--to all good citizens and honest men good bye.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas many philosophers has judged or guessed at many things about\r\nthis world, and so on. Now I suppose I may guess, as it is guessing\r\ntimes. I guess the world is one very large living creature, and always\r\nwas, and always will be without any end from everlasting to everlasting,\r\nand no end. What grows on this large creature is trees and many other\r\nthings. In the room of hair the rocks is moulds. This is called land\r\nwhere the hair grows, the belly the sea--all kinds of fish is the worms\r\nin the belly. This large body wants dressing to get our living of this\r\ncreature and by industry we get a living--we and all the animal creation\r\nis less than fleas in comparison on the back or belly of this very large\r\nimmense body. Among the hairs to work this great body is that of nature,\r\npast finding out.--All we know is we are here, we come into the world\r\ncrying and go out groaning. Mankind is the master beast on the earth--in\r\nthe sea, the whale is the head fish--the minim is the smallest fish--the\r\ngreat fish eat up the little ones, and so not only destroy one another,\r\nbut they are master over the whole of beasts and fish, even over a lion,\r\ntherefore man is the masterly beast and the worst of the whole--they know\r\nthe most, and act the worst according to what they know. Seeing mankind so\r\nbad by nature, I think when the candle goes out, men and women is done,\r\nthey will lay as dirt or rocks till the great gun fires, and when that\r\ngoes off the gun will be so large that the gun will contain nine hundred\r\nmillion tons of the best of good powder, then that will shake and bring\r\nall the bones together, then the world will be to an end. All kinds of\r\nmusic will be going on, funding systems will be laid aside, the melody\r\nwill be very great. Now why cant you all believe the above written as\r\nwell as many other things to be true; as well as what was set forth in\r\nthe last Centinel concerning digging up a frog twenty five feet below\r\nthe surface, where it was most as hard as a rock--there was his shape\r\nlike taking a stone out of a rock--This is from a minister. Now why wont\r\nyou believe me as well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWONDER OF WONDERS!\r\n\r\nHow great the soul is! Do not you all wonder & admire to see and behold\r\nand hear? Can you all believe half the truth, and admire to hear the\r\nwonders how great the soul is--only behold--past finding out! Only see\r\nhow large the soul is!--that if a man is drowned in the sea, what a\r\ngreat bubble comes up out of the top of the water! the last of the man\r\ndying under water--this is wind--is the soul that is the last to ascend\r\nout of the deep to glory--it is the breath from on high doth go on high\r\nto glory. The bubble is the soul. A young fellow\'s for gunning for the\r\ngood of bodies and souls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nMy frinds & felow mortals there is A first Cose of all things

nature! The\r\nmany literary qualifications he possesses rank him foremost among literary\r\ncharacters.----That unequalled production from the pen of this wonderful\r\nphilosopher, denominated "_A Pickle for the Knowing Ones_," has not only\r\nreceived universal applause, and been ranked as of the first magnitude\r\nin the literary world, but has had such rapidity in its sale, that a\r\ncopy cannot be procured, though diligently sought after by men of the\r\nmost transcendant merit.\r\n\r\nWhere can we find a man so extensively useful, and so eminently\r\ncalculated to diffuse light to a dark and ignorant multitude, as this\r\nrare philosopher? How penetrating his understanding! How deep his\r\nideas! What a multitude of discoveries which before were hid in embryo,\r\nhave made their appearance at the nod of his genius! Surely we may say,\r\nBlessed are the people who are highly favored with the greatest Luminary\r\nthat ever gave light to an existing world!!\r\n\r\nWhile aiming at a just portrait of this remarkable Naturalist and\r\nPhilosopher, his generosity is no less a subject of admiration, than\r\nhis literary and philosophical abilities. The readiness with which his\r\nbenevolent soul bestows donations calls forth the grateful acknowledgement\r\nof all who have been liberally assisted from his bountiful hand.\r\n\r\nSee him the first to assist in building a church for the worship of\r\nGod! See him liberally give for the purchase of bells, the ready cash,\r\nwithout hesitation! See him expending his fortune to preserve in\r\neverlasting romembrance, characters who have shone with unexampled\r\ngreatness in Europe and America! Here the subject fails. Vain man may\r\nas well attempt to stop the course of nature, as to do ample justice to\r\nthis wonderful man!\r\n\r\n\r\n  Behold all nature stands aghast\r\n  To hear thy fame from east to west!\r\n  How great how grand of thee we hear,\r\n  Thou man of sense--thou eastern star!\r\n\r\n  All men inquire--but few can tell\r\n  How thou in science doth excel!\r\n  Great philosophic genius, we,\r\n  The meanest reptiles, bow the knee.\r\n\r\n  At thy majestic shrine we shrink!\r\n  What can we do, or say, or think!\r\n  When contemplating on thy worth.\r\n  Which hath astonish\'d all the earth.\r\n\r\n  Great DEXTER, did the world do right,\r\n  Thy name would shine with brilliant light!\r\n  Each would declare thy wond\'rous fame,\r\n  And shout at DEXTER\'S mighty name!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  SALEM, _June 14, 1805_\r\n\r\nMY LORD DEXTER,\r\n\r\nBy the politeness of Mr. _Emerson_ I received the very valuable contents\r\nof your package. A new edition of that unprecedented performance, entitled\r\n"A Pickle for the Knowing Ones," &c. is very urgently called for by the\r\nfriends of literature in this country and in England--and I presume with\r\nthe additions and improvements intended to accompany the second edition,\r\nprovided it should be well printed, would entitle the author to a seat\r\nwith the Disciples of Sir Joseph Banks, if not to a place in Bonaparte\'s\r\nLegion of Honor--for my Lord DEXTER is an honorable man. But, sir, the\r\nwork cannot be executed for the sum named--nor in the time specified.--I\r\nwill print an edition of 500 copies with the additions, for fifty dollars,\r\nand cannot possibly do them for less.\r\n\r\nWishing your Lordship health in perpetuity--a continuance of your\r\nadmirable reasoning faculties--good _spirits_, and an abundance of\r\nwealth--and finally a safe passage over any river not with _Sticks_,\r\nbut a pleasure boat, I remain yours with the utmost profundity.\r\n\r\n                                                             W. CARLTON.\r\n\r\n  _The Right Honorable Lord_ DEXTER, }\r\n    _Kt. Newburyport_.               }\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_The follering peases are not my Riting but very drole_\r\n\r\n                                                          TIMOTHY DEXTER\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. MELCHER,\r\n\r\n    _Your publishing the following extract from a letter said to be\r\n    from a trader among the Indians to a friend, may amuse some of\r\n    your customers for the Gazette._\r\n\r\nA few days ago one of the Indians paid me a visit. After some\r\nconversation, he said that a minister from the United States had been with\r\nhis tribe to teach them the Christian religion. He says that there is but\r\none only living and true God, who is a good, wise, and powerful spirit\r\n(this Indian say too) and that there are three persons in the god head,\r\nof one substance and power, God the father, God the Son and God the Holy\r\nGhost, that the Father is of none, neither begotten, or proceeding,\r\nthe Son is eternally begotten of the Father, the Holy Ghost eternally\r\nproceeding from the Father and the Son, and that the Holy Ghost visited\r\na virgin, and conveyed the Son into her; where he continued nine moons\r\nand then was born like other children, was born God and man, that when\r\nhe was about thirty years old began to preach, but the great men no like\r\nhis preaching, sent their warriors, who took and killed him.\r\n\r\nIndians ask what all this talk mean, he say that the first man and woman\r\nbroke God\'s law in eating what God had forbidden, that therefore they and\r\nall the children that should proceed from them must die, and be punished\r\nafter death forever; that the Son came and died to save some of mankind\r\nfrom being punished after death. Oh! \'trange that man could kill God\r\nthe Son, and that his death be of service to mankind--great many people\r\ndie before the Son of God, and did not know any thing about him--it was\r\nthen asked whether his dying would do poor Indians any good; he say yes,\r\nif they believe; then me say that pappoose no believe them do no good;\r\nhe say you must leave that with God, and believe for yourself--one say\r\nit is hard to believe such \'tories; if Indian tell such \'trange things,\r\nthe white people no believe um.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _A curious Sermon, by the Rev. Mr. Hyberdin, which he made at\r\n    the request of certain thieves that robbed him on a hill near\r\n    Hartlgrow, in Hampshire, (England) in their presence and at\r\n    that instant._\r\n\r\nI greatly marvel that any man will disgrace thieving, and think that\r\nthe doers thereof are worthy of death, considering it as a thing that\r\ncometh near unto virtue, being used in all countries, and allowed by\r\nGod himself; the thing which I cannot compendiously show unto you at so\r\nshort a warning, and on so sharp an occasion. I must desire you, gentle\r\naudience of thieves, to take in good part what at this time cometh into\r\nmy mind, not doubting but that you, through your good knowledge, are\r\nable to add much more unto it, than this which I shall now offer unto you.\r\n\r\nFirst, Fortitude and stoutness of courage, and also boldness of mind,\r\nis commended of some men to be a virtue; which being granted, who is\r\nthere then that will not judge thieves to be virtuous? For they are of\r\nall men the most stout and hardy, and the most void of fear; for thieving\r\nis a thing usual among all men; for not only you that are here present,\r\nbut also many others in divers places, both men, women and children, rich\r\nand poor, are daily of the faculty, as the hangman at Newgate can testify;\r\nand that it is allowed of by God himself is evident from Scripture; For\r\nif you examine the whole course of the Bible you will find that thieves\r\nhave been beloved of God; for Jacob, when he came out of Mesopotamia,\r\ndid steal his uncle Laban\'s kids. The same Jacob did also steal his\r\nbrother Esau\'s blessing; and yet God said, _I have chosen Jacob and\r\nrefused Esau_. The children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt,\r\ndid steal the Egyptian\'s jewels of silver and jewels of gold, as God\r\ncommanded them to do.\r\n\r\nDavid, in the days of Abiathar, the high priest, came into the temple and\r\nstole the hallowed bread; and yet God said, "David is a man after my own\r\nheart." Christ himself, when he was here on earth, did take an ass and\r\ncolt that was none of his; and yet God said, "This is my beloved son,\r\nin whom I am well pleased." _Thus you see that God delighted in thieves._\r\n\r\nBut most of all I marvel that men can despise thieves, whereas in many\r\npoints you be like Christ himself; for Christ had no dwelling place no\r\nmore than you--Christ at length was caught, and so will you--he went to\r\nhell and so will you. In this you differ from him, for he rose and went\r\ninto heaven--so you will never do without God\'s great mercy, which God\r\ngrant you. To whom with the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, be all honor\r\nand glory, for ever and ever. AMEN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Providence Phoenix of December, 1804.\r\n\r\nMARQUIS OF NEWBURYPORT!!\r\n\r\n\r\n    [_On Monday last arrived in this town the most noble and\r\n    illustrious Lord TIMOTHY DEXTER, of Newburyport, Massachusetts,\r\n    who has since his arrival requested the publication of the\r\n    following stanzas in this day\'s paper, as a humble tribute to\r\n    the incomprehensible majesty of his name!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\r\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\r\nFoundation\'s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
