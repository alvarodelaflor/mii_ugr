Night\r\nafter night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied\r\nthe lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it\r\nlighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If he was dead, I thought,\r\nI would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew\r\nthat two candles must be set at the head of a corpse. He had often said\r\nto me: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not long for this world,\xe2\x80\x9d and I had thought his words\r\nidle. Now I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up at the\r\nwindow I said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always\r\nsounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and\r\nthe word simony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the\r\nname of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and\r\nyet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.\r\n\r\nOld Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs to\r\nsupper. While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said, as if\r\nreturning to some former remark of his:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say he was exactly ... but there was something queer\r\n... there was something uncanny about him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you my\r\nopinion....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion in his\r\nmind. Tiresome old fool! When we knew him first he used to be rather\r\ninteresting, talking of faints and worms; but I soon grew tired of him\r\nand his endless stories about the distillery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have my own theory about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it was one of those\r\n... peculiar cases.... But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory. My\r\nuncle saw me staring and said to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so your old friend is gone, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be sorry to hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Flynn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Cotter here has just told us. He was passing by the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as if the\r\nnews had not interested me. My uncle explained to old Cotter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe youngster and he were great friends. The old chap taught him a\r\ngreat deal, mind you; and they say he had a great wish for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod have mercy on his soul,\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt piously.\r\n\r\nOld Cotter looked at me for a while. I felt that his little beady black\r\neyes were examining me but I would not satisfy him by looking up from\r\nmy plate. He returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the\r\ngrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like children of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto have too much to say\r\nto a man like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean, Mr Cotter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I mean is,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Cotter, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s bad for children. My idea is:\r\nlet a young lad run about and play with young lads of his own age and\r\nnot be.... Am I right, Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my principle, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him learn to box his\r\ncorner. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m always saying to that Rosicrucian there: take\r\nexercise. Why, when I was a nipper every morning of my life I had a\r\ncold bath, winter and summer. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what stands to me now.\r\nEducation is all very fine and large.... Mr Cotter might take a pick of\r\nthat leg mutton,\xe2\x80\x9d he added to my aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Cotter.\r\n\r\nMy aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for children, Mr Cotter?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s bad for children,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Cotter, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause their minds are so\r\nimpressionable. When children see things like that, you know, it has an\r\neffect....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give utterance to my\r\nanger. Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile!\r\n\r\nIt was late when I fell asleep. Though I was angry with old Cotter for\r\nalluding to me as a child, I puzzled my head to extract meaning from\r\nhis unfinished sentences. In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw\r\nagain the heavy grey face of the paralytic. I drew the blankets over my\r\nhead and tried to think of Christmas. But the grey face still followed\r\nme. It murmured; and I understood that it desired to confess something.\r\nI felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region; and\r\nthere again I found it waiting for me. It began to confess to me in a\r\nmurmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the\r\nlips were so moist with spittle. But then I remembered that it had died\r\nof paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve\r\nthe simoniac of his sin.\r\n\r\nThe next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the little\r\nhouse in Great Britain Street. It was an unassuming shop, registered\r\nunder the vague name of _Drapery_. The drapery consisted mainly of\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s bootees and umbrellas; and on ordinary days a notice used to\r\nhang in the window, saying: _Umbrellas Re-covered_. No notice was\r\nvisible now for the shutters were up. A crape bouquet was tied to the\r\ndoor-knocker with ribbon. Two poor women and a telegram boy were\r\nreading the card pinned on the crape. I also approached and read:\r\n\r\n     July 1st, 1895\r\n     The Rev. James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n     Church, Meath Street), aged sixty-five years.\r\n     _R. I. P._\r\n\r\nThe reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was\r\ndisturbed to find myself at check. Had he not been dead I would have\r\ngone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in\r\nhis arm-chair by the fire, nearly smothered in his great-coat. Perhaps\r\nmy aunt would have given me a packet of High Toast for him and this\r\npresent would have roused him from his stupefied doze. It was always I\r\nwho emptied the packet into his black snuff-box for his hands trembled\r\ntoo much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about\r\nthe floor. Even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose\r\nlittle clouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the front of\r\nhis coat. It may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave\r\nhis ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red\r\nhandkerchief, blackened, as it always was, with the snuff-stains of a\r\nweek, with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains, was quite\r\ninefficacious.\r\n\r\nI wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage to knock. I\r\nwalked away slowly along the sunny side of the street, reading all the\r\ntheatrical advertisements in the shop-windows as I went. I found it\r\nstrange that neither I nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt\r\neven annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I\r\nhad been freed from something by his death. I wondered at this for, as\r\nmy uncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great deal. He\r\nhad studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to\r\npronounce Latin properly. He had told me stories about the catacombs\r\nand about Napoleon Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning of\r\nthe different ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments\r\nworn by the priest. Sometimes he had amused himself by putting\r\ndifficult questions to me, asking me what one should do in certain\r\ncircumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or\r\nonly imperfections. His questions showed me how complex and mysterious\r\nwere certain institutions of the Church which I had always regarded as\r\nthe simplest acts. The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and\r\ntowards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I\r\nwondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake\r\nthem; and I was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the\r\nChurch had written books as thick as the _Post Office Directory_ and as\r\nclosely printed as the law notices in the newspaper, elucidating all\r\nthese intricate questions. Often when I thought of this I could make no\r\nanswer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to\r\nsmile and nod his head twice or thrice. Sometimes he used to put me\r\nthrough the responses of the Mass which he had made me learn by heart;\r\nand, as I pattered, he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now\r\nand then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately.\r\nWhen he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his\r\ntongue lie upon his lower lip\xe2\x80\x94a habit which had made me feel uneasy in\r\nthe beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well.\r\n\r\nAs I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter\xe2\x80\x99s words and tried\r\nto remember what had happened afterwards in the dream. I remembered\r\nthat I had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique\r\nfashion. I felt that I had been very far away, in some land where the\r\ncustoms were strange\xe2\x80\x94in Persia, I thought.... But I could not remember\r\nthe end of the dream.\r\n\r\nIn the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning.\r\nIt was after sunset; but the window-panes of the houses that looked to\r\nthe west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds. Nannie\r\nreceived us in the hall; and, as it would have been unseemly to have\r\nshouted at her, my aunt shook hands with her for all. The old woman\r\npointed upwards interrogatively and, on my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s nodding, proceeded to\r\ntoil up the narrow staircase before us, her bowed head being scarcely\r\nabove the level of the banister-rail. At the first landing she stopped\r\nand beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the\r\ndead-room. My aunt went in and the old woman, seeing that I hesitated\r\nto enter, began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand.\r\n\r\nI went in on tiptoe. The room through the lace end of the blind was\r\nsuffused with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like\r\npale thin flames. He had been coffined. Nannie gave the lead and we\r\nthree knelt down at the foot of the bed. I pretended to pray but I\r\ncould not gather my thoughts because the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s mutterings\r\ndistracted me. I noticed how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back\r\nand how the heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side.\r\nThe fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in\r\nhis coffin.\r\n\r\nBut no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I saw that he\r\nwas not smiling. There he lay, solemn and copious, vested as for the\r\naltar, his large hands loosely retaining a chalice. His face was very\r\ntruculent, grey and massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled\r\nby a scanty white fur. There was a heavy odour in the room\xe2\x80\x94the flowers.\r\n\r\nWe blessed ourselves and came away. In the little room downstairs we\r\nfound Eliza seated in his arm-chair in state. I groped my way towards\r\nmy usual chair in the corner while Nannie went to the sideboard and\r\nbrought out a decanter of sherry and some wine-glasses. She set these\r\non the table and invited us to take a little glass of wine. Then, at\r\nher sister\xe2\x80\x99s bidding, she filled out the sherry into the glasses and\r\npassed them to us. She pressed me to take some cream crackers also but\r\nI declined because I thought I would make too much noise eating them.\r\nShe seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over\r\nquietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister. No one spoke:\r\nwe all gazed at the empty fireplace.\r\n\r\nMy aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to a better world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent. My aunt fingered the\r\nstem of her wine-glass before sipping a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he ... peacefully?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, quite peacefully, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza. \xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell when the\r\nbreath went out of him. He had a beautiful death, God be praised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd everything...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke was in with him a Tuesday and anointed him and\r\nprepared him and all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knew then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was quite resigned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks quite resigned,\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what the woman we had in to wash him said. She said he just\r\nlooked as if he was asleep, he looked that peaceful and resigned. No\r\none would think he\xe2\x80\x99d make such a beautiful corpse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt.\r\n\r\nShe sipped a little more from her glass and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to\r\nknow that you did all you could for him. You were both very kind to\r\nhim, I must say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEliza smoothed her dress over her knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor James!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cGod knows we done all we could, as poor as\r\nwe are\xe2\x80\x94we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see him want anything while he was in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNannie had leaned her head against the sofa-pillow and seemed about to\r\nfall asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s poor Nannie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, looking at her, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s wore out. All\r\nthe work we had, she and me, getting in the woman to wash him and then\r\nlaying him out and then the coffin and then arranging about the Mass in\r\nthe chapel. Only for Father O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what we\xe2\x80\x99d have done\r\nat all. It was him brought us all them flowers and them two\r\ncandlesticks out of the chapel and wrote out the notice for the\r\n_Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s General_ and took charge of all the papers for the cemetery\r\nand poor James\xe2\x80\x99s insurance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t that good of him?\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt.\r\n\r\nEliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s no friends like the old friends,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen all is\r\nsaid and done, no friends that a body can trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, that\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m sure now that he\xe2\x80\x99s gone\r\nto his eternal reward he won\xe2\x80\x99t forget you and all your kindness to\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor James!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was no great trouble to us. You\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear him in the house any more than now. Still, I know he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone and all to that....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s when it\xe2\x80\x99s all over that you\xe2\x80\x99ll miss him,\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be bringing him in his cup of\r\nbeef-tea any more, nor you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, sending him his snuff. Ah, poor\r\nJames!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped, as if she were communing with the past and then said\r\nshrewdly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over him\r\nlatterly. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99d bring in his soup to him there I\xe2\x80\x99d find him with\r\nhis breviary fallen to the floor, lying back in the chair and his mouth\r\nopen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laid a finger against her nose and frowned: then she continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut still and all he kept on saying that before the summer was over\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house again\r\nwhere we were all born down in Irishtown and take me and Nannie with\r\nhim. If we could only get one of them new-fangled carriages that makes\r\nno noise that Father O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke told him about, them with the rheumatic\r\nwheels, for the day cheap\xe2\x80\x94he said, at Johnny Rush\xe2\x80\x99s over the way there\r\nand drive out the three of us together of a Sunday evening. He had his\r\nmind set on that.... Poor James!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord have mercy on his soul!\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt.\r\n\r\nEliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it. Then she\r\nput it back again in her pocket and gazed into the empty grate for some\r\ntime without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was too scrupulous always,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe duties of the priesthood\r\nwas too much for him. And then his life was, you might say, crossed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a disappointed man. You could see that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA silence took possession of the little room and, under cover of it, I\r\napproached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned quietly to\r\nmy chair in the corner. Eliza seemed to have fallen into a deep revery.\r\nWe waited respectfully for her to break the silence: and after a long\r\npause she said slowly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was that chalice he broke.... That was the beginning of it. Of\r\ncourse, they say it was all right, that it contained nothing, I mean.\r\nBut still.... They say it was the boy\xe2\x80\x99s fault. But poor James was so\r\nnervous, God be merciful to him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was that it?\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard something....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEliza nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat affected his mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter that he began to mope by\r\nhimself, talking to no one and wandering about by himself. So one night\r\nhe was wanted for to go on a call and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find him anywhere.\r\nThey looked high up and low down; and still they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see a sight\r\nof him anywhere. So then the clerk suggested to try the chapel. So then\r\nthey got the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and Father\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Rourke and another priest that was there brought in a light for to\r\nlook for him.... And what do you think but there he was, sitting up by\r\nhimself in the dark in his confession-box, wide-awake and laughing-like\r\nsoftly to himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped suddenly as if to listen. I too listened; but there was no\r\nsound in the house: and I knew that the old priest was lying still in\r\nhis coffin as we had seen him, solemn and truculent in death, an idle\r\nchalice on his breast.\r\n\r\nEliza resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWide-awake and laughing-like to himself.... So then, of course, when\r\nthey saw that, that made them think that there was something gone wrong\r\nwith him....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ENCOUNTER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Joe Dillon who introduced the Wild West to us. He had a little\r\nlibrary made up of old numbers of _The Union Jack_, _Pluck_ and _The\r\nHalfpenny Marvel_. Every evening after school we met in his back garden\r\nand arranged Indian battles. He and his fat young brother Leo, the\r\nidler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm;\r\nor we fought a pitched battle on the grass. But, however well we\r\nfought, we never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with Joe\r\nDillon\xe2\x80\x99s war dance of victory. His parents went to eight-o\xe2\x80\x99clock mass\r\nevery morning in Gardiner Street and the peaceful odour of Mrs Dillon\r\nwas prevalent in the hall of the house. But he played too fiercely for\r\nus who were younger and more timid. He looked like some kind of an\r\nIndian when he capered round the garden, an old tea-cosy on his head,\r\nbeating a tin with his fist and yelling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYa! yaka, yaka, yaka!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone was incredulous when it was reported that he had a vocation\r\nfor the priesthood. Nevertheless it was true.\r\n\r\nA spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and, under its\r\ninfluence, differences of culture and constitution were waived. We\r\nbanded ourselves together, some boldly, some in jest and some almost in\r\nfear: and of the number of these latter, the reluctant Indians who were\r\nafraid to seem studious or lacking in robustness, I was one. The\r\nadventures related in the literature of the Wild West were remote from\r\nmy nature but, at least, they opened doors of escape. I liked better\r\nsome American detective stories which were traversed from time to time\r\nby unkempt fierce and beautiful girls. Though there was nothing wrong\r\nin these stories and though their intention was sometimes literary they\r\nwere circulated secretly at school. One day when Father Butler was\r\nhearing the four pages of Roman History clumsy Leo Dillon was\r\ndiscovered with a copy of _The Halfpenny Marvel_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis page or this page? This page? Now, Dillon, up! _\xe2\x80\x98Hardly had the\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99...._ Go on! What day? _\xe2\x80\x98Hardly had the day dawned\xe2\x80\x99...._ Have you\r\nstudied it? What have you there in your pocket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone\xe2\x80\x99s heart palpitated as Leo Dillon handed up the paper and\r\neveryone assumed an innocent face. Father Butler turned over the pages,\r\nfrowning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this rubbish?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c_The Apache Chief!_ Is this what you\r\nread instead of studying your Roman History? Let me not find any more\r\nof this wretched stuff in this college. The man who wrote it, I\r\nsuppose, was some wretched fellow who writes these things for a drink.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m surprised at boys like you, educated, reading such stuff. I could\r\nunderstand it if you were ... National School boys. Now, Dillon, I\r\nadvise you strongly, get at your work or....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis rebuke during the sober hours of school paled much of the glory of\r\nthe Wild West for me and the confused puffy face of Leo Dillon awakened\r\none of my consciences. But when the restraining influence of the school\r\nwas at a distance I began to hunger again for wild sensations, for the\r\nescape which those chronicles of disorder alone seemed to offer me. The\r\nmimic warfare of the evening became at last as wearisome to me as the\r\nroutine of school in the morning because I wanted real adventures to\r\nhappen to myself. But real adventures, I reflected, do not happen to\r\npeople who remain at home: they must be sought abroad.\r\n\r\nThe summer holidays were near at hand when I made up my mind to break\r\nout of the weariness of school-life for one day at least. With Leo\r\nDillon and a boy named Mahony I planned a day\xe2\x80\x99s miching. Each of us\r\nsaved up sixpence. We were to meet at ten in the morning on the Canal\r\nBridge. Mahony\xe2\x80\x99s big sister was to write an excuse for him and Leo\r\nDillon was to tell his brother to say he was sick. We arranged to go\r\nalong the Wharf Road until we came to the ships, then to cross in the\r\nferryboat and walk out to see the Pigeon House. Leo Dillon was afraid\r\nwe might meet Father Butler or someone out of the college; but Mahony\r\nasked, very sensibly, what would Father Butler be doing out at the\r\nPigeon House. We were reassured: and I brought the first stage of the\r\nplot to an end by collecting sixpence from the other two, at the same\r\ntime showing them my own sixpence. When we were making the last\r\narrangements on the eve we were all vaguely excited. We shook hands,\r\nlaughing, and Mahony said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill tomorrow, mates!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night I slept badly. In the morning I was first-comer to the\r\nbridge as I lived nearest. I hid my books in the long grass near the\r\nashpit at the end of the garden where nobody ever came and hurried\r\nalong the canal bank. It was a mild sunny morning in the first week of\r\nJune. I sat up on the coping of the bridge admiring my frail canvas\r\nshoes which I had diligently pipeclayed overnight and watching the\r\ndocile horses pulling a tramload of business people up the hill. All\r\nthe branches of the tall trees which lined the mall were gay with\r\nlittle light green leaves and the sunlight slanted through them on to\r\nthe water. The granite stone of the bridge was beginning to be warm and\r\nI began to pat it with my hands in time to an air in my head. I was\r\nvery happy.\r\n\r\nWhen I had been sitting there for five or ten minutes I saw Mahony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrey suit approaching. He came up the hill, smiling, and clambered up\r\nbeside me on the bridge. While we were waiting he brought out the\r\ncatapult which bulged from his inner pocket and explained some\r\nimprovements which he had made in it. I asked him why he had brought it\r\nand he told me he had brought it to have some gas with the birds.\r\nMahony used slang freely, and spoke of Father Butler as Old Bunser. We\r\nwaited on for a quarter of an hour more but still there was no sign of\r\nLeo Dillon. Mahony, at last, jumped down and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along. I knew Fatty\xe2\x80\x99d funk it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd his sixpence...?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s forfeit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahony. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so much the better for us\xe2\x80\x94a bob and\r\na tanner instead of a bob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe walked along the North Strand Road till we came to the Vitriol Works\r\nand then turned to the right along the Wharf Road. Mahony began to play\r\nthe Indian as soon as we were out of public sight. He chased a crowd of\r\nragged girls, brandishing his unloaded catapult and, when two ragged\r\nboys began, out of chivalry, to fling stones at us, he proposed that we\r\nshould charge them. I objected that the boys were too small and so we\r\nwalked on, the ragged troop screaming after us: _\xe2\x80\x9cSwaddlers!\r\nSwaddlers!\xe2\x80\x9d_ thinking that we were Protestants because Mahony, who was\r\ndark-complexioned, wore the silver badge of a cricket club in his cap.\r\nWhen we came to the Smoothing Iron we arranged a siege; but it was a\r\nfailure because you must have at least three. We revenged ourselves on\r\nLeo Dillon by saying what a funk he was and guessing how many he would\r\nget at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock from Mr Ryan.\r\n\r\nWe came then near the river. We spent a long time walking about the\r\nnoisy streets flanked by high stone walls, watching the working of\r\ncranes and engines and often being shouted at for our immobility by the\r\ndrivers of groaning carts. It was noon when we reached the quays and,\r\nas all the labourers seemed to be eating their lunches, we bought two\r\nbig currant buns and sat down to eat them on some metal piping beside\r\nthe river. We pleased ourselves with the spectacle of Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommerce\xe2\x80\x94the barges signalled from far away by their curls of woolly\r\nsmoke, the brown fishing fleet beyond Ringsend, the big white\r\nsailing-vessel which was being discharged on the opposite quay. Mahony\r\nsaid it would be right skit to run away to sea on one of those big\r\nships and even I, looking at the high masts, saw, or imagined, the\r\ngeography which had been scantily dosed to me at school gradually\r\ntaking substance under my eyes. School and home seemed to recede from\r\nus and their influences upon us seemed to wane.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the Liffey in the ferryboat, paying our toll to be\r\ntransported in the company of two labourers and a little Jew with a\r\nbag. We were serious to the point of solemnity, but once during the\r\nshort voyage our eyes met and we laughed. When we landed we watched the\r\ndischarging of the graceful threemaster which we had observed from the\r\nother quay. Some bystander said that she was a Norwegian vessel. I went\r\nto the stern and tried to decipher the legend upon it but, failing to\r\ndo so, I came back and examined the foreign sailors to see had any of\r\nthem green eyes for I had some confused notion.... The sailors\xe2\x80\x99 eyes\r\nwere blue and grey and even black. The only sailor whose eyes could\r\nhave been called green was a tall man who amused the crowd on the quay\r\nby calling out cheerfully every time the planks fell:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right! All right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen we were tired of this sight we wandered slowly into Ringsend. The\r\nday had grown sultry, and in the windows of the grocers\xe2\x80\x99 shops musty\r\nbiscuits lay bleaching. We bought some biscuits and chocolate which we\r\nate sedulously as we wandered through the squalid streets where the\r\nfamilies of the fishermen live. We could find no dairy and so we went\r\ninto a huckster\xe2\x80\x99s shop and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each.\r\nRefreshed by this, Mahony chased a cat down a lane, but the cat escaped\r\ninto a wide field. We both felt rather tired and when we reached the\r\nfield we made at once for a sloping bank over the ridge of which we\r\ncould see the Dodder.\r\n\r\nIt was too late and we were too tired to carry out our project of\r\nvisiting the Pigeon House. We had to be home before four o\xe2\x80\x99clock lest\r\nour adventure should be discovered. Mahony looked regretfully at his\r\ncatapult and I had to suggest going home by train before he regained\r\nany cheerfulness. The sun went in behind some clouds and left us to our\r\njaded thoughts and the crumbs of our provisions.\r\n\r\nThere was nobody but ourselves in the field. When we had lain on the\r\nbank for some time without speaking I saw a man approaching from the\r\nfar end of the field. I watched him lazily as I chewed one of those\r\ngreen stems on which girls tell fortunes. He came along by the bank\r\nslowly. He walked with one hand upon his hip and in the other hand he\r\nheld a stick with which he tapped the turf lightly. He was shabbily\r\ndressed in a suit of greenish-black and wore what we used to call a\r\njerry hat with a high crown. He seemed to be fairly old for his\r\nmoustache was ashen-grey. When he passed at our feet he glanced up at\r\nus quickly and then continued his way. We followed him with our eyes\r\nand saw that when he had gone on for perhaps fifty paces he turned\r\nabout and began to retrace his steps. He walked towards us very slowly,\r\nalways tapping the ground with his stick, so slowly that I thought he\r\nwas looking for something in the grass.\r\n\r\nHe stopped when he came level with us and bade us good-day. We answered\r\nhim and he sat down beside us on the slope slowly and with great care.\r\nHe began to talk of the weather, saying that it would be a very hot\r\nsummer and adding that the seasons had changed greatly since he was a\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x94a long time ago. He said that the happiest time of one\xe2\x80\x99s life was\r\nundoubtedly one\xe2\x80\x99s schoolboy days and that he would give anything to be\r\nyoung again. While he expressed these sentiments which bored us a\r\nlittle we kept silent. Then he began to talk of school and of books. He\r\nasked us whether we had read the poetry of Thomas Moore or the works of\r\nSir Walter Scott and Lord Lytton. I pretended that I had read every\r\nbook he mentioned so that in the end he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I can see you are a bookworm like myself. Now,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing\r\nto Mahony who was regarding us with open eyes, \xe2\x80\x9che is different; he\r\ngoes in for games.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said he had all Sir Walter Scott\xe2\x80\x99s works and all Lord Lytton\xe2\x80\x99s works\r\nat home and never tired of reading them. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\r\nwere some of Lord Lytton\xe2\x80\x99s works which boys couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read.\xe2\x80\x9d Mahony\r\nasked why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t boys read them\xe2\x80\x94a question which agitated and pained\r\nme because I was afraid the man would think I was as stupid as Mahony.\r\nThe man, however, only smiled. I saw that he had great gaps in his\r\nmouth between his yellow teeth. Then he asked us which of us had the\r\nmost sweethearts. Mahony mentioned lightly that he had three totties.\r\nThe man asked me how many had I. I answered that I had none. He did not\r\nbelieve me and said he was sure I must have one. I was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahony pertly to the man, \xe2\x80\x9chow many have you yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man smiled as before and said that when he was our age he had lots\r\nof sweethearts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chas a little sweetheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis attitude on this point struck me as strangely liberal in a man of\r\nhis age. In my heart I thought that what he said about boys and\r\nsweethearts was reasonable. But I disliked the words in his mouth and I\r\nwondered why he shivered once or twice as if he feared something or\r\nfelt a sudden chill. As he proceeded I noticed that his accent was\r\ngood. He began to speak to us about girls, saying what nice soft hair\r\nthey had and how soft their hands were and how all girls were not so\r\ngood as they seemed to be if one only knew. There was nothing he liked,\r\nhe said, so much as looking at a nice young girl, at her nice white\r\nhands and her beautiful soft hair. He gave me the impression that he\r\nwas repeating something which he had learned by heart or that,\r\nmagnetised by some words of his own speech, his mind was slowly\r\ncircling round and round in the same orbit. At times he spoke as if he\r\nwere simply alluding to some fact that everybody knew, and at times he\r\nlowered his voice and spoke mysteriously as if he were telling us\r\nsomething secret which he did not wish others to overhear. He repeated\r\nhis phrases over and over again, varying them and surrounding them with\r\nhis monotonous voice. I continued to gaze towards the foot of the\r\nslope, listening to him.\r\n\r\nAfter a long while his monologue paused. He stood up slowly, saying\r\nthat he had to leave us for a minute or so, a few minutes, and, without\r\nchanging the direction of my gaze, I saw him walking slowly away from\r\nus towards the near end of the field. We remained silent when he had\r\ngone. After a silence of a few minutes I heard Mahony exclaim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say! Look what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I neither answered nor raised my eyes Mahony exclaimed again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say.... He\xe2\x80\x99s a queer old josser!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn case he asks us for our names,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9clet you be Murphy and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe Smith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe said nothing further to each other. I was still considering whether\r\nI would go away or not when the man came back and sat down beside us\r\nagain. Hardly had he sat down when Mahony, catching sight of the cat\r\nwhich had escaped him, sprang up and pursued her across the field. The\r\nman and I watched the chase. The cat escaped once more and Mahony began\r\nto throw stones at the wall she had escaladed. Desisting from this, he\r\nbegan to wander about the far end of the field, aimlessly.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval the man spoke to me. He said that my friend was a\r\nvery rough boy and asked did he get whipped often at school. I was\r\ngoing to reply indignantly that we were not National School boys to be\r\nwhipped, as he called it; but I remained silent. He began to speak on\r\nthe subject of chastising boys. His mind, as if magnetised again by his\r\nspeech, seemed to circle slowly round and round its new centre. He said\r\nthat when boys were that kind they ought to be whipped and well\r\nwhipped. When a boy was rough and unruly there was nothing would do him\r\nany good but a good sound whipping. A slap on the hand or a box on the\r\near was no good: what he wanted was to get a nice warm whipping. I was\r\nsurprised at this sentiment and involuntarily glanced up at his face.\r\nAs I did so I met the gaze of a pair of bottle-green eyes peering at me\r\nfrom under a twitching forehead. I turned my eyes away again.\r\n\r\nThe man continued his monologue. He seemed to have forgotten his recent\r\nliberalism. He said that if ever he found a boy talking to girls or\r\nhaving a girl for a sweetheart he would whip him and whip him; and that\r\nwould teach him not to be talking to girls. And if a boy had a girl for\r\na sweetheart and told lies about it then he would give him such a\r\nwhipping as no boy ever got in this world. He said that there was\r\nnothing in this world he would like so well as that. He described to me\r\nhow he would whip such a boy as if he were unfolding some elaborate\r\nmystery. He would love that, he said, better than anything in this\r\nworld; and his voice, as he led me monotonously through the mystery,\r\ngrew almost affectionate and seemed to plead with me that I should\r\nunderstand him.\r\n\r\nI waited till his monologue paused again. Then I stood up abruptly.\r\nLest I should betray my agitation I delayed a few moments pretending to\r\nfix my shoe properly and then, saying that I was obliged to go, I bade\r\nhim good-day. I went up the slope calmly but my heart was beating\r\nquickly with fear that he would seize me by the ankles. When I reached\r\nthe top of the slope I turned round and, without looking at him, called\r\nloudly across the field:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMurphy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and I was ashamed of my\r\npaltry stratagem. I had to call the name again before Mahony saw me and\r\nhallooed in answer. How my heart beat as he came running across the\r\nfield to me! He ran as if to bring me aid. And I was penitent; for in\r\nmy heart I had always despised him a little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARABY\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth Richmond Street, being blind, was a quiet street except at the\r\nhour when the Christian Brothers\xe2\x80\x99 School set the boys free. An\r\nuninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from\r\nits neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street,\r\nconscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown\r\nimperturbable faces.\r\n\r\nThe former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back\r\ndrawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all\r\nthe rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old\r\nuseless papers. Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the\r\npages of which were curled and damp: _The Abbot_, by Walter Scott, _The\r\nDevout Communicant_ and _The Memoirs of Vidocq_. I liked the last best\r\nbecause its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house\r\ncontained a central apple-tree and a few straggling bushes under one of\r\nwhich I found the late tenant\xe2\x80\x99s rusty bicycle-pump. He had been a very\r\ncharitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to\r\ninstitutions and the furniture of his house to his sister.\r\n\r\nWhen the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten\r\nour dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The\r\nspace of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and\r\ntowards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The\r\ncold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts\r\nechoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through\r\nthe dark muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the\r\nrough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping\r\ngardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous\r\nstables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music\r\nfrom the buckled harness. When we returned to the street light from the\r\nkitchen windows had filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the\r\ncorner we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if\r\nMangan\xe2\x80\x99s sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his\r\ntea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We\r\nwaited to see whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained,\r\nwe left our shadow and walked up to Mangan\xe2\x80\x99s steps resignedly. She was\r\nwaiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened\r\ndoor. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the\r\nrailings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body and the\r\nsoft rope of her hair tossed from side to side.\r\n\r\nEvery morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her\r\ndoor. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I\r\ncould not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I\r\nran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown\r\nfigure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our\r\nways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened\r\nmorning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few\r\ncasual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nHer image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance. On\r\nSaturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to go to carry some\r\nof the parcels. We walked through the flaring streets, jostled by\r\ndrunken men and bargaining women, amid the curses of labourers, the\r\nshrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncheeks, the nasal chanting of street-singers, who sang a _come-all-you_\r\nabout O\xe2\x80\x99Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our native\r\nland. These noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I\r\nimagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes. Her\r\nname sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which\r\nI myself did not understand. My eyes were often full of tears (I could\r\nnot tell why) and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself\r\nout into my bosom. I thought little of the future. I did not know\r\nwhether I would ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke to her, how I\r\ncould tell her of my confused adoration. But my body was like a harp\r\nand her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the wires.\r\n\r\nOne evening I went into the back drawing-room in which the priest had\r\ndied. It was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound in the house.\r\nThrough one of the broken panes I heard the rain impinge upon the\r\nearth, the fine incessant needles of water playing in the sodden beds.\r\nSome distant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me. I was thankful\r\nthat I could see so little. All my senses seemed to desire to veil\r\nthemselves and, feeling that I was about to slip from them, I pressed\r\nthe palms of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: _\xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nlove! O love!\xe2\x80\x9d_ many times.\r\n\r\nAt last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was\r\nso confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I\r\ngoing to _Araby_. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a\r\nsplendid bazaar, she said; she would love to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nWhile she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist.\r\nShe could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week\r\nin her convent. Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their\r\ncaps and I was alone at the railings. She held one of the spikes,\r\nbowing her head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door\r\ncaught the white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there\r\nand, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one side\r\nof her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible\r\nas she stood at ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s well for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I go,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will bring you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts\r\nafter that evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening\r\ndays. I chafed against the work of school. At night in my bedroom and\r\nby day in the classroom her image came between me and the page I strove\r\nto read. The syllables of the word _Araby_ were called to me through\r\nthe silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment\r\nover me. I asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night. My\r\naunt was surprised and hoped it was not some Freemason affair. I\r\nanswered few questions in class. I watched my master\xe2\x80\x99s face pass from\r\namiability to sternness; he hoped I was not beginning to idle. I could\r\nnot call my wandering thoughts together. I had hardly any patience with\r\nthe serious work of life which, now that it stood between me and my\r\ndesire, seemed to me child\xe2\x80\x99s play, ugly monotonous child\xe2\x80\x99s play.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the\r\nbazaar in the evening. He was fussing at the hallstand, looking for the\r\nhat-brush, and answered me curtly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, boy, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour and lie at\r\nthe window. I left the house in bad humour and walked slowly towards\r\nthe school. The air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me.\r\n\r\nWhen I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home. Still it was\r\nearly. I sat staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking\r\nbegan to irritate me, I left the room. I mounted the staircase and\r\ngained the upper part of the house. The high cold empty gloomy rooms\r\nliberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front\r\nwindow I saw my companions playing below in the street. Their cries\r\nreached me weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the\r\ncool glass, I looked over at the dark house where she lived. I may have\r\nstood there for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast\r\nby my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved\r\nneck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress.\r\n\r\nWhen I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the fire.\r\nShe was an old garrulous woman, a pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s widow, who collected\r\nused stamps for some pious purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the\r\ntea-table. The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did\r\nnot come. Mrs Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait\r\nany longer, but it was after eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock and she did not like to be\r\nout late as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I began to\r\nwalk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock I heard my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s latchkey in the halldoor. I heard\r\nhim talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had\r\nreceived the weight of his overcoat. I could interpret these signs.\r\nWhen he was midway through his dinner I asked him to give me the money\r\nto go to the bazaar. He had forgotten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people are in bed and after their first sleep now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nI did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you give him the money and let him go? You\xe2\x80\x99ve kept him late\r\nenough as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed\r\nin the old saying: \xe2\x80\x9cAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nasked me where I was going and, when I had told him a second time he\r\nasked me did I know _The Arab\xe2\x80\x99s Farewell to his Steed_. When I left the\r\nkitchen he was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my\r\naunt.\r\n\r\nI held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street\r\ntowards the station. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and\r\nglaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my journey. I took my\r\nseat in a third-class carriage of a deserted train. After an\r\nintolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly. It crept\r\nonward among ruinous houses and over the twinkling river. At Westland\r\nRow Station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors; but the\r\nporters moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the\r\nbazaar. I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the\r\ntrain drew up beside an improvised wooden platform. I passed out on to\r\nthe road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes\r\nto ten. In front of me was a large building which displayed the magical\r\nname.\r\n\r\nI could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar\r\nwould be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a\r\nshilling to a weary-looking man. I found myself in a big hall girdled\r\nat half its height by a gallery. Nearly all the stalls were closed and\r\nthe greater part of the hall was in darkness. I recognised a silence\r\nlike that which pervades a church after a service. I walked into the\r\ncentre of the bazaar timidly. A few people were gathered about the\r\nstalls which were still open. Before a curtain, over which the words\r\n_Caf\xc3\xa9 Chantant_ were written in coloured lamps, two men were counting\r\nmoney on a salver. I listened to the fall of the coins.\r\n\r\nRemembering with difficulty why I had come I went over to one of the\r\nstalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered tea-sets. At the door\r\nof the stall a young lady was talking and laughing with two young\r\ngentlemen. I remarked their English accents and listened vaguely to\r\ntheir conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I never said such a thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, but you did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t she say that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I heard her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, there\xe2\x80\x99s a ... fib!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObserving me the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy\r\nanything. The tone of her voice was not encouraging; she seemed to have\r\nspoken to me out of a sense of duty. I looked humbly at the great jars\r\nthat stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to\r\nthe stall and murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back\r\nto the two young men. They began to talk of the same subject. Once or\r\ntwice the young lady glanced at me over her shoulder.\r\n\r\nI lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make\r\nmy interest in her wares seem the more real. Then I turned away slowly\r\nand walked down the middle of the bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to\r\nfall against the sixpence in my pocket. I heard a voice call from one\r\nend of the gallery that the light was out. The upper part of the hall\r\nwas now completely dark.\r\n\r\nGazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and\r\nderided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVELINE\r\n\r\n\r\nShe sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue. Her head\r\nwas leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the\r\nodour of dusty cretonne. She was tired.\r\n\r\nFew people passed. The man out of the last house passed on his way\r\nhome; she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and\r\nafterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One\r\ntime there used to be a field there in which they used to play every\r\nevening with other people\xe2\x80\x99s children. Then a man from Belfast bought\r\nthe field and built houses in it\xe2\x80\x94not like their little brown houses but\r\nbright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used\r\nto play together in that field\xe2\x80\x94the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns,\r\nlittle Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest,\r\nhowever, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to\r\nhunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually\r\nlittle Keogh used to keep _nix_ and call out when he saw her father\r\ncoming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father\r\nwas not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long\r\ntime ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her\r\nmother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone\r\nback to England. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like\r\nthe others, to leave her home.\r\n\r\nHome! She looked round the room, reviewing all its familiar objects\r\nwhich she had dusted once a week for so many years, wondering where on\r\nearth all the dust came from. Perhaps she would never see again those\r\nfamiliar objects from which she had never dreamed of being divided. And\r\nyet during all those years she had never found out the name of the\r\npriest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken\r\nharmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to Blessed\r\nMargaret Mary Alacoque. He had been a school friend of her father.\r\nWhenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used to pass\r\nit with a casual word:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is in Melbourne now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that wise? She\r\ntried to weigh each side of the question. In her home anyway she had\r\nshelter and food; she had those whom she had known all her life about\r\nher. Of course she had to work hard, both in the house and at business.\r\nWhat would they say of her in the Stores when they found out that she\r\nhad run away with a fellow? Say she was a fool, perhaps; and her place\r\nwould be filled up by advertisement. Miss Gavan would be glad. She had\r\nalways had an edge on her, especially whenever there were people\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Hill, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see these ladies are waiting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook lively, Miss Hill, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would not cry many tears at leaving the Stores.\r\n\r\nBut in her new home, in a distant unknown country, it would not be like\r\nthat. Then she would be married\xe2\x80\x94she, Eveline. People would treat her\r\nwith respect then. She would not be treated as her mother had been.\r\nEven now, though she was over nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in\r\ndanger of her father\xe2\x80\x99s violence. She knew it was that that had given\r\nher the palpitations. When they were growing up he had never gone for\r\nher like he used to go for Harry and Ernest, because she was a girl;\r\nbut latterly he had begun to threaten her and say what he would do to\r\nher only for her dead mother\xe2\x80\x99s sake. And now she had nobody to protect\r\nher. Ernest was dead and Harry, who was in the church decorating\r\nbusiness, was nearly always down somewhere in the country. Besides, the\r\ninvariable squabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her\r\nunspeakably. She always gave her entire wages\xe2\x80\x94seven shillings\xe2\x80\x94and Harry\r\nalways sent up what he could but the trouble was to get any money from\r\nher father. He said she used to squander the money, that she had no\r\nhead, that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to give her his hard-earned money to throw\r\nabout the streets, and much more, for he was usually fairly bad of a\r\nSaturday night. In the end he would give her the money and ask her had\r\nshe any intention of buying Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s dinner. Then she had to rush out\r\nas quickly as she could and do her marketing, holding her black leather\r\npurse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way through the crowds and\r\nreturning home late under her load of provisions. She had hard work to\r\nkeep the house together and to see that the two young children who had\r\nbeen left to her charge went to school regularly and got their meals\r\nregularly. It was hard work\xe2\x80\x94a hard life\xe2\x80\x94but now that she was about to\r\nleave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life.\r\n\r\nShe was about to explore another life with Frank. Frank was very kind,\r\nmanly, open-hearted. She was to go away with him by the night-boat to\r\nbe his wife and to live with him in Buenos Ayres where he had a home\r\nwaiting for her. How well she remembered the first time she had seen\r\nhim; he was lodging in a house on the main road where she used to\r\nvisit. It seemed a few weeks ago. He was standing at the gate, his\r\npeaked cap pushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a\r\nface of bronze. Then they had come to know each other. He used to meet\r\nher outside the Stores every evening and see her home. He took her to\r\nsee _The Bohemian Girl_ and she felt elated as she sat in an\r\nunaccustomed part of the theatre with him. He was awfully fond of music\r\nand sang a little. People knew that they were courting and, when he\r\nsang about the lass that loves a sailor, she always felt pleasantly\r\nconfused. He used to call her Poppens out of fun. First of all it had\r\nbeen an excitement for her to have a fellow and then she had begun to\r\nlike him. He had tales of distant countries. He had started as a deck\r\nboy at a pound a month on a ship of the Allan Line going out to Canada.\r\nHe told her the names of the ships he had been on and the names of the\r\ndifferent services. He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and\r\nhe told her stories of the terrible Patagonians. He had fallen on his\r\nfeet in Buenos Ayres, he said, and had come over to the old country\r\njust for a holiday. Of course, her father had found out the affair and\r\nhad forbidden her to have anything to say to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know these sailor chaps,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nOne day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her\r\nlover secretly.\r\n\r\nThe evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap\r\ngrew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was to her father. Ernest\r\nhad been her favourite but she liked Harry too. Her father was becoming\r\nold lately, she noticed; he would miss her. Sometimes he could be very\r\nnice. Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read\r\nher out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day,\r\nwhen their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill\r\nof Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet to\r\nmake the children laugh.\r\n\r\nHer time was running out but she continued to sit by the window,\r\nleaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of\r\ndusty cretonne. Down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ\r\nplaying. She knew the air. Strange that it should come that very night\r\nto remind her of the promise to her mother, her promise to keep the\r\nhome together as long as she could. She remembered the last night of\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s illness; she was again in the close dark room at the other\r\nside of the hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy. The\r\norgan-player had been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She\r\nremembered her father strutting back into the sickroom saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamned Italians! coming over here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she mused the pitiful vision of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s life laid its spell on\r\nthe very quick of her being\xe2\x80\x94that life of commonplace sacrifices closing\r\nin final craziness. She trembled as she heard again her mother\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nsaying constantly with foolish insistence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDerevaun Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must escape!\r\nFrank would save her. He would give her life, perhaps love, too. But\r\nshe wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She had a right to\r\nhappiness. Frank would take her in his arms, fold her in his arms. He\r\nwould save her.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the North Wall. He\r\nheld her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her, saying\r\nsomething about the passage over and over again. The station was full\r\nof soldiers with brown baggages. Through the wide doors of the sheds\r\nshe caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying in beside the\r\nquay wall, with illumined portholes. She answered nothing. She felt her\r\ncheek pale and cold and, out of a maze of distress, she prayed to God\r\nto direct her, to show her what was her duty. The boat blew a long\r\nmournful whistle into the mist. If she went, tomorrow she would be on\r\nthe sea with Frank, steaming towards Buenos Ayres. Their passage had\r\nbeen booked. Could she still draw back after all he had done for her?\r\nHer distress awoke a nausea in her body and she kept moving her lips in\r\nsilent fervent prayer.\r\n\r\nA bell clanged upon her heart. She felt him seize her hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her\r\ninto them: he would drown her. She gripped with both hands at the iron\r\nrailing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy.\r\nAmid the seas she sent a cry of anguish!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveline! Evvy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow. He was\r\nshouted at to go on but he still called to her. She set her white face\r\nto him, passive, like a helpless animal. Her eyes gave him no sign of\r\nlove or farewell or recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THE RACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cars came scudding in towards Dublin, running evenly like pellets\r\nin the groove of the Naas Road. At the crest of the hill at Inchicore\r\nsightseers had gathered in clumps to watch the cars careering homeward\r\nand through this channel of poverty and inaction the Continent sped its\r\nwealth and industry. Now and again the clumps of people raised the\r\ncheer of the gratefully oppressed. Their sympathy, however, was for the\r\nblue cars\xe2\x80\x94the cars of their friends, the French.\r\n\r\nThe French, moreover, were virtual victors. Their team had finished\r\nsolidly; they had been placed second and third and the driver of the\r\nwinning German car was reported a Belgian. Each blue car, therefore,\r\nreceived a double measure of welcome as it topped the crest of the hill\r\nand each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by\r\nthose in the car. In one of these trimly built cars was a party of four\r\nyoung men whose spirits seemed to be at present well above the level of\r\nsuccessful Gallicism: in fact, these four young men were almost\r\nhilarious. They were Charles S\xc3\xa9gouin, the owner of the car; Andr\xc3\xa9\r\nRivi\xc3\xa8re, a young electrician of Canadian birth; a huge Hungarian named\r\nVillona and a neatly groomed young man named Doyle. S\xc3\xa9gouin was in good\r\nhumour because he had unexpectedly received some orders in advance (he\r\nwas about to start a motor establishment in Paris) and Rivi\xc3\xa8re was in\r\ngood humour because he was to be appointed manager of the\r\nestablishment; these two young men (who were cousins) were also in good\r\nhumour because of the success of the French cars. Villona was in good\r\nhumour because he had had a very satisfactory luncheon; and besides he\r\nwas an optimist by nature. The fourth member of the party, however, was\r\ntoo excited to be genuinely happy.\r\n\r\nHe was about twenty-six years of age, with a soft, light brown\r\nmoustache and rather innocent-looking grey eyes. His father, who had\r\nbegun life as an advanced Nationalist, had modified his views early. He\r\nhad made his money as a butcher in Kingstown and by opening shops in\r\nDublin and in the suburbs he had made his money many times over. He had\r\nalso been fortunate enough to secure some of the police contracts and\r\nin the end he had become rich enough to be alluded to in the Dublin\r\nnewspapers as a merchant prince. He had sent his son to England to be\r\neducated in a big Catholic college and had afterwards sent him to\r\nDublin University to study law. Jimmy did not study very earnestly and\r\ntook to bad courses for a while. He had money and he was popular; and\r\nhe divided his time curiously between musical and motoring circles.\r\nThen he had been sent for a term to Cambridge to see a little life. His\r\nfather, remonstrative, but covertly proud of the excess, had paid his\r\nbills and brought him home. It was at Cambridge that he had met\r\nS\xc3\xa9gouin. They were not much more than acquaintances as yet but Jimmy\r\nfound great pleasure in the society of one who had seen so much of the\r\nworld and was reputed to own some of the biggest hotels in France. Such\r\na person (as his father agreed) was well worth knowing, even if he had\r\nnot been the charming companion he was. Villona was entertaining also\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nbrilliant pianist\xe2\x80\x94but, unfortunately, very poor.\r\n\r\nThe car ran on merrily with its cargo of hilarious youth. The two\r\ncousins sat on the front seat; Jimmy and his Hungarian friend sat\r\nbehind. Decidedly Villona was in excellent spirits; he kept up a deep\r\nbass hum of melody for miles of the road. The Frenchmen flung their\r\nlaughter and light words over their shoulders and often Jimmy had to\r\nstrain forward to catch the quick phrase. This was not altogether\r\npleasant for him, as he had nearly always to make a deft guess at the\r\nmeaning and shout back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind.\r\nBesides Villona\xe2\x80\x99s humming would confuse anybody; the noise of the car,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nRapid motion through space elates one; so does notoriety; so does the\r\npossession of money. These were three good reasons for Jimmy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexcitement. He had been seen by many of his friends that day in the\r\ncompany of these Continentals. At the control S\xc3\xa9gouin had presented him\r\nto one of the French competitors and, in answer to his confused murmur\r\nof compliment, the swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of\r\nshining white teeth. It was pleasant after that honour to return to the\r\nprofane world of spectators amid nudges and significant looks. Then as\r\nto money\xe2\x80\x94he really had a great sum under his control. S\xc3\xa9gouin, perhaps,\r\nwould not think it a great sum but Jimmy who, in spite of temporary\r\nerrors, was at heart the inheritor of solid instincts knew well with\r\nwhat difficulty it had been got together. This knowledge had previously\r\nkept his bills within the limits of reasonable recklessness and, if he\r\nhad been so conscious of the labour latent in money when there had been\r\nquestion merely of some freak of the higher intelligence, how much more\r\nso now when he was about to stake the greater part of his substance! It\r\nwas a serious thing for him.\r\n\r\nOf course, the investment was a good one and S\xc3\xa9gouin had managed to\r\ngive the impression that it was by a favour of friendship the mite of\r\nIrish money was to be included in the capital of the concern. Jimmy had\r\na respect for his father\xe2\x80\x99s shrewdness in business matters and in this\r\ncase it had been his father who had first suggested the investment;\r\nmoney to be made in the motor business, pots of money. Moreover S\xc3\xa9gouin\r\nhad the unmistakable air of wealth. Jimmy set out to translate into\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 work that lordly car in which he sat. How smoothly it ran. In\r\nwhat style they had come careering along the country roads! The journey\r\nlaid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life and gallantly the\r\nmachinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses of the\r\nswift blue animal.\r\n\r\nThey drove down Dame Street. The street was busy with unusual traffic,\r\nloud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of impatient\r\ntram-drivers. Near the Bank S\xc3\xa9gouin drew up and Jimmy and his friend\r\nalighted. A little knot of people collected on the footpath to pay\r\nhomage to the snorting motor. The party was to dine together that\r\nevening in S\xc3\xa9gouin\xe2\x80\x99s hotel and, meanwhile, Jimmy and his friend, who\r\nwas staying with him, were to go home to dress. The car steered out\r\nslowly for Grafton Street while the two young men pushed their way\r\nthrough the knot of gazers. They walked northward with a curious\r\nfeeling of disappointment in the exercise, while the city hung its pale\r\nglobes of light above them in a haze of summer evening.\r\n\r\nIn Jimmy\xe2\x80\x99s house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion. A certain\r\npride mingled with his parents\xe2\x80\x99 trepidation, a certain eagerness, also,\r\nto play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at\r\nleast this virtue. Jimmy, too, looked very well when he was dressed\r\nand, as he stood in the hall giving a last equation to the bows of his\r\ndress tie, his father may have felt even commercially satisfied at\r\nhaving secured for his son qualities often unpurchaseable. His father,\r\ntherefore, was unusually friendly with Villona and his manner expressed\r\na real respect for foreign accomplishments; but this subtlety of his\r\nhost was probably lost upon the Hungarian, who was beginning to have a\r\nsharp desire for his dinner.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was excellent, exquisite. S\xc3\xa9gouin, Jimmy decided, had a very\r\nrefined taste. The party was increased by a young Englishman named\r\nRouth whom Jimmy had seen with S\xc3\xa9gouin at Cambridge. The young men\r\nsupped in a snug room lit by electric candle-lamps. They talked volubly\r\nand with little reserve. Jimmy, whose imagination was kindling,\r\nconceived the lively youth of the Frenchmen twined elegantly upon the\r\nfirm framework of the Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s manner. A graceful image of his, he\r\nthought, and a just one. He admired the dexterity with which their host\r\ndirected the conversation. The five young men had various tastes and\r\ntheir tongues had been loosened. Villona, with immense respect, began\r\nto discover to the mildly surprised Englishman the beauties of the\r\nEnglish madrigal, deploring the loss of old instruments. Rivi\xc3\xa8re, not\r\nwholly ingenuously, undertook to explain to Jimmy the triumph of the\r\nFrench mechanicians. The resonant voice of the Hungarian was about to\r\nprevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic painters when\r\nS\xc3\xa9gouin shepherded his party into politics. Here was congenial ground\r\nfor all. Jimmy, under generous influences, felt the buried zeal of his\r\nfather wake to life within him: he aroused the torpid Routh at last.\r\nThe room grew doubly hot and S\xc3\xa9gouin\xe2\x80\x99s task grew harder each moment:\r\nthere was even danger of personal spite. The alert host at an\r\nopportunity lifted his glass to Humanity and, when the toast had been\r\ndrunk, he threw open a window significantly.\r\n\r\nThat night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young men\r\nstrolled along Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s Green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke. They\r\ntalked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders.\r\nThe people made way for them. At the corner of Grafton Street a short\r\nfat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another\r\nfat man. The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndr\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Farley!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very\r\nwell what the talk was about. Villona and Rivi\xc3\xa8re were the noisiest,\r\nbut all the men were excited. They got up on a car, squeezing\r\nthemselves together amid much laughter. They drove by the crowd,\r\nblended now into soft colours, to a music of merry bells. They took the\r\ntrain at Westland Row and in a few seconds, as it seemed to Jimmy, they\r\nwere walking out of Kingstown Station. The ticket-collector saluted\r\nJimmy; he was an old man:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine night, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a serene summer night; the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at\r\ntheir feet. They proceeded towards it with linked arms, singing _Cadet\r\nRoussel_ in chorus, stamping their feet at every:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cHo! Ho! Hoh\xc3\xa9, vraiment!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nThey got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the American\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyacht. There was to be supper, music, cards. Villona said with\r\nconviction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is delightful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a yacht piano in the cabin. Villona played a waltz for Farley\r\nand Rivi\xc3\xa8re, Farley acting as cavalier and Rivi\xc3\xa8re as lady. Then an\r\nimpromptu square dance, the men devising original figures. What\r\nmerriment! Jimmy took his part with a will; this was seeing life, at\r\nleast. Then Farley got out of breath and cried _\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d_ A man brought\r\nin a light supper, and the young men sat down to it for form\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\nThey drank, however: it was Bohemian. They drank Ireland, England,\r\nFrance, Hungary, the United States of America. Jimmy made a speech, a\r\nlong speech, Villona saying: _\xe2\x80\x9cHear! hear!\xe2\x80\x9d_ whenever there was a\r\npause. There was a great clapping of hands when he sat down. It must\r\nhave been a good speech. Farley clapped him on the back and laughed\r\nloudly. What jovial fellows! What good company they were!\r\n\r\nCards! cards! The table was cleared. Villona returned quietly to his\r\npiano and played voluntaries for them. The other men played game after\r\ngame, flinging themselves boldly into the adventure. They drank the\r\nhealth of the Queen of Hearts and of the Queen of Diamonds. Jimmy felt\r\nobscurely the lack of an audience: the wit was flashing. Play ran very\r\nhigh and paper began to pass. Jimmy did not know exactly who was\r\nwinning but he knew that he was losing. But it was his own fault for he\r\nfrequently mistook his cards and the other men had to calculate his\r\nI.O.U.\xe2\x80\x98s for him. They were devils of fellows but he wished they would\r\nstop: it was getting late. Someone gave the toast of the yacht _The\r\nBelle of Newport_ and then someone proposed one great game for a\r\nfinish.\r\n\r\nThe piano had stopped; Villona must have gone up on deck. It was a\r\nterrible game. They stopped just before the end of it to drink for\r\nluck. Jimmy understood that the game lay between Routh and S\xc3\xa9gouin.\r\nWhat excitement! Jimmy was excited too; he would lose, of course. How\r\nmuch had he written away? The men rose to their feet to play the last\r\ntricks, talking and gesticulating. Routh won. The cabin shook with the\r\nyoung men\xe2\x80\x99s cheering and the cards were bundled together. They began\r\nthen to gather in what they had won. Farley and Jimmy were the heaviest\r\nlosers.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he would regret in the morning but at present he was glad\r\nof the rest, glad of the dark stupor that would cover up his folly. He\r\nleaned his elbows on the table and rested his head between his hands,\r\ncounting the beats of his temples. The cabin door opened and he saw the\r\nHungarian standing in a shaft of grey light:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaybreak, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO GALLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grey warm evening of August had descended upon the city and a mild\r\nwarm air, a memory of summer, circulated in the streets. The streets,\r\nshuttered for the repose of Sunday, swarmed with a gaily coloured\r\ncrowd. Like illumined pearls the lamps shone from the summits of their\r\ntall poles upon the living texture below which, changing shape and hue\r\nunceasingly, sent up into the warm grey evening air an unchanging\r\nunceasing murmur.\r\n\r\nTwo young men came down the hill of Rutland Square. One of them was\r\njust bringing a long monologue to a close. The other, who walked on the\r\nverge of the path and was at times obliged to step on to the road,\r\nowing to his companion\xe2\x80\x99s rudeness, wore an amused listening face. He\r\nwas squat and ruddy. A yachting cap was shoved far back from his\r\nforehead and the narrative to which he listened made constant waves of\r\nexpression break forth over his face from the corners of his nose and\r\neyes and mouth. Little jets of wheezing laughter followed one another\r\nout of his convulsed body. His eyes, twinkling with cunning enjoyment,\r\nglanced at every moment towards his companion\xe2\x80\x99s face. Once or twice he\r\nrearranged the light waterproof which he had slung over one shoulder in\r\ntoreador fashion. His breeches, his white rubber shoes and his jauntily\r\nslung waterproof expressed youth. But his figure fell into rotundity at\r\nthe waist, his hair was scant and grey and his face, when the waves of\r\nexpression had passed over it, had a ravaged look.\r\n\r\nWhen he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he laughed\r\nnoiselessly for fully half a minute. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!... That takes the biscuit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice seemed winnowed of vigour; and to enforce his words he added\r\nwith humour:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat takes the solitary, unique, and, if I may so call it, _recherch\xc3\xa9_\r\nbiscuit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe became serious and silent when he had said this. His tongue was\r\ntired for he had been talking all the afternoon in a public-house in\r\nDorset Street. Most people considered Lenehan a leech but, in spite of\r\nthis reputation, his adroitness and eloquence had always prevented his\r\nfriends from forming any general policy against him. He had a brave\r\nmanner of coming up to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself\r\nnimbly at the borders of the company until he was included in a round.\r\nHe was a sporting vagrant armed with a vast stock of stories, limericks\r\nand riddles. He was insensitive to all kinds of discourtesy. No one\r\nknew how he achieved the stern task of living, but his name was vaguely\r\nassociated with racing tissues.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where did you pick her up, Corley?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nCorley ran his tongue swiftly along his upper lip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne night, man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI was going along Dame Street and I spotted\r\na fine tart under Waterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s clock and said good-night, you know. So\r\nwe went for a walk round by the canal and she told me she was a slavey\r\nin a house in Baggot Street. I put my arm round her and squeezed her a\r\nbit that night. Then next Sunday, man, I met her by appointment. We\r\nwent out to Donnybrook and I brought her into a field there. She told\r\nme she used to go with a dairyman.... It was fine, man. Cigarettes\r\nevery night she\xe2\x80\x99d bring me and paying the tram out and back. And one\r\nnight she brought me two bloody fine cigars\xe2\x80\x94O, the real cheese, you\r\nknow, that the old fellow used to smoke.... I was afraid, man, she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nget in the family way. But she\xe2\x80\x99s up to the dodge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe she thinks you\xe2\x80\x99ll marry her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lenehan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told her I was out of a job,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corley. \xe2\x80\x9cI told her I was in\r\nPim\xe2\x80\x99s. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know my name. I was too hairy to tell her that. But\r\nshe thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit of class, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLenehan laughed again, noiselessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf all the good ones ever I heard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat emphatically takes\r\nthe biscuit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCorley\xe2\x80\x99s stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of his burly\r\nbody made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the\r\nroadway and back again. Corley was the son of an inspector of police\r\nand he had inherited his father\xe2\x80\x99s frame and gait. He walked with his\r\nhands by his sides, holding himself erect and swaying his head from\r\nside to side. His head was large, globular and oily; it sweated in all\r\nweathers; and his large round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a\r\nbulb which had grown out of another. He always stared straight before\r\nhim as if he were on parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone\r\nin the street, it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips.\r\nAt present he was about town. Whenever any job was vacant a friend was\r\nalways ready to give him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking\r\nwith policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner\r\nside of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He\r\nspoke without listening to the speech of his companions. His\r\nconversation was mainly about himself: what he had said to such a\r\nperson and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to\r\nsettle the matter. When he reported these dialogues he aspirated the\r\nfirst letter of his name after the manner of Florentines.\r\n\r\nLenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men walked on\r\nthrough the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the\r\npassing girls but Lenehan\xe2\x80\x99s gaze was fixed on the large faint moon\r\ncircled with a double halo. He watched earnestly the passing of the\r\ngrey web of twilight across its face. At length he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell ... tell me, Corley, I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to pull it off all\r\nright, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCorley closed one eye expressively as an answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she game for that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lenehan dubiously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can never know\r\nwomen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corley. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the way to get around her, man.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s a bit gone on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re what I call a gay Lothario,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lenehan. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the proper kind\r\nof a Lothario, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner. To save\r\nhimself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the\r\ninterpretation of raillery. But Corley had not a subtle mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to touch a good slavey,\xe2\x80\x9d he affirmed. \xe2\x80\x9cTake my tip for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy one who has tried them all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lenehan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst I used to go with girls, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corley, unbosoming;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgirls off the South Circular. I used to take them out, man, on the\r\ntram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to a band or a play at the\r\ntheatre or buy them chocolate and sweets or something that way. I used\r\nto spend money on them right enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a convincing tone,\r\nas if he was conscious of being disbelieved.\r\n\r\nBut Lenehan could well believe it; he nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that game,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s a mug\xe2\x80\x99s game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd damn the thing I ever got out of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDitto here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lenehan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly off of one of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corley.\r\n\r\nHe moistened his upper lip by running his tongue along it. The\r\nrecollection brightened his eyes. He too gazed at the pale disc of the\r\nmoon, now nearly veiled, and seemed to meditate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was ... a bit of all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said regretfully.\r\n\r\nHe was silent again. Then he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s on the turf now. I saw her driving down Earl Street one night\r\nwith two fellows with her on a car.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s your doing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lenehan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was others at her before me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corley philosophically.\r\n\r\nThis time Lenehan was inclined to disbelieve. He shook his head to and\r\nfro and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know you can\xe2\x80\x99t kid me, Corley,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonest to God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Corley. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t she tell me herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLenehan made a tragic gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBase betrayer!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nAs they passed along the railings of Trinity College, Lenehan skipped\r\nout into the road and peered up at the clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty after,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corley. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll be there all right. I always let\r\nher wait a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLenehan laughed quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEcod! Corley, you know how to take them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m up to all their little tricks,\xe2\x80\x9d Corley confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lenehan again, \xe2\x80\x9care you sure you can bring it off\r\nall right? You know it\xe2\x80\x99s a ticklish job. They\xe2\x80\x99re damn close on that\r\npoint. Eh?... What?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis bright, small eyes searched his companion\xe2\x80\x99s face for reassurance.\r\nCorley swung his head to and fro as if to toss aside an insistent\r\ninsect, and his brows gathered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pull it off,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave it to me, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLenehan said no more. He did not wish to ruffle his friend\xe2\x80\x99s temper, to\r\nbe sent to the devil and told that his advice was not wanted. A little\r\ntact was necessary. But Corley\xe2\x80\x99s brow was soon smooth again. His\r\nthoughts were running another way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a fine decent tart,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with appreciation; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nshe is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked along Nassau Street and then turned into Kildare Street.\r\nNot far from the porch of the club a harpist stood in the roadway,\r\nplaying to a little ring of listeners. He plucked at the wires\r\nheedlessly, glancing quickly from time to time at the face of each\r\nnew-comer and from time to time, wearily also, at the sky. His harp,\r\ntoo, heedless that her coverings had fallen about her knees, seemed\r\nweary alike of the eyes of strangers and of her master\xe2\x80\x99s hands. One\r\nhand played in the bass the melody of _Silent, O Moyle_, while the\r\nother hand careered in the treble after each group of notes. The notes\r\nof the air sounded deep and full.\r\n\r\nThe two young men walked up the street without speaking, the mournful\r\nmusic following them. When they reached Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s Green they crossed\r\nthe road. Here the noise of trams, the lights and the crowd released\r\nthem from their silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere she is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Corley.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Hume Street a young woman was standing. She wore a\r\nblue dress and a white sailor hat. She stood on the curbstone, swinging\r\na sunshade in one hand. Lenehan grew lively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at her, Corley,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nCorley glanced sideways at his friend and an unpleasant grin appeared\r\non his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you trying to get inside me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lenehan boldly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want an introduction. All I\r\nwant is to have a look at her. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to eat her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO.... A look at her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Corley, more amiably. \xe2\x80\x9cWell ... I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou what. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go over and talk to her and you can pass by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lenehan.\r\n\r\nCorley had already thrown one leg over the chains when Lenehan called\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after? Where will we meet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf ten,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Corley, bringing over his other leg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorner of Merrion Street. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be coming back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWork it all right now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lenehan in farewell.\r\n\r\nCorley did not answer. He sauntered across the road swaying his head\r\nfrom side to side. His bulk, his easy pace, and the solid sound of his\r\nboots had something of the conqueror in them. He approached the young\r\nwoman and, without saluting, began at once to converse with her. She\r\nswung her umbrella more quickly and executed half turns on her heels.\r\nOnce or twice when he spoke to her at close quarters she laughed and\r\nbent her head.\r\n\r\nLenehan observed them for a few minutes. Then he walked rapidly along\r\nbeside the chains at some distance and crossed the road obliquely. As\r\nhe approached Hume Street corner he found the air heavily scented and\r\nhis eyes made a swift anxious scrutiny of the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.\r\nShe had her Sunday finery on. Her blue serge skirt was held at the\r\nwaist by a belt of black leather. The great silver buckle of her belt\r\nseemed to depress the centre of her body, catching the light stuff of\r\nher white blouse like a clip. She wore a short black jacket with\r\nmother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa. The ends of her tulle\r\ncollarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers\r\nwas pinned in her bosom, stems upwards. Lenehan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes noted\r\napprovingly her stout short muscular body. Frank rude health glowed in\r\nher face, on her fat red cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes. Her\r\nfeatures were blunt. She had broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which\r\nlay open in a contented leer, and two projecting front teeth. As he\r\npassed Lenehan took off his cap and, after about ten seconds, Corley\r\nreturned a salute to the air. This he did by raising his hand vaguely\r\nand pensively changing the angle of position of his hat.\r\n\r\nLenehan walked as far as the Shelbourne Hotel where he halted and\r\nwaited. After waiting for a little time he saw them coming towards him\r\nand, when they turned to the right, he followed them, stepping lightly\r\nin his white shoes, down one side of Merrion Square. As he walked on\r\nslowly, timing his pace to theirs, he watched Corley\xe2\x80\x99s head which\r\nturned at every moment towards the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s face like a big ball\r\nrevolving on a pivot. He kept the pair in view until he had seen them\r\nclimbing the stairs of the Donnybrook tram; then he turned about and\r\nwent back the way he had come.\r\n\r\nNow that he was alone his face looked older. His gaiety seemed to\r\nforsake him and, as he came by the railings of the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s Lawn, he\r\nallowed his hand to run along them. The air which the harpist had\r\nplayed began to control his movements. His softly padded feet played\r\nthe melody while his fingers swept a scale of variations idly along the\r\nrailings after each group of notes.\r\n\r\nHe walked listlessly round Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s Green and then down Grafton\r\nStreet. Though his eyes took note of many elements of the crowd through\r\nwhich he passed they did so morosely. He found trivial all that was\r\nmeant to charm him and did not answer the glances which invited him to\r\nbe bold. He knew that he would have to speak a great deal, to invent\r\nand to amuse, and his brain and throat were too dry for such a task.\r\nThe problem of how he could pass the hours till he met Corley again\r\ntroubled him a little. He could think of no way of passing them but to\r\nkeep on walking. He turned to the left when he came to the corner of\r\nRutland Square and felt more at ease in the dark quiet street, the\r\nsombre look of which suited his mood. He paused at last before the\r\nwindow of a poor-looking shop over which the words _Refreshment Bar_\r\nwere printed in white letters. On the glass of the window were two\r\nflying inscriptions: _Ginger Beer_ and _Ginger Ale_. A cut ham was\r\nexposed on a great blue dish while near it on a plate lay a segment of\r\nvery light plum-pudding. He eyed this food earnestly for some time and\r\nthen, after glancing warily up and down the street, went into the shop\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nHe was hungry for, except some biscuits which he had asked two grudging\r\ncurates to bring him, he had eaten nothing since breakfast-time. He sat\r\ndown at an uncovered wooden table opposite two work-girls and a\r\nmechanic. A slatternly girl waited on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much is a plate of peas?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree halfpence, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me a plate of peas,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand a bottle of ginger beer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke roughly in order to belie his air of gentility for his entry\r\nhad been followed by a pause of talk. His face was heated. To appear\r\nnatural he pushed his cap back on his head and planted his elbows on\r\nthe table. The mechanic and the two work-girls examined him point by\r\npoint before resuming their conversation in a subdued voice. The girl\r\nbrought him a plate of grocer\xe2\x80\x99s hot peas, seasoned with pepper and\r\nvinegar, a fork and his ginger beer. He ate his food greedily and found\r\nit so good that he made a note of the shop mentally. When he had eaten\r\nall the peas he sipped his ginger beer and sat for some time thinking\r\nof Corley\xe2\x80\x99s adventure. In his imagination he beheld the pair of lovers\r\nwalking along some dark road; he heard Corley\xe2\x80\x99s voice in deep energetic\r\ngallantries and saw again the leer of the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. This\r\nvision made him feel keenly his own poverty of purse and spirit. He was\r\ntired of knocking about, of pulling the devil by the tail, of shifts\r\nand intrigues. He would be thirty-one in November. Would he never get a\r\ngood job? Would he never have a home of his own? He thought how\r\npleasant it would be to have a warm fire to sit by and a good dinner to\r\nsit down to. He had walked the streets long enough with friends and\r\nwith girls. He knew what those friends were worth: he knew the girls\r\ntoo. Experience had embittered his heart against the world. But all\r\nhope had not left him. He felt better after having eaten than he had\r\nfelt before, less weary of his life, less vanquished in spirit. He\r\nmight yet be able to settle down in some snug corner and live happily\r\nif he could only come across some good simple-minded girl with a little\r\nof the ready.\r\n\r\nHe paid twopence halfpenny to the slatternly girl and went out of the\r\nshop to begin his wandering again. He went into Capel Street and walked\r\nalong towards the City Hall. Then he turned into Dame Street. At the\r\ncorner of George\xe2\x80\x99s Street he met two friends of his and stopped to\r\nconverse with them. He was glad that he could rest from all his\r\nwalking. His friends asked him had he seen Corley and what was the\r\nlatest. He replied that he had spent the day with Corley. His friends\r\ntalked very little. They looked vacantly after some figures in the\r\ncrowd and sometimes made a critical remark. One said that he had seen\r\nMac an hour before in Westmoreland Street. At this Lenehan said that he\r\nhad been with Mac the night before in Egan\xe2\x80\x99s. The young man who had\r\nseen Mac in Westmoreland Street asked was it true that Mac had won a\r\nbit over a billiard match. Lenehan did not know: he said that Holohan\r\nhad stood them drinks in Egan\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nHe left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up George\xe2\x80\x99s Street. He\r\nturned to the left at the City Markets and walked on into Grafton\r\nStreet. The crowd of girls and young men had thinned and on his way up\r\nthe street he heard many groups and couples bidding one another\r\ngood-night. He went as far as the clock of the College of Surgeons: it\r\nwas on the stroke of ten. He set off briskly along the northern side of\r\nthe Green hurrying for fear Corley should return too soon. When he\r\nreached the corner of Merrion Street he took his stand in the shadow of\r\na lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he had reserved and\r\nlit it. He leaned against the lamp-post and kept his gaze fixed on the\r\npart from which he expected to see Corley and the young woman return.\r\n\r\nHis mind became active again. He wondered had Corley managed it\r\nsuccessfully. He wondered if he had asked her yet or if he would leave\r\nit to the last. He suffered all the pangs and thrills of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsituation as well as those of his own. But the memory of Corley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nslowly revolving head calmed him somewhat: he was sure Corley would\r\npull it off all right. All at once the idea struck him that perhaps\r\nCorley had seen her home by another way and given him the slip. His\r\neyes searched the street: there was no sign of them. Yet it was surely\r\nhalf-an-hour since he had seen the clock of the College of Surgeons.\r\nWould Corley do a thing like that? He lit his last cigarette and began\r\nto smoke it nervously. He strained his eyes as each tram stopped at the\r\nfar corner of the square. They must have gone home by another way. The\r\npaper of his cigarette broke and he flung it into the road with a\r\ncurse.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he saw them coming towards him. He started with delight and,\r\nkeeping close to his lamp-post, tried to read the result in their walk.\r\nThey were walking quickly, the young woman taking quick short steps,\r\nwhile Corley kept beside her with his long stride. They did not seem to\r\nbe speaking. An intimation of the result pricked him like the point of\r\na sharp instrument. He knew Corley would fail; he knew it was no go.\r\n\r\nThey turned down Baggot Street and he followed them at once, taking the\r\nother footpath. When they stopped he stopped too. They talked for a few\r\nmoments and then the young woman went down the steps into the area of a\r\nhouse. Corley remained standing at the edge of the path, a little\r\ndistance from the front steps. Some minutes passed. Then the hall-door\r\nwas opened slowly and cautiously. A woman came running down the front\r\nsteps and coughed. Corley turned and went towards her. His broad figure\r\nhid hers from view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running up\r\nthe steps. The door closed on her and Corley began to walk swiftly\r\ntowards Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s Green.\r\n\r\nLenehan hurried on in the same direction. Some drops of light rain\r\nfell. He took them as a warning and, glancing back towards the house\r\nwhich the young woman had entered to see that he was not observed, he\r\nran eagerly across the road. Anxiety and his swift run made him pant.\r\nHe called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Corley!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCorley turned his head to see who had called him, and then continued\r\nwalking as before. Lenehan ran after him, settling the waterproof on\r\nhis shoulders with one hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Corley!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried again.\r\n\r\nHe came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face. He could\r\nsee nothing there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDid it come off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had reached the corner of Ely Place. Still without answering,\r\nCorley swerved to the left and went up the side street. His features\r\nwere composed in stern calm. Lenehan kept up with his friend, breathing\r\nuneasily. He was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you tell us?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you try her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCorley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him. Then with\r\na grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light and, smiling,\r\nopened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple. A small gold coin shone\r\nin the palm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOARDING HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs Mooney was a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. She was a woman who was quite able\r\nto keep things to herself: a determined woman. She had married her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s foreman and opened a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s shop near Spring Gardens. But\r\nas soon as his father-in-law was dead Mr Mooney began to go to the\r\ndevil. He drank, plundered the till, ran headlong into debt. It was no\r\nuse making him take the pledge: he was sure to break out again a few\r\ndays after. By fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by\r\nbuying bad meat he ruined his business. One night he went for his wife\r\nwith the cleaver and she had to sleep in a neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nAfter that they lived apart. She went to the priest and got a\r\nseparation from him with care of the children. She would give him\r\nneither money nor food nor house-room; and so he was obliged to enlist\r\nhimself as a sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s man. He was a shabby stooped little drunkard\r\nwith a white face and a white moustache and white eyebrows, pencilled\r\nabove his little eyes, which were pink-veined and raw; and all day long\r\nhe sat in the bailiff\xe2\x80\x99s room, waiting to be put on a job. Mrs Mooney,\r\nwho had taken what remained of her money out of the butcher business\r\nand set up a boarding house in Hardwicke Street, was a big imposing\r\nwoman. Her house had a floating population made up of tourists from\r\nLiverpool and the Isle of Man and, occasionally, _artistes_ from the\r\nmusic-halls. Its resident population was made up of clerks from the\r\ncity. She governed her house cunningly and firmly, knew when to give\r\ncredit, when to be stern and when to let things pass. All the resident\r\nyoung men spoke of her as _The Madam_.\r\n\r\nMrs Mooney\xe2\x80\x99s young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and\r\nlodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded). They shared in common\r\ntastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with\r\none another. They discussed with one another the chances of favourites\r\nand outsiders. Jack Mooney, the Madam\xe2\x80\x99s son, who was clerk to a\r\ncommission agent in Fleet Street, had the reputation of being a hard\r\ncase. He was fond of using soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 obscenities: usually he came home\r\nin the small hours. When he met his friends he had always a good one to\r\ntell them and he was always sure to be on to a good thing\xe2\x80\x94that is to\r\nsay, a likely horse or a likely _artiste_. He was also handy with the\r\nmits and sang comic songs. On Sunday nights there would often be a\r\nreunion in Mrs Mooney\xe2\x80\x99s front drawing-room. The music-hall _artistes_\r\nwould oblige; and Sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped\r\naccompaniments. Polly Mooney, the Madam\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, would also sing.\r\nShe sang:\r\n\r\n     _I\xe2\x80\x99m a ... naughty girl.\r\n         You needn\xe2\x80\x99t sham:\r\n         You know I am._\r\n\r\nPolly was a slim girl of nineteen; she had light soft hair and a small\r\nfull mouth. Her eyes, which were grey with a shade of green through\r\nthem, had a habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone, which\r\nmade her look like a little perverse madonna. Mrs Mooney had first sent\r\nher daughter to be a typist in a corn-factor\xe2\x80\x99s office but, as a\r\ndisreputable sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s man used to come every other day to the office,\r\nasking to be allowed to say a word to his daughter, she had taken her\r\ndaughter home again and set her to do housework. As Polly was very\r\nlively the intention was to give her the run of the young men. Besides,\r\nyoung men like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away.\r\nPolly, of course, flirted with the young men but Mrs Mooney, who was a\r\nshrewd judge, knew that the young men were only passing the time away:\r\nnone of them meant business. Things went on so for a long time and Mrs\r\nMooney began to think of sending Polly back to typewriting when she\r\nnoticed that something was going on between Polly and one of the young\r\nmen. She watched the pair and kept her own counsel.\r\n\r\nPolly knew that she was being watched, but still her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npersistent silence could not be misunderstood. There had been no open\r\ncomplicity between mother and daughter, no open understanding but,\r\nthough people in the house began to talk of the affair, still Mrs\r\nMooney did not intervene. Polly began to grow a little strange in her\r\nmanner and the young man was evidently perturbed. At last, when she\r\njudged it to be the right moment, Mrs Mooney intervened. She dealt with\r\nmoral problems as a cleaver deals with meat: and in this case she had\r\nmade up her mind.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright Sunday morning of early summer, promising heat, but\r\nwith a fresh breeze blowing. All the windows of the boarding house were\r\nopen and the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath\r\nthe raised sashes. The belfry of George\xe2\x80\x99s Church sent out constant\r\npeals and worshippers, singly or in groups, traversed the little circus\r\nbefore the church, revealing their purpose by their self-contained\r\ndemeanour no less than by the little volumes in their gloved hands.\r\nBreakfast was over in the boarding house and the table of the\r\nbreakfast-room was covered with plates on which lay yellow streaks of\r\neggs with morsels of bacon-fat and bacon-rind. Mrs Mooney sat in the\r\nstraw arm-chair and watched the servant Mary remove the breakfast\r\nthings. She made Mary collect the crusts and pieces of broken bread to\r\nhelp to make Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s bread-pudding. When the table was cleared, the\r\nbroken bread collected, the sugar and butter safe under lock and key,\r\nshe began to reconstruct the interview which she had had the night\r\nbefore with Polly. Things were as she had suspected: she had been frank\r\nin her questions and Polly had been frank in her answers. Both had been\r\nsomewhat awkward, of course. She had been made awkward by her not\r\nwishing to receive the news in too cavalier a fashion or to seem to\r\nhave connived and Polly had been made awkward not merely because\r\nallusions of that kind always made her awkward but also because she did\r\nnot wish it to be thought that in her wise innocence she had divined\r\nthe intention behind her mother\xe2\x80\x99s tolerance.\r\n\r\nMrs Mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the\r\nmantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through her revery that the\r\nbells of George\xe2\x80\x99s Church had stopped ringing. It was seventeen minutes\r\npast eleven: she would have lots of time to have the matter out with Mr\r\nDoran and then catch short twelve at Marlborough Street. She was sure\r\nshe would win. To begin with she had all the weight of social opinion\r\non her side: she was an outraged mother. She had allowed him to live\r\nbeneath her roof, assuming that he was a man of honour, and he had\r\nsimply abused her hospitality. He was thirty-four or thirty-five years\r\nof age, so that youth could not be pleaded as his excuse; nor could\r\nignorance be his excuse since he was a man who had seen something of\r\nthe world. He had simply taken advantage of Polly\xe2\x80\x99s youth and\r\ninexperience: that was evident. The question was: What reparation would\r\nhe make?\r\n\r\nThere must be reparation made in such cases. It is all very well for\r\nthe man: he can go his ways as if nothing had happened, having had his\r\nmoment of pleasure, but the girl has to bear the brunt. Some mothers\r\nwould be content to patch up such an affair for a sum of money; she had\r\nknown cases of it. But she would not do so. For her only one reparation\r\ncould make up for the loss of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s honour: marriage.\r\n\r\nShe counted all her cards again before sending Mary up to Mr Doran\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom to say that she wished to speak with him. She felt sure she would\r\nwin. He was a serious young man, not rakish or loud-voiced like the\r\nothers. If it had been Mr Sheridan or Mr Meade or Bantam Lyons her task\r\nwould have been much harder. She did not think he would face publicity.\r\nAll the lodgers in the house knew something of the affair; details had\r\nbeen invented by some. Besides, he had been employed for thirteen years\r\nin a great Catholic wine-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s office and publicity would mean for\r\nhim, perhaps, the loss of his job. Whereas if he agreed all might be\r\nwell. She knew he had a good screw for one thing and she suspected he\r\nhad a bit of stuff put by.\r\n\r\nNearly the half-hour! She stood up and surveyed herself in the\r\npier-glass. The decisive expression of her great florid face satisfied\r\nher and she thought of some mothers she knew who could not get their\r\ndaughters off their hands.\r\n\r\nMr Doran was very anxious indeed this Sunday morning. He had made two\r\nattempts to shave but his hand had been so unsteady that he had been\r\nobliged to desist. Three days\xe2\x80\x99 reddish beard fringed his jaws and every\r\ntwo or three minutes a mist gathered on his glasses so that he had to\r\ntake them off and polish them with his pocket-handkerchief. The\r\nrecollection of his confession of the night before was a cause of acute\r\npain to him; the priest had drawn out every ridiculous detail of the\r\naffair and in the end had so magnified his sin that he was almost\r\nthankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation. The harm was done.\r\nWhat could he do now but marry her or run away? He could not brazen it\r\nout. The affair would be sure to be talked of and his employer would be\r\ncertain to hear of it. Dublin is such a small city: everyone knows\r\neveryone else\xe2\x80\x99s business. He felt his heart leap warmly in his throat\r\nas he heard in his excited imagination old Mr Leonard calling out in\r\nhis rasping voice: \xe2\x80\x9cSend Mr Doran here, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll his long years of service gone for nothing! All his industry and\r\ndiligence thrown away! As a young man he had sown his wild oats, of\r\ncourse; he had boasted of his free-thinking and denied the existence of\r\nGod to his companions in public-houses. But that was all passed and\r\ndone with ... nearly. He still bought a copy of _Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99s Newspaper_\r\nevery week but he attended to his religious duties and for nine-tenths\r\nof the year lived a regular life. He had money enough to settle down\r\non; it was not that. But the family would look down on her. First of\r\nall there was her disreputable father and then her mother\xe2\x80\x99s boarding\r\nhouse was beginning to get a certain fame. He had a notion that he was\r\nbeing had. He could imagine his friends talking of the affair and\r\nlaughing. She _was_ a little vulgar; sometimes she said \xe2\x80\x9cI seen\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had\xe2\x80\x99ve known.\xe2\x80\x9d But what would grammar matter if he really loved\r\nher? He could not make up his mind whether to like her or despise her\r\nfor what she had done. Of course he had done it too. His instinct urged\r\nhim to remain free, not to marry. Once you are married you are done\r\nfor, it said.\r\n\r\nWhile he was sitting helplessly on the side of the bed in shirt and\r\ntrousers she tapped lightly at his door and entered. She told him all,\r\nthat she had made a clean breast of it to her mother and that her\r\nmother would speak with him that morning. She cried and threw her arms\r\nround his neck, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Bob! Bob! What am I to do? What am I to do at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would put an end to herself, she said.\r\n\r\nHe comforted her feebly, telling her not to cry, that it would be all\r\nright, never fear. He felt against his shirt the agitation of her\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\nIt was not altogether his fault that it had happened. He remembered\r\nwell, with the curious patient memory of the celibate, the first casual\r\ncaresses her dress, her breath, her fingers had given him. Then late\r\none night as he was undressing for bed she had tapped at his door,\r\ntimidly. She wanted to relight her candle at his for hers had been\r\nblown out by a gust. It was her bath night. She wore a loose open\r\ncombing-jacket of printed flannel. Her white instep shone in the\r\nopening of her furry slippers and the blood glowed warmly behind her\r\nperfumed skin. From her hands and wrists too as she lit and steadied\r\nher candle a faint perfume arose.\r\n\r\nOn nights when he came in very late it was she who warmed up his\r\ndinner. He scarcely knew what he was eating, feeling her beside him\r\nalone, at night, in the sleeping house. And her thoughtfulness! If the\r\nnight was anyway cold or wet or windy there was sure to be a little\r\ntumbler of punch ready for him. Perhaps they could be happy\r\ntogether....\r\n\r\nThey used to go upstairs together on tiptoe, each with a candle, and on\r\nthe third landing exchange reluctant good-nights. They used to kiss. He\r\nremembered well her eyes, the touch of her hand and his delirium....\r\n\r\nBut delirium passes. He echoed her phrase, applying it to himself:\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d_ The instinct of the celibate warned him to hold\r\nback. But the sin was there; even his sense of honour told him that\r\nreparation must be made for such a sin.\r\n\r\nWhile he was sitting with her on the side of the bed Mary came to the\r\ndoor and said that the missus wanted to see him in the parlour. He\r\nstood up to put on his coat and waistcoat, more helpless than ever.\r\nWhen he was dressed he went over to her to comfort her. It would be all\r\nright, never fear. He left her crying on the bed and moaning softly:\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cO my God!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nGoing down the stairs his glasses became so dimmed with moisture that\r\nhe had to take them off and polish them. He longed to ascend through\r\nthe roof and fly away to another country where he would never hear\r\nagain of his trouble, and yet a force pushed him downstairs step by\r\nstep. The implacable faces of his employer and of the Madam stared upon\r\nhis discomfiture. On the last flight of stairs he passed Jack Mooney\r\nwho was coming up from the pantry nursing two bottles of _Bass_. They\r\nsaluted coldly; and the lover\xe2\x80\x99s eyes rested for a second or two on a\r\nthick bulldog face and a pair of thick short arms. When he reached the\r\nfoot of the staircase he glanced up and saw Jack regarding him from the\r\ndoor of the return-room.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he remembered the night when one of the music-hall _artistes_,\r\na little blond Londoner, had made a rather free allusion to Polly. The\r\nreunion had been almost broken up on account of Jack\xe2\x80\x99s violence.\r\nEveryone tried to quiet him. The music-hall _artiste_, a little paler\r\nthan usual, kept smiling and saying that there was no harm meant: but\r\nJack kept shouting at him that if any fellow tried that sort of a game\r\non with _his_ sister he\xe2\x80\x99d bloody well put his teeth down his throat, so\r\nhe would.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolly sat for a little time on the side of the bed, crying. Then she\r\ndried her eyes and went over to the looking-glass. She dipped the end\r\nof the towel in the water-jug and refreshed her eyes with the cool\r\nwater. She looked at herself in profile and readjusted a hairpin above\r\nher ear. Then she went back to the bed again and sat at the foot. She\r\nregarded the pillows for a long time and the sight of them awakened in\r\nher mind secret amiable memories. She rested the nape of her neck\r\nagainst the cool iron bed-rail and fell into a revery. There was no\r\nlonger any perturbation visible on her face.\r\n\r\nShe waited on patiently, almost cheerfully, without alarm, her memories\r\ngradually giving place to hopes and visions of the future. Her hopes\r\nand visions were so intricate that she no longer saw the white pillows\r\non which her gaze was fixed or remembered that she was waiting for\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nAt last she heard her mother calling. She started to her feet and ran\r\nto the banisters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolly! Polly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome down, dear. Mr Doran wants to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she remembered what she had been waiting for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LITTLE CLOUD\r\n\r\n\r\nEight years before he had seen his friend off at the North Wall and\r\nwished him godspeed. Gallaher had got on. You could tell that at once\r\nby his travelled air, his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few\r\nfellows had talents like his and fewer still could remain unspoiled by\r\nsuch success. Gallaher\xe2\x80\x99s heart was in the right place and he had\r\ndeserved to win. It was something to have a friend like that.\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts ever since lunch-time had been of his\r\nmeeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher\xe2\x80\x99s invitation and of the great city\r\nLondon where Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,\r\nthough he was but slightly under the average stature, he gave one the\r\nidea of being a little man. His hands were white and small, his frame\r\nwas fragile, his voice was quiet and his manners were refined. He took\r\nthe greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and used\r\nperfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The half-moons of his nails\r\nwere perfect and when he smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of\r\nchildish white teeth.\r\n\r\nAs he sat at his desk in the King\xe2\x80\x99s Inns he thought what changes those\r\neight years had brought. The friend whom he had known under a shabby\r\nand necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the London\r\nPress. He turned often from his tiresome writing to gaze out of the\r\noffice window. The glow of a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots\r\nand walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the untidy nurses\r\nand decrepit old men who drowsed on the benches; it flickered upon all\r\nthe moving figures\xe2\x80\x94on the children who ran screaming along the gravel\r\npaths and on everyone who passed through the gardens. He watched the\r\nscene and thought of life; and (as always happened when he thought of\r\nlife) he became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of him. He\r\nfelt how useless it was to struggle against fortune, this being the\r\nburden of wisdom which the ages had bequeathed to him.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the books of poetry upon his shelves at home. He had\r\nbought them in his bachelor days and many an evening, as he sat in the\r\nlittle room off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down from the\r\nbookshelf and read out something to his wife. But shyness had always\r\nheld him back; and so the books had remained on their shelves. At times\r\nhe repeated lines to himself and this consoled him.\r\n\r\nWhen his hour had struck he stood up and took leave of his desk and of\r\nhis fellow-clerks punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal arch\r\nof the King\xe2\x80\x99s Inns, a neat modest figure, and walked swiftly down\r\nHenrietta Street. The golden sunset was waning and the air had grown\r\nsharp. A horde of grimy children populated the street. They stood or\r\nran in the roadway or crawled up the steps before the gaping doors or\r\nsquatted like mice upon the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no\r\nthought. He picked his way deftly through all that minute vermin-like\r\nlife and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions in which the\r\nold nobility of Dublin had roystered. No memory of the past touched\r\nhim, for his mind was full of a present joy.\r\n\r\nHe had never been in Corless\xe2\x80\x99s but he knew the value of the name. He\r\nknew that people went there after the theatre to eat oysters and drink\r\nliqueurs; and he had heard that the waiters there spoke French and\r\nGerman. Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn up before\r\nthe door and richly dressed ladies, escorted by cavaliers, alight and\r\nenter quickly. They wore noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were\r\npowdered and they caught up their dresses, when they touched earth,\r\nlike alarmed Atalantas. He had always passed without turning his head\r\nto look. It was his habit to walk swiftly in the street even by day and\r\nwhenever he found himself in the city late at night he hurried on his\r\nway apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes, however, he courted the\r\ncauses of his fear. He chose the darkest and narrowest streets and, as\r\nhe walked boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his\r\nfootsteps troubled him, the wandering silent figures troubled him; and\r\nat times a sound of low fugitive laughter made him tremble like a leaf.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the right towards Capel Street. Ignatius Gallaher on the\r\nLondon Press! Who would have thought it possible eight years before?\r\nStill, now that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could remember\r\nmany signs of future greatness in his friend. People used to say that\r\nIgnatius Gallaher was wild. Of course, he did mix with a rakish set of\r\nfellows at that time, drank freely and borrowed money on all sides. In\r\nthe end he had got mixed up in some shady affair, some money\r\ntransaction: at least, that was one version of his flight. But nobody\r\ndenied him talent. There was always a certain ... something in Ignatius\r\nGallaher that impressed you in spite of yourself. Even when he was out\r\nat elbows and at his wits\xe2\x80\x99 end for money he kept up a bold face. Little\r\nChandler remembered (and the remembrance brought a slight flush of\r\npride to his cheek) one of Ignatius Gallaher\xe2\x80\x99s sayings when he was in a\r\ntight corner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf time now, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say light-heartedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nconsidering cap?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was Ignatius Gallaher all out; and, damn it, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t but\r\nadmire him for it.\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler quickened his pace. For the first time in his life he\r\nfelt himself superior to the people he passed. For the first time his\r\nsoul revolted against the dull inelegance of Capel Street. There was no\r\ndoubt about it: if you wanted to succeed you had to go away. You could\r\ndo nothing in Dublin. As he crossed Grattan Bridge he looked down the\r\nriver towards the lower quays and pitied the poor stunted houses. They\r\nseemed to him a band of tramps, huddled together along the riverbanks,\r\ntheir old coats covered with dust and soot, stupefied by the panorama\r\nof sunset and waiting for the first chill of night bid them arise,\r\nshake themselves and begone. He wondered whether he could write a poem\r\nto express his idea. Perhaps Gallaher might be able to get it into some\r\nLondon paper for him. Could he write something original? He was not\r\nsure what idea he wished to express but the thought that a poetic\r\nmoment had touched him took life within him like an infant hope. He\r\nstepped onward bravely.\r\n\r\nEvery step brought him nearer to London, farther from his own sober\r\ninartistic life. A light began to tremble on the horizon of his mind.\r\nHe was not so old\xe2\x80\x94thirty-two. His temperament might be said to be just\r\nat the point of maturity. There were so many different moods and\r\nimpressions that he wished to express in verse. He felt them within\r\nhim. He tried to weigh his soul to see if it was a poet\xe2\x80\x99s soul.\r\nMelancholy was the dominant note of his temperament, he thought, but it\r\nwas a melancholy tempered by recurrences of faith and resignation and\r\nsimple joy. If he could give expression to it in a book of poems\r\nperhaps men would listen. He would never be popular: he saw that. He\r\ncould not sway the crowd but he might appeal to a little circle of\r\nkindred minds. The English critics, perhaps, would recognise him as one\r\nof the Celtic school by reason of the melancholy tone of his poems;\r\nbesides that, he would put in allusions. He began to invent sentences\r\nand phrases from the notice which his book would get. _\xe2\x80\x9cMr Chandler has\r\nthe gift of easy and graceful verse.\xe2\x80\x9d ... \xe2\x80\x9cA wistful sadness pervades\r\nthese poems.\xe2\x80\x9d ... \xe2\x80\x9cThe Celtic note.\xe2\x80\x9d_ It was a pity his name was not\r\nmore Irish-looking. Perhaps it would be better to insert his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname before the surname: Thomas Malone Chandler, or better still: T.\r\nMalone Chandler. He would speak to Gallaher about it.\r\n\r\nHe pursued his revery so ardently that he passed his street and had to\r\nturn back. As he came near Corless\xe2\x80\x99s his former agitation began to\r\novermaster him and he halted before the door in indecision. Finally he\r\nopened the door and entered.\r\n\r\nThe light and noise of the bar held him at the doorways for a few\r\nmoments. He looked about him, but his sight was confused by the shining\r\nof many red and green wine-glasses. The bar seemed to him to be full of\r\npeople and he felt that the people were observing him curiously. He\r\nglanced quickly to right and left (frowning slightly to make his errand\r\nappear serious), but when his sight cleared a little he saw that nobody\r\nhad turned to look at him: and there, sure enough, was Ignatius\r\nGallaher leaning with his back against the counter and his feet planted\r\nfar apart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Tommy, old hero, here you are! What is it to be? What will you\r\nhave? I\xe2\x80\x99m taking whisky: better stuff than we get across the water.\r\nSoda? Lithia? No mineral? I\xe2\x80\x99m the same. Spoils the flavour.... Here,\r\n_gar\xc3\xa7on_, bring us two halves of malt whisky, like a good fellow....\r\nWell, and how have you been pulling along since I saw you last? Dear\r\nGod, how old we\xe2\x80\x99re getting! Do you see any signs of aging in me\xe2\x80\x94eh,\r\nwhat? A little grey and thin on the top\xe2\x80\x94what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIgnatius Gallaher took off his hat and displayed a large closely\r\ncropped head. His face was heavy, pale and clean-shaven. His eyes,\r\nwhich were of bluish slate-colour, relieved his unhealthy pallor and\r\nshone out plainly above the vivid orange tie he wore. Between these\r\nrival features the lips appeared very long and shapeless and\r\ncolourless. He bent his head and felt with two sympathetic fingers the\r\nthin hair at the crown. Little Chandler shook his head as a denial.\r\nIgnatius Galaher put on his hat again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt pulls you down,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPress life. Always hurry and scurry,\r\nlooking for copy and sometimes not finding it: and then, always to have\r\nsomething new in your stuff. Damn proofs and printers, I say, for a few\r\ndays. I\xe2\x80\x99m deuced glad, I can tell you, to get back to the old country.\r\nDoes a fellow good, a bit of a holiday. I feel a ton better since I\r\nlanded again in dear dirty Dublin.... Here you are, Tommy. Water? Say\r\nwhen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler allowed his whisky to be very much diluted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s good for you, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI drink mine neat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI drink very little as a rule,\xe2\x80\x9d said Little Chandler modestly. \xe2\x80\x9cAn odd\r\nhalf-one or so when I meet any of the old crowd: that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher, cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s to us and to\r\nold times and old acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey clinked glasses and drank the toast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met some of the old gang today,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher. \xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x99Hara\r\nseems to be in a bad way. What\xe2\x80\x99s he doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Little Chandler. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone to the dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Hogan has a good sit, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; he\xe2\x80\x99s in the Land Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met him one night in London and he seemed to be very flush.... Poor\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Hara! Boose, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther things, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Little Chandler shortly.\r\n\r\nIgnatius Gallaher laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTommy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI see you haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed an atom. You\xe2\x80\x99re the very\r\nsame serious person that used to lecture me on Sunday mornings when I\r\nhad a sore head and a fur on my tongue. You\xe2\x80\x99d want to knock about a bit\r\nin the world. Have you never been anywhere even for a trip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been to the Isle of Man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Little Chandler.\r\n\r\nIgnatius Gallaher laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Isle of Man!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo to London or Paris: Paris, for choice.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99d do you good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think I have! I\xe2\x80\x99ve knocked about there a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it really so beautiful as they say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Little Chandler.\r\n\r\nHe sipped a little of his drink while Ignatius Gallaher finished his\r\nboldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher, pausing on the word and on the\r\nflavour of his drink. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not so beautiful, you know. Of course, it\r\nis beautiful.... But it\xe2\x80\x99s the life of Paris; that\xe2\x80\x99s the thing. Ah,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no city like Paris for gaiety, movement, excitement....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler finished his whisky and, after some trouble, succeeded\r\nin catching the barman\xe2\x80\x99s eye. He ordered the same again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been to the Moulin Rouge,\xe2\x80\x9d Ignatius Gallaher continued when the\r\nbarman had removed their glasses, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to all the Bohemian\r\ncaf\xc3\xa9s. Hot stuff! Not for a pious chap like you, Tommy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler said nothing until the barman returned with two\r\nglasses: then he touched his friend\xe2\x80\x99s glass lightly and reciprocated\r\nthe former toast. He was beginning to feel somewhat disillusioned.\r\nGallaher\xe2\x80\x99s accent and way of expressing himself did not please him.\r\nThere was something vulgar in his friend which he had not observed\r\nbefore. But perhaps it was only the result of living in London amid the\r\nbustle and competition of the Press. The old personal charm was still\r\nthere under this new gaudy manner. And, after all, Gallaher had lived,\r\nhe had seen the world. Little Chandler looked at his friend enviously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything in Paris is gay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher. \xe2\x80\x9cThey believe in\r\nenjoying life\xe2\x80\x94and don\xe2\x80\x99t you think they\xe2\x80\x99re right? If you want to enjoy\r\nyourself properly you must go to Paris. And, mind you, they\xe2\x80\x99ve a great\r\nfeeling for the Irish there. When they heard I was from Ireland they\r\nwere ready to eat me, man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler took four or five sips from his glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis it true that Paris is so ... immoral as they\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIgnatius Gallaher made a catholic gesture with his right arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery place is immoral,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you do find spicy bits in\r\nParis. Go to one of the students\xe2\x80\x99 balls, for instance. That\xe2\x80\x99s lively,\r\nif you like, when the _cocottes_ begin to let themselves loose. You\r\nknow what they are, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Little Chandler.\r\n\r\nIgnatius Gallaher drank off his whisky and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may say what you like. There\xe2\x80\x99s no woman like the\r\nParisienne\xe2\x80\x94for style, for go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is an immoral city,\xe2\x80\x9d said Little Chandler, with timid\r\ninsistence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, compared with London or Dublin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLondon!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s six of one and half-a-dozen of\r\nthe other. You ask Hogan, my boy. I showed him a bit about London when\r\nhe was over there. He\xe2\x80\x99d open your eye.... I say, Tommy, don\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\npunch of that whisky: liquor up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, really....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, come on, another one won\xe2\x80\x99t do you any harm. What is it? The same\r\nagain, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell ... all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Fran\xc3\xa7ois_, the same again.... Will you smoke, Tommy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIgnatius Gallaher produced his cigar-case. The two friends lit their\r\ncigars and puffed at them in silence until their drinks were served.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher, emerging after some\r\ntime from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken refuge, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a rum\r\nworld. Talk of immorality! I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of cases\xe2\x80\x94what am I saying?\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nknown them: cases of ... immorality....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIgnatius Gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then, in a calm\r\nhistorian\xe2\x80\x99s tone, he proceeded to sketch for his friend some pictures\r\nof the corruption which was rife abroad. He summarised the vices of\r\nmany capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to Berlin. Some\r\nthings he could not vouch for (his friends had told him), but of others\r\nhe had had personal experience. He spared neither rank nor caste. He\r\nrevealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the Continent and\r\ndescribed some of the practices which were fashionable in high society\r\nand ended by telling, with details, a story about an English duchess\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nstory which he knew to be true. Little Chandler was astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher, \xe2\x80\x9chere we are in old jog-along\r\nDublin where nothing is known of such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dull you must find it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Little Chandler, \xe2\x80\x9cafter all the other\r\nplaces you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a relaxation to come over here,\r\nyou know. And, after all, it\xe2\x80\x99s the old country, as they say, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t help having a certain feeling for it. That\xe2\x80\x99s human nature....\r\nBut tell me something about yourself. Hogan told me you had ... tasted\r\nthe joys of connubial bliss. Two years ago, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler blushed and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was married last May twelve months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope it\xe2\x80\x99s not too late in the day to offer my best wishes,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nIgnatius Gallaher. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know your address or I\xe2\x80\x99d have done so at\r\nthe time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe extended his hand, which Little Chandler took.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Tommy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you and yours every joy in life, old\r\nchap, and tons of money, and may you never die till I shoot you. And\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the wish of a sincere friend, an old friend. You know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Little Chandler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny youngsters?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher.\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler blushed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have one child,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSon or daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIgnatius Gallaher slapped his friend sonorously on the back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt you, Tommy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler smiled, looked confusedly at his glass and bit his\r\nlower lip with three childishly white front teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll spend an evening with us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you go back.\r\nMy wife will be delighted to meet you. We can have a little music\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks awfully, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry we\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t meet earlier. But I must leave tomorrow night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTonight, perhaps...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry, old man. You see I\xe2\x80\x99m over here with another fellow,\r\nclever young chap he is too, and we arranged to go to a little\r\ncard-party. Only for that....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, in that case....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who knows?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher considerately. \xe2\x80\x9cNext year I may\r\ntake a little skip over here now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve broken the ice. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a\r\npleasure deferred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Little Chandler, \xe2\x80\x9cthe next time you come we must have\r\nan evening together. That\xe2\x80\x99s agreed now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s agreed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher. \xe2\x80\x9cNext year if I come,\r\n_parole d\xe2\x80\x99honneur_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to clinch the bargain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Little Chandler, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll just have one\r\nmore now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIgnatius Gallaher took out a large gold watch and looked at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it to be the last?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause you know, I have an a.p.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, yes, positively,\xe2\x80\x9d said Little Chandler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher, \xe2\x80\x9clet us have another one as\r\na _deoc an doruis_\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s good vernacular for a small whisky, I\r\nbelieve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler ordered the drinks. The blush which had risen to his\r\nface a few moments before was establishing itself. A trifle made him\r\nblush at any time: and now he felt warm and excited. Three small\r\nwhiskies had gone to his head and Gallaher\xe2\x80\x99s strong cigar had confused\r\nhis mind, for he was a delicate and abstinent person. The adventure of\r\nmeeting Gallaher after eight years, of finding himself with Gallaher in\r\nCorless\xe2\x80\x99s surrounded by lights and noise, of listening to Gallaher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstories and of sharing for a brief space Gallaher\xe2\x80\x99s vagrant and\r\ntriumphant life, upset the equipoise of his sensitive nature. He felt\r\nacutely the contrast between his own life and his friend\xe2\x80\x99s and it\r\nseemed to him unjust. Gallaher was his inferior in birth and education.\r\nHe was sure that he could do something better than his friend had ever\r\ndone, or could ever do, something higher than mere tawdry journalism if\r\nhe only got the chance. What was it that stood in his way? His\r\nunfortunate timidity! He wished to vindicate himself in some way, to\r\nassert his manhood. He saw behind Gallaher\xe2\x80\x99s refusal of his invitation.\r\nGallaher was only patronising him by his friendliness just as he was\r\npatronising Ireland by his visit.\r\n\r\nThe barman brought their drinks. Little Chandler pushed one glass\r\ntowards his friend and took up the other boldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as they lifted their glasses. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you come next\r\nyear I may have the pleasure of wishing long life and happiness to Mr\r\nand Mrs Ignatius Gallaher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIgnatius Gallaher in the act of drinking closed one eye expressively\r\nover the rim of his glass. When he had drunk he smacked his lips\r\ndecisively, set down his glass and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo blooming fear of that, my boy. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have my fling first and\r\nsee a bit of life and the world before I put my head in the sack\xe2\x80\x94if I\r\never do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome day you will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Little Chandler calmly.\r\n\r\nIgnatius Gallaher turned his orange tie and slate-blue eyes full upon\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll put your head in the sack,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Little Chandler stoutly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clike everyone else if you can find the girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had slightly emphasised his tone and he was aware that he had\r\nbetrayed himself; but, though the colour had heightened in his cheek,\r\nhe did not flinch from his friend\xe2\x80\x99s gaze. Ignatius Gallaher watched him\r\nfor a few moments and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ever it occurs, you may bet your bottom dollar there\xe2\x80\x99ll be no\r\nmooning and spooning about it. I mean to marry money. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have a\r\ngood fat account at the bank or she won\xe2\x80\x99t do for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, man alive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Gallaher, vehemently, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know what\r\nit is? I\xe2\x80\x99ve only to say the word and tomorrow I can have the woman and\r\nthe cash. You don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it? Well, I know it. There are\r\nhundreds\xe2\x80\x94what am I saying?\xe2\x80\x94thousands of rich Germans and Jews, rotten\r\nwith money, that\xe2\x80\x99d only be too glad.... You wait a while my boy. See if\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t play my cards properly. When I go about a thing I mean\r\nbusiness, I tell you. You just wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tossed his glass to his mouth, finished his drink and laughed\r\nloudly. Then he looked thoughtfully before him and said in a calmer\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m in no hurry. They can wait. I don\xe2\x80\x99t fancy tying myself up to\r\none woman, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe imitated with his mouth the act of tasting and made a wry face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust get a bit stale, I should think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler sat in the room off the hall, holding a child in his\r\narms. To save money they kept no servant but Annie\xe2\x80\x99s young sister\r\nMonica came for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the\r\nevening to help. But Monica had gone home long ago. It was a quarter to\r\nnine. Little Chandler had come home late for tea and, moreover, he had\r\nforgotten to bring Annie home the parcel of coffee from Bewley\xe2\x80\x99s. Of\r\ncourse she was in a bad humour and gave him short answers. She said she\r\nwould do without any tea but when it came near the time at which the\r\nshop at the corner closed she decided to go out herself for a quarter\r\nof a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar. She put the sleeping child\r\ndeftly in his arms and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere. Don\xe2\x80\x99t waken him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its\r\nlight fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled\r\nhorn. It was Annie\xe2\x80\x99s photograph. Little Chandler looked at it, pausing\r\nat the thin tight lips. She wore the pale blue summer blouse which he\r\nhad brought her home as a present one Saturday. It had cost him ten and\r\nelevenpence; but what an agony of nervousness it had cost him! How he\r\nhad suffered that day, waiting at the shop door until the shop was\r\nempty, standing at the counter and trying to appear at his ease while\r\nthe girl piled ladies\xe2\x80\x99 blouses before him, paying at the desk and\r\nforgetting to take up the odd penny of his change, being called back by\r\nthe cashier, and finally, striving to hide his blushes as he left the\r\nshop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied. When he\r\nbrought the blouse home Annie kissed him and said it was very pretty\r\nand stylish; but when she heard the price she threw the blouse on the\r\ntable and said it was a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence\r\nfor it. At first she wanted to take it back but when she tried it on\r\nshe was delighted with it, especially with the make of the sleeves, and\r\nkissed him and said he was very good to think of her.\r\n\r\nHm!...\r\n\r\nHe looked coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered\r\ncoldly. Certainly they were pretty and the face itself was pretty. But\r\nhe found something mean in it. Why was it so unconscious and ladylike?\r\nThe composure of the eyes irritated him. They repelled him and defied\r\nhim: there was no passion in them, no rapture. He thought of what\r\nGallaher had said about rich Jewesses. Those dark Oriental eyes, he\r\nthought, how full they are of passion, of voluptuous longing!... Why\r\nhad he married the eyes in the photograph?\r\n\r\nHe caught himself up at the question and glanced nervously round the\r\nroom. He found something mean in the pretty furniture which he had\r\nbought for his house on the hire system. Annie had chosen it herself\r\nand it reminded him of her. It too was prim and pretty. A dull\r\nresentment against his life awoke within him. Could he not escape from\r\nhis little house? Was it too late for him to try to live bravely like\r\nGallaher? Could he go to London? There was the furniture still to be\r\npaid for. If he could only write a book and get it published, that\r\nmight open the way for him.\r\n\r\nA volume of Byron\xe2\x80\x99s poems lay before him on the table. He opened it\r\ncautiously with his left hand lest he should waken the child and began\r\nto read the first poem in the book:\r\n\r\n     _Hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom,\r\n         Not e\xe2\x80\x99en a Zephyr wanders through the grove,\r\n     Whilst I return to view my Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s tomb\r\n         And scatter flowers on the dust I love._\r\n\r\nHe paused. He felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room. How\r\nmelancholy it was! Could he, too, write like that, express the\r\nmelancholy of his soul in verse? There were so many things he wanted to\r\ndescribe: his sensation of a few hours before on Grattan Bridge, for\r\nexample. If he could get back again into that mood....\r\n\r\nThe child awoke and began to cry. He turned from the page and tried to\r\nhush it: but it would not be hushed. He began to rock it to and fro in\r\nhis arms but its wailing cry grew keener. He rocked it faster while his\r\neyes began to read the second stanza:\r\n\r\n     _Within this narrow cell reclines her clay,\r\n         That clay where once...._\r\n\r\nIt was useless. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. The wailing\r\nof the child pierced the drum of his ear. It was useless, useless! He\r\nwas a prisoner for life. His arms trembled with anger and suddenly\r\nbending to the child\xe2\x80\x99s face he shouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child stopped for an instant, had a spasm of fright and began to\r\nscream. He jumped up from his chair and walked hastily up and down the\r\nroom with the child in his arms. It began to sob piteously, losing its\r\nbreath for four or five seconds, and then bursting out anew. The thin\r\nwalls of the room echoed the sound. He tried to soothe it but it sobbed\r\nmore convulsively. He looked at the contracted and quivering face of\r\nthe child and began to be alarmed. He counted seven sobs without a\r\nbreak between them and caught the child to his breast in fright. If it\r\ndied!...\r\n\r\nThe door was burst open and a young woman ran in, panting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nThe child, hearing its mother\xe2\x80\x99s voice, broke out into a paroxysm of\r\nsobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, Annie ... it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.... He began to cry....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flung her parcels on the floor and snatched the child from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done to him?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, glaring into his face.\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler sustained for one moment the gaze of her eyes and his\r\nheart closed together as he met the hatred in them. He began to\r\nstammer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.... He ... he began to cry.... I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ... I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nanything.... What?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGiving no heed to him she began to walk up and down the room, clasping\r\nthe child tightly in her arms and murmuring:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little man! My little mannie! Was \xe2\x80\x99ou frightened, love?... There\r\nnow, love! There now!... Lambabaun! Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s little lamb of the\r\nworld!... There now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back\r\nout of the lamplight. He listened while the paroxysm of the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTERPARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bell rang furiously and, when Miss Parker went to the tube, a\r\nfurious voice called out in a piercing North of Ireland accent:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend Farrington here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Parker returned to her machine, saying to a man who was writing at\r\na desk:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Alleyne wants you upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man muttered \xe2\x80\x9c_Blast_ him!\xe2\x80\x9d under his breath and pushed back his\r\nchair to stand up. When he stood up he was tall and of great bulk. He\r\nhad a hanging face, dark wine-coloured, with fair eyebrows and\r\nmoustache: his eyes bulged forward slightly and the whites of them were\r\ndirty. He lifted up the counter and, passing by the clients, went out\r\nof the office with a heavy step.\r\n\r\nHe went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing, where a\r\ndoor bore a brass plate with the inscription _Mr Alleyne_. Here he\r\nhalted, puffing with labour and vexation, and knocked. The shrill voice\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man entered Mr Alleyne\xe2\x80\x99s room. Simultaneously Mr Alleyne, a little\r\nman wearing gold-rimmed glasses on a clean-shaven face, shot his head\r\nup over a pile of documents. The head itself was so pink and hairless\r\nit seemed like a large egg reposing on the papers. Mr Alleyne did not\r\nlose a moment:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarrington? What is the meaning of this? Why have I always to complain\r\nof you? May I ask you why you haven\xe2\x80\x99t made a copy of that contract\r\nbetween Bodley and Kirwan? I told you it must be ready by four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mr Shelley said, sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mr Shelley said, sir...._ Kindly attend to what I say and not to what\r\n_Mr Shelley says, sir_. You have always some excuse or another for\r\nshirking work. Let me tell you that if the contract is not copied\r\nbefore this evening I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay the matter before Mr Crosbie.... Do you\r\nhear me now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear me now?... Ay and another little matter! I might as well\r\nbe talking to the wall as talking to you. Understand once for all that\r\nyou get a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and a half. How\r\nmany courses do you want, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know.... Do you mind me, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Alleyne bent his head again upon his pile of papers. The man stared\r\nfixedly at the polished skull which directed the affairs of Crosbie &\r\nAlleyne, gauging its fragility. A spasm of rage gripped his throat for\r\na few moments and then passed, leaving after it a sharp sensation of\r\nthirst. The man recognised the sensation and felt that he must have a\r\ngood night\xe2\x80\x99s drinking. The middle of the month was passed and, if he\r\ncould get the copy done in time, Mr Alleyne might give him an order on\r\nthe cashier. He stood still, gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile\r\nof papers. Suddenly Mr Alleyne began to upset all the papers, searching\r\nfor something. Then, as if he had been unaware of the man\xe2\x80\x99s presence\r\ntill that moment, he shot up his head again, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? Are you going to stand there all day? Upon my word, Farrington,\r\nyou take things easy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was waiting to see....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see. Go downstairs and do your work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man walked heavily towards the door and, as he went out of the\r\nroom, he heard Mr Alleyne cry after him that if the contract was not\r\ncopied by evening Mr Crosbie would hear of the matter.\r\n\r\nHe returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the sheets\r\nwhich remained to be copied. He took up his pen and dipped it in the\r\nink but he continued to stare stupidly at the last words he had\r\nwritten: _In no case shall the said Bernard Bodley be...._ The evening\r\nwas falling and in a few minutes they would be lighting the gas: then\r\nhe could write. He felt that he must slake the thirst in his throat. He\r\nstood up from his desk and, lifting the counter as before, passed out\r\nof the office. As he was passing out the chief clerk looked at him\r\ninquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, Mr Shelley,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, pointing with his finger to\r\nindicate the objective of his journey.\r\n\r\nThe chief clerk glanced at the hat-rack but, seeing the row complete,\r\noffered no remark. As soon as he was on the landing the man pulled a\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99s plaid cap out of his pocket, put it on his head and ran\r\nquickly down the rickety stairs. From the street door he walked on\r\nfurtively on the inner side of the path towards the corner and all at\r\nonce dived into a doorway. He was now safe in the dark snug of\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s shop, and filling up the little window that looked into the\r\nbar with his inflamed face, the colour of dark wine or dark meat, he\r\ncalled out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Pat, give us a g.p., like a good fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe curate brought him a glass of plain porter. The man drank it at a\r\ngulp and asked for a caraway seed. He put his penny on the counter and,\r\nleaving the curate to grope for it in the gloom, retreated out of the\r\nsnug as furtively as he had entered it.\r\n\r\nDarkness, accompanied by a thick fog, was gaining upon the dusk of\r\nFebruary and the lamps in Eustace Street had been lit. The man went up\r\nby the houses until he reached the door of the office, wondering\r\nwhether he could finish his copy in time. On the stairs a moist pungent\r\nodour of perfumes saluted his nose: evidently Miss Delacour had come\r\nwhile he was out in O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s. He crammed his cap back again into his\r\npocket and re-entered the office, assuming an air of absent-mindedness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Alleyne has been calling for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the chief clerk severely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere were you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the counter as\r\nif to intimate that their presence prevented him from answering. As the\r\nclients were both male the chief clerk allowed himself a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that game,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFive times in one day is a little bit....\r\nWell, you better look sharp and get a copy of our correspondence in the\r\nDelacour case for Mr Alleyne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis address in the presence of the public, his run upstairs and the\r\nporter he had gulped down so hastily confused the man and, as he sat\r\ndown at his desk to get what was required, he realised how hopeless was\r\nthe task of finishing his copy of the contract before half past five.\r\nThe dark damp night was coming and he longed to spend it in the bars,\r\ndrinking with his friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of\r\nglasses. He got out the Delacour correspondence and passed out of the\r\noffice. He hoped Mr Alleyne would not discover that the last two\r\nletters were missing.\r\n\r\nThe moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to Mr Alleyne\xe2\x80\x99s room. Miss\r\nDelacour was a middle-aged woman of Jewish appearance. Mr Alleyne was\r\nsaid to be sweet on her or on her money. She came to the office often\r\nand stayed a long time when she came. She was sitting beside his desk\r\nnow in an aroma of perfumes, smoothing the handle of her umbrella and\r\nnodding the great black feather in her hat. Mr Alleyne had swivelled\r\nhis chair round to face her and thrown his right foot jauntily upon his\r\nleft knee. The man put the correspondence on the desk and bowed\r\nrespectfully but neither Mr Alleyne nor Miss Delacour took any notice\r\nof his bow. Mr Alleyne tapped a finger on the correspondence and then\r\nflicked it towards him as if to say: _\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right: you can go.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nThe man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his desk. He\r\nstared intently at the incomplete phrase: _In no case shall the said\r\nBernard Bodley be_ ... and thought how strange it was that the last\r\nthree words began with the same letter. The chief clerk began to hurry\r\nMiss Parker, saying she would never have the letters typed in time for\r\npost. The man listened to the clicking of the machine for a few minutes\r\nand then set to work to finish his copy. But his head was not clear and\r\nhis mind wandered away to the glare and rattle of the public-house. It\r\nwas a night for hot punches. He struggled on with his copy, but when\r\nthe clock struck five he had still fourteen pages to write. Blast it!\r\nHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t finish it in time. He longed to execrate aloud, to bring\r\nhis fist down on something violently. He was so enraged that he wrote\r\n_Bernard Bernard_ instead of _Bernard Bodley_ and had to begin again on\r\na clean sheet.\r\n\r\nHe felt strong enough to clear out the whole office singlehanded. His\r\nbody ached to do something, to rush out and revel in violence. All the\r\nindignities of his life enraged him.... Could he ask the cashier\r\nprivately for an advance? No, the cashier was no good, no damn good: he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give an advance.... He knew where he would meet the boys:\r\nLeonard and O\xe2\x80\x99Halloran and Nosey Flynn. The barometer of his emotional\r\nnature was set for a spell of riot.\r\n\r\nHis imagination had so abstracted him that his name was called twice\r\nbefore he answered. Mr Alleyne and Miss Delacour were standing outside\r\nthe counter and all the clerks had turned round in anticipation of\r\nsomething. The man got up from his desk. Mr Alleyne began a tirade of\r\nabuse, saying that two letters were missing. The man answered that he\r\nknew nothing about them, that he had made a faithful copy. The tirade\r\ncontinued: it was so bitter and violent that the man could hardly\r\nrestrain his fist from descending upon the head of the manikin before\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about any other two letters,\xe2\x80\x9d he said stupidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You\xe2\x80\x94know\xe2\x80\x94nothing_. Of course you know nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Alleyne.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, glancing first for approval to the lady beside\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you take me for a fool? Do you think me an utter fool?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man glanced from the lady\xe2\x80\x99s face to the little egg-shaped head and\r\nback again; and, almost before he was aware of it, his tongue had found\r\na felicitous moment:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question to put to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause in the very breathing of the clerks. Everyone was\r\nastounded (the author of the witticism no less than his neighbours) and\r\nMiss Delacour, who was a stout amiable person, began to smile broadly.\r\nMr Alleyne flushed to the hue of a wild rose and his mouth twitched\r\nwith a dwarf\xe2\x80\x99s passion. He shook his fist in the man\xe2\x80\x99s face till it\r\nseemed to vibrate like the knob of some electric machine:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou impertinent ruffian! You impertinent ruffian! I\xe2\x80\x99ll make short work\r\nof you! Wait till you see! You\xe2\x80\x99ll apologise to me for your impertinence\r\nor you\xe2\x80\x99ll quit the office instanter! You\xe2\x80\x99ll quit this, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you,\r\nor you\xe2\x80\x99ll apologise to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stood in a doorway opposite the office watching to see if the\r\ncashier would come out alone. All the clerks passed out and finally the\r\ncashier came out with the chief clerk. It was no use trying to say a\r\nword to him when he was with the chief clerk. The man felt that his\r\nposition was bad enough. He had been obliged to offer an abject apology\r\nto Mr Alleyne for his impertinence but he knew what a hornet\xe2\x80\x99s nest the\r\noffice would be for him. He could remember the way in which Mr Alleyne\r\nhad hounded little Peake out of the office in order to make room for\r\nhis own nephew. He felt savage and thirsty and revengeful, annoyed with\r\nhimself and with everyone else. Mr Alleyne would never give him an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s rest; his life would be a hell to him. He had made a proper fool\r\nof himself this time. Could he not keep his tongue in his cheek? But\r\nthey had never pulled together from the first, he and Mr Alleyne, ever\r\nsince the day Mr Alleyne had overheard him mimicking his North of\r\nIreland accent to amuse Higgins and Miss Parker: that had been the\r\nbeginning of it. He might have tried Higgins for the money, but sure\r\nHiggins never had anything for himself. A man with two establishments\r\nto keep up, of course he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t....\r\n\r\nHe felt his great body again aching for the comfort of the\r\npublic-house. The fog had begun to chill him and he wondered could he\r\ntouch Pat in O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s. He could not touch him for more than a bob\xe2\x80\x94and\r\na bob was no use. Yet he must get money somewhere or other: he had\r\nspent his last penny for the g.p. and soon it would be too late for\r\ngetting money anywhere. Suddenly, as he was fingering his watch-chain,\r\nhe thought of Terry Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s pawn-office in Fleet Street. That was the\r\ndart! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he think of it sooner?\r\n\r\nHe went through the narrow alley of Temple Bar quickly, muttering to\r\nhimself that they could all go to hell because he was going to have a\r\ngood night of it. The clerk in Terry Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s said _A crown!_ but the\r\nconsignor held out for six shillings; and in the end the six shillings\r\nwas allowed him literally. He came out of the pawn-office joyfully,\r\nmaking a little cylinder, of the coins between his thumb and fingers.\r\nIn Westmoreland Street the footpaths were crowded with young men and\r\nwomen returning from business and ragged urchins ran here and there\r\nyelling out the names of the evening editions. The man passed through\r\nthe crowd, looking on the spectacle generally with proud satisfaction\r\nand staring masterfully at the office-girls. His head was full of the\r\nnoises of tram-gongs and swishing trolleys and his nose already sniffed\r\nthe curling fumes of punch. As he walked on he preconsidered the terms\r\nin which he would narrate the incident to the boys:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, I just looked at him\xe2\x80\x94coolly, you know, and looked at her. Then I\r\nlooked back at him again\xe2\x80\x94taking my time, you know. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question to put to me,\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNosey Flynn was sitting up in his usual corner of Davy Byrne\xe2\x80\x99s and,\r\nwhen he heard the story, he stood Farrington a half-one, saying it was\r\nas smart a thing as ever he heard. Farrington stood a drink in his\r\nturn. After a while O\xe2\x80\x99Halloran and Paddy Leonard came in and the story\r\nwas repeated to them. O\xe2\x80\x99Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round\r\nand told the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he\r\nwas in Callan\xe2\x80\x99s of Fownes\xe2\x80\x99s Street; but, as the retort was after the\r\nmanner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that\r\nit was not as clever as Farrington\xe2\x80\x99s retort. At this Farrington told\r\nthe boys to polish off that and have another.\r\n\r\nJust as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins!\r\nOf course he had to join in with the others. The men asked him to give\r\nhis version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of\r\nfive small hot whiskies was very exhilarating. Everyone roared laughing\r\nwhen he showed the way in which Mr Alleyne shook his fist in\r\nFarrington\xe2\x80\x99s face. Then he imitated Farrington, saying, _\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here was\r\nmy nabs, as cool as you please,\xe2\x80\x9d_ while Farrington looked at the\r\ncompany out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth\r\nstray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip.\r\n\r\nWhen that round was over there was a pause. O\xe2\x80\x99Halloran had money but\r\nneither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left\r\nthe shop somewhat regretfully. At the corner of Duke Street Higgins and\r\nNosey Flynn bevelled off to the left while the other three turned back\r\ntowards the city. Rain was drizzling down on the cold streets and, when\r\nthey reached the Ballast Office, Farrington suggested the Scotch House.\r\nThe bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and glasses.\r\nThe three men pushed past the whining match-sellers at the door and\r\nformed a little party at the corner of the counter. They began to\r\nexchange stories. Leonard introduced them to a young fellow named\r\nWeathers who was performing at the Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout\r\n_artiste_. Farrington stood a drink all round. Weathers said he would\r\ntake a small Irish and Apollinaris. Farrington, who had definite\r\nnotions of what was what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris\r\ntoo; but the boys told Tim to make theirs hot. The talk became\r\ntheatrical. O\xe2\x80\x99Halloran stood a round and then Farrington stood another\r\nround, Weathers protesting that the hospitality was too Irish. He\r\npromised to get them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some\r\nnice girls. O\xe2\x80\x99Halloran said that he and Leonard would go, but that\r\nFarrington wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go because he was a married man; and Farrington\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheavy dirty eyes leered at the company in token that he understood he\r\nwas being chaffed. Weathers made them all have just one little tincture\r\nat his expense and promised to meet them later on at Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nPoolbeg Street.\r\n\r\nWhen the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s. They went\r\ninto the parlour at the back and O\xe2\x80\x99Halloran ordered small hot specials\r\nall round. They were all beginning to feel mellow. Farrington was just\r\nstanding another round when Weathers came back. Much to Farrington\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrelief he drank a glass of bitter this time. Funds were getting low but\r\nthey had enough to keep them going. Presently two young women with big\r\nhats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a table close\r\nby. Weathers saluted them and told the company that they were out of\r\nthe Tivoli. Farrington\xe2\x80\x99s eyes wandered at every moment in the direction\r\nof one of the young women. There was something striking in her\r\nappearance. An immense scarf of peacock-blue muslin was wound round her\r\nhat and knotted in a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright\r\nyellow gloves, reaching to the elbow. Farrington gazed admiringly at\r\nthe plump arm which she moved very often and with much grace; and when,\r\nafter a little time, she answered his gaze he admired still more her\r\nlarge dark brown eyes. The oblique staring expression in them\r\nfascinated him. She glanced at him once or twice and, when the party\r\nwas leaving the room, she brushed against his chair and said _\xe2\x80\x9cO,\r\npardon!\xe2\x80\x9d_ in a London accent. He watched her leave the room in the hope\r\nthat she would look back at him, but he was disappointed. He cursed his\r\nwant of money and cursed all the rounds he had stood, particularly all\r\nthe whiskies and Apollinaris which he had stood to Weathers. If there\r\nwas one thing that he hated it was a sponge. He was so angry that he\r\nlost count of the conversation of his friends.\r\n\r\nWhen Paddy Leonard called him he found that they were talking about\r\nfeats of strength. Weathers was showing his biceps muscle to the\r\ncompany and boasting so much that the other two had called on\r\nFarrington to uphold the national honour. Farrington pulled up his\r\nsleeve accordingly and showed his biceps muscle to the company. The two\r\narms were examined and compared and finally it was agreed to have a\r\ntrial of strength. The table was cleared and the two men rested their\r\nelbows on it, clasping hands. When Paddy Leonard said _\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d_ each was\r\nto try to bring down the other\xe2\x80\x99s hand on to the table. Farrington\r\nlooked very serious and determined.\r\n\r\nThe trial began. After about thirty seconds Weathers brought his\r\nopponent\xe2\x80\x99s hand slowly down on to the table. Farrington\xe2\x80\x99s dark\r\nwine-coloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation at\r\nhaving been defeated by such a stripling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not to put the weight of your body behind it. Play fair,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s not playing fair?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on again. The two best out of three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trial began again. The veins stood out on Farrington\xe2\x80\x99s forehead,\r\nand the pallor of Weathers\xe2\x80\x99 complexion changed to peony. Their hands\r\nand arms trembled under the stress. After a long struggle Weathers\r\nagain brought his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s hand slowly on to the table. There was a\r\nmurmur of applause from the spectators. The curate, who was standing\r\nbeside the table, nodded his red head towards the victor and said with\r\nstupid familiarity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that\xe2\x80\x99s the knack!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell do you know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Farrington fiercely, turning\r\non the man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you put in your gab for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSh, sh!\xe2\x80\x9d said O\xe2\x80\x99Halloran, observing the violent expression of\r\nFarrington\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cPony up, boys. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have just one little smahan\r\nmore and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nA very sullen-faced man stood at the corner of O\xe2\x80\x99Connell Bridge waiting\r\nfor the little Sandymount tram to take him home. He was full of\r\nsmouldering anger and revengefulness. He felt humiliated and\r\ndiscontented; he did not even feel drunk; and he had only twopence in\r\nhis pocket. He cursed everything. He had done for himself in the\r\noffice, pawned his watch, spent all his money; and he had not even got\r\ndrunk. He began to feel thirsty again and he longed to be back again in\r\nthe hot reeking public-house. He had lost his reputation as a strong\r\nman, having been defeated twice by a mere boy. His heart swelled with\r\nfury and, when he thought of the woman in the big hat who had brushed\r\nagainst him and said _Pardon!_ his fury nearly choked him.\r\n\r\nHis tram let him down at Shelbourne Road and he steered his great body\r\nalong in the shadow of the wall of the barracks. He loathed returning\r\nto his home. When he went in by the side-door he found the kitchen\r\nempty and the kitchen fire nearly out. He bawled upstairs:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAda! Ada!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife was a little sharp-faced woman who bullied her husband when he\r\nwas sober and was bullied by him when he was drunk. They had five\r\nchildren. A little boy came running down the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, peering through the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe, pa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you? Charlie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, pa. Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s out at the chapel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right.... Did she think of leaving any dinner for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, pa. I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLight the lamp. What do you mean by having the place in darkness? Are\r\nthe other children in bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man sat down heavily on one of the chairs while the little boy lit\r\nthe lamp. He began to mimic his son\xe2\x80\x99s flat accent, saying half to\r\nhimself: _\xe2\x80\x9cAt the chapel. At the chapel, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d_ When the lamp\r\nwas lit he banged his fist on the table and shouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s for my dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going ... to cook it, pa,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little boy.\r\n\r\nThe man jumped up furiously and pointed to the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn that fire! You let the fire out! By God, I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to do that\r\nagain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took a step to the door and seized the walking-stick which was\r\nstanding behind it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to let the fire out!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rolling up his sleeve in\r\norder to give his arm free play.\r\n\r\nThe little boy cried _\xe2\x80\x9cO, pa!\xe2\x80\x9d_ and ran whimpering round the table, but\r\nthe man followed him and caught him by the coat. The little boy looked\r\nabout him wildly but, seeing no way of escape, fell upon his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you\xe2\x80\x99ll let the fire out the next time!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man striking at\r\nhim vigorously with the stick. \xe2\x80\x9cTake that, you little whelp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his thigh. He clasped\r\nhis hands together in the air and his voice shook with fright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, pa!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t beat me, pa! And I\xe2\x80\x99ll ... I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a _Hail\r\nMary_ for you.... I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a _Hail Mary_ for you, pa, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t beat\r\nme.... I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a _Hail Mary_....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe matron had given her leave to go out as soon as the women\xe2\x80\x99s tea was\r\nover and Maria looked forward to her evening out. The kitchen was spick\r\nand span: the cook said you could see yourself in the big copper\r\nboilers. The fire was nice and bright and on one of the side-tables\r\nwere four very big barmbracks. These barmbracks seemed uncut; but if\r\nyou went closer you would see that they had been cut into long thick\r\neven slices and were ready to be handed round at tea. Maria had cut\r\nthem herself.\r\n\r\nMaria was a very, very small person indeed but she had a very long nose\r\nand a very long chin. She talked a little through her nose, always\r\nsoothingly: _\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d_ and _\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d_ She was always sent\r\nfor when the women quarrelled over their tubs and always succeeded in\r\nmaking peace. One day the matron had said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaria, you are a veritable peace-maker!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the sub-matron and two of the Board ladies had heard the\r\ncompliment. And Ginger Mooney was always saying what she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do to\r\nthe dummy who had charge of the irons if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for Maria. Everyone\r\nwas so fond of Maria.\r\n\r\nThe women would have their tea at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock and she would be able to\r\nget away before seven. From Ballsbridge to the Pillar, twenty minutes;\r\nfrom the Pillar to Drumcondra, twenty minutes; and twenty minutes to\r\nbuy the things. She would be there before eight. She took out her purse\r\nwith the silver clasps and read again the words _A Present from\r\nBelfast_. She was very fond of that purse because Joe had brought it to\r\nher five years before when he and Alphy had gone to Belfast on a\r\nWhit-Monday trip. In the purse were two half-crowns and some coppers.\r\nShe would have five shillings clear after paying tram fare. What a nice\r\nevening they would have, all the children singing! Only she hoped that\r\nJoe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come in drunk. He was so different when he took any drink.\r\n\r\nOften he had wanted her to go and live with them; but she would have\r\nfelt herself in the way (though Joe\xe2\x80\x99s wife was ever so nice with her)\r\nand she had become accustomed to the life of the laundry. Joe was a\r\ngood fellow. She had nursed him and Alphy too; and Joe used often say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma is mamma but Maria is my proper mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter the break-up at home the boys had got her that position in the\r\n_Dublin by Lamplight_ laundry, and she liked it. She used to have such\r\na bad opinion of Protestants but now she thought they were very nice\r\npeople, a little quiet and serious, but still very nice people to live\r\nwith. Then she had her plants in the conservatory and she liked looking\r\nafter them. She had lovely ferns and wax-plants and, whenever anyone\r\ncame to visit her, she always gave the visitor one or two slips from\r\nher conservatory. There was one thing she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like and that was the\r\ntracts on the walks; but the matron was such a nice person to deal\r\nwith, so genteel.\r\n\r\nWhen the cook told her everything was ready she went into the women\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom and began to pull the big bell. In a few minutes the women began\r\nto come in by twos and threes, wiping their steaming hands in their\r\npetticoats and pulling down the sleeves of their blouses over their red\r\nsteaming arms. They settled down before their huge mugs which the cook\r\nand the dummy filled up with hot tea, already mixed with milk and sugar\r\nin huge tin cans. Maria superintended the distribution of the barmbrack\r\nand saw that every woman got her four slices. There was a great deal of\r\nlaughing and joking during the meal. Lizzie Fleming said Maria was sure\r\nto get the ring and, though Fleming had said that for so many Hallow\r\nEves, Maria had to laugh and say she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any ring or man\r\neither; and when she laughed her grey-green eyes sparkled with\r\ndisappointed shyness and the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her\r\nchin. Then Ginger Mooney lifted up her mug of tea and proposed Maria\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhealth while all the other women clattered with their mugs on the\r\ntable, and said she was sorry she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a sup of porter to drink it\r\nin. And Maria laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip\r\nof her chin and till her minute body nearly shook itself asunder\r\nbecause she knew that Mooney meant well though, of course, she had the\r\nnotions of a common woman.\r\n\r\nBut wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Maria glad when the women had finished their tea and the\r\ncook and the dummy had begun to clear away the tea-things! She went\r\ninto her little bedroom and, remembering that the next morning was a\r\nmass morning, changed the hand of the alarm from seven to six. Then she\r\ntook off her working skirt and her house-boots and laid her best skirt\r\nout on the bed and her tiny dress-boots beside the foot of the bed. She\r\nchanged her blouse too and, as she stood before the mirror, she thought\r\nof how she used to dress for mass on Sunday morning when she was a\r\nyoung girl; and she looked with quaint affection at the diminutive body\r\nwhich she had so often adorned. In spite of its years she found it a\r\nnice tidy little body.\r\n\r\nWhen she got outside the streets were shining with rain and she was\r\nglad of her old brown waterproof. The tram was full and she had to sit\r\non the little stool at the end of the car, facing all the people, with\r\nher toes barely touching the floor. She arranged in her mind all she\r\nwas going to do and thought how much better it was to be independent\r\nand to have your own money in your pocket. She hoped they would have a\r\nnice evening. She was sure they would but she could not help thinking\r\nwhat a pity it was Alphy and Joe were not speaking. They were always\r\nfalling out now but when they were boys together they used to be the\r\nbest of friends: but such was life.\r\n\r\nShe got out of her tram at the Pillar and ferreted her way quickly\r\namong the crowds. She went into Downes\xe2\x80\x99s cake-shop but the shop was so\r\nfull of people that it was a long time before she could get herself\r\nattended to. She bought a dozen of mixed penny cakes, and at last came\r\nout of the shop laden with a big bag. Then she thought what else would\r\nshe buy: she wanted to buy something really nice. They would be sure to\r\nhave plenty of apples and nuts. It was hard to know what to buy and all\r\nshe could think of was cake. She decided to buy some plumcake but\r\nDownes\xe2\x80\x99s plumcake had not enough almond icing on top of it so she went\r\nover to a shop in Henry Street. Here she was a long time in suiting\r\nherself and the stylish young lady behind the counter, who was\r\nevidently a little annoyed by her, asked her was it wedding-cake she\r\nwanted to buy. That made Maria blush and smile at the young lady; but\r\nthe young lady took it all very seriously and finally cut a thick slice\r\nof plumcake, parcelled it up and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo-and-four, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought she would have to stand in the Drumcondra tram because none\r\nof the young men seemed to notice her but an elderly gentleman made\r\nroom for her. He was a stout gentleman and he wore a brown hard hat; he\r\nhad a square red face and a greyish moustache. Maria thought he was a\r\ncolonel-looking gentleman and she reflected how much more polite he was\r\nthan the young men who simply stared straight before them. The\r\ngentleman began to chat with her about Hallow Eve and the rainy\r\nweather. He supposed the bag was full of good things for the little\r\nones and said it was only right that the youngsters should enjoy\r\nthemselves while they were young. Maria agreed with him and favoured\r\nhim with demure nods and hems. He was very nice with her, and when she\r\nwas getting out at the Canal Bridge she thanked him and bowed, and he\r\nbowed to her and raised his hat and smiled agreeably, and while she was\r\ngoing up along the terrace, bending her tiny head under the rain, she\r\nthought how easy it was to know a gentleman even when he has a drop\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nEverybody said: _\xe2\x80\x9cO, here\xe2\x80\x99s Maria!\xe2\x80\x9d_ when she came to Joe\xe2\x80\x99s house. Joe\r\nwas there, having come home from business, and all the children had\r\ntheir Sunday dresses on. There were two big girls in from next door and\r\ngames were going on. Maria gave the bag of cakes to the eldest boy,\r\nAlphy, to divide and Mrs Donnelly said it was too good of her to bring\r\nsuch a big bag of cakes and made all the children say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, Maria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Maria said she had brought something special for papa and mamma,\r\nsomething they would be sure to like, and she began to look for her\r\nplumcake. She tried in Downes\xe2\x80\x99s bag and then in the pockets of her\r\nwaterproof and then on the hallstand but nowhere could she find it.\r\nThen she asked all the children had any of them eaten it\xe2\x80\x94by mistake, of\r\ncourse\xe2\x80\x94but the children all said no and looked as if they did not like\r\nto eat cakes if they were to be accused of stealing. Everybody had a\r\nsolution for the mystery and Mrs Donnelly said it was plain that Maria\r\nhad left it behind her in the tram. Maria, remembering how confused the\r\ngentleman with the greyish moustache had made her, coloured with shame\r\nand vexation and disappointment. At the thought of the failure of her\r\nlittle surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away for\r\nnothing she nearly cried outright.\r\n\r\nBut Joe said it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter and made her sit down by the fire. He was\r\nvery nice with her. He told her all that went on in his office,\r\nrepeating for her a smart answer which he had made to the manager.\r\nMaria did not understand why Joe laughed so much over the answer he had\r\nmade but she said that the manager must have been a very overbearing\r\nperson to deal with. Joe said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad when you knew how to\r\ntake him, that he was a decent sort so long as you didn\xe2\x80\x99t rub him the\r\nwrong way. Mrs Donnelly played the piano for the children and they\r\ndanced and sang. Then the two next-door girls handed round the nuts.\r\nNobody could find the nutcrackers and Joe was nearly getting cross over\r\nit and asked how did they expect Maria to crack nuts without a\r\nnutcracker. But Maria said she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like nuts and that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nto bother about her. Then Joe asked would she take a bottle of stout\r\nand Mrs Donnelly said there was port wine too in the house if she would\r\nprefer that. Maria said she would rather they didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask her to take\r\nanything: but Joe insisted.\r\n\r\nSo Maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking over old\r\ntimes and Maria thought she would put in a good word for Alphy. But Joe\r\ncried that God might strike him stone dead if ever he spoke a word to\r\nhis brother again and Maria said she was sorry she had mentioned the\r\nmatter. Mrs Donnelly told her husband it was a great shame for him to\r\nspeak that way of his own flesh and blood but Joe said that Alphy was\r\nno brother of his and there was nearly being a row on the head of it.\r\nBut Joe said he would not lose his temper on account of the night it\r\nwas and asked his wife to open some more stout. The two next-door girls\r\nhad arranged some Hallow Eve games and soon everything was merry again.\r\nMaria was delighted to see the children so merry and Joe and his wife\r\nin such good spirits. The next-door girls put some saucers on the table\r\nand then led the children up to the table, blindfold. One got the\r\nprayer-book and the other three got the water; and when one of the\r\nnext-door girls got the ring Mrs Donnelly shook her finger at the\r\nblushing girl as much as to say: _O, I know all about it!_ They\r\ninsisted then on blindfolding Maria and leading her up to the table to\r\nsee what she would get; and, while they were putting on the bandage,\r\nMaria laughed and laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the\r\ntip of her chin.\r\n\r\nThey led her up to the table amid laughing and joking and she put her\r\nhand out in the air as she was told to do. She moved her hand about\r\nhere and there in the air and descended on one of the saucers. She felt\r\na soft wet substance with her fingers and was surprised that nobody\r\nspoke or took off her bandage. There was a pause for a few seconds; and\r\nthen a great deal of scuffling and whispering. Somebody said something\r\nabout the garden, and at last Mrs Donnelly said something very cross to\r\none of the next-door girls and told her to throw it out at once: that\r\nwas no play. Maria understood that it was wrong that time and so she\r\nhad to do it over again: and this time she got the prayer-book.\r\n\r\nAfter that Mrs Donnelly played Miss McCloud\xe2\x80\x99s Reel for the children and\r\nJoe made Maria take a glass of wine. Soon they were all quite merry\r\nagain and Mrs Donnelly said Maria would enter a convent before the year\r\nwas out because she had got the prayer-book. Maria had never seen Joe\r\nso nice to her as he was that night, so full of pleasant talk and\r\nreminiscences. She said they were all very good to her.\r\n\r\nAt last the children grew tired and sleepy and Joe asked Maria would\r\nshe not sing some little song before she went, one of the old songs.\r\nMrs Donnelly said _\xe2\x80\x9cDo, please, Maria!\xe2\x80\x9d_ and so Maria had to get up and\r\nstand beside the piano. Mrs Donnelly bade the children be quiet and\r\nlisten to Maria\xe2\x80\x99s song. Then she played the prelude and said _\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\nMaria!\xe2\x80\x9d_ and Maria, blushing very much began to sing in a tiny\r\nquavering voice. She sang _I Dreamt that I Dwelt_, and when she came to\r\nthe second verse she sang again:\r\n\r\n     _I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls\r\n         With vassals and serfs at my side\r\n     And of all who assembled within those walls\r\n         That I was the hope and the pride.\r\n     I had riches too great to count, could boast\r\n         Of a high ancestral name,\r\n     But I also dreamt, which pleased me most,\r\n         That you loved me still the same._\r\n\r\nBut no one tried to show her her mistake; and when she had ended her\r\nsong Joe was very much moved. He said that there was no time like the\r\nlong ago and no music for him like poor old Balfe, whatever other\r\npeople might say; and his eyes filled up so much with tears that he\r\ncould not find what he was looking for and in the end he had to ask his\r\nwife to tell him where the corkscrew was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PAINFUL CASE\r\n\r\n\r\nMr James Duffy lived in Chapelizod because he wished to live as far as\r\npossible from the city of which he was a citizen and because he found\r\nall the other suburbs of Dublin mean, modern and pretentious. He lived\r\nin an old sombre house and from his windows he could look into the\r\ndisused distillery or upwards along the shallow river on which Dublin\r\nis built. The lofty walls of his uncarpeted room were free from\r\npictures. He had himself bought every article of furniture in the room:\r\na black iron bedstead, an iron washstand, four cane chairs, a\r\nclothes-rack, a coal-scuttle, a fender and irons and a square table on\r\nwhich lay a double desk. A bookcase had been made in an alcove by means\r\nof shelves of white wood. The bed was clothed with white bedclothes and\r\na black and scarlet rug covered the foot. A little hand-mirror hung\r\nabove the washstand and during the day a white-shaded lamp stood as the\r\nsole ornament of the mantelpiece. The books on the white wooden shelves\r\nwere arranged from below upwards according to bulk. A complete\r\nWordsworth stood at one end of the lowest shelf and a copy of the\r\n_Maynooth Catechism_, sewn into the cloth cover of a notebook, stood at\r\none end of the top shelf. Writing materials were always on the desk. In\r\nthe desk lay a manuscript translation of Hauptmann\xe2\x80\x99s _Michael Kramer_,\r\nthe stage directions of which were written in purple ink, and a little\r\nsheaf of papers held together by a brass pin. In these sheets a\r\nsentence was inscribed from time to time and, in an ironical moment,\r\nthe headline of an advertisement for _Bile Beans_ had been pasted on to\r\nthe first sheet. On lifting the lid of the desk a faint fragrance\r\nescaped\xe2\x80\x94the fragrance of new cedarwood pencils or of a bottle of gum or\r\nof an overripe apple which might have been left there and forgotten.\r\n\r\nMr Duffy abhorred anything which betokened physical or mental disorder.\r\nA medi\xc3\xa6val doctor would have called him saturnine. His face, which\r\ncarried the entire tale of his years, was of the brown tint of Dublin\r\nstreets. On his long and rather large head grew dry black hair and a\r\ntawny moustache did not quite cover an unamiable mouth. His cheekbones\r\nalso gave his face a harsh character; but there was no harshness in the\r\neyes which, looking at the world from under their tawny eyebrows, gave\r\nthe impression of a man ever alert to greet a redeeming instinct in\r\nothers but often disappointed. He lived at a little distance from his\r\nbody, regarding his own acts with doubtful side-glances. He had an odd\r\nautobiographical habit which led him to compose in his mind from time\r\nto time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the\r\nthird person and a predicate in the past tense. He never gave alms to\r\nbeggars and walked firmly, carrying a stout hazel.\r\n\r\nHe had been for many years cashier of a private bank in Baggot Street.\r\nEvery morning he came in from Chapelizod by tram. At midday he went to\r\nDan Burke\xe2\x80\x99s and took his lunch\xe2\x80\x94a bottle of lager beer and a small\r\ntrayful of arrowroot biscuits. At four o\xe2\x80\x99clock he was set free. He\r\ndined in an eating-house in George\xe2\x80\x99s Street where he felt himself safe\r\nfrom the society of Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s gilded youth and where there was a certain\r\nplain honesty in the bill of fare. His evenings were spent either\r\nbefore his landlady\xe2\x80\x99s piano or roaming about the outskirts of the city.\r\nHis liking for Mozart\xe2\x80\x99s music brought him sometimes to an opera or a\r\nconcert: these were the only dissipations of his life.\r\n\r\nHe had neither companions nor friends, church nor creed. He lived his\r\nspiritual life without any communion with others, visiting his\r\nrelatives at Christmas and escorting them to the cemetery when they\r\ndied. He performed these two social duties for old dignity\xe2\x80\x99s sake but\r\nconceded nothing further to the conventions which regulate the civic\r\nlife. He allowed himself to think that in certain circumstances he\r\nwould rob his bank but, as these circumstances never arose, his life\r\nrolled out evenly\xe2\x80\x94an adventureless tale.\r\n\r\nOne evening he found himself sitting beside two ladies in the Rotunda.\r\nThe house, thinly peopled and silent, gave distressing prophecy of\r\nfailure. The lady who sat next him looked round at the deserted house\r\nonce or twice and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity there is such a poor house tonight! It\xe2\x80\x99s so hard on people\r\nto have to sing to empty benches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took the remark as an invitation to talk. He was surprised that she\r\nseemed so little awkward. While they talked he tried to fix her\r\npermanently in his memory. When he learned that the young girl beside\r\nher was her daughter he judged her to be a year or so younger than\r\nhimself. Her face, which must have been handsome, had remained\r\nintelligent. It was an oval face with strongly marked features. The\r\neyes were very dark blue and steady. Their gaze began with a defiant\r\nnote but was confused by what seemed a deliberate swoon of the pupil\r\ninto the iris, revealing for an instant a temperament of great\r\nsensibility. The pupil reasserted itself quickly, this half-disclosed\r\nnature fell again under the reign of prudence, and her astrakhan\r\njacket, moulding a bosom of a certain fullness, struck the note of\r\ndefiance more definitely.\r\n\r\nHe met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in Earlsfort\r\nTerrace and seized the moments when her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s attention was\r\ndiverted to become intimate. She alluded once or twice to her husband\r\nbut her tone was not such as to make the allusion a warning. Her name\r\nwas Mrs Sinico. Her husband\xe2\x80\x99s great-great-grandfather had come from\r\nLeghorn. Her husband was captain of a mercantile boat plying between\r\nDublin and Holland; and they had one child.\r\n\r\nMeeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an\r\nappointment. She came. This was the first of many meetings; they met\r\nalways in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks\r\ntogether. Mr Duffy, however, had a distaste for underhand ways and,\r\nfinding that they were compelled to meet stealthily, he forced her to\r\nask him to her house. Captain Sinico encouraged his visits, thinking\r\nthat his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hand was in question. He had dismissed his wife so\r\nsincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that\r\nanyone else would take an interest in her. As the husband was often\r\naway and the daughter out giving music lessons Mr Duffy had many\r\nopportunities of enjoying the lady\xe2\x80\x99s society. Neither he nor she had\r\nhad any such adventure before and neither was conscious of any\r\nincongruity. Little by little he entangled his thoughts with hers. He\r\nlent her books, provided her with ideas, shared his intellectual life\r\nwith her. She listened to all.\r\n\r\nSometimes in return for his theories she gave out some fact of her own\r\nlife. With almost maternal solicitude she urged him to let his nature\r\nopen to the full: she became his confessor. He told her that for some\r\ntime he had assisted at the meetings of an Irish Socialist Party where\r\nhe had felt himself a unique figure amidst a score of sober workmen in\r\na garret lit by an inefficient oil-lamp. When the party had divided\r\ninto three sections, each under its own leader and in its own garret,\r\nhe had discontinued his attendances. The workmen\xe2\x80\x99s discussions, he\r\nsaid, were too timorous; the interest they took in the question of\r\nwages was inordinate. He felt that they were hard-featured realists and\r\nthat they resented an exactitude which was the produce of a leisure not\r\nwithin their reach. No social revolution, he told her, would be likely\r\nto strike Dublin for some centuries.\r\n\r\nShe asked him why did he not write out his thoughts. For what, he asked\r\nher, with careful scorn. To compete with phrasemongers, incapable of\r\nthinking consecutively for sixty seconds? To submit himself to the\r\ncriticisms of an obtuse middle class which entrusted its morality to\r\npolicemen and its fine arts to impresarios?\r\n\r\nHe went often to her little cottage outside Dublin; often they spent\r\ntheir evenings alone. Little by little, as their thoughts entangled,\r\nthey spoke of subjects less remote. Her companionship was like a warm\r\nsoil about an exotic. Many times she allowed the dark to fall upon\r\nthem, refraining from lighting the lamp. The dark discreet room, their\r\nisolation, the music that still vibrated in their ears united them.\r\nThis union exalted him, wore away the rough edges of his character,\r\nemotionalised his mental life. Sometimes he caught himself listening to\r\nthe sound of his own voice. He thought that in her eyes he would ascend\r\nto an angelical stature; and, as he attached the fervent nature of his\r\ncompanion more and more closely to him, he heard the strange impersonal\r\nvoice which he recognised as his own, insisting on the soul\xe2\x80\x99s incurable\r\nloneliness. We cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own. The end\r\nof these discourses was that one night during which she had shown every\r\nsign of unusual excitement, Mrs Sinico caught up his hand passionately\r\nand pressed it to her cheek.\r\n\r\nMr Duffy was very much surprised. Her interpretation of his words\r\ndisillusioned him. He did not visit her for a week, then he wrote to\r\nher asking her to meet him. As he did not wish their last interview to\r\nbe troubled by the influence of their ruined confessional they met in a\r\nlittle cakeshop near the Parkgate. It was cold autumn weather but in\r\nspite of the cold they wandered up and down the roads of the Park for\r\nnearly three hours. They agreed to break off their intercourse: every\r\nbond, he said, is a bond to sorrow. When they came out of the Park they\r\nwalked in silence towards the tram; but here she began to tremble so\r\nviolently that, fearing another collapse on her part, he bade her\r\ngood-bye quickly and left her. A few days later he received a parcel\r\ncontaining his books and music.\r\n\r\nFour years passed. Mr Duffy returned to his even way of life. His room\r\nstill bore witness of the orderliness of his mind. Some new pieces of\r\nmusic encumbered the music-stand in the lower room and on his shelves\r\nstood two volumes by Nietzsche: _Thus Spake Zarathustra_ and _The Gay\r\nScience_. He wrote seldom in the sheaf of papers which lay in his desk.\r\nOne of his sentences, written two months after his last interview with\r\nMrs Sinico, read: Love between man and man is impossible because there\r\nmust not be sexual intercourse and friendship between man and woman is\r\nimpossible because there must be sexual intercourse. He kept away from\r\nconcerts lest he should meet her. His father died; the junior partner\r\nof the bank retired. And still every morning he went into the city by\r\ntram and every evening walked home from the city after having dined\r\nmoderately in George\xe2\x80\x99s Street and read the evening paper for dessert.\r\n\r\nOne evening as he was about to put a morsel of corned beef and cabbage\r\ninto his mouth his hand stopped. His eyes fixed themselves on a\r\nparagraph in the evening paper which he had propped against the\r\nwater-carafe. He replaced the morsel of food on his plate and read the\r\nparagraph attentively. Then he drank a glass of water, pushed his plate\r\nto one side, doubled the paper down before him between his elbows and\r\nread the paragraph over and over again. The cabbage began to deposit a\r\ncold white grease on his plate. The girl came over to him to ask was\r\nhis dinner not properly cooked. He said it was very good and ate a few\r\nmouthfuls of it with difficulty. Then he paid his bill and went out.\r\n\r\nHe walked along quickly through the November twilight, his stout hazel\r\nstick striking the ground regularly, the fringe of the buff _Mail_\r\npeeping out of a side-pocket of his tight reefer overcoat. On the\r\nlonely road which leads from the Parkgate to Chapelizod he slackened\r\nhis pace. His stick struck the ground less emphatically and his breath,\r\nissuing irregularly, almost with a sighing sound, condensed in the\r\nwintry air. When he reached his house he went up at once to his bedroom\r\nand, taking the paper from his pocket, read the paragraph again by the\r\nfailing light of the window. He read it not aloud, but moving his lips\r\nas a priest does when he reads the prayers _Secreto_. This was the\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n     DEATH OF A LADY AT SYDNEY PARADE\r\n\r\n     A PAINFUL CASE\r\n\r\nToday at the City of Dublin Hospital the Deputy Coroner (in the absence\r\nof Mr Leverett) held an inquest on the body of Mrs Emily Sinico, aged\r\nforty-three years, who was killed at Sydney Parade Station yesterday\r\nevening. The evidence showed that the deceased lady, while attempting\r\nto cross the line, was knocked down by the engine of the ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nslow train from Kingstown, thereby sustaining injuries of the head and\r\nright side which led to her death.\r\n\r\nJames Lennon, driver of the engine, stated that he had been in the\r\nemployment of the railway company for fifteen years. On hearing the\r\nguard\xe2\x80\x99s whistle he set the train in motion and a second or two\r\nafterwards brought it to rest in response to loud cries. The train was\r\ngoing slowly.\r\n\r\nP. Dunne, railway porter, stated that as the train was about to start\r\nhe observed a woman attempting to cross the lines. He ran towards her\r\nand shouted, but, before he could reach her, she was caught by the\r\nbuffer of the engine and fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n_A juror_. \xe2\x80\x9cYou saw the lady fall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_Witness_. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPolice Sergeant Croly deposed that when he arrived he found the\r\ndeceased lying on the platform apparently dead. He had the body taken\r\nto the waiting-room pending the arrival of the ambulance.\r\n\r\nConstable 57E corroborated.\r\n\r\nDr Halpin, assistant house surgeon of the City of Dublin Hospital,\r\nstated that the deceased had two lower ribs fractured and had sustained\r\nsevere contusions of the right shoulder. The right side of the head had\r\nbeen injured in the fall. The injuries were not sufficient to have\r\ncaused death in a normal person. Death, in his opinion, had been\r\nprobably due to shock and sudden failure of the heart\xe2\x80\x99s action.\r\n\r\nMr H. B. Patterson Finlay, on behalf of the railway company, expressed\r\nhis deep regret at the accident. The company had always taken every\r\nprecaution to prevent people crossing the lines except by the bridges,\r\nboth by placing notices in every station and by the use of patent\r\nspring gates at level crossings. The deceased had been in the habit of\r\ncrossing the lines late at night from platform to platform and, in view\r\nof certain other circumstances of the case, he did not think the\r\nrailway officials were to blame.\r\n\r\nCaptain Sinico, of Leoville, Sydney Parade, husband of the deceased,\r\nalso gave evidence. He stated that the deceased was his wife. He was\r\nnot in Dublin at the time of the accident as he had arrived only that\r\nmorning from Rotterdam. They had been married for twenty-two years and\r\nhad lived happily until about two years ago when his wife began to be\r\nrather intemperate in her habits.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary Sinico said that of late her mother had been in the habit of\r\ngoing out at night to buy spirits. She, witness, had often tried to\r\nreason with her mother and had induced her to join a league. She was\r\nnot at home until an hour after the accident. The jury returned a\r\nverdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated Lennon\r\nfrom all blame.\r\n\r\nThe Deputy Coroner said it was a most painful case, and expressed great\r\nsympathy with Captain Sinico and his daughter. He urged on the railway\r\ncompany to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar\r\naccidents in the future. No blame attached to anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Duffy raised his eyes from the paper and gazed out of his window on\r\nthe cheerless evening landscape. The river lay quiet beside the empty\r\ndistillery and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the\r\nLucan road. What an end! The whole narrative of her death revolted him\r\nand it revolted him to think that he had ever spoken to her of what he\r\nheld sacred. The threadbare phrases, the inane expressions of sympathy,\r\nthe cautious words of a reporter won over to conceal the details of a\r\ncommonplace vulgar death attacked his stomach. Not merely had she\r\ndegraded herself; she had degraded him. He saw the squalid tract of her\r\nvice, miserable and malodorous. His soul\xe2\x80\x99s companion! He thought of the\r\nhobbling wretches whom he had seen carrying cans and bottles to be\r\nfilled by the barman. Just God, what an end! Evidently she had been\r\nunfit to live, without any strength of purpose, an easy prey to habits,\r\none of the wrecks on which civilisation has been reared. But that she\r\ncould have sunk so low! Was it possible he had deceived himself so\r\nutterly about her? He remembered her outburst of that night and\r\ninterpreted it in a harsher sense than he had ever done. He had no\r\ndifficulty now in approving of the course he had taken.\r\n\r\nAs the light failed and his memory began to wander he thought her hand\r\ntouched his. The shock which had first attacked his stomach was now\r\nattacking his nerves. He put on his overcoat and hat quickly and went\r\nout. The cold air met him on the threshold; it crept into the sleeves\r\nof his coat. When he came to the public-house at Chapelizod Bridge he\r\nwent in and ordered a hot punch.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor served him obsequiously but did not venture to talk.\r\nThere were five or six workingmen in the shop discussing the value of a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s estate in County Kildare. They drank at intervals from\r\ntheir huge pint tumblers and smoked, spitting often on the floor and\r\nsometimes dragging the sawdust over their spits with their heavy boots.\r\nMr Duffy sat on his stool and gazed at them, without seeing or hearing\r\nthem. After a while they went out and he called for another punch. He\r\nsat a long time over it. The shop was very quiet. The proprietor\r\nsprawled on the counter reading the _Herald_ and yawning. Now and again\r\na tram was heard swishing along the lonely road outside.\r\n\r\nAs he sat there, living over his life with her and evoking alternately\r\nthe two images in which he now conceived her, he realised that she was\r\ndead, that she had ceased to exist, that she had become a memory. He\r\nbegan to feel ill at ease. He asked himself what else could he have\r\ndone. He could not have carried on a comedy of deception with her; he\r\ncould not have lived with her openly. He had done what seemed to him\r\nbest. How was he to blame? Now that she was gone he understood how\r\nlonely her life must have been, sitting night after night alone in that\r\nroom. His life would be lonely too until he, too, died, ceased to\r\nexist, became a memory\xe2\x80\x94if anyone remembered him.\r\n\r\nIt was after nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock when he left the shop. The night was cold and\r\ngloomy. He entered the Park by the first gate and walked along under\r\nthe gaunt trees. He walked through the bleak alleys where they had\r\nwalked four years before. She seemed to be near him in the darkness. At\r\nmoments he seemed to feel her voice touch his ear, her hand touch his.\r\nHe stood still to listen. Why had he withheld life from her? Why had he\r\nsentenced her to death? He felt his moral nature falling to pieces.\r\n\r\nWhen he gained the crest of the Magazine Hill he halted and looked\r\nalong the river towards Dublin, the lights of which burned redly and\r\nhospitably in the cold night. He looked down the slope and, at the\r\nbase, in the shadow of the wall of the Park, he saw some human figures\r\nlying. Those venal and furtive loves filled him with despair. He gnawed\r\nthe rectitude of his life; he felt that he had been outcast from life\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeast. One human being had seemed to love him and he had denied her\r\nlife and happiness: he had sentenced her to ignominy, a death of shame.\r\nHe knew that the prostrate creatures down by the wall were watching him\r\nand wished him gone. No one wanted him; he was outcast from life\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeast. He turned his eyes to the grey gleaming river, winding along\r\ntowards Dublin. Beyond the river he saw a goods train winding out of\r\nKingsbridge Station, like a worm with a fiery head winding through the\r\ndarkness, obstinately and laboriously. It passed slowly out of sight;\r\nbut still he heard in his ears the laborious drone of the engine\r\nreiterating the syllables of her name.\r\n\r\nHe turned back the way he had come, the rhythm of the engine pounding\r\nin his ears. He began to doubt the reality of what memory told him. He\r\nhalted under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die away. He could not\r\nfeel her near him in the darkness nor her voice touch his ear. He\r\nwaited for some minutes listening. He could hear nothing: the night was\r\nperfectly silent. He listened again: perfectly silent. He felt that he\r\nwas alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIVY DAY IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Jack raked the cinders together with a piece of cardboard and\r\nspread them judiciously over the whitening dome of coals. When the dome\r\nwas thinly covered his face lapsed into darkness but, as he set himself\r\nto fan the fire again, his crouching shadow ascended the opposite wall\r\nand his face slowly re-emerged into light. It was an old man\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nvery bony and hairy. The moist blue eyes blinked at the fire and the\r\nmoist mouth fell open at times, munching once or twice mechanically\r\nwhen it closed. When the cinders had caught he laid the piece of\r\ncardboard against the wall, sighed and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s better now, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, a grey-haired young man, whose face was disfigured by many\r\nblotches and pimples, had just brought the tobacco for a cigarette into\r\na shapely cylinder but when spoken to he undid his handiwork\r\nmeditatively. Then he began to roll the tobacco again meditatively and\r\nafter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought decided to lick the paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Mr Tierney say when he\xe2\x80\x99d be back?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked in a husky falsetto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor put his cigarette into his mouth and began to search his\r\npockets. He took out a pack of thin pasteboard cards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a match,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, this\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\nHe selected one of the cards and read what was printed on it:\r\n\r\n     MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS\r\n\r\n     ROYAL EXCHANGE WARD\r\n\r\nMr Richard J. Tierney, P.L.G., respectfully solicits the favour of your\r\nvote and influence at the coming election in the Royal Exchange Ward.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor had been engaged by Tierney\xe2\x80\x99s agent to canvass one part of\r\nthe ward but, as the weather was inclement and his boots let in the\r\nwet, he spent a great part of the day sitting by the fire in the\r\nCommittee Room in Wicklow Street with Jack, the old caretaker. They had\r\nbeen sitting thus since the short day had grown dark. It was the sixth\r\nof October, dismal and cold out of doors.\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor tore a strip off the card and, lighting it, lit his\r\ncigarette. As he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy ivy in\r\nthe lapel of his coat. The old man watched him attentively and then,\r\ntaking up the piece of cardboard again, began to fan the fire slowly\r\nwhile his companion smoked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, continuing, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know what way to bring up\r\nchildren. Now who\xe2\x80\x99d think he\xe2\x80\x99d turn out like that! I sent him to the\r\nChristian Brothers and I done what I could for him, and there he goes\r\nboosing about. I tried to make him someway decent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replaced the cardboard wearily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly I\xe2\x80\x99m an old man now I\xe2\x80\x99d change his tune for him. I\xe2\x80\x99d take the\r\nstick to his back and beat him while I could stand over him\xe2\x80\x94as I done\r\nmany a time before. The mother, you know, she cocks him up with this\r\nand that....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what ruins children,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd little thanks you get for\r\nit, only impudence. He takes th\xe2\x80\x99upper hand of me whenever he sees I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\na sup taken. What\xe2\x80\x99s the world coming to when sons speaks that way to\r\ntheir father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat age is he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNineteen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you put him to something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, amn\xe2\x80\x99t I never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he left\r\nschool? \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t keep you,\xe2\x80\x99 I says. \xe2\x80\x98You must get a job for yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut, sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s worse whenever he gets a job; he drinks it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor shook his head in sympathy, and the old man fell silent,\r\ngazing into the fire. Someone opened the door of the room and called\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello! Is this a Freemasons\xe2\x80\x99 meeting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in the dark?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Hynes?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. What are you doing in the dark?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Hynes advancing into\r\nthe light of the fire.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, slender young man with a light brown moustache. Imminent\r\nlittle drops of rain hung at the brim of his hat and the collar of his\r\njacket-coat was turned up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, \xe2\x80\x9chow goes it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor shook his head. The old man left the hearth and, after\r\nstumbling about the room returned with two candlesticks which he thrust\r\none after the other into the fire and carried to the table. A denuded\r\nroom came into view and the fire lost all its cheerful colour. The\r\nwalls of the room were bare except for a copy of an election address.\r\nIn the middle of the room was a small table on which papers were\r\nheaped.\r\n\r\nMr Hynes leaned against the mantelpiece and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he paid you yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope to God he\xe2\x80\x99ll not leave us in the\r\nlurch tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Hynes laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, he\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you. Never fear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he\xe2\x80\x99ll look smart about it if he means business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Hynes satirically to the old man.\r\n\r\nThe old man returned to his seat by the fire, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t but he has it, anyway. Not like the other tinker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat other tinker?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Hynes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColgan,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is because Colgan\xe2\x80\x99s a working-man you say that? What\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndifference between a good honest bricklayer and a publican\xe2\x80\x94eh? Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe working-man as good a right to be in the Corporation as anyone\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x94ay, and a better right than those shoneens that are always hat in\r\nhand before any fellow with a handle to his name? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so, Mat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr Hynes, addressing Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne man is a plain honest man with no hunker-sliding about him. He\r\ngoes in to represent the labour classes. This fellow you\xe2\x80\x99re working for\r\nonly wants to get some job or other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, the working-classes should be represented,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe working-man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Hynes, \xe2\x80\x9cgets all kicks and no halfpence. But\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s labour produces everything. The working-man is not looking for fat\r\njobs for his sons and nephews and cousins. The working-man is not going\r\nto drag the honour of Dublin in the mud to please a German monarch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know they want to present an address of welcome to Edward\r\nRex if he comes here next year? What do we want kowtowing to a foreign\r\nking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur man won\xe2\x80\x99t vote for the address,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor. \xe2\x80\x9cHe goes in on\r\nthe Nationalist ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Hynes. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till you see whether he will or not. I\r\nknow him. Is it Tricky Dicky Tierney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God! perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re right, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, I wish\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d turn up with the spondulics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three men fell silent. The old man began to rake more cinders\r\ntogether. Mr Hynes took off his hat, shook it and then turned down the\r\ncollar of his coat, displaying, as he did so, an ivy leaf in the lapel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this man was alive,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the leaf, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99d have no\r\ntalk of an address of welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMusha, God be with them times!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was some life\r\nin it then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe room was silent again. Then a bustling little man with a snuffling\r\nnose and very cold ears pushed in the door. He walked over quickly to\r\nthe fire, rubbing his hands as if he intended to produce a spark from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo money, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down here, Mr Henchy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, offering him his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, don\xe2\x80\x99t stir, Jack, don\xe2\x80\x99t stir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy.\r\n\r\nHe nodded curtly to Mr Hynes and sat down on the chair which the old\r\nman vacated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you serve Aungier Street?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, beginning to search his pockets for memoranda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you call on Grimes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? How does he stand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t promise. He said: \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone what way I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto vote.\xe2\x80\x99 But I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asked me who the nominators were; and I told him. I mentioned\r\nFather Burke\xe2\x80\x99s name. I think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Henchy began to snuffle and to rub his hands over the fire at a\r\nterrific speed. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of God, Jack, bring us a bit of coal. There must be some\r\nleft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man went out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI asked the little\r\nshoeboy, but he said: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, now, Mr Henchy, when I see the work going on\r\nproperly I won\xe2\x80\x99t forget you, you may be sure.\xe2\x80\x99 Mean little tinker!\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Usha, how could he be anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I tell you, Mat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Hynes. \xe2\x80\x9cTricky Dicky Tierney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, he\xe2\x80\x99s as tricky as they make \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\nthose little pigs\xe2\x80\x99 eyes for nothing. Blast his soul! Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t he pay up\r\nlike a man instead of: \xe2\x80\x98O, now, Mr Henchy, I must speak to Mr\r\nFanning.... I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of money\xe2\x80\x99? Mean little shoeboy of hell! I\r\nsuppose he forgets the time his little old father kept the hand-me-down\r\nshop in Mary\xe2\x80\x99s Lane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is that a fact?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you never hear that? And the men used\r\nto go in on Sunday morning before the houses were open to buy a\r\nwaistcoat or a trousers\xe2\x80\x94moya! But Tricky Dicky\xe2\x80\x99s little old father\r\nalways had a tricky little black bottle up in a corner. Do you mind\r\nnow? That\xe2\x80\x99s that. That\xe2\x80\x99s where he first saw the light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man returned with a few lumps of coal which he placed here and\r\nthere on the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a nice how-do-you-do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does he expect us\r\nto work for him if he won\xe2\x80\x99t stump up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect to find the bailiffs in\r\nthe hall when I go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Hynes laughed and, shoving himself away from the mantelpiece with\r\nthe aid of his shoulders, made ready to leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right when King Eddie comes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell boys, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\noff for the present. See you later. \xe2\x80\x99Bye, \xe2\x80\x99bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out of the room slowly. Neither Mr Henchy nor the old man said\r\nanything but, just as the door was closing, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, who had been\r\nstaring moodily into the fire, called out suddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Bye, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Henchy waited a few moments and then nodded in the direction of the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said across the fire, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat brings our friend in here?\r\nWhat does he want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Usha, poor Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, throwing the end of his cigarette\r\ninto the fire, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s hard up, like the rest of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Henchy snuffled vigorously and spat so copiously that he nearly put\r\nout the fire, which uttered a hissing protest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell you my private and candid opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nman from the other camp. He\xe2\x80\x99s a spy of Colgan\xe2\x80\x99s, if you ask me. Just go\r\nround and try and find out how they\xe2\x80\x99re getting on. They won\xe2\x80\x99t suspect\r\nyou. Do you twig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor Joe is a decent skin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis father was a decent respectable man,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Henchy admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\nold Larry Hynes! Many a good turn he did in his day! But I\xe2\x80\x99m greatly\r\nafraid our friend is not nineteen carat. Damn it, I can understand a\r\nfellow being hard up, but what I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand is a fellow sponging.\r\nCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he have some spark of manhood about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get a warm welcome from me when he comes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\r\nman. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him work for his own side and not come spying around here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor dubiously, as he took out\r\ncigarette-papers and tobacco. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Joe Hynes is a straight man.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s a clever chap, too, with the pen. Do you remember that thing he\r\nwrote...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of these hillsiders and fenians are a bit too clever if you ask\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what my private and candid opinion is\r\nabout some of those little jokers? I believe half of them are in the\r\npay of the Castle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, but I know it for a fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re Castle\r\nhacks.... I don\xe2\x80\x99t say Hynes.... No, damn it, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s a stroke\r\nabove that.... But there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain little nobleman with a\r\ncock-eye\xe2\x80\x94you know the patriot I\xe2\x80\x99m alluding to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lineal descendant of Major Sirr for you if you like! O, the\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s blood of a patriot! That\xe2\x80\x99s a fellow now that\xe2\x80\x99d sell his country\r\nfor fourpence\xe2\x80\x94ay\xe2\x80\x94and go down on his bended knees and thank the Almighty\r\nChrist he had a country to sell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy.\r\n\r\nA person resembling a poor clergyman or a poor actor appeared in the\r\ndoorway. His black clothes were tightly buttoned on his short body and\r\nit was impossible to say whether he wore a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s collar or a\r\nlayman\xe2\x80\x99s, because the collar of his shabby frock-coat, the uncovered\r\nbuttons of which reflected the candlelight, was turned up about his\r\nneck. He wore a round hat of hard black felt. His face, shining with\r\nraindrops, had the appearance of damp yellow cheese save where two rosy\r\nspots indicated the cheekbones. He opened his very long mouth suddenly\r\nto express disappointment and at the same time opened wide his very\r\nbright blue eyes to express pleasure and surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Father Keon!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, jumping up from his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that\r\nyou? Come in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, no, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Keon quickly, pursing his lips as if he\r\nwere addressing a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come in and sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Keon, speaking in a discreet indulgent\r\nvelvety voice. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me disturb you now! I\xe2\x80\x99m just looking for Mr\r\nFanning....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s round at the _Black Eagle_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut won\xe2\x80\x99t you come\r\nin and sit down a minute?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, thank you. It was just a little business matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father\r\nKeon. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe retreated from the doorway and Mr Henchy, seizing one of the\r\ncandlesticks, went to the door to light him downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble, I beg!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but the stairs is so dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I can see.... Thank you, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you right now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, thanks.... Thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Henchy returned with the candlestick and put it on the table. He sat\r\ndown again at the fire. There was silence for a few moments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, John,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, lighting his cigarette with another\r\npasteboard card.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat he is exactly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk me an easier one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanning and himself seem to me very thick. They\xe2\x80\x99re often in Kavanagh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntogether. Is he a priest at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMmmyes, I believe so.... I think he\xe2\x80\x99s what you call a black sheep. We\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t many of them, thank God! but we have a few.... He\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nunfortunate man of some kind....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how does he knock it out?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s another mystery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he attached to any chapel or church or institution or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, \xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s travelling on his own account....\r\nGod forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he was the dozen of stout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any chance of a drink itself?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m dry too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked that little shoeboy three times,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, \xe2\x80\x9cwould he\r\nsend up a dozen of stout. I asked him again now, but he was leaning on\r\nthe counter in his shirt-sleeves having a deep goster with Alderman\r\nCowley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you remind him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go over while he was talking to Alderman Cowley. I\r\njust waited till I caught his eye, and said: \xe2\x80\x98About that little matter\r\nI was speaking to you about....\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right, Mr H.,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid. Yerra, sure the little hop-o\xe2\x80\x99-my-thumb has forgotten all about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s some deal on in that quarter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor thoughtfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw the three of them hard at it yesterday at Suffolk Street\r\ncorner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I know the little game they\xe2\x80\x99re at,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nowe the City Fathers money nowadays if you want to be made Lord Mayor.\r\nThen they\xe2\x80\x99ll make you Lord Mayor. By God! I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking seriously of\r\nbecoming a City Father myself. What do you think? Would I do for the\r\njob?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far as owing money goes....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDriving out of the Mansion House,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, \xe2\x80\x9cin all my vermin,\r\nwith Jack here standing up behind me in a powdered wig\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd make me your private secretary, John.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll make Father Keon my private chaplain. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a\r\nfamily party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, Mr Henchy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d keep up better style than\r\nsome of them. I was talking one day to old Keegan, the porter. \xe2\x80\x98And how\r\ndo you like your new master, Pat?\xe2\x80\x99 says I to him. \xe2\x80\x98You haven\xe2\x80\x99t much\r\nentertaining now,\xe2\x80\x99 says I. \xe2\x80\x98Entertaining!\xe2\x80\x99 says he. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99d live on the\r\nsmell of an oil-rag.\xe2\x80\x99 And do you know what he told me? Now, I declare\r\nto God I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy and Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me: \xe2\x80\x98What do you think of a Lord Mayor of Dublin sending out\r\nfor a pound of chops for his dinner? How\xe2\x80\x99s that for high living?\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nhe. \xe2\x80\x98Wisha! wisha,\xe2\x80\x99 says I. \xe2\x80\x98A pound of chops,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98coming into\r\nthe Mansion House.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Wisha!\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98what kind of people is going at\r\nall now?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point there was a knock at the door, and a boy put in his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the _Black Eagle_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, walking in sideways and\r\ndepositing a basket on the floor with a noise of shaken bottles.\r\n\r\nThe old man helped the boy to transfer the bottles from the basket to\r\nthe table and counted the full tally. After the transfer the boy put\r\nhis basket on his arm and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny bottles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat bottles?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you let us drink them first?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was told to ask for the bottles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you run over to O\xe2\x80\x99Farrell\xe2\x80\x99s and ask\r\nhim to lend us a corkscrew\xe2\x80\x94for Mr Henchy, say. Tell him we won\xe2\x80\x99t keep\r\nit a minute. Leave the basket there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy went out and Mr Henchy began to rub his hands cheerfully,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, he\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad after all. He\xe2\x80\x99s as good as his word,\r\nanyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no tumblers,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, don\xe2\x80\x99t let that trouble you, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cMany\xe2\x80\x99s the good\r\nman before now drank out of the bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, it\xe2\x80\x99s better than nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad sort,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, \xe2\x80\x9conly Fanning has such a loan of\r\nhim. He means well, you know, in his own tinpot way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy came back with the corkscrew. The old man opened three bottles\r\nand was handing back the corkscrew when Mr Henchy said to the boy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like a drink, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy.\r\n\r\nThe old man opened another bottle grudgingly, and handed it to the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat age are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventeen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy.\r\n\r\nAs the old man said nothing further, the boy took the bottle and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s my best respects, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d to Mr Henchy, drank the contents, put\r\nthe bottle back on the table and wiped his mouth with his sleeve. Then\r\nhe took up the corkscrew and went out of the door sideways, muttering\r\nsome form of salutation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way it begins,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thin edge of the wedge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy.\r\n\r\nThe old man distributed the three bottles which he had opened and the\r\nmen drank from them simultaneously. After having drunk each placed his\r\nbottle on the mantelpiece within hand\xe2\x80\x99s reach and drew in a long breath\r\nof satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I did a good day\xe2\x80\x99s work today,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat so, John?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I got him one or two sure things in Dawson Street, Crofton and\r\nmyself. Between ourselves, you know, Crofton (he\xe2\x80\x99s a decent chap, of\r\ncourse), but he\xe2\x80\x99s not worth a damn as a canvasser. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a word to\r\nthrow to a dog. He stands and looks at the people while I do the\r\ntalking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere two men entered the room. One of them was a very fat man whose\r\nblue serge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling from his sloping\r\nfigure. He had a big face which resembled a young ox\xe2\x80\x99s face in\r\nexpression, staring blue eyes and a grizzled moustache. The other man,\r\nwho was much younger and frailer, had a thin, clean-shaven face. He\r\nwore a very high double collar and a wide-brimmed bowler hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Crofton!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy to the fat man. \xe2\x80\x9cTalk of the\r\ndevil....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did the boose come from?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cDid the cow\r\ncalve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, of course, Lyons spots the drink first thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the way you chaps canvass,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Lyons, \xe2\x80\x9cand Crofton and I\r\nout in the cold and rain looking for votes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, blast your soul,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d get more votes in five\r\nminutes than you two\xe2\x80\x99d get in a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen two bottles of stout, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen there\xe2\x80\x99s no corkscrew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait now, wait now!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, getting up quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever\r\nsee this little trick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took two bottles from the table and, carrying them to the fire, put\r\nthem on the hob. Then he sat down again by the fire and took another\r\ndrink from his bottle. Mr Lyons sat on the edge of the table, pushed\r\nhis hat towards the nape of his neck and began to swing his legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is my bottle?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy.\r\n\r\nMr Crofton sat down on a box and looked fixedly at the other bottle on\r\nthe hob. He was silent for two reasons. The first reason, sufficient in\r\nitself, was that he had nothing to say; the second reason was that he\r\nconsidered his companions beneath him. He had been a canvasser for\r\nWilkins, the Conservative, but when the Conservatives had withdrawn\r\ntheir man and, choosing the lesser of two evils, given their support to\r\nthe Nationalist candidate, he had been engaged to work for Mr Tierney.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes an apologetic \xe2\x80\x9cPok!\xe2\x80\x9d was heard as the cork flew out of\r\nMr Lyons\xe2\x80\x99 bottle. Mr Lyons jumped off the table, went to the fire, took\r\nhis bottle and carried it back to the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just telling them, Crofton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we got a good\r\nfew votes today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho did you get?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Lyons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I got Parkes for one, and I got Atkinson for two, and got Ward\r\nof Dawson Street. Fine old chap he is, too\xe2\x80\x94regular old toff, old\r\nConservative! \xe2\x80\x98But isn\xe2\x80\x99t your candidate a Nationalist?\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na respectable man,\xe2\x80\x99 said I. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s in favour of whatever will benefit\r\nthis country. He\xe2\x80\x99s a big ratepayer,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98He has extensive house\r\nproperty in the city and three places of business and isn\xe2\x80\x99t it to his\r\nown advantage to keep down the rates? He\xe2\x80\x99s a prominent and respected\r\ncitizen,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98and a Poor Law Guardian, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to\r\nany party, good, bad, or indifferent.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s the way to talk to \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about the address to the King?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Lyons, after drinking\r\nand smacking his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we want in this country, as I\r\nsaid to old Ward, is capital. The King\xe2\x80\x99s coming here will mean an\r\ninflux of money into this country. The citizens of Dublin will benefit\r\nby it. Look at all the factories down by the quays there, idle! Look at\r\nall the money there is in the country if we only worked the old\r\nindustries, the mills, the ship-building yards and factories. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncapital we want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut look here, John,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we welcome the\r\nKing of England? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Parnell himself....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParnell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, \xe2\x80\x9cis dead. Now, here\xe2\x80\x99s the way I look at it.\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s this chap come to the throne after his old mother keeping him\r\nout of it till the man was grey. He\xe2\x80\x99s a man of the world, and he means\r\nwell by us. He\xe2\x80\x99s a jolly fine decent fellow, if you ask me, and no damn\r\nnonsense about him. He just says to himself: \xe2\x80\x98The old one never went to\r\nsee these wild Irish. By Christ, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go myself and see what they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x99 And are we going to insult the man when he comes over here on a\r\nfriendly visit? Eh? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right, Crofton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Crofton nodded his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut after all now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Lyons argumentatively, \xe2\x80\x9cKing Edward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife, you know, is not the very....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet bygones be bygones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cI admire the man personally.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s just an ordinary knockabout like you and me. He\xe2\x80\x99s fond of his\r\nglass of grog and he\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a rake, perhaps, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\nsportsman. Damn it, can\xe2\x80\x99t we Irish play fair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Lyons. \xe2\x80\x9cBut look at the case of Parnell\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x99s the analogy between the\r\ntwo cases?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Lyons, \xe2\x80\x9cis we have our ideals. Why, now, would\r\nwe welcome a man like that? Do you think now after what he did Parnell\r\nwas a fit man to lead us? And why, then, would we do it for Edward the\r\nSeventh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Parnell\xe2\x80\x99s anniversary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t let us\r\nstir up any bad blood. We all respect him now that he\xe2\x80\x99s dead and\r\ngone\xe2\x80\x94even the Conservatives,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to Mr Crofton.\r\n\r\nPok! The tardy cork flew out of Mr Crofton\xe2\x80\x99s bottle. Mr Crofton got up\r\nfrom his box and went to the fire. As he returned with his capture he\r\nsaid in a deep voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur side of the house respects him, because he was a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight you are, Crofton!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was the only man\r\nthat could keep that bag of cats in order. \xe2\x80\x98Down, ye dogs! Lie down, ye\r\ncurs!\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s the way he treated them. Come in, Joe! Come in!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncalled out, catching sight of Mr Hynes in the doorway.\r\n\r\nMr Hynes came in slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen another bottle of stout, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cO, I forgot\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no corkscrew! Here, show me one here and I\xe2\x80\x99ll put it at the\r\nfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man handed him another bottle and he placed it on the hob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re just talking about the\r\nChief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy.\r\n\r\nMr Hynes sat on the side of the table near Mr Lyons but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one of them, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat didn\xe2\x80\x99t renege him.\r\nBy God, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say for you, Joe! No, by God, you stuck to him like a\r\nman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cGive us that thing you wrote\xe2\x80\x94do\r\nyou remember? Have you got it on you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, ay!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cGive us that. Did you ever hear that,\r\nCrofton? Listen to this now: splendid thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor. \xe2\x80\x9cFire away, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Hynes did not seem to remember at once the piece to which they were\r\nalluding but, after reflecting a while, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, that thing is it.... Sure, that\xe2\x80\x99s old now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut with it, man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Sh, \xe2\x80\x99sh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Hynes hesitated a little longer. Then amid the silence he took off\r\nhis hat, laid it on the table and stood up. He seemed to be rehearsing\r\nthe piece in his mind. After a rather long pause he announced:\r\n\r\n     THE DEATH OF PARNELL\r\n     6_th October_ 1891\r\n\r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat once or twice and then began to recite:\r\n\r\n     He is dead. Our Uncrowned King is dead.\r\n         O, Erin, mourn with grief and woe\r\n     For he lies dead whom the fell gang\r\n         Of modern hypocrites laid low.\r\n\r\n     He lies slain by the coward hounds\r\n         He raised to glory from the mire;\r\n     And Erin\xe2\x80\x99s hopes and Erin\xe2\x80\x99s dreams\r\n         Perish upon her monarch\xe2\x80\x99s pyre.\r\n\r\n     In palace, cabin or in cot\r\n         The Irish heart where\xe2\x80\x99er it be\r\n     Is bowed with woe\xe2\x80\x94for he is gone\r\n         Who would have wrought her destiny.\r\n\r\n     He would have had his Erin famed,\r\n         The green flag gloriously unfurled,\r\n     Her statesmen, bards and warriors raised\r\n         Before the nations of the World.\r\n\r\n     He dreamed (alas, \xe2\x80\x99twas but a dream!)\r\n         Of Liberty: but as he strove\r\n     To clutch that idol, treachery\r\n         Sundered him from the thing he loved.\r\n\r\n     Shame on the coward, caitiff hands\r\n         That smote their Lord or with a kiss\r\n     Betrayed him to the rabble-rout\r\n         Of fawning priests\xe2\x80\x94no friends of his.\r\n\r\n     May everlasting shame consume\r\n         The memory of those who tried\r\n     To befoul and smear the exalted name\r\n         Of one who spurned them in his pride.\r\n\r\n     He fell as fall the mighty ones,\r\n         Nobly undaunted to the last,\r\n     And death has now united him\r\n         With Erin\xe2\x80\x99s heroes of the past.\r\n\r\n     No sound of strife disturb his sleep!\r\n         Calmly he rests: no human pain\r\n     Or high ambition spurs him now\r\n         The peaks of glory to attain.\r\n\r\n     They had their way: they laid him low.\r\n         But Erin, list, his spirit may\r\n     Rise, like the Ph\xc5\x93nix from the flames,\r\n         When breaks the dawning of the day,\r\n\r\n     The day that brings us Freedom\xe2\x80\x99s reign.\r\n         And on that day may Erin well\r\n     Pledge in the cup she lifts to Joy\r\n         One grief\xe2\x80\x94the memory of Parnell.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Hynes sat down again on the table. When he had finished his\r\nrecitation there was a silence and then a burst of clapping: even Mr\r\nLyons clapped. The applause continued for a little time. When it had\r\nceased all the auditors drank from their bottles in silence.\r\n\r\nPok! The cork flew out of Mr Hynes\xe2\x80\x99 bottle, but Mr Hynes remained\r\nsitting flushed and bareheaded on the table. He did not seem to have\r\nheard the invitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood man, Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, taking out his cigarette papers and\r\npouch the better to hide his emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of that, Crofton?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr Henchy. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that\r\nfine? What?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Crofton said that it was a very fine piece of writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Holohan, assistant secretary of the _Eire Abu_ Society, had been\r\nwalking up and down Dublin for nearly a month, with his hands and\r\npockets full of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the series of\r\nconcerts. He had a game leg and for this his friends called him Hoppy\r\nHolohan. He walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street\r\ncorners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was Mrs\r\nKearney who arranged everything.\r\n\r\nMiss Devlin had become Mrs Kearney out of spite. She had been educated\r\nin a high-class convent, where she had learned French and music. As she\r\nwas naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at\r\nschool. When she came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many\r\nhouses where her playing and ivory manners were much admired. She sat\r\namid the chilly circle of her accomplishments, waiting for some suitor\r\nto brave it and offer her a brilliant life. But the young men whom she\r\nmet were ordinary and she gave them no encouragement, trying to console\r\nher romantic desires by eating a great deal of Turkish Delight in\r\nsecret. However, when she drew near the limit and her friends began to\r\nloosen their tongues about her, she silenced them by marrying Mr\r\nKearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay.\r\n\r\nHe was much older than she. His conversation, which was serious, took\r\nplace at intervals in his great brown beard. After the first year of\r\nmarried life, Mrs Kearney perceived that such a man would wear better\r\nthan a romantic person, but she never put her own romantic ideas away.\r\nHe was sober, thrifty and pious; he went to the altar every first\r\nFriday, sometimes with her, oftener by himself. But she never weakened\r\nin her religion and was a good wife to him. At some party in a strange\r\nhouse when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take\r\nhis leave and, when his cough troubled him, she put the eider-down\r\nquilt over his feet and made a strong rum punch. For his part, he was a\r\nmodel father. By paying a small sum every week into a society, he\r\nensured for both his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when\r\nthey came to the age of twenty-four. He sent the elder daughter,\r\nKathleen, to a good convent, where she learned French and music, and\r\nafterward paid her fees at the Academy. Every year in the month of July\r\nMrs Kearney found occasion to say to some friend:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good man is packing us off to Skerries for a few weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf it was not Skerries it was Howth or Greystones.\r\n\r\nWhen the Irish Revival began to be appreciable Mrs Kearney determined\r\nto take advantage of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s name and brought an Irish teacher\r\nto the house. Kathleen and her sister sent Irish picture postcards to\r\ntheir friends and these friends sent back other Irish picture\r\npostcards. On special Sundays, when Mr Kearney went with his family to\r\nthe pro-cathedral, a little crowd of people would assemble after mass\r\nat the corner of Cathedral Street. They were all friends of the\r\nKearneys\xe2\x80\x94musical friends or Nationalist friends; and, when they had\r\nplayed every little counter of gossip, they shook hands with one\r\nanother all together, laughing at the crossing of so many hands, and\r\nsaid good-bye to one another in Irish. Soon the name of Miss Kathleen\r\nKearney began to be heard often on people\xe2\x80\x99s lips. People said that she\r\nwas very clever at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she\r\nwas a believer in the language movement. Mrs Kearney was well content\r\nat this. Therefore she was not surprised when one day Mr Holohan came\r\nto her and proposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a\r\nseries of four grand concerts which his Society was going to give in\r\nthe Antient Concert Rooms. She brought him into the drawing-room, made\r\nhim sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver\r\nbiscuit-barrel. She entered heart and soul into the details of the\r\nenterprise, advised and dissuaded; and finally a contract was drawn up\r\nby which Kathleen was to receive eight guineas for her services as\r\naccompanist at the four grand concerts.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of\r\nbills and the disposing of items for a programme, Mrs Kearney helped\r\nhim. She had tact. She knew what _artistes_ should go into capitals and\r\nwhat _artistes_ should go into small type. She knew that the first\r\ntenor would not like to come on after Mr Meade\xe2\x80\x99s comic turn. To keep\r\nthe audience continually diverted she slipped the doubtful items in\r\nbetween the old favourites. Mr Holohan called to see her every day to\r\nhave her advice on some point. She was invariably friendly and\r\nadvising\xe2\x80\x94homely, in fact. She pushed the decanter towards him, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, help yourself, Mr Holohan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd while he was helping himself she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverything went on smoothly. Mrs Kearney bought some lovely blush-pink\r\ncharmeuse in Brown Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s to let into the front of Kathleen\xe2\x80\x99s dress.\r\nIt cost a pretty penny; but there are occasions when a little expense\r\nis justifiable. She took a dozen of two-shilling tickets for the final\r\nconcert and sent them to those friends who could not be trusted to come\r\notherwise. She forgot nothing and, thanks to her, everything that was\r\nto be done was done.\r\n\r\nThe concerts were to be on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\r\nWhen Mrs Kearney arrived with her daughter at the Antient Concert Rooms\r\non Wednesday night she did not like the look of things. A few young\r\nmen, wearing bright blue badges in their coats, stood idle in the\r\nvestibule; none of them wore evening dress. She passed by with her\r\ndaughter and a quick glance through the open door of the hall showed\r\nher the cause of the stewards\xe2\x80\x99 idleness. At first she wondered had she\r\nmistaken the hour. No, it was twenty minutes to eight.\r\n\r\nIn the dressing-room behind the stage she was introduced to the\r\nsecretary of the Society, Mr Fitzpatrick. She smiled and shook his\r\nhand. He was a little man, with a white vacant face. She noticed that\r\nhe wore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head and that\r\nhis accent was flat. He held a programme in his hand and, while he was\r\ntalking to her, he chewed one end of it into a moist pulp. He seemed to\r\nbear disappointments lightly. Mr Holohan came into the dressing-room\r\nevery few minutes with reports from the box-office. The _artistes_\r\ntalked among themselves nervously, glanced from time to time at the\r\nmirror and rolled and unrolled their music. When it was nearly\r\nhalf-past eight, the few people in the hall began to express their\r\ndesire to be entertained. Mr Fitzpatrick came in, smiled vacantly at\r\nthe room, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, ladies and gentlemen. I suppose we\xe2\x80\x99d better open the ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick stare of\r\ncontempt, and then said to her daughter encouragingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she had an opportunity, she called Mr Holohan aside and asked him\r\nto tell her what it meant. Mr Holohan did not know what it meant. He\r\nsaid that the Committee had made a mistake in arranging for four\r\nconcerts: four was too many.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the _artistes_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Kearney. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course they are doing their\r\nbest, but really they are not good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Holohan admitted that the _artistes_ were no good but the Committee,\r\nhe said, had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased\r\nand reserve all the talent for Saturday night. Mrs Kearney said\r\nnothing, but, as the mediocre items followed one another on the\r\nplatform and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer, she began\r\nto regret that she had put herself to any expense for such a concert.\r\nThere was something she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like in the look of things and Mr\r\nFitzpatrick\xe2\x80\x99s vacant smile irritated her very much. However, she said\r\nnothing and waited to see how it would end. The concert expired shortly\r\nbefore ten, and everyone went home quickly.\r\n\r\nThe concert on Thursday night was better attended, but Mrs Kearney saw\r\nat once that the house was filled with paper. The audience behaved\r\nindecorously, as if the concert were an informal dress rehearsal. Mr\r\nFitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself; he was quite unconscious that Mrs\r\nKearney was taking angry note of his conduct. He stood at the edge of\r\nthe screen, from time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a\r\nlaugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony. In the course of\r\nthe evening, Mrs Kearney learned that the Friday concert was to be\r\nabandoned and that the Committee was going to move heaven and earth to\r\nsecure a bumper house on Saturday night. When she heard this, she\r\nsought out Mr Holohan. She buttonholed him as he was limping out\r\nquickly with a glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it\r\ntrue. Yes, it was true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, of course, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t alter the contract,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ncontract was for four concerts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Holohan seemed to be in a hurry; he advised her to speak to Mr\r\nFitzpatrick. Mrs Kearney was now beginning to be alarmed. She called Mr\r\nFitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her daughter had\r\nsigned for four concerts and that, of course, according to the terms of\r\nthe contract, she should receive the sum originally stipulated for,\r\nwhether the society gave the four concerts or not. Mr Fitzpatrick, who\r\ndid not catch the point at issue very quickly, seemed unable to resolve\r\nthe difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the\r\nCommittee. Mrs Kearney\xe2\x80\x99s anger began to flutter in her cheek and she\r\nhad all she could do to keep from asking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is the _Cometty_ pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that: so she was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nLittle boys were sent out into the principal streets of Dublin early on\r\nFriday morning with bundles of handbills. Special puffs appeared in all\r\nthe evening papers, reminding the music-loving public of the treat\r\nwhich was in store for it on the following evening. Mrs Kearney was\r\nsomewhat reassured, but she thought well to tell her husband part of\r\nher suspicions. He listened carefully and said that perhaps it would be\r\nbetter if he went with her on Saturday night. She agreed. She respected\r\nher husband in the same way as she respected the General Post Office,\r\nas something large, secure and fixed; and though she knew the small\r\nnumber of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male. She\r\nwas glad that he had suggested coming with her. She thought her plans\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThe night of the grand concert came. Mrs Kearney, with her husband and\r\ndaughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms three-quarters of an\r\nhour before the time at which the concert was to begin. By ill luck it\r\nwas a rainy evening. Mrs Kearney placed her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s clothes and\r\nmusic in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking\r\nfor Mr Holohan or Mr Fitzpatrick. She could find neither. She asked the\r\nstewards was any member of the Committee in the hall and, after a great\r\ndeal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named Miss Beirne\r\nto whom Mrs Kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the\r\nsecretaries. Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she\r\ndo anything. Mrs Kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which\r\nwas screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little woman hoped they would have a good house. She looked out at\r\nthe rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the\r\ntrustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features. Then she gave a\r\nlittle sigh and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well! We did our best, the dear knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Kearney had to go back to the dressing-room.\r\n\r\nThe _artistes_ were arriving. The bass and the second tenor had already\r\ncome. The bass, Mr Duggan, was a slender young man with a scattered\r\nblack moustache. He was the son of a hall porter in an office in the\r\ncity and, as a boy, he had sung prolonged bass notes in the resounding\r\nhall. From this humble state he had raised himself until he had become\r\na first-rate _artiste_. He had appeared in grand opera. One night, when\r\nan operatic _artiste_ had fallen ill, he had undertaken the part of the\r\nking in the opera of _Maritana_ at the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Theatre. He sang his\r\nmusic with great feeling and volume and was warmly welcomed by the\r\ngallery; but, unfortunately, he marred the good impression by wiping\r\nhis nose in his gloved hand once or twice out of thoughtlessness. He\r\nwas unassuming and spoke little. He said _yous_ so softly that it\r\npassed unnoticed and he never drank anything stronger than milk for his\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Mr Bell, the second tenor, was a fair-haired little man\r\nwho competed every year for prizes at the Feis Ceoil. On his fourth\r\ntrial he had been awarded a bronze medal. He was extremely nervous and\r\nextremely jealous of other tenors and he covered his nervous jealousy\r\nwith an ebullient friendliness. It was his humour to have people know\r\nwhat an ordeal a concert was to him. Therefore when he saw Mr Duggan he\r\nwent over to him and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in it too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Duggan.\r\n\r\nMr Bell laughed at his fellow-sufferer, held out his hand and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the\r\nscreen to view the house. The seats were being filled up rapidly and a\r\npleasant noise circulated in the auditorium. She came back and spoke to\r\nher husband privately. Their conversation was evidently about Kathleen\r\nfor they both glanced at her often as she stood chatting to one of her\r\nNationalist friends, Miss Healy, the contralto. An unknown solitary\r\nwoman with a pale face walked through the room. The women followed with\r\nkeen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body.\r\nSomeone said that she was Madam Glynn, the soprano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder where did they dig her up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kathleen to Miss Healy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure I never heard of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Healy had to smile. Mr Holohan limped into the dressing-room at\r\nthat moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown\r\nwoman. Mr Holohan said that she was Madam Glynn from London. Madam\r\nGlynn took her stand in a corner of the room, holding a roll of music\r\nstiffly before her and from time to time changing the direction of her\r\nstartled gaze. The shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell\r\nrevengefully into the little cup behind her collar-bone. The noise of\r\nthe hall became more audible. The first tenor and the baritone arrived\r\ntogether. They were both well dressed, stout and complacent and they\r\nbrought a breath of opulence among the company.\r\n\r\nMrs Kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to them\r\namiably. She wanted to be on good terms with them but, while she strove\r\nto be polite, her eyes followed Mr Holohan in his limping and devious\r\ncourses. As soon as she could she excused herself and went out after\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThey went down to a discreet part of the corridor. Mrs Kearney asked\r\nhim when was her daughter going to be paid. Mr Holohan said that Mr\r\nFitzpatrick had charge of that. Mrs Kearney said that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nanything about Mr Fitzpatrick. Her daughter had signed a contract for\r\neight guineas and she would have to be paid. Mr Holohan said that it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t his business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy isn\xe2\x80\x99t it your business?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs Kearney. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you yourself\r\nbring her the contract? Anyway, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not your business it\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nbusiness and I mean to see to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better speak to Mr Fitzpatrick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Holohan distantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs Kearney. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave my contract, and I intend to see that it is carried out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly\r\nsuffused. The room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress had taken\r\npossession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss\r\nHealy and the baritone. They were the _Freeman_ man and Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden\r\nBurke. The _Freeman_ man had come in to say that he could not wait for\r\nthe concert as he had to report the lecture which an American priest\r\nwas giving in the Mansion House. He said they were to leave the report\r\nfor him at the _Freeman_ office and he would see that it went in. He\r\nwas a grey-haired man, with a plausible voice and careful manners. He\r\nheld an extinguished cigar in his hand and the aroma of cigar smoke\r\nfloated near him. He had not intended to stay a moment because concerts\r\nand _artistes_ bored him considerably but he remained leaning against\r\nthe mantelpiece. Miss Healy stood in front of him, talking and\r\nlaughing. He was old enough to suspect one reason for her politeness\r\nbut young enough in spirit to turn the moment to account. The warmth,\r\nfragrance and colour of her body appealed to his senses. He was\r\npleasantly conscious that the bosom which he saw rise and fall slowly\r\nbeneath him rose and fell at that moment for him, that the laughter and\r\nfragrance and wilful glances were his tribute. When he could stay no\r\nlonger he took leave of her regretfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke will write the notice,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained to Mr Holohan,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll see it in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much, Mr Hendrick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Holohan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll see it in,\r\nI know. Now, won\xe2\x80\x99t you have a little something before you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Hendrick.\r\n\r\nThe two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase\r\nand came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking\r\nbottles for a few gentlemen. One of these gentlemen was Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden\r\nBurke, who had found out the room by instinct. He was a suave, elderly\r\nman who balanced his imposing body, when at rest, upon a large silk\r\numbrella. His magniloquent western name was the moral umbrella upon\r\nwhich he balanced the fine problem of his finances. He was widely\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr Holohan was entertaining the _Freeman_ man Mrs Kearney was\r\nspeaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to ask her to lower\r\nher voice. The conversation of the others in the dressing-room had\r\nbecome strained. Mr Bell, the first item, stood ready with his music\r\nbut the accompanist made no sign. Evidently something was wrong. Mr\r\nKearney looked straight before him, stroking his beard, while Mrs\r\nKearney spoke into Kathleen\xe2\x80\x99s ear with subdued emphasis. From the hall\r\ncame sounds of encouragement, clapping and stamping of feet. The first\r\ntenor and the baritone and Miss Healy stood together, waiting\r\ntranquilly, but Mr Bell\xe2\x80\x99s nerves were greatly agitated because he was\r\nafraid the audience would think that he had come late.\r\n\r\nMr Holohan and Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke came into the room. In a moment Mr\r\nHolohan perceived the hush. He went over to Mrs Kearney and spoke with\r\nher earnestly. While they were speaking the noise in the hall grew\r\nlouder. Mr Holohan became very red and excited. He spoke volubly, but\r\nMrs Kearney said curtly at intervals:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t go on. She must get her eight guineas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was\r\nclapping and stamping. He appealed to Mr Kearney and to Kathleen. But\r\nMr Kearney continued to stroke his beard and Kathleen looked down,\r\nmoving the point of her new shoe: it was not her fault. Mrs Kearney\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t go on without her money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a swift struggle of tongues Mr Holohan hobbled out in haste. The\r\nroom was silent. When the strain of the silence had become somewhat\r\npainful Miss Healy said to the baritone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Mrs Pat Campbell this week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very\r\nfine. The conversation went no further. The first tenor bent his head\r\nand began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended\r\nacross his waist, smiling and humming random notes to observe the\r\neffect on the frontal sinus. From time to time everyone glanced at Mrs\r\nKearney.\r\n\r\nThe noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when Mr Fitzpatrick\r\nburst into the room, followed by Mr Holohan, who was panting. The\r\nclapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling. Mr\r\nFitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his hand. He counted out four into\r\nMrs Kearney\xe2\x80\x99s hand and said she would get the other half at the\r\ninterval. Mrs Kearney said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is four shillings short.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Kathleen gathered in her skirt and said: _\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr Bell,\xe2\x80\x9d_ to the\r\nfirst item, who was shaking like an aspen. The singer and the\r\naccompanist went out together. The noise in hall died away. There was a\r\npause of a few seconds: and then the piano was heard.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the concert was very successful except for Madam\r\nGlynn\xe2\x80\x99s item. The poor lady sang _Killarney_ in a bodiless gasping\r\nvoice, with all the old-fashioned mannerisms of intonation and\r\npronunciation which she believed lent elegance to her singing. She\r\nlooked as if she had been resurrected from an old stage-wardrobe and\r\nthe cheaper parts of the hall made fun of her high wailing notes. The\r\nfirst tenor and the contralto, however, brought down the house.\r\nKathleen played a selection of Irish airs which was generously\r\napplauded. The first part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation\r\ndelivered by a young lady who arranged amateur theatricals. It was\r\ndeservedly applauded; and, when it was ended, the men went out for the\r\ninterval, content.\r\n\r\nAll this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement. In one corner\r\nwere Mr Holohan, Mr Fitzpatrick, Miss Beirne, two of the stewards, the\r\nbaritone, the bass, and Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke. Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said it\r\nwas the most scandalous exhibition he had ever witnessed. Miss Kathleen\r\nKearney\xe2\x80\x99s musical career was ended in Dublin after that, he said. The\r\nbaritone was asked what did he think of Mrs Kearney\xe2\x80\x99s conduct. He did\r\nnot like to say anything. He had been paid his money and wished to be\r\nat peace with men. However, he said that Mrs Kearney might have taken\r\nthe _artistes_ into consideration. The stewards and the secretaries\r\ndebated hotly as to what should be done when the interval came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree with Miss Beirne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke. \xe2\x80\x9cPay her nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn another corner of the room were Mrs Kearney and her husband, Mr\r\nBell, Miss Healy and the young lady who had to recite the patriotic\r\npiece. Mrs Kearney said that the Committee had treated her\r\nscandalously. She had spared neither trouble nor expense and this was\r\nhow she was repaid.\r\n\r\nThey thought they had only a girl to deal with and that, therefore,\r\nthey could ride roughshod over her. But she would show them their\r\nmistake. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have dared to have treated her like that if she\r\nhad been a man. But she would see that her daughter got her rights: she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be fooled. If they didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay her to the last farthing she\r\nwould make Dublin ring. Of course she was sorry for the sake of the\r\n_artistes_. But what else could she do? She appealed to the second\r\ntenor who said he thought she had not been well treated. Then she\r\nappealed to Miss Healy. Miss Healy wanted to join the other group but\r\nshe did not like to do so because she was a great friend of Kathleen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand the Kearneys had often invited her to their house.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first part was ended Mr Fitzpatrick and Mr Holohan went\r\nover to Mrs Kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be\r\npaid after the Committee meeting on the following Tuesday and that, in\r\ncase her daughter did not play for the second part, the Committee would\r\nconsider the contract broken and would pay nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any Committee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Kearney angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter\r\nhas her contract. She will get four pounds eight into her hand or a\r\nfoot she won\xe2\x80\x99t put on that platform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m surprised at you, Mrs Kearney,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Holohan. \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought\r\nyou would treat us this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what way did you treat me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs Kearney.\r\n\r\nHer face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she\r\nwould attack someone with her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m asking for my rights,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have some sense of decency,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Holohan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight I, indeed?... And when I ask when my daughter is going to be\r\npaid I can\xe2\x80\x99t get a civil answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must speak to the secretary. It\xe2\x80\x99s not my business. I\xe2\x80\x99m a great\r\nfellow fol-the-diddle-I-do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were a lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Holohan, walking away from her\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\nAfter that Mrs Kearney\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone\r\napproved of what the Committee had done. She stood at the door, haggard\r\nwith rage, arguing with her husband and daughter, gesticulating with\r\nthem. She waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the\r\nhope that the secretaries would approach her. But Miss Healy had kindly\r\nconsented to play one or two accompaniments. Mrs Kearney had to stand\r\naside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the\r\nplatform. She stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and,\r\nwhen the first notes of the song struck her ear, she caught up her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s cloak and said to her husband:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet a cab!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out at once. Mrs Kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter\r\nand followed him. As she passed through the doorway she stopped and\r\nglared into Mr Holohan\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not done with you yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m done with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Holohan.\r\n\r\nKathleen followed her mother meekly. Mr Holohan began to pace up and\r\ndown the room, in order to cool himself for he felt his skin on fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a nice lady!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cO, she\xe2\x80\x99s a nice lady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did the proper thing, Holohan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke, poised\r\nupon his umbrella in approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRACE\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo gentlemen who were in the lavatory at the time tried to lift him\r\nup: but he was quite helpless. He lay curled up at the foot of the\r\nstairs down which he had fallen. They succeeded in turning him over.\r\nHis hat had rolled a few yards away and his clothes were smeared with\r\nthe filth and ooze of the floor on which he had lain, face downwards.\r\nHis eyes were closed and he breathed with a grunting noise. A thin\r\nstream of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.\r\n\r\nThese two gentlemen and one of the curates carried him up the stairs\r\nand laid him down again on the floor of the bar. In two minutes he was\r\nsurrounded by a ring of men. The manager of the bar asked everyone who\r\nhe was and who was with him. No one knew who he was but one of the\r\ncurates said he had served the gentleman with a small rum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he by himself?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the manager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. There was two gentlemen with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one knew; a voice said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him air. He\xe2\x80\x99s fainted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ring of onlookers distended and closed again elastically. A dark\r\nmedal of blood had formed itself near the man\xe2\x80\x99s head on the tessellated\r\nfloor. The manager, alarmed by the grey pallor of the man\xe2\x80\x99s face, sent\r\nfor a policeman.\r\n\r\nHis collar was unfastened and his necktie undone. He opened his eyes\r\nfor an instant, sighed and closed them again. One of gentlemen who had\r\ncarried him upstairs held a dinged silk hat in his hand. The manager\r\nasked repeatedly did no one know who the injured man was or where had\r\nhis friends gone. The door of the bar opened and an immense constable\r\nentered. A crowd which had followed him down the laneway collected\r\noutside the door, struggling to look in through the glass panels.\r\n\r\nThe manager at once began to narrate what he knew. The constable, a\r\nyoung man with thick immobile features, listened. He moved his head\r\nslowly to right and left and from the manager to the person on the\r\nfloor, as if he feared to be the victim of some delusion. Then he drew\r\noff his glove, produced a small book from his waist, licked the lead of\r\nhis pencil and made ready to indite. He asked in a suspicious\r\nprovincial accent:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the man? What\xe2\x80\x99s his name and address?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA young man in a cycling-suit cleared his way through the ring of\r\nbystanders. He knelt down promptly beside the injured man and called\r\nfor water. The constable knelt down also to help. The young man washed\r\nthe blood from the injured man\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and then called for some brandy.\r\nThe constable repeated the order in an authoritative voice until a\r\ncurate came running with the glass. The brandy was forced down the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s throat. In a few seconds he opened his eyes and looked about him.\r\nHe looked at the circle of faces and then, understanding, strove to\r\nrise to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re all right now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young man in the cycling-suit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSha, \xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the injured man, trying to stand up.\r\n\r\nHe was helped to his feet. The manager said something about a hospital\r\nand some of the bystanders gave advice. The battered silk hat was\r\nplaced on the man\xe2\x80\x99s head. The constable asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man, without answering, began to twirl the ends of his moustache.\r\nHe made light of his accident. It was nothing, he said: only a little\r\naccident. He spoke very thickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the constable.\r\n\r\nThe man said they were to get a cab for him. While the point was being\r\ndebated a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion, wearing a long\r\nyellow ulster, came from the far end of the bar. Seeing the spectacle,\r\nhe called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Tom, old man! What\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSha, \xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer surveyed the deplorable figure before him and then turned\r\nto the constable, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, constable. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see him home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe constable touched his helmet and answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Mr Power!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power, taking his friend by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cNo bones\r\nbroken. What? Can you walk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man in the cycling-suit took the man by the other arm and the\r\ncrowd divided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you get yourself into this mess?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman fell down the stairs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99ery \xe2\x80\x99uch o\xe2\x80\x99liged to you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the injured man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99ant we have a little...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now. Not now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three men left the bar and the crowd sifted through the doors into\r\nthe laneway. The manager brought the constable to the stairs to inspect\r\nthe scene of the accident. They agreed that the gentleman must have\r\nmissed his footing. The customers returned to the counter and a curate\r\nset about removing the traces of blood from the floor.\r\n\r\nWhen they came out into Grafton Street, Mr Power whistled for an\r\noutsider. The injured man said again as well as he could:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99ery \xe2\x80\x99uch o\xe2\x80\x99liged to you, sir. I hope we\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99eet again. \xe2\x80\x99y na\xe2\x80\x99e is\r\nKernan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shock and the incipient pain had partly sobered him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mention it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\nThey shook hands. Mr Kernan was hoisted on to the car and, while Mr\r\nPower was giving directions to the carman, he expressed his gratitude\r\nto the young man and regretted that they could not have a little drink\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\nThe car drove off towards Westmoreland Street. As it passed Ballast\r\nOffice the clock showed half-past nine. A keen east wind hit them,\r\nblowing from the mouth of the river. Mr Kernan was huddled together\r\nwith cold. His friend asked him to tell how the accident had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI \xe2\x80\x99an\xe2\x80\x99t, \xe2\x80\x99an,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99y \xe2\x80\x99ongue is hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other leaned over the well of the car and peered into Mr Kernan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth but he could not see. He struck a match and, sheltering it in the\r\nshell of his hands, peered again into the mouth which Mr Kernan opened\r\nobediently. The swaying movement of the car brought the match to and\r\nfrom the opened mouth. The lower teeth and gums were covered with\r\nclotted blood and a minute piece of the tongue seemed to have been\r\nbitten off. The match was blown out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s ugly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSha, \xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan, closing his mouth and pulling the\r\ncollar of his filthy coat across his neck.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed\r\nin the dignity of its calling. He had never been seen in the city\r\nwithout a silk hat of some decency and a pair of gaiters. By grace of\r\nthese two articles of clothing, he said, a man could always pass\r\nmuster. He carried on the tradition of his Napoleon, the great\r\nBlackwhite, whose memory he evoked at times by legend and mimicry.\r\nModern business methods had spared him only so far as to allow him a\r\nlittle office in Crowe Street on the window blind of which was written\r\nthe name of his firm with the address\xe2\x80\x94London, E.C. On the mantelpiece\r\nof this little office a little leaden battalion of canisters was drawn\r\nup and on the table before the window stood four or five china bowls\r\nwhich were usually half full of a black liquid. From these bowls Mr\r\nKernan tasted tea. He took a mouthful, drew it up, saturated his palate\r\nwith it and then spat it forth into the grate. Then he paused to judge.\r\n\r\nMr Power, a much younger man, was employed in the Royal Irish\r\nConstabulary Office in Dublin Castle. The arc of his social rise\r\nintersected the arc of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s decline, but Mr Kernan\xe2\x80\x99s decline\r\nwas mitigated by the fact that certain of those friends who had known\r\nhim at his highest point of success still esteemed him as a character.\r\nMr Power was one of these friends. His inexplicable debts were a byword\r\nin his circle; he was a debonair young man.\r\n\r\nThe car halted before a small house on the Glasnevin road and Mr Kernan\r\nwas helped into the house. His wife put him to bed while Mr Power sat\r\ndownstairs in the kitchen asking the children where they went to school\r\nand what book they were in. The children\xe2\x80\x94two girls and a boy, conscious\r\nof their father\xe2\x80\x99s helplessness and of their mother\xe2\x80\x99s absence, began\r\nsome horseplay with him. He was surprised at their manners and at their\r\naccents, and his brow grew thoughtful. After a while Mrs Kernan entered\r\nthe kitchen, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a sight! O, he\xe2\x80\x99ll do for himself one day and that\xe2\x80\x99s the holy alls\r\nof it. He\xe2\x80\x99s been drinking since Friday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Power was careful to explain to her that he was not responsible,\r\nthat he had come on the scene by the merest accident. Mrs Kernan,\r\nremembering Mr Power\xe2\x80\x99s good offices during domestic quarrels, as well\r\nas many small, but opportune loans, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that, Mr Power. I know you\xe2\x80\x99re a friend of his,\r\nnot like some of the others he does be with. They\xe2\x80\x99re all right so long\r\nas he has money in his pocket to keep him out from his wife and family.\r\nNice friends! Who was he with tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Power shook his head but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing in the house to offer\r\nyou. But if you wait a minute I\xe2\x80\x99ll send round to Fogarty\xe2\x80\x99s at the\r\ncorner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Power stood up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were waiting for him to come home with the money. He never seems to\r\nthink he has a home at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, now, Mrs Kernan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll make him turn over a new\r\nleaf. I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to Martin. He\xe2\x80\x99s the man. We\xe2\x80\x99ll come here one of these\r\nnights and talk it over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw him to the door. The carman was stamping up and down the\r\nfootpath, and swinging his arms to warm himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you to bring him home,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power.\r\n\r\nHe got up on the car. As it drove off he raised his hat to her gaily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll make a new man of him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Mrs Kernan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs Kernan\xe2\x80\x99s puzzled eyes watched the car till it was out of sight.\r\nThen she withdrew them, went into the house and emptied her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nShe was an active, practical woman of middle age. Not long before she\r\nhad celebrated her silver wedding and renewed her intimacy with her\r\nhusband by waltzing with him to Mr Power\xe2\x80\x99s accompaniment. In her days\r\nof courtship Mr Kernan had seemed to her a not ungallant figure: and\r\nshe still hurried to the chapel door whenever a wedding was reported\r\nand, seeing the bridal pair, recalled with vivid pleasure how she had\r\npassed out of the Star of the Sea Church in Sandymount, leaning on the\r\narm of a jovial well-fed man, who was dressed smartly in a frock-coat\r\nand lavender trousers and carried a silk hat gracefully balanced upon\r\nhis other arm. After three weeks she had found a wife\xe2\x80\x99s life irksome\r\nand, later on, when she was beginning to find it unbearable, she had\r\nbecome a mother. The part of mother presented to her no insuperable\r\ndifficulties and for twenty-five years she had kept house shrewdly for\r\nher husband. Her two eldest sons were launched. One was in a draper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop in Glasgow and the other was clerk to a tea-merchant in Belfast.\r\nThey were good sons, wrote regularly and sometimes sent home money. The\r\nother children were still at school.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan sent a letter to his office next day and remained in bed. She\r\nmade beef-tea for him and scolded him roundly. She accepted his\r\nfrequent intemperance as part of the climate, healed him dutifully\r\nwhenever he was sick and always tried to make him eat a breakfast.\r\nThere were worse husbands. He had never been violent since the boys had\r\ngrown up and she knew that he would walk to the end of Thomas Street\r\nand back again to book even a small order.\r\n\r\nTwo nights after his friends came to see him. She brought them up to\r\nhis bedroom, the air of which was impregnated with a personal odour,\r\nand gave them chairs at the fire. Mr Kernan\xe2\x80\x99s tongue, the occasional\r\nstinging pain of which had made him somewhat irritable during the day,\r\nbecame more polite. He sat propped up in the bed by pillows and the\r\nlittle colour in his puffy cheeks made them resemble warm cinders. He\r\napologised to his guests for the disorder of the room, but at the same\r\ntime looked at them a little proudly, with a veteran\xe2\x80\x99s pride.\r\n\r\nHe was quite unconscious that he was the victim of a plot which his\r\nfriends, Mr Cunningham, Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy and Mr Power had disclosed to Mrs\r\nKernan in the parlour. The idea had been Mr Power\xe2\x80\x99s but its development\r\nwas entrusted to Mr Cunningham. Mr Kernan came of Protestant stock and,\r\nthough he had been converted to the Catholic faith at the time of his\r\nmarriage, he had not been in the pale of the Church for twenty years.\r\nHe was fond, moreover, of giving side-thrusts at Catholicism.\r\n\r\nMr Cunningham was the very man for such a case. He was an elder\r\ncolleague of Mr Power. His own domestic life was not very happy. People\r\nhad great sympathy with him for it was known that he had married an\r\nunpresentable woman who was an incurable drunkard. He had set up house\r\nfor her six times; and each time she had pawned the furniture on him.\r\n\r\nEveryone had respect for poor Martin Cunningham. He was a thoroughly\r\nsensible man, influential and intelligent. His blade of human\r\nknowledge, natural astuteness particularised by long association with\r\ncases in the police courts, had been tempered by brief immersions in\r\nthe waters of general philosophy. He was well informed. His friends\r\nbowed to his opinions and considered that his face was like\r\nShakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nWhen the plot had been disclosed to her, Mrs Kernan had said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI leave it all in your hands, Mr Cunningham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a quarter of a century of married life, she had very few\r\nillusions left. Religion for her was a habit and she suspected that a\r\nman of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s age would not change greatly before death. She was\r\ntempted to see a curious appropriateness in his accident and, but that\r\nshe did not wish to seem bloody-minded, she would have told the\r\ngentlemen that Mr Kernan\xe2\x80\x99s tongue would not suffer by being shortened.\r\nHowever, Mr Cunningham was a capable man; and religion was religion.\r\nThe scheme might do good and, at least, it could do no harm. Her\r\nbeliefs were not extravagant. She believed steadily in the Sacred Heart\r\nas the most generally useful of all Catholic devotions and approved of\r\nthe sacraments. Her faith was bounded by her kitchen but, if she was\r\nput to it, she could believe also in the banshee and in the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen began to talk of the accident. Mr Cunningham said that he\r\nhad once known a similar case. A man of seventy had bitten off a piece\r\nof his tongue during an epileptic fit and the tongue had filled in\r\nagain so that no one could see a trace of the bite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not seventy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the invalid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pain you now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\nMr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy had been at one time a tenor of some reputation. His wife, who\r\nhad been a soprano, still taught young children to play the piano at\r\nlow terms. His line of life had not been the shortest distance between\r\ntwo points and for short periods he had been driven to live by his\r\nwits. He had been a clerk in the Midland Railway, a canvasser for\r\nadvertisements for _The Irish Times_ and for _The Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Journal_, a\r\ntown traveller for a coal firm on commission, a private inquiry agent,\r\na clerk in the office of the Sub-Sheriff and he had recently become\r\nsecretary to the City Coroner. His new office made him professionally\r\ninterested in Mr Kernan\xe2\x80\x99s case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPain? Not much,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr Kernan. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s so sickening. I feel as\r\nif I wanted to retch off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the boose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I caught a cold on the car. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething keeps coming into my throat, phlegm or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMucus.\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt keeps coming like from down in my throat; sickening thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the thorax.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at Mr Cunningham and Mr Power at the same time with an air of\r\nchallenge. Mr Cunningham nodded his head rapidly and Mr Power said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, all\xe2\x80\x99s well that ends well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very much obliged to you, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the invalid.\r\n\r\nMr Power waved his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose other two fellows I was with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho were you with?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Cunningham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA chap. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know his name. Damn it now, what\xe2\x80\x99s his name? Little\r\nchap with sandy hair....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Cunningham made that remark, people were silent. It was known\r\nthat the speaker had secret sources of information. In this case the\r\nmonosyllable had a moral intention. Mr Harford sometimes formed one of\r\na little detachment which left the city shortly after noon on Sunday\r\nwith the purpose of arriving as soon as possible at some public-house\r\non the outskirts of the city where its members duly qualified\r\nthemselves as _bona fide_ travellers. But his fellow-travellers had\r\nnever consented to overlook his origin. He had begun life as an obscure\r\nfinancier by lending small sums of money to workmen at usurious\r\ninterest. Later on he had become the partner of a very fat short\r\ngentleman, Mr Goldberg, in the Liffey Loan Bank. Though he had never\r\nembraced more than the Jewish ethical code his fellow-Catholics,\r\nwhenever they had smarted in person or by proxy under his exactions,\r\nspoke of him bitterly as an Irish Jew and an illiterate and saw divine\r\ndisapproval of usury made manifest through the person of his idiot son.\r\nAt other times they remembered his good points.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder where did he go to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan.\r\n\r\nHe wished the details of the incident to remain vague. He wished his\r\nfriends to think there had been some mistake, that Mr Harford and he\r\nhad missed each other. His friends, who knew quite well Mr Harford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanners in drinking, were silent. Mr Power said again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll\xe2\x80\x99s well that ends well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Kernan changed the subject at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a decent young chap, that medical fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly for\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, only for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power, \xe2\x80\x9cit might have been a case of seven\r\ndays, without the option of a fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan, trying to remember. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember now there\r\nwas a policeman. Decent young fellow, he seemed. How did it happen at\r\nall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt happened that you were peloothered, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue bill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan, equally gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you squared the constable, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\nMr Power did not relish the use of his Christian name. He was not\r\nstraight-laced, but he could not forget that Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy had recently made\r\na crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to enable Mrs M\xe2\x80\x99Coy to\r\nfulfil imaginary engagements in the country. More than he resented the\r\nfact that he had been victimised he resented such low playing of the\r\ngame. He answered the question, therefore, as if Mr Kernan had asked\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe narrative made Mr Kernan indignant. He was keenly conscious of his\r\ncitizenship, wished to live with his city on terms mutually honourable\r\nand resented any affront put upon him by those whom he called country\r\nbumpkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this what we pay rates for?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cTo feed and clothe these\r\nignorant bostooms ... and they\xe2\x80\x99re nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Cunningham laughed. He was a Castle official only during office\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could they be anything else, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe assumed a thick provincial accent and said in a tone of command:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c65, catch your cabbage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone laughed. Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy, who wanted to enter the conversation by any\r\ndoor, pretended that he had never heard the story. Mr Cunningham said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is supposed\xe2\x80\x94they say, you know\xe2\x80\x94to take place in the depot where\r\nthey get these thundering big country fellows, omadhauns, you know, to\r\ndrill. The sergeant makes them stand in a row against the wall and hold\r\nup their plates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe illustrated the story by grotesque gestures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt dinner, you know. Then he has a bloody big bowl of cabbage before\r\nhim on the table and a bloody big spoon like a shovel. He takes up a\r\nwad of cabbage on the spoon and pegs it across the room and the poor\r\ndevils have to try and catch it on their plates: 65, _catch your\r\ncabbage_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone laughed again: but Mr Kernan was somewhat indignant still. He\r\ntalked of writing a letter to the papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese yahoos coming up here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthink they can boss the\r\npeople. I needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, Martin, what kind of men they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Cunningham gave a qualified assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like everything else in this world,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou get some bad\r\nones and you get some good ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, you get some good ones, I admit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan, satisfied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s better to have nothing to say to them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nopinion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Kernan entered the room and, placing a tray on the table, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp yourselves, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Power stood up to officiate, offering her his chair. She declined\r\nit, saying she was ironing downstairs, and, after having exchanged a\r\nnod with Mr Cunningham behind Mr Power\xe2\x80\x99s back, prepared to leave the\r\nroom. Her husband called out to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you nothing for me, duckie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, you! The back of my hand to you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Kernan tartly.\r\n\r\nHer husband called after her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing for poor little hubby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe assumed such a comical face and voice that the distribution of the\r\nbottles of stout took place amid general merriment.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen drank from their glasses, set the glasses again on the\r\ntable and paused. Then Mr Cunningham turned towards Mr Power and said\r\ncasually:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Thursday night, you said, Jack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThursday, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRighto!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham promptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can meet in M\xe2\x80\x99Auley\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll be the most\r\nconvenient place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it is sure\r\nto be crammed to the doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can meet at half-seven,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRighto!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf-seven at M\xe2\x80\x99Auley\xe2\x80\x99s be it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence. Mr Kernan waited to see whether he would be\r\ntaken into his friends\xe2\x80\x99 confidence. Then he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s in the wind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only a little matter that\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re arranging about for Thursday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe opera, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham in an evasive tone, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s just a little\r\n... spiritual matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan.\r\n\r\nThere was silence again. Then Mr Power said, point blank:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell you the truth, Tom, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make a retreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham, \xe2\x80\x9cJack and I and M\xe2\x80\x99Coy here\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nall going to wash the pot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe uttered the metaphor with a certain homely energy and, encouraged by\r\nhis own voice, proceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, we may as well all admit we\xe2\x80\x99re a nice collection of\r\nscoundrels, one and all. I say, one and all,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with gruff\r\ncharity and turning to Mr Power. \xe2\x80\x9cOwn up now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI own up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I own up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we\xe2\x80\x99re going to wash the pot together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham.\r\n\r\nA thought seemed to strike him. He turned suddenly to the invalid and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye know what, Tom, has just occurred to me? You might join in and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d have a four-handed reel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood idea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power. \xe2\x80\x9cThe four of us together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Kernan was silent. The proposal conveyed very little meaning to his\r\nmind but, understanding that some spiritual agencies were about to\r\nconcern themselves on his behalf, he thought he owed it to his dignity\r\nto show a stiff neck. He took no part in the conversation for a long\r\nwhile but listened, with an air of calm enmity, while his friends\r\ndiscussed the Jesuits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t such a bad opinion of the Jesuits,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, intervening at\r\nlength. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re an educated order. I believe they mean well too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re the grandest order in the Church, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham,\r\nwith enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cThe General of the Jesuits stands next to the Pope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no mistake about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy, \xe2\x80\x9cif you want a thing well\r\ndone and no flies about it you go to a Jesuit. They\xe2\x80\x99re the boyos have\r\ninfluence. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a case in point....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Jesuits are a fine body of men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a curious thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham, \xe2\x80\x9cabout the Jesuit Order.\r\nEvery other order of the Church had to be reformed at some time or\r\nother but the Jesuit Order was never once reformed. It never fell\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at their church, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at the congregation\r\nthey have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Jesuits cater for the upper classes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I have a feeling for them. It\xe2\x80\x99s some\r\nof those secular priests, ignorant, bumptious\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all good men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham, \xe2\x80\x9ceach in his own way. The\r\nIrish priesthood is honoured all the world over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot like some of the other priesthoods on the continent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy, \xe2\x80\x9cunworthy of the name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan, relenting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99m right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been in the world\r\nall this time and seen most sides of it without being a judge of\r\ncharacter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen drank again, one following another\xe2\x80\x99s example. Mr Kernan\r\nseemed to be weighing something in his mind. He was impressed. He had a\r\nhigh opinion of Mr Cunningham as a judge of character and as a reader\r\nof faces. He asked for particulars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a retreat, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham. \xe2\x80\x9cFather Purdon\r\nis giving it. It\xe2\x80\x99s for business men, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard on us, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power persuasively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Purdon? Father Purdon?\xe2\x80\x9d said the invalid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, you must know him, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham stoutly. \xe2\x80\x9cFine jolly\r\nfellow! He\xe2\x80\x99s a man of the world like ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ... yes. I think I know him. Rather red face; tall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd tell me, Martin.... Is he a good preacher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMunno.... It\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a sermon, you know. It\xe2\x80\x99s just kind of a\r\nfriendly talk, you know, in a common-sense way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Kernan deliberated. Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Tom Burke, that was the boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Father Tom Burke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was a born orator. Did\r\nyou ever hear him, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I ever hear him!\xe2\x80\x9d said the invalid, nettled. \xe2\x80\x9cRather! I heard\r\nhim....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet they say he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much of a theologian,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, of course, nothing wrong, you know. Only sometimes, they say, he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t preach what was quite orthodox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! ... he was a splendid man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard him once,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Kernan continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI forget the subject of his\r\ndiscourse now. Crofton and I were in the back of the ... pit, you know\r\n... the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe body,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in the back near the door. I forget now what.... O yes, it was on\r\nthe Pope, the late Pope. I remember it well. Upon my word it was\r\nmagnificent, the style of the oratory. And his voice! God! hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he a\r\nvoice! _The Prisoner of the Vatican_, he called him. I remember Crofton\r\nsaying to me when we came out\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99s an Orangeman, Crofton, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Course he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan, \xe2\x80\x9cand a damned decent Orangeman too. We\r\nwent into Butler\xe2\x80\x99s in Moore Street\xe2\x80\x94faith, I was genuinely moved, tell\r\nyou the God\xe2\x80\x99s truth\xe2\x80\x94and I remember well his very words. _Kernan_, he\r\nsaid, _we worship at different altars_, he said, _but our belief is the\r\nsame_. Struck me as very well put.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal in that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power. \xe2\x80\x9cThere used always to be\r\ncrowds of Protestants in the chapel where Father Tom was preaching.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not much difference between us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe both believe in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... in the Redeemer. Only they don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the Pope and in the\r\nmother of God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham quietly and effectively, \xe2\x80\x9cour\r\nreligion is _the_ religion, the old, original faith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan warmly.\r\n\r\nMrs Kernan came to the door of the bedroom and announced:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a visitor for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Fogarty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, come in! come in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pale oval face came forward into the light. The arch of its fair\r\ntrailing moustache was repeated in the fair eyebrows looped above\r\npleasantly astonished eyes. Mr Fogarty was a modest grocer. He had\r\nfailed in business in a licensed house in the city because his\r\nfinancial condition had constrained him to tie himself to second-class\r\ndistillers and brewers. He had opened a small shop on Glasnevin Road\r\nwhere, he flattered himself, his manners would ingratiate him with the\r\nhousewives of the district. He bore himself with a certain grace,\r\ncomplimented little children and spoke with a neat enunciation. He was\r\nnot without culture.\r\n\r\nMr Fogarty brought a gift with him, a half-pint of special whisky. He\r\ninquired politely for Mr Kernan, placed his gift on the table and sat\r\ndown with the company on equal terms. Mr Kernan appreciated the gift\r\nall the more since he was aware that there was a small account for\r\ngroceries unsettled between him and Mr Fogarty. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt you, old man. Open that, Jack, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Power again officiated. Glasses were rinsed and five small measures\r\nof whisky were poured out. This new influence enlivened the\r\nconversation. Mr Fogarty, sitting on a small area of the chair, was\r\nspecially interested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPope Leo XIII.,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham, \xe2\x80\x9cwas one of the lights of the\r\nage. His great idea, you know, was the union of the Latin and Greek\r\nChurches. That was the aim of his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often heard he was one of the most intellectual men in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr Power. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, apart from his being Pope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham, \xe2\x80\x9cif not _the_ most so. His motto, you\r\nknow, as Pope, was _Lux upon Lux\xe2\x80\x94Light upon Light_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Fogarty eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong there. It was\r\n_Lux in Tenebris_, I think\xe2\x80\x94_Light in Darkness_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy, \xe2\x80\x9c_Tenebrae_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham positively, \xe2\x80\x9cit was _Lux upon Lux_. And\r\nPius IX. his predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s motto was _Crux upon Crux_\xe2\x80\x94that is, _Cross\r\nupon Cross_\xe2\x80\x94to show the difference between their two pontificates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe inference was allowed. Mr Cunningham continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPope Leo, you know, was a great scholar and a poet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had a strong face,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wrote Latin poetry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Fogarty.\r\n\r\nMr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy tasted his whisky contentedly and shook his head with a double\r\nintention, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no joke, I can tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn that, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power, following Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexample, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we went to the penny-a-week school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was many a good man went to the penny-a-week school with a sod\r\nof turf under his oxter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan sententiously. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old system\r\nwas the best: plain honest education. None of your modern trumpery....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo superfluities,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Fogarty.\r\n\r\nHe enunciated the word and then drank gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember reading,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one of Pope Leo\xe2\x80\x99s poems\r\nwas on the invention of the photograph\xe2\x80\x94in Latin, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the photograph!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr Kernan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham.\r\n\r\nHe also drank from his glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t the photograph wonderful when\r\nyou come to think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power, \xe2\x80\x9cgreat minds can see things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the poet says: _Great minds are very near to madness_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nFogarty.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan seemed to be troubled in mind. He made an effort to recall\r\nthe Protestant theology on some thorny points and in the end addressed\r\nMr Cunningham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Martin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWeren\xe2\x80\x99t some of the popes\xe2\x80\x94of course, not\r\nour present man, or his predecessor, but some of the old popes\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nexactly ... you know ... up to the knocker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Mr Cunningham said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, of course, there were some bad lots.... But the astonishing thing\r\nis this. Not one of them, not the biggest drunkard, not the most ...\r\nout-and-out ruffian, not one of them ever preached _ex cathedra_ a word\r\nof false doctrine. Now isn\xe2\x80\x99t that an astonishing thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, because when the Pope speaks _ex cathedra_,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Fogarty\r\nexplained, \xe2\x80\x9che is infallible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I know about the infallibility of the Pope. I remember I was\r\nyounger then.... Or was it that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Fogarty interrupted. He took up the bottle and helped the others to\r\na little more. Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy, seeing that there was not enough to go round,\r\npleaded that he had not finished his first measure. The others accepted\r\nunder protest. The light music of whisky falling into glasses made an\r\nagreeable interlude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that you were saying, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapal infallibility,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was the greatest scene\r\nin the whole history of the Church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was that, Martin?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Power.\r\n\r\nMr Cunningham held up two thick fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the sacred college, you know, of cardinals and archbishops and\r\nbishops there were two men who held out against it while the others\r\nwere all for it. The whole conclave except these two was unanimous. No!\r\nThey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they were a German cardinal by the name of Dolling ... or Dowling\r\n... or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDowling was no German, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a sure five,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this great German cardinal, whatever his name was, was one; and\r\nthe other was John MacHale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr Kernan. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it John of Tuam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of that now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Fogarty dubiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it\r\nwas some Italian or American.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn of Tuam,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr Cunningham, \xe2\x80\x9cwas the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drank and the other gentlemen followed his lead. Then he resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere they were at it, all the cardinals and bishops and archbishops\r\nfrom all the ends of the earth and these two fighting dog and devil\r\nuntil at last the Pope himself stood up and declared infallibility a\r\ndogma of the Church _ex cathedra_. On the very moment John MacHale, who\r\nhad been arguing and arguing against it, stood up and shouted out with\r\nthe voice of a lion: \xe2\x80\x98_Credo!_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I believe!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Fogarty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Credo!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham. \xe2\x80\x9cThat showed the faith he had. He\r\nsubmitted the moment the Pope spoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about Dowling?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe German cardinal wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t submit. He left the church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Cunningham\xe2\x80\x99s words had built up the vast image of the church in the\r\nminds of his hearers. His deep raucous voice had thrilled them as it\r\nuttered the word of belief and submission. When Mrs Kernan came into\r\nthe room drying her hands she came into a solemn company. She did not\r\ndisturb the silence, but leaned over the rail at the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI once saw John MacHale,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget it as\r\nlong as I live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned towards his wife to be confirmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often told you that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Kernan nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was at the unveiling of Sir John Gray\xe2\x80\x99s statue. Edmund Dwyer Gray\r\nwas speaking, blathering away, and here was this old fellow,\r\ncrabbed-looking old chap, looking at him from under his bushy\r\neyebrows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Kernan knitted his brows and, lowering his head like an angry bull,\r\nglared at his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, resuming his natural face, \xe2\x80\x9cI never saw such an\r\neye in a man\xe2\x80\x99s head. It was as much as to say: _I have you properly\r\ntaped, my lad_. He had an eye like a hawk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of the Grays was any good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Power.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause again. Mr Power turned to Mrs Kernan and said with\r\nabrupt joviality:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs Kernan, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make your man here a good holy pious\r\nand God-fearing Roman Catholic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe swept his arm round the company inclusively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all going to make a retreat together and confess our sins\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nGod knows we want it badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan, smiling a little nervously.\r\n\r\nMrs Kernan thought it would be wiser to conceal her satisfaction. So\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pity the poor priest that has to listen to your tale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Kernan\xe2\x80\x99s expression changed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said bluntly, \xe2\x80\x9che can ... do the other\r\nthing. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell him my little tale of woe. I\xe2\x80\x99m not such a bad\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Cunningham intervened promptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll all renounce the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctogether, not forgetting his\r\nworks and pomps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet behind me, Satan!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Fogarty, laughing and looking at the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nMr Power said nothing. He felt completely out-generalled. But a pleased\r\nexpression flickered across his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll we have to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham, \xe2\x80\x9cis to stand up with lighted\r\ncandles in our hands and renew our baptismal vows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget the candle, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan. \xe2\x80\x9cMust I have a candle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Cunningham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, damn it all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan sensibly, \xe2\x80\x9cI draw the line there.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do the job right enough. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the retreat business and\r\nconfession, and ... all that business. But ... no candles! No, damn it\r\nall, I bar the candles!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head with farcical gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to that!\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bar the candles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Kernan, conscious of having created an\r\neffect on his audience and continuing to shake his head to and fro. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbar the magic-lantern business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a nice Catholic for you!\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo candles!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr Kernan obdurately. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transept of the Jesuit Church in Gardiner Street was almost full;\r\nand still at every moment gentlemen entered from the side door and,\r\ndirected by the lay-brother, walked on tiptoe along the aisles until\r\nthey found seating accommodation. The gentlemen were all well dressed\r\nand orderly. The light of the lamps of the church fell upon an assembly\r\nof black clothes and white collars, relieved here and there by tweeds,\r\non dark mottled pillars of green marble and on lugubrious canvases. The\r\ngentlemen sat in the benches, having hitched their trousers slightly\r\nabove their knees and laid their hats in security. They sat well back\r\nand gazed formally at the distant speck of red light which was\r\nsuspended before the high altar.\r\n\r\nIn one of the benches near the pulpit sat Mr Cunningham and Mr Kernan.\r\nIn the bench behind sat Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy alone: and in the bench behind him sat\r\nMr Power and Mr Fogarty. Mr M\xe2\x80\x99Coy had tried unsuccessfully to find a\r\nplace in the bench with the others and, when the party had settled down\r\nin the form of a quincunx, he had tried unsuccessfully to make comic\r\nremarks. As these had not been well received he had desisted. Even he\r\nwas sensible of the decorous atmosphere and even he began to respond to\r\nthe religious stimulus. In a whisper Mr Cunningham drew Mr Kernan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention to Mr Harford, the moneylender, who sat some distance off,\r\nand to Mr Fanning, the registration agent and mayor maker of the city,\r\nwho was sitting immediately under the pulpit beside one of the newly\r\nelected councillors of the ward. To the right sat old Michael Grimes,\r\nthe owner of three pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s shops, and Dan Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s nephew, who was\r\nup for the job in the Town Clerk\xe2\x80\x99s office. Farther in front sat Mr\r\nHendrick, the chief reporter of _The Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Journal_, and poor\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Carroll, an old friend of Mr Kernan\xe2\x80\x99s, who had been at one time a\r\nconsiderable commercial figure. Gradually, as he recognised familiar\r\nfaces, Mr Kernan began to feel more at home. His hat, which had been\r\nrehabilitated by his wife, rested upon his knees. Once or twice he\r\npulled down his cuffs with one hand while he held the brim of his hat\r\nlightly, but firmly, with the other hand.\r\n\r\nA powerful-looking figure, the upper part of which was draped with a\r\nwhite surplice, was observed to be struggling up into the pulpit.\r\nSimultaneously the congregation unsettled, produced handkerchiefs and\r\nknelt upon them with care. Mr Kernan followed the general example. The\r\npriest\xe2\x80\x99s figure now stood upright in the pulpit, two-thirds of its\r\nbulk, crowned by a massive red face, appearing above the balustrade.\r\n\r\nFather Purdon knelt down, turned towards the red speck of light and,\r\ncovering his face with his hands, prayed. After an interval, he\r\nuncovered his face and rose. The congregation rose also and settled\r\nagain on its benches. Mr Kernan restored his hat to its original\r\nposition on his knee and presented an attentive face to the preacher.\r\nThe preacher turned back each wide sleeve of his surplice with an\r\nelaborate large gesture and slowly surveyed the array of faces. Then he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cFor the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the\r\nchildren of light. Wherefore make unto yourselves friends out of the\r\nmammon of iniquity so that when you die they may receive you into\r\neverlasting dwellings.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\nFather Purdon developed the text with resonant assurance. It was one of\r\nthe most difficult texts in all the Scriptures, he said, to interpret\r\nproperly. It was a text which might seem to the casual observer at\r\nvariance with the lofty morality elsewhere preached by Jesus Christ.\r\nBut, he told his hearers, the text had seemed to him specially adapted\r\nfor the guidance of those whose lot it was to lead the life of the\r\nworld and who yet wished to lead that life not in the manner of\r\nworldlings. It was a text for business men and professional men. Jesus\r\nChrist, with His divine understanding of every cranny of our human\r\nnature, understood that all men were not called to the religious life,\r\nthat by far the vast majority were forced to live in the world and, to\r\na certain extent, for the world: and in this sentence He designed to\r\ngive them a word of counsel, setting before them as exemplars in the\r\nreligious life those very worshippers of Mammon who were of all men the\r\nleast solicitous in matters religious.\r\n\r\nHe told his hearers that he was there that evening for no terrifying,\r\nno extravagant purpose; but as a man of the world speaking to his\r\nfellow-men. He came to speak to business men and he would speak to them\r\nin a businesslike way. If he might use the metaphor, he said, he was\r\ntheir spiritual accountant; and he wished each and every one of his\r\nhearers to open his books, the books of his spiritual life, and see if\r\nthey tallied accurately with conscience.\r\n\r\nJesus Christ was not a hard taskmaster. He understood our little\r\nfailings, understood the weakness of our poor fallen nature, understood\r\nthe temptations of this life. We might have had, we all had from time\r\nto time, our temptations: we might have, we all had, our failings. But\r\none thing only, he said, he would ask of his hearers. And that was: to\r\nbe straight and manly with God. If their accounts tallied in every\r\npoint to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have verified my accounts. I find all well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut if, as might happen, there were some discrepancies, to admit the\r\ntruth, to be frank and say like a man:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have looked into my accounts. I find this wrong and this\r\nwrong. But, with God\xe2\x80\x99s grace, I will rectify this and this. I will set\r\nright my accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEAD\r\n\r\n\r\nLily, the caretaker\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, was literally run off her feet. Hardly\r\nhad she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office\r\non the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the\r\nwheezy hall-door bell clanged again and she had to scamper along the\r\nbare hallway to let in another guest. It was well for her she had not\r\nto attend to the ladies also. But Miss Kate and Miss Julia had thought\r\nof that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndressing-room. Miss Kate and Miss Julia were there, gossiping and\r\nlaughing and fussing, walking after each other to the head of the\r\nstairs, peering down over the banisters and calling down to Lily to ask\r\nher who had come.\r\n\r\nIt was always a great affair, the Misses Morkan\xe2\x80\x99s annual dance.\r\nEverybody who knew them came to it, members of the family, old friends\r\nof the family, the members of Julia\xe2\x80\x99s choir, any of Kate\xe2\x80\x99s pupils that\r\nwere grown up enough, and even some of Mary Jane\xe2\x80\x99s pupils too. Never\r\nonce had it fallen flat. For years and years it had gone off in\r\nsplendid style as long as anyone could remember; ever since Kate and\r\nJulia, after the death of their brother Pat, had left the house in\r\nStoney Batter and taken Mary Jane, their only niece, to live with them\r\nin the dark gaunt house on Usher\xe2\x80\x99s Island, the upper part of which they\r\nhad rented from Mr Fulham, the corn-factor on the ground floor. That\r\nwas a good thirty years ago if it was a day. Mary Jane, who was then a\r\nlittle girl in short clothes, was now the main prop of the household,\r\nfor she had the organ in Haddington Road. She had been through the\r\nAcademy and gave a pupils\xe2\x80\x99 concert every year in the upper room of the\r\nAntient Concert Rooms. Many of her pupils belonged to the better-class\r\nfamilies on the Kingstown and Dalkey line. Old as they were, her aunts\r\nalso did their share. Julia, though she was quite grey, was still the\r\nleading soprano in Adam and Eve\xe2\x80\x99s, and Kate, being too feeble to go\r\nabout much, gave music lessons to beginners on the old square piano in\r\nthe back room. Lily, the caretaker\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, did housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s work for\r\nthem. Though their life was modest they believed in eating well; the\r\nbest of everything: diamond-bone sirloins, three-shilling tea and the\r\nbest bottled stout. But Lily seldom made a mistake in the orders so\r\nthat she got on well with her three mistresses. They were fussy, that\r\nwas all. But the only thing they would not stand was back answers.\r\n\r\nOf course they had good reason to be fussy on such a night. And then it\r\nwas long after ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock and yet there was no sign of Gabriel and his\r\nwife. Besides they were dreadfully afraid that Freddy Malins might turn\r\nup screwed. They would not wish for worlds that any of Mary Jane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npupils should see him under the influence; and when he was like that it\r\nwas sometimes very hard to manage him. Freddy Malins always came late\r\nbut they wondered what could be keeping Gabriel: and that was what\r\nbrought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask Lily had Gabriel\r\nor Freddy come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Mr Conroy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lily to Gabriel when she opened the door for him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Kate and Miss Julia thought you were never coming. Good-night,\r\nMrs Conroy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll engage they did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they forget that my wife\r\nhere takes three mortal hours to dress herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood on the mat, scraping the snow from his goloshes, while Lily\r\nled his wife to the foot of the stairs and called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Kate, here\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs Conroy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKate and Julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once. Both of them\r\nkissed Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s wife, said she must be perished alive and asked was\r\nGabriel with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am as right as the mail, Aunt Kate! Go on up. I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncalled out Gabriel from the dark.\r\n\r\nHe continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women went\r\nupstairs, laughing, to the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 dressing-room. A light fringe of\r\nsnow lay like a cape on the shoulders of his overcoat and like toecaps\r\non the toes of his goloshes; and, as the buttons of his overcoat\r\nslipped with a squeaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a\r\ncold, fragrant air from out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it snowing again, Mr Conroy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lily.\r\n\r\nShe had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat.\r\nGabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and\r\nglanced at her. She was a slim, growing girl, pale in complexion and\r\nwith hay-coloured hair. The gas in the pantry made her look still\r\npaler. Gabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on\r\nthe lowest step nursing a rag doll.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Lily,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think we\xe2\x80\x99re in for a night of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked up at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking with the stamping\r\nand shuffling of feet on the floor above, listened for a moment to the\r\npiano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his overcoat\r\ncarefully at the end of a shelf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Lily,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a friendly tone, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you still go to\r\nschool?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m done schooling this year and more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we\xe2\x80\x99ll be going to your\r\nwedding one of these fine days with your young man, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with great\r\nbitterness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel coloured as if he felt he had made a mistake and, without\r\nlooking at her, kicked off his goloshes and flicked actively with his\r\nmuffler at his patent-leather shoes.\r\n\r\nHe was a stout tallish young man. The high colour of his cheeks pushed\r\nupwards even to his forehead where it scattered itself in a few\r\nformless patches of pale red; and on his hairless face there\r\nscintillated restlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt rims of\r\nthe glasses which screened his delicate and restless eyes. His glossy\r\nblack hair was parted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind\r\nhis ears where it curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat.\r\n\r\nWhen he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled his\r\nwaistcoat down more tightly on his plump body. Then he took a coin\r\nrapidly from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lily,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, thrusting it into her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas-time,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Just ... here\xe2\x80\x99s a little....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked rapidly towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl, following him. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, sir, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristmas-time! Christmas-time!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, almost trotting to the\r\nstairs and waving his hand to her in deprecation.\r\n\r\nThe girl, seeing that he had gained the stairs, called out after him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, thank you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited outside the drawing-room door until the waltz should finish,\r\nlistening to the skirts that swept against it and to the shuffling of\r\nfeet. He was still discomposed by the girl\xe2\x80\x99s bitter and sudden retort.\r\nIt had cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his\r\ncuffs and the bows of his tie. He then took from his waistcoat pocket a\r\nlittle paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech. He\r\nwas undecided about the lines from Robert Browning for he feared they\r\nwould be above the heads of his hearers. Some quotation that they would\r\nrecognise from Shakespeare or from the Melodies would be better. The\r\nindelicate clacking of the men\xe2\x80\x99s heels and the shuffling of their soles\r\nreminded him that their grade of culture differed from his. He would\r\nonly make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they could\r\nnot understand. They would think that he was airing his superior\r\neducation. He would fail with them just as he had failed with the girl\r\nin the pantry. He had taken up a wrong tone. His whole speech was a\r\nmistake from first to last, an utter failure.\r\n\r\nJust then his aunts and his wife came out of the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 dressing-room.\r\nHis aunts were two small plainly dressed old women. Aunt Julia was an\r\ninch or so the taller. Her hair, drawn low over the tops of her ears,\r\nwas grey; and grey also, with darker shadows, was her large flaccid\r\nface. Though she was stout in build and stood erect her slow eyes and\r\nparted lips gave her the appearance of a woman who did not know where\r\nshe was or where she was going. Aunt Kate was more vivacious. Her face,\r\nhealthier than her sister\xe2\x80\x99s, was all puckers and creases, like a\r\nshrivelled red apple, and her hair, braided in the same old-fashioned\r\nway, had not lost its ripe nut colour.\r\n\r\nThey both kissed Gabriel frankly. He was their favourite nephew, the\r\nson of their dead elder sister, Ellen, who had married T. J. Conroy of\r\nthe Port and Docks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGretta tells me you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to take a cab back to Monkstown\r\ntonight, Gabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, turning to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cwe had quite enough of that\r\nlast year, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t we? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember, Aunt Kate, what a cold Gretta\r\ngot out of it? Cab windows rattling all the way, and the east wind\r\nblowing in after we passed Merrion. Very jolly it was. Gretta caught a\r\ndreadful cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, Gabriel, quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t be too\r\ncareful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as for Gretta there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99d walk home in the snow\r\nif she were let.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Conroy laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind him, Aunt Kate,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s really an awful bother,\r\nwhat with green shades for Tom\xe2\x80\x99s eyes at night and making him do the\r\ndumb-bells, and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout. The poor child! And\r\nshe simply hates the sight of it!... O, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll never guess what he\r\nmakes me wear now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her husband, whose\r\nadmiring and happy eyes had been wandering from her dress to her face\r\nand hair. The two aunts laughed heartily too, for Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s solicitude\r\nwas a standing joke with them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoloshes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Conroy. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the latest. Whenever it\xe2\x80\x99s wet\r\nunderfoot I must put on my goloshes. Tonight even he wanted me to put\r\nthem on, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. The next thing he\xe2\x80\x99ll buy me will be a diving\r\nsuit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly while Aunt\r\nKate nearly doubled herself, so heartily did she enjoy the joke. The\r\nsmile soon faded from Aunt Julia\xe2\x80\x99s face and her mirthless eyes were\r\ndirected towards her nephew\xe2\x80\x99s face. After a pause she asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are goloshes, Gabriel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoloshes, Julia!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her sister. \xe2\x80\x9cGoodness me, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know\r\nwhat goloshes are? You wear them over your ... over your boots, Gretta,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Conroy. \xe2\x80\x9cGuttapercha things. We both have a pair now.\r\nGabriel says everyone wears them on the continent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, on the continent,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Aunt Julia, nodding her head slowly.\r\n\r\nGabriel knitted his brows and said, as if he were slightly angered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing very wonderful but Gretta thinks it very funny because\r\nshe says the word reminds her of Christy Minstrels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me, Gabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate, with brisk tact. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen about the room. Gretta was saying....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, the room is all right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve taken one in the\r\nGresham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate, \xe2\x80\x9cby far the best thing to do. And the\r\nchildren, Gretta, you\xe2\x80\x99re not anxious about them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, for one night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Conroy. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, Bessie will look after\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a comfort it is to have a\r\ngirl like that, one you can depend on! There\xe2\x80\x99s that Lily, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what has come over her lately. She\xe2\x80\x99s not the girl she was at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point but she\r\nbroke off suddenly to gaze after her sister who had wandered down the\r\nstairs and was craning her neck over the banisters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said almost testily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is Julia going?\r\nJulia! Julia! Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and announced\r\nblandly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Freddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the\r\npianist told that the waltz had ended. The drawing-room door was opened\r\nfrom within and some couples came out. Aunt Kate drew Gabriel aside\r\nhurriedly and whispered into his ear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he\xe2\x80\x99s all right, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t let him up if he\xe2\x80\x99s screwed. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s screwed. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters. He could\r\nhear two persons talking in the pantry. Then he recognised Freddy\r\nMalins\xe2\x80\x99 laugh. He went down the stairs noisily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s such a relief,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate to Mrs Conroy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Gabriel is\r\nhere. I always feel easier in my mind when he\xe2\x80\x99s here.... Julia, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMiss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment. Thanks for your\r\nbeautiful waltz, Miss Daly. It made lovely time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tall wizen-faced man, with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy\r\nskin, who was passing out with his partner said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd may we have some refreshment, too, Miss Morkan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJulia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate summarily, \xe2\x80\x9cand here\xe2\x80\x99s Mr Browne and Miss\r\nFurlong. Take them in, Julia, with Miss Daly and Miss Power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the man for the ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Browne, pursing his lips until\r\nhis moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Miss\r\nMorkan, the reason they are so fond of me is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not finish his sentence, but, seeing that Aunt Kate was out of\r\nearshot, at once led the three young ladies into the back room. The\r\nmiddle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to end,\r\nand on these Aunt Julia and the caretaker were straightening and\r\nsmoothing a large cloth. On the sideboard were arrayed dishes and\r\nplates, and glasses and bundles of knives and forks and spoons. The top\r\nof the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands and\r\nsweets. At a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were\r\nstanding, drinking hop-bitters.\r\n\r\nMr Browne led his charges thither and invited them all, in jest, to\r\nsome ladies\xe2\x80\x99 punch, hot, strong and sweet. As they said they never took\r\nanything strong he opened three bottles of lemonade for them. Then he\r\nasked one of the young men to move aside, and, taking hold of the\r\ndecanter, filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky. The young\r\nmen eyed him respectfully while he took a trial sip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod help me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wizened face broke into a broader smile, and the three young ladies\r\nlaughed in musical echo to his pleasantry, swaying their bodies to and\r\nfro, with nervous jerks of their shoulders. The boldest said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, now, Mr Browne, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the doctor never ordered anything of the\r\nkind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Browne took another sip of his whisky and said, with sidling\r\nmimicry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, I\xe2\x80\x99m like the famous Mrs Cassidy, who is reported to\r\nhave said: \xe2\x80\x98Now, Mary Grimes, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t take it, make me take it, for\r\nI feel I want it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and he had\r\nassumed a very low Dublin accent so that the young ladies, with one\r\ninstinct, received his speech in silence. Miss Furlong, who was one of\r\nMary Jane\xe2\x80\x99s pupils, asked Miss Daly what was the name of the pretty\r\nwaltz she had played; and Mr Browne, seeing that he was ignored, turned\r\npromptly to the two young men who were more appreciative.\r\n\r\nA red-faced young woman, dressed in pansy, came into the room,\r\nexcitedly clapping her hands and crying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuadrilles! Quadrilles!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClose on her heels came Aunt Kate, crying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo gentlemen and three ladies, Mary Jane!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, here\xe2\x80\x99s Mr Bergin and Mr Kerrigan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cMr Kerrigan,\r\nwill you take Miss Power? Miss Furlong, may I get you a partner, Mr\r\nBergin. O, that\xe2\x80\x99ll just do now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree ladies, Mary Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate.\r\n\r\nThe two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the\r\npleasure, and Mary Jane turned to Miss Daly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Miss Daly, you\xe2\x80\x99re really awfully good, after playing for the last\r\ntwo dances, but really we\xe2\x80\x99re so short of ladies tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind in the least, Miss Morkan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve a nice partner for you, Mr Bartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy, the tenor. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget him to sing later on. All Dublin is raving about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLovely voice, lovely voice!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate.\r\n\r\nAs the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure Mary Jane\r\nled her recruits quickly from the room. They had hardly gone when Aunt\r\nJulia wandered slowly into the room, looking behind her at something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, Julia?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Aunt Kate anxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to her\r\nsister and said, simply, as if the question had surprised her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins\r\nacross the landing. The latter, a young man of about forty, was of\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was\r\nfleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes\r\nof his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features,\r\na blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His\r\nheavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look\r\nsleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had\r\nbeen telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the\r\nknuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-evening, Freddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Julia.\r\n\r\nFreddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an\r\noffhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then,\r\nseeing that Mr Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed\r\nthe room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the\r\nstory he had just told to Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad, is he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate to Gabriel.\r\n\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, no, hardly noticeable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he a terrible fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd his poor mother made\r\nhim take the pledge on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve. But come on, Gabriel, into the\r\ndrawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr Browne by\r\nfrowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr Browne\r\nnodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, Teddy, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade\r\njust to buck you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFreddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer\r\naside impatiently but Mr Browne, having first called Freddy Malins\xe2\x80\x99\r\nattention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a full\r\nglass of lemonade. Freddy Malins\xe2\x80\x99 left hand accepted the glass\r\nmechanically, his right hand being engaged in the mechanical\r\nreadjustment of his dress. Mr Browne, whose face was once more\r\nwrinkling with mirth, poured out for himself a glass of whisky while\r\nFreddy Malins exploded, before he had well reached the climax of his\r\nstory, in a kink of high-pitched bronchitic laughter and, setting down\r\nhis untasted and overflowing glass, began to rub the knuckles of his\r\nleft fist backwards and forwards into his left eye, repeating words of\r\nhis last phrase as well as his fit of laughter would allow him.\r\n\r\n\r\nGabriel could not listen while Mary Jane was playing her Academy piece,\r\nfull of runs and difficult passages, to the hushed drawing-room. He\r\nliked music but the piece she was playing had no melody for him and he\r\ndoubted whether it had any melody for the other listeners, though they\r\nhad begged Mary Jane to play something. Four young men, who had come\r\nfrom the refreshment-room to stand in the doorway at the sound of the\r\npiano, had gone away quietly in couples after a few minutes. The only\r\npersons who seemed to follow the music were Mary Jane herself, her\r\nhands racing along the keyboard or lifted from it at the pauses like\r\nthose of a priestess in momentary imprecation, and Aunt Kate standing\r\nat her elbow to turn the page.\r\n\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, irritated by the floor, which glittered with beeswax\r\nunder the heavy chandelier, wandered to the wall above the piano. A\r\npicture of the balcony scene in _Romeo and Juliet_ hung there and\r\nbeside it was a picture of the two murdered princes in the Tower which\r\nAunt Julia had worked in red, blue and brown wools when she was a girl.\r\nProbably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had\r\nbeen taught for one year. His mother had worked for him as a birthday\r\npresent a waistcoat of purple tabinet, with little foxes\xe2\x80\x99 heads upon\r\nit, lined with brown satin and having round mulberry buttons. It was\r\nstrange that his mother had had no musical talent though Aunt Kate used\r\nto call her the brains carrier of the Morkan family. Both she and Julia\r\nhad always seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister.\r\nHer photograph stood before the pierglass. She held an open book on her\r\nknees and was pointing out something in it to Constantine who, dressed\r\nin a man-o\xe2\x80\x99-war suit, lay at her feet. It was she who had chosen the\r\nname of her sons for she was very sensible of the dignity of family\r\nlife. Thanks to her, Constantine was now senior curate in Balbrigan\r\nand, thanks to her, Gabriel himself had taken his degree in the Royal\r\nUniversity. A shadow passed over his face as he remembered her sullen\r\nopposition to his marriage. Some slighting phrases she had used still\r\nrankled in his memory; she had once spoken of Gretta as being country\r\ncute and that was not true of Gretta at all. It was Gretta who had\r\nnursed her during all her last long illness in their house at\r\nMonkstown.\r\n\r\nHe knew that Mary Jane must be near the end of her piece for she was\r\nplaying again the opening melody with runs of scales after every bar\r\nand while he waited for the end the resentment died down in his heart.\r\nThe piece ended with a trill of octaves in the treble and a final deep\r\noctave in the bass. Great applause greeted Mary Jane as, blushing and\r\nrolling up her music nervously, she escaped from the room. The most\r\nvigorous clapping came from the four young men in the doorway who had\r\ngone away to the refreshment-room at the beginning of the piece but had\r\ncome back when the piano had stopped.\r\n\r\nLancers were arranged. Gabriel found himself partnered with Miss Ivors.\r\nShe was a frank-mannered talkative young lady, with a freckled face and\r\nprominent brown eyes. She did not wear a low-cut bodice and the large\r\nbrooch which was fixed in the front of her collar bore on it an Irish\r\ndevice and motto.\r\n\r\nWhen they had taken their places she said abruptly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a crow to pluck with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gabriel, smiling at her solemn manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is G. C.?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miss Ivors, turning her eyes upon him.\r\n\r\nGabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows, as if he did not\r\nunderstand, when she said bluntly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, innocent Amy! I have found out that you write for _The Daily\r\nExpress_. Now, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you ashamed of yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I be ashamed of myself?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gabriel, blinking his eyes\r\nand trying to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ivors frankly. \xe2\x80\x9cTo say you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nwrite for a paper like that. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you were a West Briton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s face. It was true that he\r\nwrote a literary column every Wednesday in _The Daily Express_, for\r\nwhich he was paid fifteen shillings. But that did not make him a West\r\nBriton surely. The books he received for review were almost more\r\nwelcome than the paltry cheque. He loved to feel the covers and turn\r\nover the pages of newly printed books. Nearly every day when his\r\nteaching in the college was ended he used to wander down the quays to\r\nthe second-hand booksellers, to Hickey\xe2\x80\x99s on Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s Walk, to Webb\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nor Massey\xe2\x80\x99s on Aston\xe2\x80\x99s Quay, or to O\xe2\x80\x99Clohissey\xe2\x80\x99s in the by-street. He\r\ndid not know how to meet her charge. He wanted to say that literature\r\nwas above politics. But they were friends of many years\xe2\x80\x99 standing and\r\ntheir careers had been parallel, first at the university and then as\r\nteachers: he could not risk a grandiose phrase with her. He continued\r\nblinking his eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw\r\nnothing political in writing reviews of books.\r\n\r\nWhen their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and\r\ninattentive. Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said\r\nin a soft friendly tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I was only joking. Come, we cross now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they were together again she spoke of the University question and\r\nGabriel felt more at ease. A friend of hers had shown her his review of\r\nBrowning\xe2\x80\x99s poems. That was how she had found out the secret: but she\r\nliked the review immensely. Then she said suddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Mr Conroy, will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles this\r\nsummer? We\xe2\x80\x99re going to stay there a whole month. It will be splendid\r\nout in the Atlantic. You ought to come. Mr Clancy is coming, and Mr\r\nKilkelly and Kathleen Kearney. It would be splendid for Gretta too if\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d come. She\xe2\x80\x99s from Connacht, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer people are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will come, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ivors, laying her warm hand\r\neagerly on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, \xe2\x80\x9cI have just arranged to go\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo where?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Ivors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, every year I go for a cycling tour with some fellows\r\nand so\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Ivors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGabriel awkwardly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why do you go to France and Belgium,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ivors, \xe2\x80\x9cinstead of\r\nvisiting your own land?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s partly to keep in touch with the languages\r\nand partly for a change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd haven\xe2\x80\x99t you your own language to keep in touch with\xe2\x80\x94Irish?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMiss Ivors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, \xe2\x80\x9cif it comes to that, you know, Irish is not my\r\nlanguage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir neighbours had turned to listen to the cross-examination. Gabriel\r\nglanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good humour\r\nunder the ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd haven\xe2\x80\x99t you your own land to visit,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Miss Ivors, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nyou know nothing of, your own people, and your own country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, to tell you the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Gabriel suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sick of my\r\nown country, sick of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Ivors.\r\n\r\nGabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Miss Ivors.\r\n\r\nThey had to go visiting together and, as he had not answered her, Miss\r\nIvors said warmly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you\xe2\x80\x99ve no answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with\r\ngreat energy. He avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour expression on\r\nher face. But when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel\r\nhis hand firmly pressed. She looked at him from under her brows for a\r\nmoment quizzically until he smiled. Then, just as the chain was about\r\nto start again, she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWest Briton!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the\r\nroom where Freddy Malins\xe2\x80\x99 mother was sitting. She was a stout feeble\r\nold woman with white hair. Her voice had a catch in it like her son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand she stuttered slightly. She had been told that Freddy had come and\r\nthat he was nearly all right. Gabriel asked her whether she had had a\r\ngood crossing. She lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came\r\nto Dublin on a visit once a year. She answered placidly that she had\r\nhad a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive\r\nto her. She spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in\r\nGlasgow, and of all the friends they had there. While her tongue\r\nrambled on Gabriel tried to banish from his mind all memory of the\r\nunpleasant incident with Miss Ivors. Of course the girl or woman, or\r\nwhatever she was, was an enthusiast but there was a time for all\r\nthings. Perhaps he ought not to have answered her like that. But she\r\nhad no right to call him a West Briton before people, even in joke. She\r\nhad tried to make him ridiculous before people, heckling him and\r\nstaring at him with her rabbit\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\nHe saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing\r\ncouples. When she reached him she said into his ear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel, Aunt Kate wants to know won\xe2\x80\x99t you carve the goose as usual.\r\nMiss Daly will carve the ham and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the pudding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over\r\nso that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the table to ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you dancing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I was. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you see me? What row had you with Molly\r\nIvors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo row. Why? Did she say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething like that. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get that Mr D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy to sing. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfull of conceit, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no row,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel moodily, \xe2\x80\x9conly she wanted me to go for\r\na trip to the west of Ireland and I said I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, do go, Gabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d love to see Galway again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can go if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel coldly.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him for a moment, then turned to Mrs Malins and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a nice husband for you, Mrs Malins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile she was threading her way back across the room Mrs Malins,\r\nwithout adverting to the interruption, went on to tell Gabriel what\r\nbeautiful places there were in Scotland and beautiful scenery. Her\r\nson-in-law brought them every year to the lakes and they used to go\r\nfishing. Her son-in-law was a splendid fisher. One day he caught a\r\nbeautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner.\r\n\r\nGabriel hardly heard what she said. Now that supper was coming near he\r\nbegan to think again about his speech and about the quotation. When he\r\nsaw Freddy Malins coming across the room to visit his mother Gabriel\r\nleft the chair free for him and retired into the embrasure of the\r\nwindow. The room had already cleared and from the back room came the\r\nclatter of plates and knives. Those who still remained in the\r\ndrawing-room seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in\r\nlittle groups. Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s warm trembling fingers tapped the cold pane of\r\nthe window. How cool it must be outside! How pleasant it would be to\r\nwalk out alone, first along by the river and then through the park! The\r\nsnow would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright\r\ncap on the top of the Wellington Monument. How much more pleasant it\r\nwould be there than at the supper-table!\r\n\r\nHe ran over the headings of his speech: Irish hospitality, sad\r\nmemories, the Three Graces, Paris, the quotation from Browning. He\r\nrepeated to himself a phrase he had written in his review: \xe2\x80\x9cOne feels\r\nthat one is listening to a thought-tormented music.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Ivors had\r\npraised the review. Was she sincere? Had she really any life of her own\r\nbehind all her propagandism? There had never been any ill-feeling\r\nbetween them until that night. It unnerved him to think that she would\r\nbe at the supper-table, looking up at him while he spoke with her\r\ncritical quizzing eyes. Perhaps she would not be sorry to see him fail\r\nin his speech. An idea came into his mind and gave him courage. He\r\nwould say, alluding to Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia: \xe2\x80\x9cLadies and Gentlemen,\r\nthe generation which is now on the wane among us may have had its\r\nfaults but for my part I think it had certain qualities of hospitality,\r\nof humour, of humanity, which the new and very serious and\r\nhypereducated generation that is growing up around us seems to me to\r\nlack.\xe2\x80\x9d Very good: that was one for Miss Ivors. What did he care that\r\nhis aunts were only two ignorant old women?\r\n\r\nA murmur in the room attracted his attention. Mr Browne was advancing\r\nfrom the door, gallantly escorting Aunt Julia, who leaned upon his arm,\r\nsmiling and hanging her head. An irregular musketry of applause\r\nescorted her also as far as the piano and then, as Mary Jane seated\r\nherself on the stool, and Aunt Julia, no longer smiling, half turned so\r\nas to pitch her voice fairly into the room, gradually ceased. Gabriel\r\nrecognised the prelude. It was that of an old song of Aunt\r\nJulia\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94_Arrayed for the Bridal_. Her voice, strong and clear in tone,\r\nattacked with great spirit the runs which embellish the air and though\r\nshe sang very rapidly she did not miss even the smallest of the grace\r\nnotes. To follow the voice, without looking at the singer\xe2\x80\x99s face, was\r\nto feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight. Gabriel\r\napplauded loudly with all the others at the close of the song and loud\r\napplause was borne in from the invisible supper-table. It sounded so\r\ngenuine that a little colour struggled into Aunt Julia\xe2\x80\x99s face as she\r\nbent to replace in the music-stand the old leather-bound songbook that\r\nhad her initials on the cover. Freddy Malins, who had listened with his\r\nhead perched sideways to hear her better, was still applauding when\r\neveryone else had ceased and talking animatedly to his mother who\r\nnodded her head gravely and slowly in acquiescence. At last, when he\r\ncould clap no more, he stood up suddenly and hurried across the room to\r\nAunt Julia whose hand he seized and held in both his hands, shaking it\r\nwhen words failed him or the catch in his voice proved too much for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just telling my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard you sing so\r\nwell, never. No, I never heard your voice so good as it is tonight.\r\nNow! Would you believe that now? That\xe2\x80\x99s the truth. Upon my word and\r\nhonour that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth. I never heard your voice sound so fresh and so\r\n... so clear and fresh, never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Julia smiled broadly and murmured something about compliments as\r\nshe released her hand from his grasp. Mr Browne extended his open hand\r\ntowards her and said to those who were near him in the manner of a\r\nshowman introducing a prodigy to an audience:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Julia Morkan, my latest discovery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was laughing very heartily at this himself when Freddy Malins turned\r\nto him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Browne, if you\xe2\x80\x99re serious you might make a worse discovery. All\r\nI can say is I never heard her sing half so well as long as I am coming\r\nhere. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the honest truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither did I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Browne. \xe2\x80\x9cI think her voice has greatly\r\nimproved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Julia shrugged her shoulders and said with meek pride:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty years ago I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad voice as voices go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often told Julia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate emphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she was simply\r\nthrown away in that choir. But she never would be said by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others against a\r\nrefractory child while Aunt Julia gazed in front of her, a vague smile\r\nof reminiscence playing on her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Aunt Kate, \xe2\x80\x9cshe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be said or led by anyone,\r\nslaving there in that choir night and day, night and day. Six o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\non Christmas morning! And all for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it for the honour of God, Aunt Kate?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary Jane,\r\ntwisting round on the piano-stool and smiling.\r\n\r\nAunt Kate turned fiercely on her niece and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know all about the honour of God, Mary Jane, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s not at\r\nall honourable for the pope to turn out the women out of the choirs\r\nthat have slaved there all their lives and put little whipper-snappers\r\nof boys over their heads. I suppose it is for the good of the Church if\r\nthe pope does it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not just, Mary Jane, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in\r\ndefence of her sister for it was a sore subject with her but Mary Jane,\r\nseeing that all the dancers had come back, intervened pacifically:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Aunt Kate, you\xe2\x80\x99re giving scandal to Mr Browne who is of the other\r\npersuasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Kate turned to Mr Browne, who was grinning at this allusion to his\r\nreligion, and said hastily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I don\xe2\x80\x99t question the pope\xe2\x80\x99s being right. I\xe2\x80\x99m only a stupid old\r\nwoman and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t presume to do such a thing. But there\xe2\x80\x99s such a\r\nthing as common everyday politeness and gratitude. And if I were in\r\nJulia\xe2\x80\x99s place I\xe2\x80\x99d tell that Father Healey straight up to his face....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd besides, Aunt Kate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane, \xe2\x80\x9cwe really are all hungry and\r\nwhen we are hungry we are all very quarrelsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr Browne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that we had better go to supper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane, \xe2\x80\x9cand finish the\r\ndiscussion afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the landing outside the drawing-room Gabriel found his wife and Mary\r\nJane trying to persuade Miss Ivors to stay for supper. But Miss Ivors,\r\nwho had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak, would not stay. She\r\ndid not feel in the least hungry and she had already overstayed her\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut only for ten minutes, Molly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Conroy. \xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t delay\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo take a pick itself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane, \xe2\x80\x9cafter all your dancing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ivors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you didn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy yourself at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane\r\nhopelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver so much, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Ivors, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you really must let\r\nme run off now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can you get home?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs Conroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, it\xe2\x80\x99s only two steps up the quay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel hesitated a moment and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will allow me, Miss Ivors, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you home if you are really\r\nobliged to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Miss Ivors broke away from them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t hear of it,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cFor goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake go in to your\r\nsuppers and don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me. I\xe2\x80\x99m quite well able to take care of myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re the comical girl, Molly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Conroy frankly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Beannacht libh_,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Ivors, with a laugh, as she ran down the\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\nMary Jane gazed after her, a moody puzzled expression on her face,\r\nwhile Mrs Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the hall-door.\r\nGabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure. But she\r\ndid not seem to be in ill humour: she had gone away laughing. He stared\r\nblankly down the staircase.\r\n\r\nAt the moment Aunt Kate came toddling out of the supper-room, almost\r\nwringing her hands in despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Gabriel?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere on earth is Gabriel? There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neveryone waiting in there, stage to let, and nobody to carve the\r\ngoose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, Aunt Kate!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gabriel, with sudden animation, \xe2\x80\x9cready to\r\ncarve a flock of geese, if necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end, on\r\na bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham,\r\nstripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat\r\npaper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef.\r\nBetween these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little\r\nminsters of jelly, red and yellow; a shallow dish full of blocks of\r\nblancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a\r\nstalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled\r\nalmonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna\r\nfigs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of\r\nchocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass\r\nvase in which stood some tall celery stalks. In the centre of the table\r\nthere stood, as sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of\r\noranges and American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut\r\nglass, one containing port and the other dark sherry. On the closed\r\nsquare piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind\r\nit were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up\r\naccording to the colours of their uniforms, the first two black, with\r\nbrown and red labels, the third and smallest squad white, with\r\ntransverse green sashes.\r\n\r\nGabriel took his seat boldly at the head of the table and, having\r\nlooked to the edge of the carver, plunged his fork firmly into the\r\ngoose. He felt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked\r\nnothing better than to find himself at the head of a well-laden table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Furlong, what shall I send you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cA wing or a slice of\r\nthe breast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a small slice of the breast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Higgins, what for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, anything at all, Mr Conroy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Gabriel and Miss Daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham\r\nand spiced beef Lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury\r\npotatoes wrapped in a white napkin. This was Mary Jane\xe2\x80\x99s idea and she\r\nhad also suggested apple sauce for the goose but Aunt Kate had said\r\nthat plain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good\r\nenough for her and she hoped she might never eat worse. Mary Jane\r\nwaited on her pupils and saw that they got the best slices and Aunt\r\nKate and Aunt Julia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of\r\nstout and ale for the gentlemen and bottles of minerals for the ladies.\r\nThere was a great deal of confusion and laughter and noise, the noise\r\nof orders and counter-orders, of knives and forks, of corks and\r\nglass-stoppers. Gabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he\r\nhad finished the first round without serving himself. Everyone\r\nprotested loudly so that he compromised by taking a long draught of\r\nstout for he had found the carving hot work. Mary Jane settled down\r\nquietly to her supper but Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia were still toddling\r\nround the table, walking on each other\xe2\x80\x99s heels, getting in each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nway and giving each other unheeded orders. Mr Browne begged of them to\r\nsit down and eat their suppers and so did Gabriel but they said they\r\nwere time enough so that, at last, Freddy Malins stood up and,\r\ncapturing Aunt Kate, plumped her down on her chair amid general\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nWhen everyone had been well served Gabriel said, smiling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing\r\nlet him or her speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA chorus of voices invited him to begin his own supper and Lily came\r\nforward with three potatoes which she had reserved for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel amiably, as he took another preparatory\r\ndraught, \xe2\x80\x9ckindly forget my existence, ladies and gentlemen, for a few\r\nminutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with which\r\nthe table covered Lily\xe2\x80\x99s removal of the plates. The subject of talk was\r\nthe opera company which was then at the Theatre Royal. Mr Bartell\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Arcy, the tenor, a dark-complexioned young man with a smart\r\nmoustache, praised very highly the leading contralto of the company but\r\nMiss Furlong thought she had a rather vulgar style of production.\r\nFreddy Malins said there was a negro chieftain singing in the second\r\npart of the Gaiety pantomime who had one of the finest tenor voices he\r\nhad ever heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard him?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Mr Bartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy across the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr Bartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy carelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d Freddy Malins explained, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I\xe2\x80\x99d be curious to hear your\r\nopinion of him. I think he has a grand voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt takes Teddy to find out the really good things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Browne\r\nfamiliarly to the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t he have a voice too?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Freddy Malins sharply.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it because he\xe2\x80\x99s only a black?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody answered this question and Mary Jane led the table back to the\r\nlegitimate opera. One of her pupils had given her a pass for _Mignon_.\r\nOf course it was very fine, she said, but it made her think of poor\r\nGeorgina Burns. Mr Browne could go back farther still, to the old\r\nItalian companies that used to come to Dublin\xe2\x80\x94Tietjens, Ilma de Murzka,\r\nCampanini, the great Trebelli, Giuglini, Ravelli, Aramburo. Those were\r\nthe days, he said, when there was something like singing to be heard in\r\nDublin. He told too of how the top gallery of the old Royal used to be\r\npacked night after night, of how one night an Italian tenor had sung\r\nfive encores to _Let me like a Soldier fall_, introducing a high C\r\nevery time, and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their\r\nenthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great _prima\r\ndonna_ and pull her themselves through the streets to her hotel. Why\r\ndid they never play the grand old operas now, he asked, _Dinorah,\r\nLucrezia Borgia?_ Because they could not get the voices to sing them:\r\nthat was why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Bartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy, \xe2\x80\x9cI presume there are as good\r\nsingers today as there were then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Browne defiantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn London, Paris, Milan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Bartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\r\nCaruso, for example, is quite as good, if not better than any of the\r\nmen you have mentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Browne. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I may tell you I doubt it strongly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I\xe2\x80\x99d give anything to hear Caruso sing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate, who had been picking a bone, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was only\r\none tenor. To please me, I mean. But I suppose none of you ever heard\r\nof him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was he, Miss Morkan?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Bartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy politely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate, \xe2\x80\x9cwas Parkinson. I heard him when he was in\r\nhis prime and I think he had then the purest tenor voice that was ever\r\nput into a man\xe2\x80\x99s throat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Bartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy. \xe2\x80\x9cI never even heard of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, Miss Morkan is right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Browne. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember hearing\r\nof old Parkinson but he\xe2\x80\x99s too far back for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beautiful pure sweet mellow English tenor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate with\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nGabriel having finished, the huge pudding was transferred to the table.\r\nThe clatter of forks and spoons began again. Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s wife served out\r\nspoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the table. Midway\r\ndown they were held up by Mary Jane, who replenished them with\r\nraspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam. The pudding was\r\nof Aunt Julia\xe2\x80\x99s making and she received praises for it from all\r\nquarters. She herself said that it was not quite brown enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope, Miss Morkan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Browne, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99m brown enough for\r\nyou because, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m all brown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the gentlemen, except Gabriel, ate some of the pudding out of\r\ncompliment to Aunt Julia. As Gabriel never ate sweets the celery had\r\nbeen left for him. Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it\r\nwith his pudding. He had been told that celery was a capital thing for\r\nthe blood and he was just then under doctor\xe2\x80\x99s care. Mrs Malins, who had\r\nbeen silent all through the supper, said that her son was going down to\r\nMount Melleray in a week or so. The table then spoke of Mount Melleray,\r\nhow bracing the air was down there, how hospitable the monks were and\r\nhow they never asked for a penny-piece from their guests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you mean to say,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Browne incredulously, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a chap\r\ncan go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on\r\nthe fat of the land and then come away without paying anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mary Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we had an institution like that in our Church,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Browne\r\ncandidly.\r\n\r\nHe was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke, got up at two in\r\nthe morning and slept in their coffins. He asked what they did it for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the rule of the order,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but why?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Browne.\r\n\r\nAunt Kate repeated that it was the rule, that was all. Mr Browne still\r\nseemed not to understand. Freddy Malins explained to him, as best he\r\ncould, that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by\r\nall the sinners in the outside world. The explanation was not very\r\nclear for Mr Browne grinned and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like that idea very much but wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t a comfortable spring bed do\r\nthem as well as a coffin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe coffin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane, \xe2\x80\x9cis to remind them of their last end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the\r\ntable during which Mrs Malins could be heard saying to her neighbour in\r\nan indistinct undertone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are very good men, the monks, very pious men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates\r\nand sweets were now passed about the table and Aunt Julia invited all\r\nthe guests to have either port or sherry. At first Mr Bartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy\r\nrefused to take either but one of his neighbours nudged him and\r\nwhispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be\r\nfilled. Gradually as the last glasses were being filled the\r\nconversation ceased. A pause followed, broken only by the noise of the\r\nwine and by unsettlings of chairs. The Misses Morkan, all three, looked\r\ndown at the tablecloth. Someone coughed once or twice and then a few\r\ngentlemen patted the table gently as a signal for silence. The silence\r\ncame and Gabriel pushed back his chair.\r\n\r\nThe patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased\r\naltogether. Gabriel leaned his ten trembling fingers on the tablecloth\r\nand smiled nervously at the company. Meeting a row of upturned faces he\r\nraised his eyes to the chandelier. The piano was playing a waltz tune\r\nand he could hear the skirts sweeping against the drawing-room door.\r\nPeople, perhaps, were standing in the snow on the quay outside, gazing\r\nup at the lighted windows and listening to the waltz music. The air was\r\npure there. In the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted\r\nwith snow. The Wellington Monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that\r\nflashed westward over the white field of Fifteen Acres.\r\n\r\nHe began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies and Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has fallen to my lot this evening, as in years past, to perform a\r\nvery pleasing task but a task for which I am afraid my poor powers as a\r\nspeaker are all too inadequate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Browne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, however that may be, I can only ask you tonight to take the will\r\nfor the deed and to lend me your attention for a few moments while I\r\nendeavour to express to you in words what my feelings are on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies and Gentlemen, it is not the first time that we have gathered\r\ntogether under this hospitable roof, around this hospitable board. It\r\nis not the first time that we have been the recipients\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps, I\r\nhad better say, the victims\xe2\x80\x94of the hospitality of certain good ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made a circle in the air with his arm and paused. Everyone laughed\r\nor smiled at Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia and Mary Jane who all turned\r\ncrimson with pleasure. Gabriel went on more boldly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has no\r\ntradition which does it so much honour and which it should guard so\r\njealously as that of its hospitality. It is a tradition that is unique\r\nas far as my experience goes (and I have visited not a few places\r\nabroad) among the modern nations. Some would say, perhaps, that with us\r\nit is rather a failing than anything to be boasted of. But granted even\r\nthat, it is, to my mind, a princely failing, and one that I trust will\r\nlong be cultivated among us. Of one thing, at least, I am sure. As long\r\nas this one roof shelters the good ladies aforesaid\xe2\x80\x94and I wish from my\r\nheart it may do so for many and many a long year to come\xe2\x80\x94the tradition\r\nof genuine warm-hearted courteous Irish hospitality, which our\r\nforefathers have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down\r\nto our descendants, is still alive among us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA hearty murmur of assent ran round the table. It shot through\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s mind that Miss Ivors was not there and that she had gone away\r\ndiscourteously: and he said with confidence in himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies and Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA new generation is growing up in our midst, a generation actuated by\r\nnew ideas and new principles. It is serious and enthusiastic for these\r\nnew ideas and its enthusiasm, even when it is misdirected, is, I\r\nbelieve, in the main sincere. But we are living in a sceptical and, if\r\nI may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age: and sometimes I fear\r\nthat this new generation, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack\r\nthose qualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour which\r\nbelonged to an older day. Listening tonight to the names of all those\r\ngreat singers of the past it seemed to me, I must confess, that we were\r\nliving in a less spacious age. Those days might, without exaggeration,\r\nbe called spacious days: and if they are gone beyond recall let us\r\nhope, at least, that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of\r\nthem with pride and affection, still cherish in our hearts the memory\r\nof those dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not\r\nwillingly let die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Browne loudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut yet,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Gabriel, his voice falling into a softer\r\ninflection, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are always in gatherings such as this sadder\r\nthoughts that will recur to our minds: thoughts of the past, of youth,\r\nof changes, of absent faces that we miss here tonight. Our path through\r\nlife is strewn with many such sad memories: and were we to brood upon\r\nthem always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work\r\namong the living. We have all of us living duties and living affections\r\nwhich claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, I will not linger on the past. I will not let any gloomy\r\nmoralising intrude upon us here tonight. Here we are gathered together\r\nfor a brief moment from the bustle and rush of our everyday routine. We\r\nare met here as friends, in the spirit of good-fellowship, as\r\ncolleagues, also to a certain extent, in the true spirit of\r\n_camaraderie_, and as the guests of\xe2\x80\x94what shall I call them?\xe2\x80\x94the Three\r\nGraces of the Dublin musical world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion. Aunt Julia\r\nvainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to tell her what Gabriel\r\nhad said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says we are the Three Graces, Aunt Julia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane.\r\n\r\nAunt Julia did not understand but she looked up, smiling, at Gabriel,\r\nwho continued in the same vein:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies and Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not attempt to play tonight the part that Paris played on\r\nanother occasion. I will not attempt to choose between them. The task\r\nwould be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers. For when I\r\nview them in turn, whether it be our chief hostess herself, whose good\r\nheart, whose too good heart, has become a byword with all who know her,\r\nor her sister, who seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose\r\nsinging must have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight,\r\nor, last but not least, when I consider our youngest hostess, talented,\r\ncheerful, hard-working and the best of nieces, I confess, Ladies and\r\nGentlemen, that I do not know to which of them I should award the\r\nprize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel glanced down at his aunts and, seeing the large smile on Aunt\r\nJulia\xe2\x80\x99s face and the tears which had risen to Aunt Kate\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\nhastened to his close. He raised his glass of port gallantly, while\r\nevery member of the company fingered a glass expectantly, and said\r\nloudly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us toast them all three together. Let us drink to their health,\r\nwealth, long life, happiness and prosperity and may they long continue\r\nto hold the proud and self-won position which they hold in their\r\nprofession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in\r\nour hearts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the guests stood up, glass in hand, and turning towards the three\r\nseated ladies, sang in unison, with Mr Browne as leader:\r\n\r\n     For they are jolly gay fellows,\r\n     For they are jolly gay fellows,\r\n     For they are jolly gay fellows,\r\n     Which nobody can deny.\r\n\r\nAunt Kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even Aunt Julia\r\nseemed moved. Freddy Malins beat time with his pudding-fork and the\r\nsingers turned towards one another, as if in melodious conference,\r\nwhile they sang with emphasis:\r\n\r\n     Unless he tells a lie,\r\n     Unless he tells a lie.\r\n\r\nThen, turning once more towards their hostesses, they sang:\r\n\r\n     For they are jolly gay fellows,\r\n     For they are jolly gay fellows,\r\n     For they are jolly gay fellows,\r\n     Which nobody can deny.\r\n\r\nThe acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the\r\nsupper-room by many of the other guests and renewed time after time,\r\nFreddy Malins acting as officer with his fork on high.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so\r\nthat Aunt Kate said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClose the door, somebody. Mrs Malins will get her death of cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrowne is out there, Aunt Kate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrowne is everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate, lowering her voice.\r\n\r\nMary Jane laughed at her tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d she said archly, \xe2\x80\x9che is very attentive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been laid on here like the gas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate in the same\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9call during the Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed herself this time good-humouredly and then added quickly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell him to come in, Mary Jane, and close the door. I hope to\r\ngoodness he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment the hall-door was opened and Mr Browne came in from the\r\ndoorstep, laughing as if his heart would break. He was dressed in a\r\nlong green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on\r\nhis head an oval fur cap. He pointed down the snow-covered quay from\r\nwhere the sound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeddy will have all the cabs in Dublin out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nGabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office, struggling\r\ninto his overcoat and, looking round the hall, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGretta not down yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s getting on her things, Gabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s playing up there?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody. They\xe2\x80\x99re all gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, Aunt Kate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cBartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy and Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Callaghan\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t gone yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomeone is fooling at the piano anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nMary Jane glanced at Gabriel and Mr Browne and said with a shiver:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up like\r\nthat. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to face your journey home at this hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like nothing better this minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Browne stoutly, \xe2\x80\x9cthan a\r\nrattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking\r\ngoer between the shafts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe used to have a very good horse and trap at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Julia\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe never-to-be-forgotten Johnny,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane, laughing.\r\n\r\nAunt Kate and Gabriel laughed too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what was wonderful about Johnny?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Browne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe late lamented Patrick Morkan, our grandfather, that is,\xe2\x80\x9d explained\r\nGabriel, \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly known in his later years as the old gentleman, was a\r\nglue-boiler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO now, Gabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9che had a starch mill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, glue or starch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, \xe2\x80\x9cthe old gentleman had a horse by\r\nthe name of Johnny. And Johnny used to work in the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmill, walking round and round in order to drive the mill. That was all\r\nvery well; but now comes the tragic part about Johnny. One fine day the\r\nold gentleman thought he\xe2\x80\x99d like to drive out with the quality to a\r\nmilitary review in the park.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord have mercy on his soul,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate compassionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cSo the old gentleman, as I said, harnessed\r\nJohnny and put on his very best tall hat and his very best stock collar\r\nand drove out in grand style from his ancestral mansion somewhere near\r\nBack Lane, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone laughed, even Mrs Malins, at Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s manner and Aunt Kate\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO now, Gabriel, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t live in Back Lane, really. Only the mill was\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut from the mansion of his forefathers,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Gabriel, \xe2\x80\x9che drove\r\nwith Johnny. And everything went on beautifully until Johnny came in\r\nsight of King Billy\xe2\x80\x99s statue: and whether he fell in love with the\r\nhorse King Billy sits on or whether he thought he was back again in the\r\nmill, anyhow he began to walk round the statue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his goloshes amid the\r\nlaughter of the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRound and round he went,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, \xe2\x80\x9cand the old gentleman, who\r\nwas a very pompous old gentleman, was highly indignant. \xe2\x80\x98Go on, sir!\r\nWhat do you mean, sir? Johnny! Johnny! Most extraordinary conduct!\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t understand the horse!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peal of laughter which followed Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s imitation of the incident\r\nwas interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall door. Mary Jane ran\r\nto open it and let in Freddy Malins. Freddy Malins, with his hat well\r\nback on his head and his shoulders humped with cold, was puffing and\r\nsteaming after his exertions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could only get one cab,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, we\xe2\x80\x99ll find another along the quay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter not keep Mrs Malins standing in the\r\ndraught.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Malins was helped down the front steps by her son and Mr Browne\r\nand, after many man\xc5\x93uvres, hoisted into the cab. Freddy Malins\r\nclambered in after her and spent a long time settling her on the seat,\r\nMr Browne helping him with advice. At last she was settled comfortably\r\nand Freddy Malins invited Mr Browne into the cab. There was a good deal\r\nof confused talk, and then Mr Browne got into the cab. The cabman\r\nsettled his rug over his knees, and bent down for the address. The\r\nconfusion grew greater and the cabman was directed differently by\r\nFreddy Malins and Mr Browne, each of whom had his head out through a\r\nwindow of the cab. The difficulty was to know where to drop Mr Browne\r\nalong the route, and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane helped the\r\ndiscussion from the doorstep with cross-directions and contradictions\r\nand abundance of laughter. As for Freddy Malins he was speechless with\r\nlaughter. He popped his head in and out of the window every moment to\r\nthe great danger of his hat, and told his mother how the discussion was\r\nprogressing, till at last Mr Browne shouted to the bewildered cabman\r\nabove the din of everybody\xe2\x80\x99s laughter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Trinity College?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cabman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, drive bang up against Trinity College gates,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Browne,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand then we\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you where to go. You understand now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cabman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake like a bird for Trinity College.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cabman.\r\n\r\nThe horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay amid a\r\nchorus of laughter and adieus.\r\n\r\nGabriel had not gone to the door with the others. He was in a dark part\r\nof the hall gazing up the staircase. A woman was standing near the top\r\nof the first flight, in the shadow also. He could not see her face but\r\nhe could see the terracotta and salmon-pink panels of her skirt which\r\nthe shadow made appear black and white. It was his wife. She was\r\nleaning on the banisters, listening to something. Gabriel was surprised\r\nat her stillness and strained his ear to listen also. But he could hear\r\nlittle save the noise of laughter and dispute on the front steps, a few\r\nchords struck on the piano and a few notes of a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice singing.\r\n\r\nHe stood still in the gloom of the hall, trying to catch the air that\r\nthe voice was singing and gazing up at his wife. There was grace and\r\nmystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something. He asked\r\nhimself what is a woman standing on the stairs in the shadow, listening\r\nto distant music, a symbol of. If he were a painter he would paint her\r\nin that attitude. Her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her\r\nhair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show\r\noff the light ones. _Distant Music_ he would call the picture if he\r\nwere a painter.\r\n\r\nThe hall-door was closed; and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane came\r\ndown the hall, still laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, isn\xe2\x80\x99t Freddy terrible?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s really terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his wife\r\nwas standing. Now that the hall-door was closed the voice and the piano\r\ncould be heard more clearly. Gabriel held up his hand for them to be\r\nsilent. The song seemed to be in the old Irish tonality and the singer\r\nseemed uncertain both of his words and of his voice. The voice, made\r\nplaintive by distance and by the singer\xe2\x80\x99s hoarseness, faintly\r\nilluminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief:\r\n\r\n     O, the rain falls on my heavy locks\r\n     And the dew wets my skin,\r\n     My babe lies cold....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mary Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Bartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy singing and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsing all the night. O, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get him to sing a song before he goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO do, Mary Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate.\r\n\r\nMary Jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase, but before\r\nshe reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, what a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he coming down, Gretta?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them. A\r\nfew steps behind her were Mr Bartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy and Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Callaghan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Mr D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary Jane, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s downright mean of you to break\r\noff like that when we were all in raptures listening to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been at him all the evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Callaghan, \xe2\x80\x9cand Mrs\r\nConroy too and he told us he had a dreadful cold and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Mr D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate, \xe2\x80\x9cnow that was a great fib to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you see that I\xe2\x80\x99m as hoarse as a crow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy roughly.\r\n\r\nHe went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat. The others,\r\ntaken aback by his rude speech, could find nothing to say. Aunt Kate\r\nwrinkled her brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject. Mr\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Arcy stood swathing his neck carefully and frowning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the weather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Julia, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, everybody has colds,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate readily, \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane, \xe2\x80\x9cwe haven\xe2\x80\x99t had snow like it for thirty\r\nyears; and I read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is\r\ngeneral all over Ireland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love the look of snow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Julia sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Callaghan. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Christmas is never really\r\nChristmas unless we have the snow on the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut poor Mr D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the snow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate, smiling.\r\n\r\nMr D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy came from the pantry, fully swathed and buttoned, and in a\r\nrepentant tone told them the history of his cold. Everyone gave him\r\nadvice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be very careful of\r\nhis throat in the night air. Gabriel watched his wife, who did not join\r\nin the conversation. She was standing right under the dusty fanlight\r\nand the flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair, which he\r\nhad seen her drying at the fire a few days before. She was in the same\r\nattitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her. At last she turned\r\ntowards them and Gabriel saw that there was colour on her cheeks and\r\nthat her eyes were shining. A sudden tide of joy went leaping out of\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the name of that song you were\r\nsinging?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s called _The Lass of Aughrim_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember it properly. Why? Do you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_The Lass of Aughrim_,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of the name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice air,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you were not in\r\nvoice tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mary Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Kate, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t annoy Mr D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nhim annoyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door,\r\nwhere good-night was said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks for the pleasant evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Gabriel. Good-night, Gretta!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks ever so much. Good-night, Aunt\r\nJulia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, good-night, Gretta, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Mr D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy. Good-night, Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Callaghan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Miss Morkan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, all. Safe home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe morning was still dark. A dull yellow light brooded over the houses\r\nand the river; and the sky seemed to be descending. It was slushy\r\nunderfoot; and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs, on\r\nthe parapets of the quay and on the area railings. The lamps were still\r\nburning redly in the murky air and, across the river, the palace of the\r\nFour Courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky.\r\n\r\nShe was walking on before him with Mr Bartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy, her shoes in a\r\nbrown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up\r\nfrom the slush. She had no longer any grace of attitude but Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes were still bright with happiness. The blood went bounding along\r\nhis veins; and the thoughts went rioting through his brain, proud,\r\njoyful, tender, valorous.\r\n\r\nShe was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to\r\nrun after her noiselessly, catch her by the shoulders and say something\r\nfoolish and affectionate into her ear. She seemed to him so frail that\r\nhe longed to defend her against something and then to be alone with\r\nher. Moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his\r\nmemory. A heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfast-cup and he\r\nwas caressing it with his hand. Birds were twittering in the ivy and\r\nthe sunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor: he could\r\nnot eat for happiness. They were standing on the crowded platform and\r\nhe was placing a ticket inside the warm palm of her glove. He was\r\nstanding with her in the cold, looking in through a grated window at a\r\nman making bottles in a roaring furnace. It was very cold. Her face,\r\nfragrant in the cold air, was quite close to his; and suddenly he\r\ncalled out to the man at the furnace:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the fire hot, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace. It was just\r\nas well. He might have answered rudely.\r\n\r\nA wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his heart and went coursing\r\nin warm flood along his arteries. Like the tender fire of stars moments\r\nof their life together, that no one knew of or would ever know of,\r\nbroke upon and illumined his memory. He longed to recall to her those\r\nmoments, to make her forget the years of their dull existence together\r\nand remember only their moments of ecstasy. For the years, he felt, had\r\nnot quenched his soul or hers. Their children, his writing, her\r\nhousehold cares had not quenched all their souls\xe2\x80\x99 tender fire. In one\r\nletter that he had written to her then he had said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it that\r\nwords like these seem to me so dull and cold? Is it because there is no\r\nword tender enough to be your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLike distant music these words that he had written years before were\r\nborne towards him from the past. He longed to be alone with her. When\r\nthe others had gone away, when he and she were in their room in the\r\nhotel, then they would be alone together. He would call her softly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGretta!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps she would not hear at once: she would be undressing. Then\r\nsomething in his voice would strike her. She would turn and look at\r\nhim....\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Winetavern Street they met a cab. He was glad of its\r\nrattling noise as it saved him from conversation. She was looking out\r\nof the window and seemed tired. The others spoke only a few words,\r\npointing out some building or street. The horse galloped along wearily\r\nunder the murky morning sky, dragging his old rattling box after his\r\nheels, and Gabriel was again in a cab with her, galloping to catch the\r\nboat, galloping to their honeymoon.\r\n\r\nAs the cab drove across O\xe2\x80\x99Connell Bridge Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Callaghan said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say you never cross O\xe2\x80\x99Connell Bridge without seeing a white\r\nhorse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see a white man this time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Bartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy.\r\n\r\nGabriel pointed to the statue, on which lay patches of snow. Then he\r\nnodded familiarly to it and waved his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Dan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gaily.\r\n\r\nWhen the cab drew up before the hotel, Gabriel jumped out and, in spite\r\nof Mr Bartell D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy\xe2\x80\x99s protest, paid the driver. He gave the man a\r\nshilling over his fare. The man saluted and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA prosperous New Year to you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel cordially.\r\n\r\nShe leaned for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and while\r\nstanding at the curbstone, bidding the others good-night. She leaned\r\nlightly on his arm, as lightly as when she had danced with him a few\r\nhours before. He had felt proud and happy then, happy that she was his,\r\nproud of her grace and wifely carriage. But now, after the kindling\r\nagain of so many memories, the first touch of her body, musical and\r\nstrange and perfumed, sent through him a keen pang of lust. Under cover\r\nof her silence he pressed her arm closely to his side; and, as they\r\nstood at the hotel door, he felt that they had escaped from their lives\r\nand duties, escaped from home and friends and run away together with\r\nwild and radiant hearts to a new adventure.\r\n\r\nAn old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall. He lit a\r\ncandle in the office and went before them to the stairs. They followed\r\nhim in silence, their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly\r\ncarpeted stairs. She mounted the stairs behind the porter, her head\r\nbowed in the ascent, her frail shoulders curved as with a burden, her\r\nskirt girt tightly about her. He could have flung his arms about her\r\nhips and held her still, for his arms were trembling with desire to\r\nseize her and only the stress of his nails against the palms of his\r\nhands held the wild impulse of his body in check. The porter halted on\r\nthe stairs to settle his guttering candle. They halted too on the steps\r\nbelow him. In the silence Gabriel could hear the falling of the molten\r\nwax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs.\r\n\r\nThe porter led them along a corridor and opened a door. Then he set his\r\nunstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked at what hour they were\r\nto be called in the morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nThe porter pointed to the tap of the electric-light and began a\r\nmuttered apology but Gabriel cut him short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want any light. We have light enough from the street. And I\r\nsay,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing to the candle, \xe2\x80\x9cyou might remove that handsome\r\narticle, like a good man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe porter took up his candle again, but slowly for he was surprised by\r\nsuch a novel idea. Then he mumbled good-night and went out. Gabriel\r\nshot the lock to.\r\n\r\nA ghostly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one\r\nwindow to the door. Gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and\r\ncrossed the room towards the window. He looked down into the street in\r\norder that his emotion might calm a little. Then he turned and leaned\r\nagainst a chest of drawers with his back to the light. She had taken\r\noff her hat and cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror,\r\nunhooking her waist. Gabriel paused for a few moments, watching her,\r\nand then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGretta!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of\r\nlight towards him. Her face looked so serious and weary that the words\r\nwould not pass Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s lips. No, it was not the moment yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou looked tired,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a little,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t feel ill or weak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, tired: that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went on to the window and stood there, looking out. Gabriel waited\r\nagain and then, fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him, he\r\nsaid abruptly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, Gretta!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that poor fellow Malins?\xe2\x80\x9d he said quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. What about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, poor fellow, he\xe2\x80\x99s a decent sort of chap after all,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nGabriel in a false voice. \xe2\x80\x9cHe gave me back that sovereign I lent him,\r\nand I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it, really. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep away from\r\nthat Browne, because he\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad fellow, really.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was trembling now with annoyance. Why did she seem so abstracted? He\r\ndid not know how he could begin. Was she annoyed, too, about something?\r\nIf she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord! To take\r\nher as she was would be brutal. No, he must see some ardour in her eyes\r\nfirst. He longed to be master of her strange mood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you lend him the pound?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, after a pause.\r\n\r\nGabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal\r\nlanguage about the sottish Malins and his pound. He longed to cry to\r\nher from his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster her.\r\nBut he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop in\r\nHenry Street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come\r\nfrom the window. She stood before him for an instant, looking at him\r\nstrangely. Then, suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her\r\nhands lightly on his shoulders, she kissed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a very generous person, Gabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nGabriel, trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the\r\nquaintness of her phrase, put his hands on her hair and began smoothing\r\nit back, scarcely touching it with his fingers. The washing had made it\r\nfine and brilliant. His heart was brimming over with happiness. Just\r\nwhen he was wishing for it she had come to him of her own accord.\r\nPerhaps her thoughts had been running with his. Perhaps she had felt\r\nthe impetuous desire that was in him, and then the yielding mood had\r\ncome upon her. Now that she had fallen to him so easily, he wondered\r\nwhy he had been so diffident.\r\n\r\nHe stood, holding her head between his hands. Then, slipping one arm\r\nswiftly about her body and drawing her towards him, he said softly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGretta, dear, what are you thinking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm. He said again, softly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what it is, Gretta. I think I know what is the matter. Do I\r\nknow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer at once. Then she said in an outburst of tears:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I am thinking about that song, _The Lass of Aughrim_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe broke loose from him and ran to the bed and, throwing her arms\r\nacross the bed-rail, hid her face. Gabriel stood stock-still for a\r\nmoment in astonishment and then followed her. As he passed in the way\r\nof the cheval-glass he caught sight of himself in full length, his\r\nbroad, well-filled shirt-front, the face whose expression always\r\npuzzled him when he saw it in a mirror and his glimmering gilt-rimmed\r\neyeglasses. He halted a few paces from her and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the song? Why does that make you cry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of\r\nher hand like a child. A kinder note than he had intended went into his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Gretta?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who was the person long ago?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gabriel, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with my\r\ngrandmother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe smile passed away from Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s face. A dull anger began to gather\r\nagain at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to\r\nglow angrily in his veins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomeone you were in love with?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked ironically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a young boy I used to know,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cnamed Michael\r\nFurey. He used to sing that song, _The Lass of Aughrim_. He was very\r\ndelicate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel was silent. He did not wish her to think that he was interested\r\nin this delicate boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see him so plainly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said after a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch eyes as he\r\nhad: big, dark eyes! And such an expression in them\xe2\x80\x94an expression!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO then, you were in love with him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used to go out walking with him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I was in Galway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA thought flew across Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said coldly.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him and asked in surprise:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know? To see him, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at length. \xe2\x80\x9cHe died when he was only seventeen.\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it a terrible thing to die so young as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gabriel, still ironically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was in the gasworks,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nGabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the\r\nevocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks. While he\r\nhad been full of memories of their secret life together, full of\r\ntenderness and joy and desire, she had been comparing him in her mind\r\nwith another. A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him.\r\nHe saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his\r\naunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians\r\nand idealising his own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he\r\nhad caught a glimpse of in the mirror. Instinctively he turned his back\r\nmore to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nHe tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when\r\nhe spoke was humble and indifferent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was great with him at that time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHer voice was veiled and sad. Gabriel, feeling now how vain it would be\r\nto try to lead her whither he had purposed, caressed one of her hands\r\nand said, also sadly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did he die of so young, Gretta? Consumption, was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he died for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nA vague terror seized Gabriel at this answer as if, at that hour when\r\nhe had hoped to triumph, some impalpable and vindictive being was\r\ncoming against him, gathering forces against him in its vague world.\r\nBut he shook himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued\r\nto caress her hand. He did not question her again for he felt that she\r\nwould tell him of herself. Her hand was warm and moist: it did not\r\nrespond to his touch but he continued to caress it just as he had\r\ncaressed her first letter to him that spring morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was in the winter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cabout the beginning of the winter\r\nwhen I was going to leave my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s and come up here to the\r\nconvent. And he was ill at the time in his lodgings in Galway and\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be let out and his people in Oughterard were written to. He\r\nwas in decline, they said, or something like that. I never knew\r\nrightly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused for a moment and sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was very fond of me and he was such a\r\ngentle boy. We used to go out together, walking, you know, Gabriel,\r\nlike the way they do in the country. He was going to study singing only\r\nfor his health. He had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; and then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up\r\nto the convent he was much worse and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be let see him so I\r\nwrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in\r\nthe summer and hoping he would be better then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused for a moment to get her voice under control and then went\r\non:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the night before I left I was in my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s house in Nuns\xe2\x80\x99\r\nIsland, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up against the window.\r\nThe window was so wet I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see so I ran downstairs as I was and\r\nslipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at\r\nthe end of the garden, shivering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you not tell him to go back?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his\r\ndeath in the rain. But he said he did not want to live. I can see his\r\neyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the wall where\r\nthere was a tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did he go home?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he went home. And when I was only a week in the convent he died\r\nand he was buried in Oughterard where his people came from. O, the day\r\nI heard that, that he was dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped, choking with sobs and, overcome by emotion, flung herself\r\nface downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt. Gabriel held her hand\r\nfor a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her\r\ngrief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nGabriel, leaning on his elbow, looked for a few moments unresentfully\r\non her tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening to her deep-drawn\r\nbreath. So she had had that romance in her life: a man had died for her\r\nsake. It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her\r\nhusband, had played in her life. He watched her while she slept as\r\nthough he and she had never lived together as man and wife. His curious\r\neyes rested long upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of\r\nwhat she must have been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty,\r\na strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul. He did not like to\r\nsay even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful but he knew\r\nthat it was no longer the face for which Michael Furey had braved\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nPerhaps she had not told him all the story. His eyes moved to the chair\r\nover which she had thrown some of her clothes. A petticoat string\r\ndangled to the floor. One boot stood upright, its limp upper fallen\r\ndown: the fellow of it lay upon its side. He wondered at his riot of\r\nemotions of an hour before. From what had it proceeded? From his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsupper, from his own foolish speech, from the wine and dancing, the\r\nmerry-making when saying good-night in the hall, the pleasure of the\r\nwalk along the river in the snow. Poor Aunt Julia! She, too, would soon\r\nbe a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his horse. He had\r\ncaught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was\r\nsinging _Arrayed for the Bridal_. Soon, perhaps, he would be sitting in\r\nthat same drawing-room, dressed in black, his silk hat on his knees.\r\nThe blinds would be drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside\r\nhim, crying and blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died. He\r\nwould cast about in his mind for some words that might console her, and\r\nwould find only lame and useless ones. Yes, yes: that would happen very\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nThe air of the room chilled his shoulders. He stretched himself\r\ncautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife. One by\r\none they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other\r\nworld, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally\r\nwith age. He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her\r\nheart for so many years that image of her lover\xe2\x80\x99s eyes when he had told\r\nher that he did not wish to live.\r\n\r\nGenerous tears filled Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. He had never felt like that\r\nhimself towards any woman but he knew that such a feeling must be love.\r\nThe tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness\r\nhe imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping\r\ntree. Other forms were near. His soul had approached that region where\r\ndwell the vast hosts of the dead. He was conscious of, but could not\r\napprehend, their wayward and flickering existence. His own identity was\r\nfading out into a grey impalpable world: the solid world itself which\r\nthese dead had one time reared and lived in was dissolving and\r\ndwindling.\r\n\r\nA few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had\r\nbegun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark,\r\nfalling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to\r\nset out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow\r\nwas general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark\r\ncentral plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of\r\nAllen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous\r\nShannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely\r\nchurchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly\r\ndrifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the\r\nlittle gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard\r\nthe snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like\r\nthe descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dubliners, by James Joyce\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DUBLINERS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2814-0.txt or 2814-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/8/1/2814/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Reed, Karol Pietrzak, and David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
