<p>A juvenile history of England has long been
needed in our primary schools.</p>

<p>Those already prepared, and in use, are written
in a style entirely beyond the capacities of
young children, and too comprehensive in detail.</p>

<p>“History for children ought to be told in their
own simple language, or it fails to interest them;
while all that is unfitted for childish ears, or
unsuited to a childish understanding, should be
carefully omitted; at the same time, it is essential
to avoid making false or imperfect impressions
by an injudicious brevity.”</p>

<p><em>Philadelphia</em>, 1853.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p class="p4">The Publisher invites the attention of those engaged in tuition,
to the following reviews, selected from a large number, recommendatory
of Miss Corner, as an historian for the school-room:</p>

<p>“Miss Corner is an excellent historian for the school-room; she
narrates with fluency and clearness, and in a concise and lively
manner.”&mdash;<cite>London Spectator.</cite></p>

<p>“It is written with clearness and simplicity, the principal
events are accurately and briefly described, and the whole is well
adapted to the comprehension of young persons.”&mdash;<cite>London Atlas.</cite></p>

<p>“Miss Corner is concise in matter, yet perspicuous in style,
delicate in narration, yet accurate in record, comprehensive in
reference, yet simple in arrangement.”&mdash;<cite>Devonport Independent.</cite></p>

<p>“Miss Corner writes intelligently and fluently, with much ease
and winning grace.”&mdash;<cite>London Magazine of Arts and Sciences.</cite></p>

<p>“The beauty of composition throughout the writings of Miss
Corner is singular and fascinating.”&mdash;<cite>London Sun.</cite></p>

<p>“This meritorious work is written in a very easy and agreeable
style, perfectly adapted to the capacities of the young persons for
whom it is intended.”&mdash;<cite>London Times.</cite></p>

<p>“Miss Corner has acquired a deserved celebrity for the singularly-attractive
and intelligible manner she has in narrating history.”&mdash;<cite>London
Critic.</cite></p>

  <div class="caption">ANCIENT BRITONS.</div>
</div>

<p>1. Would you not like to read about your
own country, and to know what sort of people
lived in it a long while ago, and whether they
were any thing like us? Indeed, they were not;
neither was England, in ancient times, such as
it is now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>2. There were no great cities, no fine buildings,
no pleasant gardens, parks, or nice roads
to go from one place to another; but the people
lived in caves, or in the woods, in clusters of
huts, which they called towns.</p>

<p>3. The country was not then called England,
but Britain; and its inhabitants were called
Britons. They were divided into many tribes;
and each tribe had a king or chief, like the
North American Indians; and these chiefs often
went to war with one another.</p>

<p>4. Some of the tribes lived like savages, for
they had no clothes but skins, and did not know
how to cultivate the land: so they had no bread,
but got food to eat by hunting animals in the
forests, fishing in the rivers, and some of them
by keeping herds of small hardy cattle, and
gathering wild roots and acorns, which they
roasted and eat.</p>

<p>5. But all the Britons were not equally uncivilized,
for those who dwelt on the south coasts
of the island, had learned many useful things
from the Gauls, a people then living in the country
now called France, who used to come over to
trade with them, and with many families of
Gauls who had at various times settled amongst
them.</p>

<p>6. They grew corn, brewed ale, made butter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
and cheese, and a coarse woollen cloth for their
clothing. And they knew how to dye the wool
of several colors, for they wore plaid trowsers
and tunics, and dark colored woollen mantles, in
shape like a large open shawl.</p>

<p>7. Perhaps you would like to know what they
had to sell to the Gauls; so I will tell you.
Britain was famous for large dogs; and there
was plenty of tin; and the South Britons sold
also corn and cattle, and the prisoners which
had been taken in war, who were bought for
slaves; and you will be sorry to hear that many
of the ancient Britons sold their children into
slavery.</p>

<p>8. They carried these goods in carts, drawn
by oxen, to the coast of Hampshire, then crossed
over to the Isle of Wight, in light boats, made
of wicker, and covered with hides or skins, in
shape something like half a walnut shell.</p>

<p>9. The merchants from Gaul met them in the
Isle of Wight; and as they brought different
kinds of merchandise to dispose of, they managed
their business almost entirely without
money, by exchanging one thing for another.</p>

<p>10. The Britons were very clever in making
things of wicker work, in the form of baskets,
shields, coated with hides, boats, and chariots,
with flat wooden wheels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>11. These chariots were used in war, and
sharp scythes were fixed to the axles of the
wheels, which made terrible havoc when driven
through a body of enemies.</p>

<p>12. But I shall not say much about the wars
of the ancient Britons, or their mode of fighting;
as there are many things far more pleasant
to read of, and more useful to know.</p>

<p>13. At that time, which is about one thousand
nine hundred years ago, the country was almost
covered with forests; and when the people
wanted to build a town, they cleared a space for
it by cutting down the trees, and then built a
number of round huts of branches and clay, with
high pointed roofs, like an extinguisher, covered
with rushes or reeds.</p>

<p>14. This was called a town; and around it they
made a bank of earth, and a fence of the trees
they had felled; outside the fence, they also dug
a ditch, to protect themselves and their cattle
from the sudden attacks of hostile tribes.</p>

<p>15. As to furniture, a few stools or blocks of
wood to sit upon, some wooden bowls and wicker
baskets to hold their food, with a few jars and
pans of coarse earthenware, were all the things
they used; for they slept on the ground on
skins, spread upon dried leaves, and fern, or
heath. Their bows and arrows, shields, spears,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
and other weapons, were hung round the insides
of their huts.</p>

<p>16. The Britons were not quite ignorant of
the art of working in metals; for there was a
class of men living among them who understood
many useful arts, and were learned, too, for
those times, although they did not communicate
their learning to the rest of the people.</p>

<p>17. These men were the Druids, or priests, who
had much more authority than the chiefs, because
they were so much cleverer; therefore the
people minded what they said.</p>

<p>18. They made all the laws, and held courts
of justice in the open air, when they must have
made a very venerable appearance, seated in a
circle on stones, dressed in long white woollen
robes, with wands in their hands, and long
beards descending below their girdles.</p>

<p>19. The ignorant people believed they were
magicians, for they knew something of astronomy,
and of the medicinal qualities of plants
and herbs, with which they made medicines to
give the sick, who always thought they were
cured by magic.</p>

<p>20. Some of the Druids were bards, that is
poets, and musicians; others taught young men
to become Druids; and some of them made a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
great many useful things out of the metals that
were found in the mines.</p>

<p>21. You will perhaps wonder where the
Druids gained all their knowledge. I cannot
tell you; but many learned men think that the
first Druids came from India or Persia, as the
religion they taught was very similar to that of
the Persians and Hindoos.</p>

<p>22. They did not believe in the true God, but
told the people there were many gods, and that
they were in trees and rivers, and fire, which
they worshipped for that reason.</p>

<p>23. They had no churches, but made temples,
by forming circles of large stones, of such immense
size that nobody can guess how they were
carried to the places where they stood, for there
are some of them still remaining.</p>

<p>24. They used to hold several religious festivals
in the course of the year, when all the people
made holiday, and the bards played on their
harps and sang, and there was plenty of feasting,
and merry making; and they used to light
bonfires, and make an illumination by running
about with torches in their hands, for they believed
that a display of fire was pleasing to their
gods; and so you see that our custom of having
fireworks, and illuminations, and bonfires, on
days of public rejoicing, is as old as the time of
the ancient Britons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>25. The Druids had a great deal to do on
those days; for they used to go to their temples
and say prayers, and sacrifice animals for offerings
to their false gods; and on New Year’s
Day, they walked in procession to some old oak
tree to cut the mistletoe that grew upon it, for
this was one of their religious ceremonies; and
the oldest Druid went up into the tree to cut the
plant, while the rest stood below singing sacred
songs, and holding their robes to catch the
boughs as they fell; and crowds of men and women
stood round to see them.</p>

<p>26. But I must make an end of this chapter
about the ancient Britons, and tell you how the
Romans came and conquered the country, and
made quite a different place of it.</p>

<span class="fs60">THE ROMANS IN BRITAIN.</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="figcenter illowe30" id="i_b_016">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_016.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">LANDING OF JULIUS CÆSAR.</div>
</div>

<p>1. The Romans, about the time of the birth of
Christ, were the richest, the most powerful, and
the cleverest people in the world. Rome was a
grand city, and there were many other fine cities
in Italy belonging to the Romans, who knew
how to build handsome houses, and make beautiful
gardens, besides being excellent farmers.</p>

<p>2. They had elegant furniture, and pictures,
and marble statues; and they were well educated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
and wrote a great number of books in
Latin, for that was their language, and many of
those books are used in our schools to this day.</p>

<p>3. They had large armies, and had conquered
a great many countries, when Julius Cæsar, a
great Roman General, brought an army to Britain,
about fifty years before the birth of our
Saviour, to try to conquer the Britons also; but
thousands of British warriors went down to the
sea shore, by Dover cliffs, to fight the Romans
as soon as they landed; and they took a great
many war chariots with them, and fought so
bravely, that after two or three battles, Cæsar
offered to make peace with them, and go away,
if their princes would pay tribute to the Roman
government; which they consented to do.</p>

<p>4. However, the Romans thought no more
about Britain for nearly a hundred years, when
they came again, and went to war in earnest
with the natives, who at length were obliged to
submit to them; and Britain became a part of
the Roman Empire, just as India is at this time
a part of the British Empire.</p>

<p>5. Now this was a good thing for the Britons,
although they did not then think so; for as soon
as they left off fighting, the Romans began to
teach them all they knew, and to make a much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
better place of Britain than it had ever been
before.</p>

<p>6. As soon as a part of the country was conquered,
some great man was sent from Rome to
govern it, and to make the people obey the
Roman laws.</p>

<p>7. Then other great men came to live here,
and brought their families and furniture and
plate from Rome; and built fine houses, and
planted gardens, with flowers and fruit trees,
and vegetables, that were never seen here before,
for they brought the roots and seeds and young
trees with them.</p>

<p>8. At first, the Roman governors made the
Britons pay very heavy taxes; not in money, for
they had none; but they were obliged to give a
part of their cattle, and corn, and metals, or
any thing else they had; and to work with the
Roman soldiers at building, making roads, draining
the watery lands, and cutting down trees, to
make room for houses and gardens.</p>

<p>9. They did not like this, and one of the
tribes, named the Iceni, who lived in that part
of Britain which is now called Norfolk and Suffolk,
determined to make another effort to drive
the Romans out of the country.</p>

<p>10. You will be surprised to hear that they
were headed by a woman; but there were queens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
among the Britons as well as kings; and the
king of the Iceni being dead, his widow Boadicea
governed in his stead.</p>

<p>11. She encouraged her people to rebel
against their new rulers, and led them to battle
herself, mounted in a chariot, and armed like a
warrior; but the Romans won the battle, and the
brave but unfortunate queen put an end to her
own life.</p>

<p>12. After this, there was another long war,
which lasted till all the South British tribes
were subdued, and the Roman government established
all over the country, except the north
part of Scotland.</p>

<p>13. It was lucky for the Britons that a very
good Roman, named Agricola, was made governor
about this time, for he behaved so kindly
that they began to like the Romans, and to
wish to live as they did, and to know how to do
all the clever things they could do.</p>

<p>14. I should tell you that all the Roman soldiers
were educated as engineers and builders,
surveyors, and cultivators of land, and when
not actually engaged in fighting, they were employed
daily for four hours in some such out-of-door
labour or occupation; so, when the war
was over, they were set to work to improve
the country, and the Britons had to help them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>15. They made good hard broad roads, paved
with stones firmly cemented together, and set
up mile stones upon them.</p>

<p>16. The Romans had built London during the
war, and given it the name of Augusta, but the
houses were almost all barracks for the soldiers
and their families, so that it was not nearly so
handsome as York and Bath, and many other
cities that they built in place of the old British
towns.</p>

<p>17. The Britons, who had never seen any
thing better than their own clay huts, must have
been quite astonished at the fine houses constructed
by the Romans; who also built, in
every city, temples, theatres, and public baths,
with large rooms for people to meet in, like a
coffee house.</p>

<p>18. Then, in each town, was a market place
for people to buy and sell goods, and the Romans
taught the Britons generally to use money,
which was more convenient than taking things
in exchange.</p>

<p>19. The Romans were excellent farmers, as I
said before; so they shewed the natives how to
manage their land better than they had done,
and how to make many useful implements of
husbandry.</p>

<p>20. By cutting down the forest trees, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
they used in building, they obtained more land
for cultivation, and grew so much corn that
there was more than enough for the people in
Britain, so that a great deal was sent every year
to the Roman colonies in Germany.</p>

<p>21. By degrees, the Britons left off their old
habits, and those above the lowest rank wore
the Roman dress, spoke the Roman language,
and adopted the manners and customs of their
conquerors, who treated them as friends and
equals.</p>

<p>22. There were schools opened in all the
towns, where British and Roman boys were instructed
together, and the former were all
brought up to serve in the Roman armies; for
there were no more wars among the British
princes; who held the same rank as before,
but paid tribute to the Roman governor, and
were under his authority, as many of the princes
of India are now under the authority of the
English Governor General in India.</p>

<p>23. The Britons had to pay a great many
taxes, but they likewise enjoyed many rights,
for the Roman laws were much better laws than
those of the Druids, which were made for barbarians,
and not for civilized people, such as the
Britons had now become.</p>

<p>24. You will, perhaps, wonder what the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Druids were about all this time. The Romans
did not approve of their religion, so they put an
end to it very soon, after they came here; but
what became of the Druids, is not exactly
known.</p>

<p>25. It is supposed that many of them were
killed by the Romans in the isle of Anglesea,
where the chief Druid always resided; and
that all the rest fled to Scotland, or the Isle of
Man.</p>

<p>26. The Romans, however, were themselves
heathens, when they first settled in Britain, and
worshipped a number of false gods; but their
gods were different from those of the Druids,
and the rites and ceremonies of their religion
were different too.</p>

<p>27. But, in course of time, many of the Romans
became Christians, and Christianity was
taught in Britain, where the heathen temples
were converted into Christian churches, and the
Britons, as well as the Romans, at length learned
to worship the one true God.</p>

<p>28. The Romans had kept possession of
Britain for more than three hundred years, when
it happened that great armies of barbarians
went to fight against Rome, and all the soldiers
were sent for, to try to drive them away again;
so that this country was left unprotected, for it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
was the Roman soldiers who had kept enemies
from coming here.</p>

<p>29. The Britons hoped they would come back
again, as they did more than once; but affairs
got worse and worse at Rome, so the rulers
there sent word to the British princes, that they
did not wish to keep the island any longer, therefore
the Britons might consider themselves a
free people. But was freedom a blessing to
them? I think we shall find it was not.</p>

<span class="fs60">THE SAXON HEPTARCHY.</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="figcenter illowe30" id="i_b_024">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_024.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A SAXON SHIP.</div>
</div>

<p>1. It is now time to tell you something about
the Picts and Scots. They were the people of
Scotland, and were called by the Romans Caledonians,
which meant men of the woods, because
they were very rude and fierce, and lived
among woods and wilds.</p>

<p>2. They had always been sad enemies to the
Britons; but the Romans had kept them away,
and the good governor Agricola built a row of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
strong forts, all across their country, and placed
soldiers in them, to make the Caledonians keep
on the other side.</p>

<p>3. However, they sometimes managed to break
through; so the Emperor Severus, who was here
from the year 207 to 211, had a stone wall built
across that narrow part, where Northumberland
joins Cumberland, and it was so strong, that
parts of the banks and forts are still remaining.</p>

<p>4. But when all the Roman soldiers were
gone, the Picts and Scots began to come again,
and robbed the people of their corn and cattle,
and stole their children for slaves, and did a
great deal of mischief.</p>

<p>5. Now, if the British princes had agreed
among themselves, and joined together to drive
out these terrible foes, things might have gone
on very well; but they were foolish enough to
quarrel, and go to war with one another; while
some of the captains, who wanted to be princes,
got a number of soldiers to help them, and took
possession of different places, where they called
themselves kings, and made the people obey
them.</p>

<p>6. They did not continue the good Roman
laws; nor elect magistrates to keep order in the
cities, as used to be done while the Romans were
here; and tillage was neglected, because the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
farmers were afraid their crops would be destroyed,
so that numbers of people died of
famine.</p>

<p>7. There were still many Romans in Britain,
who were not soldiers but were settled here,
most of them having married into British families;
and there were a great number of people
who were Britons by birth, but whose ancestors
had been Romans; and all these were desirous
that the country should still be governed by the
Roman laws, and formed what was called the
Roman party.</p>

<p>8. But there was a British party also, that
wanted to do away with the Roman laws altogether,
and not to let the Romans have any
thing to do with ruling the country; so each of
these parties elected a king.</p>

<p>9. The Britons chose a prince named Vortigern;
and the Romans chose one called
Aurelius Ambrosius; and there was war between
them.</p>

<p>10. Then Vortigern, the British king, thought
it would be a good thing to get some other brave
people to join his party, that he might be able
to overcome his rival, as well as to drive away
the Picts and Scots; so he proposed to some
of the British chiefs that they should ask the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Saxons to come and help them, and they thought
it would be a good plan.</p>

<p>11. The Saxons inhabited the north of Germany,
and parts of Holland and Denmark,
which were then poor and barren countries.</p>

<p>12. Many of their chiefs were pirates, that is,
they lived by going out on the seas to fight and
plunder; nor did they think it wicked so to do;
but, on the contrary, imagined it was brave and
noble.</p>

<p>13. Two of them, Hengist and Horsa, happened
to be cruising near the British coast,
when they received a message from Vortigern;
who made a bargain with them, and offered to
give them the little island of Thanet, if they
would come with all their men, to assist him in
driving out the Picts and Scots.</p>

<p>14. Thanet is that part of Kent where Margate
is now situated, but was then separated by
an arm of the sea, so that it was a small island,
standing alone, nearly a mile from the coast.</p>

<p>15. The Saxons were very ready to come, for
they knew that Britain was a pleasant, fertile
country, and hoped to get some of it for themselves;
but they did not let the Britons know
they thought of doing so.</p>

<p>16. Hengist and Horsa were very brave, and
their men were well armed, so they soon forced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the Picts and Scots to retreat to their own country;
and shortly afterwards they went to the
Isle of Thanet, which they fortified, and many
more Saxons came there to them.</p>

<p>17. I cannot tell you how the affairs of the
Britons went on, or what became of Vortigern;
but this I can tell you, that the Saxons soon
began to quarrel with the people of Kent, and
fought with them, and having driven most of
them away, took the land for themselves, and
began to live there.</p>

<p>18. The chief who made this conquest, was
Esca, the son of Hengist, who called himself
king of Kent, which, from that time, was a
small Saxon kingdom, for the Britons never won
it back again.</p>

<p>13. Then other chiefs, hearing how Esca had
succeeded, got together bands of soldiers, and
landed in different parts of the country, to try
to gain kingdoms also; but they did not all
come at once, and their conquests were made by
such slow degrees, that the wars lasted more
than one hundred and fifty years; so you may
guess how hard the Britons fought in defence
of their liberty.</p>

<p>20. We can learn but very little about those
unhappy times, for the few histories that were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
then written were mostly destroyed in these long
wars; and though songs were composed by the
bards or poets, which the people used to learn
and teach to their children, these songs were not
all true.</p>

<p>21. They were mostly about the wars, and
the brave British chiefs who defended the country
against the Saxons; and if you should ever
hear anybody speak of king Arthur, and the
knights of the Round Table, you may remember
that he is said to have been one of those chiefs;
and, if we may believe the tale, killed four hundred
Saxons with his own hand in one battle.</p>

<p>22. Those who made the story about him, say
that the nobles of his court were all so equal in
bravery and goodness, that he had a large round
table made for them to feast at, that no one
might sit above another; so they were called
knights of the Round Table. But let us return
to our history.</p>

<p>23. The Saxons went on making one conquest
after another, till, at last, they were in possession
of the whole country; where very few of
the natives were left, for most of those who had
not been killed in the wars, had fled into Gaul,
or taken refuge among the Welsh mountains; so
from this time we shall hear no more of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Britons, but must look upon the Saxons as the
people of England.</p>

<p>24. I told you how Esca had established the
little kingdom of Kent. Well, in the course of
the wars, six more kingdoms had been formed in
the same manner, by different Saxon chiefs, so
that, by the time the conquest was completed,
there were seven kingdoms in Britain, namely,
Kent, Sussex, Essex, and East Anglia, Northumbria,
Wessex, and Mercia; and this division
of the country among seven kings, was called
the Saxon Heptarchy.</p>

<p>25. The Saxons were not clever people, like
the Romans, but were rough and ignorant, and
cared for nothing but fighting; so while the wars
were going on, they ruined and destroyed all the
beautiful and useful works that had been done in
the Roman times; for they did not understand
their value, and only thought it was a fine thing
to destroy all that belonged to their enemies.</p>

<p>26. But the works of the Romans were very
strong; for even now, when workmen are digging
in London, and different parts of the country,
they sometimes find Roman walls, and pavements,
and foundations of houses, that show
what good architects the Romans were.</p>

<p>27. When the Saxons had got possession of
the whole country, you may perhaps suppose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
they would be quiet and contented, but this was
not the case; for as long as there were separate
kingdoms, they were continually at war with
each other, and the principal cause of disagreement
was, that, among the kings, there was
always one called the Bretwalda, or ruler of
Britain, who had some degree of authority over
the rest; but as any one of them might be raised
to this dignity, it was a constant source of quarrels
and warfare, until, at length, the weaker
kingdoms were overcome by the more powerful
ones, and there was but one king over the whole
country, which then took the name of Angleland
or England, from a particular tribe of people
called the Angles, who came here in great numbers
with the Saxons.</p>

<p>28. I dare say you did not know before how
Britain came to be called England; and you
would be very much amused to hear how many
of the places in it, came by their present names.</p>

<p>29. We will take for example Norfolk and
Suffolk, which, with Cambridge, formed the
kingdom of East Anglia, and was conquered by
the Angles. Now these Angles consisted of two
tribes, who divided their conquest between them,
one tribe settling in the north part, the other in
the south; so that they were called North folk,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
and South folk, and thus came the names of the
two counties.</p>

<span class="fs60">MANNERS OF THE SAXONS.</span></h2>

<div class="figcenter illowe30" id="i_b_033">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_033.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">ANCIENT SAXONS.</div>
</div>

<p>1. I am now going to tell you what sort of
people the Saxons were, and how they lived
after they were quite settled in England; for
you ought to know all about them, as they were
our own ancestors, and made a great many of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
our laws; and their language was English too,
although it has so much altered that you would
hardly know it for the same.</p>

<p>2. The Saxons were not Christians when they
first came here; but their religion was different
from that of both the Druids and heathen Romans;
for they worshipped great images of
stone or wood, that they made themselves, and
called gods; and from the names of their gods
and goddesses, our names of the days of the
week are derived.</p>

<p>3. At length, the bishop of Rome, who was
called the Pope, sent some good men to persuade
the Saxons to leave off praying to wooden idols,
and to worship the true God.</p>

<p>4. These missionaries first went to Ethelbert,
king of Kent, who was then Bretwalda, and
reasoned with him, so that he saw how wrong
he had been, and not only became a Christian
himself, but let the missionaries go and preach
among the people, who were baptized in great
numbers, and taught to believe in God and
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>5. The missionaries were all priests or monks;
and some of them lived together in great houses
called monasteries, which they built upon lands
given them by the kings and nobles, on which
they also raised corn, and fed sheep and cattle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>6. They had brought from Rome the knowledge
of many useful arts, which they taught to
the people, who thus learned to be smiths and
carpenters, and to make a variety of things out
of metal, wood and leather, which the Saxons
did not know how to make before.</p>

<p>7. Then the priests could read and write,
which was more than the nobles, or even the
kings could do; and they used to write books,
and ornament the pages with beautiful borders,
and miniature paintings; and the books, thus
adorned, are called illuminated manuscripts.</p>

<p>8. Still the Saxons, or English, as I shall
henceforth call them, were very rough and ignorant
as compared with the Romans.</p>

<p>9. Their churches and houses, and even the
palaces of the kings, were rude wooden buildings,
and the cottages of the poor people were
no better than the huts of the ancient Britons.</p>

<p>10. The common people were almost all employed
in cultivating the land, and lived in villages
on the different estates to which they
belonged; for the Saxon landlords were not only
the owners of the land, but of the people also;
who were not at liberty, as they are now, to go
where they pleased; neither could they buy
land for themselves, nor have any property but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
what their lords chose. I will tell you how it
was.</p>

<p>11. The Saxon lords had divided all the land
amongst themselves, and had brought from their
own countries thousands of ceorls, or poor
people, dependent on them, to be their labourers.</p>

<p>12. Each family of ceorls was allowed to have
a cottage, with a few acres of land, and to let
their cattle or sheep graze on the commons, for
which, instead of paying rent, they worked a
certain number of days in each year for their
lord, and, besides, gave him a stated portion of
those things their little farms produced; so that
whenever they killed a pig, they carried some
of it to the great house; and the same with
their fowls, eggs, honey, milk and butter; and
thus the chief’s family was well supplied with
provisions by his tenants, some of whom took
care of his sheep and herds, cultivated his fields,
and got in his harvests.</p>

<p>13. Then there were always some among
them who had learned useful trades, and thus
they did all the kinds of work their masters
wanted.</p>

<p>14. Yet, with all this, the poor ceorls generally
had enough for themselves, and some to
spare, which they sold at the markets, and thus
were able to save a little money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>15. Their cottages were round huts, made of
the rough branches of trees, coated with clay,
and thatched with straw. They had neither
windows nor chimneys; but a hole was made in
the roof to let out the smoke from the wood fire,
kindled on a hearth in the middle of the room;
and they used to bake their barley-cakes, which
served them for bread, on these hearths, without
any oven.</p>

<p>16. They made a coarse kind of cloth for clothing
from the wool of their sheep, a part of which
was also given to their lord, and was used to
clothe the servants of his household, for the rich
people got a finer cloth for themselves, which
was brought from other countries.</p>

<p>17. Great men usually wore white cloth tunics
that reached to the knee, with broad coloured
borders, and belts round the waist. They had
short cloaks, linen drawers and black leather
shoes, with coloured bands crossed on their legs,
instead of stockings. The common people wore
tunics of coarse dark cloth, and shoes, but no
covering on the legs.</p>

<p>18. But I must tell you something more about
these country folks, who, at the time, formed
the great mass of the English population. They
were, strictly speaking, in bondage, for they
could not leave the place where they were born,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
nor the master they belonged to, unless he gave
them their freedom; they were obliged to serve
as soldiers in war time, and when the land was
transferred to a new lord, the people were transferred
with it.</p>

<p>19. All they had might at any time be taken
from them, and their sons and daughters could
not marry, without consent of their lord.</p>

<p>20. Yet these people considered themselves
free, because they could not be sold like the
slaves; for I ought to tell you there was a lower
class of bondmen, called thralls, and there were
regular slave markets where they were bought
and sold.</p>

<p>21. A landowner could sell a thrall just as he
could sell an ox; but he could not sell a vassal
tenant, or, as they were called in the Saxon
times, a ceorl, or churl, without the estate to
which he belonged. The thralls were employed
to do the hardest and meanest work, and had
nothing of their own.</p>

<p>22. The houses of the great men were very
like large barns, and each house stood on an
open space of ground, enclosed by a wall of
earth and a ditch, within which there were
stacks of corn, sheds for the horses and cattle,
and huts for the thralls to sleep in.</p>

<p>23. The principal room was a great hall,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
strewed with rushes, and furnished with long
oak tables and benches.</p>

<p>24. The windows were square holes crossed
with thin laths, called lattices, and the fire-place
was a stone hearth in the middle of the earthen
floor, on which they used to burn great logs
of wood, and let the smoke go out at a hole in
the door.</p>

<p>25. But the great people often had merry
doings in these halls, for they were fond of
feasting, and used to sit at the long wooden
tables, without table cloths, and eat out of
wooden platters or trenchers with their fingers.</p>

<p>26. Boiled meats and fish, usually salted,
were put on the table in great wooden dishes,
but roast meats were brought in on the spits on
which they were cooked, and handed round by
the thralls, to the company, who helped themselves
with knives which they carried at their
girdles.</p>

<p>27. There was plenty of ale, and among the
richest, wine also, which they drank out of horn
cups; and when the meats were taken away,
they used to drink and sing, and play on the
harp, and often had tumblers, jugglers, and
minstrels to amuse them.</p>

<p>28. Then the visitors used to lie down on the
floor to sleep, covered with their cloaks; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
very few people had bedsteads, and the only
beds were a kind of large bags, or bed-ticks,
filled with straw, and blocks of wood for pillows.</p>

<p>29. Such were the rough manners of our
Saxon forefathers, who were, however, in some
respects a good sort of people, and you will be
sorry for them by and by, when you read how
the Normans came, and took away their lands,
and made slaves of them. But I must first tell
you what happened in the Saxon times, after the
Heptarchy was broken up, and there was only
one king of England.</p>

  <div class="caption">ALFRED THE GREAT.</div>
</div>

<p>1. It was nearly 380 years after the first
Saxons came here with their two pirate chiefs,
Hengist and Horsa, that England began to have
only one king.</p>

<p>2. There were still some other princes, who
bore that title, but they had so little power, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
they could hardly be called kings; so that a
brave prince, named Egbert, who conquered the
last kingdom of the Heptarchy, is usually called
the first king of England.</p>

<p>3. The civil wars were thus, for a time, ended;
but it seemed as if the English were never to
be long at peace, for they now had some terrible
enemies to contend with, who kept the
country in constant alarm.</p>

<p>4. These were the Danes who came from Denmark,
Norway, and Sweden, and were almost
the same people as the Saxons; for they spoke
the same language, followed the same customs,
and lived by piracy, as the Saxons did in former
times.</p>

<p>5. I have not room to tell you of half the
mischief they did in England. Sometimes they
would land suddenly from their boats in the
night, when the affrighted people were awakened
by a cry of, “the Danes! the Danes!” and,
starting up, perhaps, beheld their villages in
flames; and, as they ran in terror from their
cottages, were either killed or dragged away to
the pirate vessels, with the cattle and any thing
else that could be found, and made slaves.</p>

<p>6. Egbert had fought a battle with them in
Cornwall, and forced them to depart; but, during
the reign of Ethelwulf, the next king, and three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
of his sons, they not only attacked the towns
and villages on the sea-coast, but used to seize
the horses and ride about the country in search
of plunder.</p>

<p>7. They broke into the monasteries, where the
people often put their money and jewels for
safety; and if the inmates made any resistance
they would set the building on fire.</p>

<p>8. Then they set up fortified camps, in many
places; that is, a number of tents, arranged together,
like a town surrounded with a wall and
ditch; and thus a great many of the Danes
established themselves in the country, and conquered
all the northern part of it. This was the
sad state of affairs when Alfred the Great came
to the throne.</p>

<p>9. I dare say you have heard of this good
prince, who was the youngest and favorite son
of king Ethelwulf, for he was the cleverest and
best. His mother, being an accomplished lady,
tried to teach all her sons to read; but none of
them would learn except Alfred, who afterwards
went to Rome to study Latin, and learn to write,
so that he was a good scholar for those times.</p>

<p>10. His three brothers had all reigned in
turn, and were all dead by the time he was
twenty-two years old, therefore he was then heir
to the crown; but, instead of being able to think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
about the best way of governing the country, he
was obliged to get together as many soldiers as he
could, and go out with them to fight the Danes.</p>

<p>11. There was no regular army then, as there
is now; but, when the king wanted soldiers, he
sent to all the noblemen and landholders in the
kingdom, who were obliged to come themselves
and bring so many men with them, according to
the size of their estates, some on horseback,
some on foot, and all well armed.</p>

<p>12. You must remember that people could not
buy land then for money, nor have it for paying
rent; but large estates were given to the thanes
and nobles by the king, on condition that they
should perform certain services for him; and you
have already seen how the vassals of the nobles
held their little farms on similar terms.</p>

<p>13. This was called the feudal system, which
means, holding land for services instead of rent;
and the person holding the land was called the
vassal of him to whom it belonged, whether rich
or poor; so the nobles were the vassals of the
king, and the ceorls were the vassals of the
nobles.</p>

<p>14. I think you now understand what the
feudal system was, therefore I shall proceed with
the history of Alfred the Great.</p>

<p>15. The war had gone on for several years,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
and the king was so unfortunate that, at last, he
was obliged to hide himself in a woody marsh
in Somersetshire, called the Isle of Athelney,
because it was surrounded by bogs and rivers.</p>

<p>16. The Danes were then in pursuit of him;
and, one time, fearing to be taken prisoner, he
got some man to let him keep his cows, or pigs,
I do not know which; so that, if the Danes happened
to see him, they might not guess who he
was.</p>

<p>17. I dare say, you have heard the story of
this peasant’s wife scolding Alfred one day, for
letting some cakes burn, which she had left to
bake on the hearth, whilst she was out; but she
did not know that he was the king, or, of course,
she would not have taken that liberty.</p>

<p>18. At last, Alfred heard there were many
chiefs and noblemen, with their vassals, ready
to join him again; so he determined to try
another battle, but thought it would be prudent
first to learn what was the real strength of
the enemy.</p>

<p>19. Now the Danes, like the Saxons, were fond
of good cheer, and liked to have songs and
music to make them merry while they were feasting;
and this put it into Alfred’s head to go into
their camp disguised as a harper, for he could
play the harp and sing very well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>20. So away he went, with his harp at his
back, and, when he came there, the Danish
chiefs had him called into their tents, and made
him sit down and play to them, and gave him
plenty to eat and drink.</p>

<p>21. Then he heard them talking about king
Alfred, and saying, they supposed he was dead,
as he did not come to fight them, so they need
think of nothing but enjoying themselves; and
thus he discovered they were not prepared for a
battle, and were almost sure to be defeated, if
taken by surprise.</p>

<p>22. He, therefore, left the camp as soon as he
could, and sent a message to his friends to meet
him in Selwood Forest, also in Somersetshire,
with all the men they could muster; and, when
they were all come, he put himself at their
head, and, marching suddenly down upon the
Danes, fought and won a great battle at Ethandune,
a place in Gloucestershire, now called
Woeful Danes’ Bottom, from the terrible slaughter
of the Danes there.</p>

<p>23. But there were a great many Danes in
England who had not been engaged in this battle,
and who had possession of almost all the
northern part of the country; so the king wisely
considered that it would be much better to induce
them to settle peaceably in the country as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
friends, rather than prolong those dreadful wars,
which had already caused so much misery.</p>

<p>24. He therefore proposed to the Danish
chief that, if he would promise to keep at peace,
he should have a wide tract of country, which
had been desolated by these wars, all along the
east coast, from the river Tweed to the river
Thames, for himself and his people, to be called
the Dane land; so Guthrun, the Danish chief,
accepted the offer, and parcelled the land out
amongst his followers, who settled there with
their vassals, and lived the same manner as the
Saxons.</p>

<p>25. You may think how glad the people were
that the wars were over, and the king was very
glad too, for he now had time to do what was
more pleasant to him than fighting, which was,
to do all the good he could for the country. He
thought the best way to defend it against its
enemies was to have good ships to keep them
from landing; but, as the English did not know
much about ship-building, he sent for men from
Italy to teach them, and also had models of
ships brought that they might see how they were
constructed, and men were taught to manage
them, so that England, for the first time, had a
navy.</p>

<p>26. These ships were called galleys, and were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
worked both with oars and sails; they were twice
as long as those of the Danes, and stood higher
out of the water.</p>

<p>27. While some workmen were making ships,
others were employed in rebuilding of the towns
and villages that had been burned down by the
Danes; and the king ordained that there should
be schools in different parts of the kingdom,
where noblemen’s sons might be educated, for he
had found the benefit of learning himself, and
thought it a sad thing that all the great men
should be so ignorant as they were.</p>

<p>28. You may, perhaps, wonder why so good a
man as Alfred should only think of having the
great people taught to read; but reading would
have been of no use to the common people, as
the art of printing was unknown, and there were
no books but those written by the monks or
nuns, which were so expensive that none but
very rich people could afford to have even two
or three of them.</p>

<p>29. The principal school founded by king
Alfred was at Oxford, which was then a small,
poor place, with a monastery, and a few mean
wooden houses for the scholars to live in, very
different from the present grand university, and
the masters, who were all churchmen, and called
learned clerks, resided in the monastery.</p>

<p>30. Alfred, with the help of some good and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
clever men, whom he consulted in every thing,
made some very wise laws, and obliged the people
to obey them, by having courts of justice held
in the principal cities, regularly once a month;
for nobody had thought much about law or
justice either, while the wars were going on, so
that there was need of some very strict regulations
to restore good order, without which there
can be neither happiness nor comfort any where.</p>

<p>31. Under the good government of Alfred the
Great, England enjoyed more peace and prosperity
than it had known since the days of the
Romans; and as his son and grandson both endeavoured
to follow his example, the influence
of his wisdom was felt long after his death, which
happened when he was about fifty years old, in
the year 900.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_050.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">CANUTE AND HIS COURTIERS.</div>
</div>

<p>1. Alfred was succeeded by his son Edward,
who was a very good king, though not so clever
as his father. He built walls round a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
many of the towns, to defend them in case the
Danes should come again; for, although so many
of them were living quietly in the country, those
who did not live here were still enemies, and the
resident Danes were always ready to join their
countrymen.</p>

<p>2. But they could not do much mischief while
Edward was king, or in the reign of his brave
son Athelstan, who was almost as great a prince
as Alfred himself.</p>

<p>3. He knew that commerce was one of the
best things in the world for any country, so he
had more ships built, and sent them to trade with
foreign countries; and he said that, when any
man had made three voyages in a vessel of his
own, he should be made a Thane; which was the
same as knighting a gentleman in these days.</p>

<p>4. There were no stores in England at this
time, but the people bought every thing they
wanted at markets and fairs; and they used to
salt a great deal of their meat and fish, that it
might keep a long time.</p>

<p>5. In buying and selling, they sometimes used
slaves and cattle, instead of money, a man slave
being worth a pound of silver, and an ox worth
a quarter of a pound, which was called five shillings,
as a shilling was the twentieth part of a
pound in weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>6. If a nobleman, therefore, wanted to buy
any thing of two pounds value, he could pay
for it with two of his thralls, or eight oxen, and
the seller was obliged to take them; but he
could sell them again directly; for I am sorry
to say there were slave markets in England till
some time after the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>7. Athelstan had a good deal of fighting to
do, for the people of the Daneland revolted, and
he was obliged to lead his soldiers into their territory,
to bring them to order; and then he had
to march against Howel, the Prince of Wales,
who was defeated in battle, when Athelstan
nobly gave him back his dominions, saying,
“There was more glory in making a king than
in dethroning one.”</p>

<p>8. I shall not mention all the kings that
reigned after Athelstan, because there were
many of them who did nothing that is worth
telling about; but I must speak of a great
churchman, named Dunstan, who was Archbishop
of Canterbury, and, for several reigns,
ruled the whole country, for the kings and
nobles were obliged to do just as he pleased.</p>

<p>9. He was a very clever man, and so good a
worker in metals that he made jewellery and
bells, and gave them to some of the churches,
which was considered an act of piety; for it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
about this time that bells began to be used in
England, and they were highly valued.</p>

<p>10. Dunstan persuaded the kings and rich
noblemen, to rebuild the monasteries that had
been plundered and destroyed by the Danes, and
endow them with lands; so that, at last, nearly
one-third of all the landed property in the kingdom
belonged to the clergy.</p>

<p>11. There was a king named Edgar, the fourth
after Athelstan, who did many useful things for
the country; and, among others, he thought of
a plan to destroy the wolves, which were so numerous
in all the forests, that the people were
in constant alarm for the safety of their sheep,
and even of their little children.</p>

<p>12. Edgar, therefore, ordered that each of
the princes of Wales, who had to pay tribute to
the kings of England, should send, instead of
money, three hundred wolves’ heads every year;
so they were obliged to employ huntsmen to go
into the woods to kill those dangerous animals,
which were so generally destroyed in a few
years that they have seldom been found in England
ever since.</p>

<p>13. Then Edgar kept the Danes away by
having as many as three hundred and sixty
vessels always ready for service; but, when he
and Dunstan were dead the navy was neglected;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
and the country was again overrun with those
terrible enemies, who fought with the English
every where, robbed them of their property,
took their houses for themselves, and acted just
as if they were the conquerors and lords of the
land.</p>

<p>14. At last, the Danish king, Sweyn, landed
with a great army, and began a dreadful war
with Ethelred, who was then king of England,
that lasted about four years, in the course of
which he and Ethelred both died; but the war
was continued by Canute, the son of Sweyn, and
with such success, that, in the end, he was
crowned king of England.</p>

<p>15. It was lucky for the English that Canute
happened to be a wise and good prince; for he
said to himself, “As I am now king of these
people, I will behave kindly to them, that they
may love me, and then we shall go on comfortably
together.” So he began to repair the
mischief that had been done in the late wars,
by setting people to work to rebuild the towns
that had been destroyed; which was soon done
in those days, when the houses were so roughly
built, and only of wood.</p>

<p>16. He also made a law that the Danes should
not rob and insult the English, as they had been
in the habit of doing; and ordered that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
should obey the other laws of the country;
which he did not alter in the least; neither did
he interfere with the estates of the nobles, nor
with their rights over their vassals; and he consulted
with the Witanagemote, or Parliament, in
all affairs of importance.</p>

<p>17. This Parliament was composed of the
great nobles and the bishops, so that it was like
our House of Lords; and, when the king made
a new law, the people were not obliged to obey it,
until it had been approved by the Witanagemote.</p>

<p>18. As long as Canute reigned, which was
nineteen years, there were peace and plenty, and
the poor people were much happier than they had
been for a long time, for they could stay at home
and mind their farms, or work at their trades,
without being called away continually to fight
the Danes.</p>

<p>19. The king, it is true, kept a large army
of Danish soldiers, and the people had to pay
heavy taxes to support them; but this was
better than seeing them come as enemies into
the towns and villages to destroy or take every
thing.</p>

<p>20. After the death of Canute, his two sons
reigned in succession, but they were neither very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
good nor very clever, and both died within six
years.</p>

<p>21. All this while there was a Saxon prince,
named Edward, son of king Ethelred, living at
the court of the Duke of Normandy, who was
his uncle, and had afforded him shelter and protection
whilst his enemies were ruling in England.</p>

<p>22. He was now restored to the throne, and
the English people thought themselves happy in
having again a king of their own nation; but
they little foresaw the terrible consequences of
placing over them one who had formed so close
a connection with the Normans.</p>

<p>23. Edward was attached to the Normans, for
they had been kind to him in his misfortunes;
but it was neither wise nor just to bring a great
number of them to his court, and set them up
above his own countrymen, by giving them the
highest appointments in the government, which,
of course, gave offence to the English noblemen.</p>

<p>24. Edward was called the Confessor, because
he spent much of his time in devotion. He
rebuilt Westminster Abbey, which was founded
during the Heptarchy; but this building was
pulled down about 160 years afterwards, by
Henry the Third, who erected the present edifice
in its place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>25. But I was going to tell you what happened
in consequence of the king’s attachment to the
Normans. His uncle was dead, and his cousin
William, a bold spirited prince, who was now
Duke of Normandy, came over to England to
visit the king, and see what sort of a place it
was.</p>

<p>26. He brought a great many noblemen with
him, and it seems they all liked the country so
much that the Duke thought he should like to
be its king, and his friends thought they should
like to get good estates here; so king Edward
was persuaded to make a will, or give his promise,
that, when he died, his cousin William,
who was more than twenty years younger than
himself, should be his successor. The English
lords knew nothing about this at the time, but
they had reason enough to know it afterwards,
as you will presently find.</p>

<p>27. Edward the Confessor died at the beginning
of the year 1066, when Harold, his wife’s
brother, a brave and popular nobleman, took
possession of the throne, with the consent of
the chief nobles and clergy.</p>

  <div class="caption">DEATH OF HAROLD.</div>
</div>

<p>1. As soon as the Duke of Normandy knew
that Edward the Confessor was dead, and Harold
made king, he called his friends together, and
promised to bestow lands and honors in England
on all who would assist him to win the crown;
which, he said, was his by right, and that Harold
was an usurper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>2. Now this is a doubtful question; for,
although the king could appoint a successor, if
he thought proper; yet it was necessary that his
choice should have the approval of the Witenagemote,
which had not been given in this case;
so the English said that, notwithstanding king
Edward’s will, the Duke of Normandy had no
right to the throne.</p>

<p>3. I cannot pretend to say which was right;
but, as it is of more consequence to know how
the dispute ended, we will proceed to the history
of the conquest.</p>

<p>4. The Normans were great warriors; so that
even many of the clergy would sometimes put
on armour under their robes, and lead their own
vassals to battle; and they had as much interest
in the dispute as the nobles, for they expected
to come into possession of some of the Bishops’
sees and rich abbey lands, provided Duke William
should succeed in his enterprise.</p>

<p>5. While all this was going on in Normandy,
Harold’s brother, Tosti, had raised a rebellion
in the north of England, and was joined by the
king of Norway, who landed with an army in
Yorkshire: so Harold had to go and fight with
them, and there was a great battle at Stamford
Bridge, where the king gained a complete
victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>6. Two or three days after this he was enjoying
himself at a great feast, at York, when news
was brought to him that the Normans had landed
in Sussex, where they were doing all manner of
mischief, driving the people away from the
towns and villages, and taking every thing they
could lay their hands on.</p>

<p>7. The king made all the haste he could to
get his soldiers together, and began his march
to oppose the invaders, but it took nearly a fortnight
to get to where they were; and all that
time the invaders were making dreadful havoc
for miles round their camp, so that the terrified
people fled to the woods, or shut themselves up
in the churches, for fear of being killed.</p>

<p>8. At last, Harold came, and a battle was
fought near Hastings, on the 14th of October,
1066, where the king and two of his brothers,
with a great many of the English nobles, were
slain, and the conqueror from that day looked
upon himself as the master of the country.</p>

<p>9. But the English had seen enough of the
Normans to know that they should be very badly
treated if they once suffered a Norman government
to be established, so they resolved to do
their utmost to prevent it, and thus the Normans
had to fight for every town, and castle, before it
was given up to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>10. William had marched to London, and laid
siege to it, soon after the battle of Hastings,
and the people having submitted to him, he was
crowned in Westminster Abbey, on Christmas
day.</p>

<p>11. A few of the English nobles went to offer
their submission, that is, they agreed to obey
him as their king, since he had promised that all
who did so should be permitted to enjoy their
rank and property undisturbed.</p>

<p>12. But it was only a few who trusted to these
promises, and they were deceived in the end, for
it is almost certain that the Conqueror intended,
from the first, to take every thing from the English
to give to the Normans.</p>

<p>13. I mean the English lords; for he meant
to make the common people remain on the estates
to which they belonged, that the new masters
might have vassals and slaves to cultivate their
lands.</p>

<p>14. Now the poor people did not like this any
more than the nobles themselves, so they fought
bravely for their masters in many places; but it
was all to no purpose; for, at the end of seven
years, the Normans were in possession of all the
land in the country, and most of its former lords
had either been killed, or were reduced to such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
a state of poverty and wretchedness that it is
melancholy to think of.</p>

<p>15. I will not attempt to describe the sufferings
of the people during that long period, but
you may imagine how very miserable they must
have been, for the Normans got the better of
them all over the country, and took delight in
robbing and insulting their unhappy victims.</p>

<p>16. I told you that the design of the Conqueror
was to take all the land, and divide it
among his followers, except what he chose to
keep for himself, as crown lands.</p>

<p>17. Now there were many Saxon ladies who
possessed estates, in consequence of their fathers
or brothers having been killed at the battle of
Hastings; and most of these heiresses were compelled,
against their will, to marry Norman
lords, who thus gained lands as well as brides.</p>

<p>18. Then the estates of all those who had not
submitted to the king were declared to be forfeited,
and William gave them to the Normans,
or, more properly speaking, he gave the Barons
leave to take them by force; so the English lords
had to fight for their houses and lands, and many
were killed, and many fled to other countries.</p>

<p>19. The rustics, on these forfeited estates,
would fight for their lord to the last; but, when
he was forced to yield, they had no choice but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
to submit to the new lord, or to see their cottages
set on fire, and their wives and children
perhaps murdered before their eyes.</p>

<p>20. Some of the English nobles hid in the
forests with their families, and as many of
their vassals as would go with them, where they
made habitations, and supported themselves by
robbery and hunting; and this was the origin
of the numerous bands of robbers that, in after
times, were the terror of the country.</p>

<p>21. The famous Robin Hood, who lived in
the reign of Richard the First, is supposed to
have been a descendant of one of these unfortunate
English nobles.</p>

<p>22. The Bishops’ sees and abbey lands were
seized in the same violent manner, as the estates
of the nobles, and given to the Norman clergy;
and many of the monasteries, after being broken
open and plundered, were taken for the abode
of monks who came over from Normandy in
great numbers.</p>

<p>23. The Normans built a great many castles
in different parts of the country; and, if they
wanted to build one on a spot where there happened
to be houses, they thought nothing of
turning out the inhabitants, and pulling down
the houses, to make room: and they pressed the
poor people, both men and women, to do all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
labour, without pay, and treated them very
cruelly besides; for, if they did not work hard
enough, these unfeeling taskmasters would urge
them on with blows.</p>

<p>24. Then wherever the Norman soldiers stayed,
they went and lived in the houses of the people,
took what they pleased, and made the family
wait upon them.</p>

<p>25. The king, himself, cruelly laid waste different
parts of the country in revenge for the
opposition made to his progress by some of the
English earls, especially in the north, where,
about three years after the battle of Hastings,
such a scene of desolation was made by fire and
sword, that, from York to Durham, the houses,
the people, and all signs of cultivation, were
utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>26. The last stand made against the Normans
was in a little island, formed by bogs and lakes,
in Cambridgeshire, and still called the Isle of
Ely. There, a brave chief, named Hereward,
set up a fortified camp, and was joined by other
noblemen, and many of their dependents, who,
with the ceorls, or tenants, belonging to the
Abbey of Ely, made quite an army.</p>

<p>27. It was a secure place of refuge, because
the only safe paths into the island were unknown
to the Normans, who would most likely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
have been lost in the bogs, if they had ventured
to approach.</p>

<p>28. But they had built a castle close by, at
Cam Bridge, and they brought boats and tried
to make causeways by which they might get into
the camp of refuge; but the English would go
out in bands at night and destroy all that their
enemies had done, and kept constantly on the
watch for straggling parties, who were often
attacked unawares, and many of them killed,
while the English could always retreat to their
camp, where they were safe from pursuit.</p>

<p>29. At last the Normans established a blockade
of boats round the island, and provisions
began to get scarce within it; so two or three
bad selfish men, who lived in the abbey, went to
the Normans at Cam Bridge, and said, they
would show them the way into the island, if
they would promise not to meddle with the
abbey.</p>

<p>30. These men led the Normans secretly into
the island, and a terrible battle was fought, in
which almost all the English were killed.</p>

<p>31. When Hereward saw it was useless to
fight any longer, he made his escape, and went
to his own castle of Bourn, in Lincolnshire;
where I believe, he afterwards made peace with
the king, and was allowed to keep his estate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>32. I have given you a long history of the
Conquest, because it was the most important
event that ever occurred in the history of
England, and was the last sudden and violent
change made in this country by foreign invasion.</p>

  <div class="caption">DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS.</div>
</div>

<p>1. The Normans were a cleverer people than
the English, and lived in a superior manner.
They were better acquainted with the arts of
agriculture and architecture, and they knew a
great deal more about useful gardening; for all
the convents in Normandy had good gardens,
planted with vegetables and herbs; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
monks brought over plenty of seeds and roots to
sow or plant in gardens here.</p>

<p>2. The Normans built stone castles, and
strong houses of timber, with upper stories, so
that their dwellings, in general, were higher and
more substantial than those of the Saxons; and
one great improvement was that they had chimneys;
but their furniture was as rough and
clumsy as the furniture used in the Saxon
times, and their way of living was almost the
same, except that they did not care so much
about feasting, but preferred spending their
time in hunting, hawking, and fighting in sport,
for pastime.</p>

<p>3. I should here tell you that William the
Conqueror made the first game laws, and very
severe they were, and very hard upon the poor
people, who used to be at liberty to kill game in
the forests; but, after these new laws, they
dared not so much as take even a hare or partridge
in their own fields.</p>

<p>4. It was not only the English, who were forbidden
to hunt on the royal domains, but the
Normans also, unless they had special leave to
do so; and, if any one was bold enough to kill
a deer in the king’s forests, he was punished in
the most cruel manner, by having his eyes put
out, or his hands cut off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>5. The king’s palace was at Winchester, and
he wanted to have a forest close by for hunting,
so he ordered that all the towns and villages
should be pulled down for about thirty miles, and
the land planted with trees; and, what was
worse, he gave nothing to the poor people for
turning them out of their homes; and this is
still called the New Forest.</p>

<p>6. In imitation of this bad example, many of
the nobles began to make large parks, enclosed
with walls to keep deer, and they cared no more
than William had done about taking away the
fields and pasture lands of the poor cottagers,
who dared not complain, and were even obliged
to run to their doors with refreshments to offer
to the Norman lords and their followers when
they were out hunting, although they often
saw them riding over their corn, and breaking
through their hedges.</p>

<p>7. It was not till after several reigns that the
descendants of the Norman Conquerors began
to consider themselves Englishmen, and to treat
their vassals more like fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>8. The first hundred years after the conquest
is therefore usually called the Norman period,
and includes the reigns of William the Conqueror,
William Rufus, Henry the First, and
Stephen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>9. I have already told you that the Feudal
system was brought into England by the Saxons,
and I explained what it was; but I must now
mention that this system was carried much
farther by the Normans, that is, their feudal
laws were stricter, and the nobles themselves
were bound by them as well as the common
people.</p>

<p>10. I should wish you to understand this as
clearly as possible, because the manners and
customs of the age were governed entirely by
those laws.</p>

<p>11. First, then, the king was lord of the land,
and kept a great portion of it for himself, which
made what were called crown lands; and all the
people, who lived on the crown lands, whether in
burgh, town, or country, were his tenants, and
paid him rent, or taxes, both in money and produce,
besides being obliged to furnish him with
soldiers at their own expense.</p>

<p>12. For example, if a town had to find two
or more horse-soldiers, the inhabitants were, besides,
obliged to pay the expenses of their arms,
horses and maintenance, for the time they were
on service.</p>

<p>13. The Manors and Abbey lands were held of
the king on the same conditions; and every man,
who had a certain quantity of land, was bound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
either to serve as a soldier himself, or send a
substitute.</p>

<p>14. The rest of the country was divided by
the king amongst the great barons, who agreed,
in return, that whenever he went to war they
would go with him, and take with them so many
men, properly armed and trained for warfare,
perhaps fifty or a hundred, or even more, according
to the extent of lands they held.</p>

<p>15. These great Baronies were called Feods,
and the king was the feodal or feudal lord of the
barons, who were called crowned vassals; and,
when any one of them died, the king took the
lands again until the heir paid him a large sum
of money to redeem them.</p>

<p>16. Some of the kings behaved very ill in
this, in making the heirs pay a great deal more
than was just; and, if a baron died, and left a
daughter only, she was obliged to marry any one
the king chose, or he would not let her have her
inheritance at all.</p>

<p>17. The feudal laws were therefore very bad,
because they gave men the power of being
tyrants to each other; for the nobles had the
same power of oppressing their vassals that the
king had of oppressing them.</p>

<p>18. You must understand that the great
Barons, who held very extensive domains, gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
small estates out of them to men who were not
so high in rank as themselves, on the same conditions
as the king had given the large baronies
to them, so that the lesser nobles were the vassals
of the great ones, and were bound to aid
them with men and money when required.</p>

<p>19. Then all the nobles, from the highest to
the lowest degree, were the absolute lords of all
the common people that dwelt on their lands,
and could make them do just whatever they
pleased, as I told you they could in the Saxon
times; but then the Norman lords treated them,
at first, a great deal more harshly than the
Saxon lords did, and took a great deal more from
them.</p>

<p>20. After the Norman conquest they were
called villeins, which meant villagers, and they
lived in the same manner, and had the same kind
of duties to perform for their lords, as in the
Saxon times; but there were many new feudal
customs brought here by the Normans; as for
example, a mill was set up on every estate, to
which all the poor people were obliged to take
their corn to be ground, instead of grinding it
at home with hand-mills, as they used to do;
and, out of each measure, a part was taken for
the baron, which was a very hard tax upon them,
especially if they had large families.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>21. Another feudal custom was this; a duty
was laid on every thing sold at the fairs and
markets; that is, if a man went to the market
to buy a sheep, he must pay so much for the
sheep, and so much for duty, the duty being for
the baron, or lord of the manor.</p>

<p>22. There were a great many other customs
which I have not room to mention, but I think
I have said enough to show you what the feudal
system was in the first ages after the Norman
conquest; so now I will tell you something about
the first Norman sovereigns.</p>

<p>23. William the Conqueror died in 1087, and
was succeeded by his eldest son, Robert, in
Normandy, and by his second son, William
Rufus, in England; but after a time Duke Robert
wanted money to go to the Holy Wars,
which I will tell you about presently, so he
mortgaged his duchy of Normandy to his brother
William, who thus became sovereign of both
countries, as his father had been. He was a sad
tyrant, and so rude in his manners that nobody
liked him.</p>

<p>24. I told you what strict game laws were
made by the Conqueror, but William Rufus made
them more severe still, and so displeased the noblemen,
by forbidding them to hunt without his
leave, that some of them formed a conspiracy to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
dethrone him; but the plot was discovered, and
the Earl of Northumberland, who was at the
head of it, was taken prisoner, and confined in
Windsor Castle all the rest of his life.</p>

<p>25. There was another great lord, the Count
d’Eu, who was accused of being engaged in this
plot, by a knight called Geoffrey Bainard, so the
king had him arrested. The Count, however,
denied having any thing to do with it, and said
he defied his accuser, and was ready to fight
with him, and that God would give the victory
<ins class="corr" id="tn-75" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'te whichever of'">
to whichever of</ins> them was in the right.</p>

<p>26. So they fought with swords, in the presence
of the king and court, when Bainard was
victorious, and the Count being thus convicted,
was condemned to have his eyes torn out.</p>

<p>27. This was a strange way for a man to
prove his innocence of any crime, but it became
a common custom in England, and was called
“Wager of battle.” Even law-suits, respecting
right of property, were often thus decided; and,
if a lady had a quarrel or a lawsuit, she might
get a man to do battle for her, and he was called
her champion.</p>

<p>28. It was the fashion for many ages, not
only in England, but all over Europe, for young
men of noble birth to roam about the world in
search of adventures; and, as they were generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
poor and depended chiefly on their swords
for subsistence, they would engage in anybody’s
quarrels; fight in the cause of women or children
who were either injured or oppressed, and
enlist in the service of princes and barons who
were at war.</p>

<p>29. This was called chivalry, and these knights
errant, or wandering knights, were made welcome
wherever they went, and treated with hospitality
at the castles of the great.</p>

<p>30. Numbers of them went to the Holy Wars,
but, as I suppose you do not know what the
Holy Wars were, I will tell you about them.</p>

<p>31. Many pious Christians in those days
thought it a duty to make a journey, or pilgrimage
as it was called, to Jerusalem, once in their
lives, to say their prayers at our Saviour’s tomb;
but Jerusalem had been conquered by the Mahomedans,
who hated the Christians, and behaved
very cruelly to the pilgrims; so the Pope,
who you know is the great Bishop of Rome, and
at that time had more authority over all the
countries of Europe than the kings had, said
that it was the duty of all Christian warriors to
go to Palestine, or the Holy Land, to fight
against the Saracens, and try to drive them from
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>32. Then a religious man, called Peter the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
Hermit, went about preaching a crusade, that is,
exhorting the princes and nobles in France,
Germany, and Italy, to undertake this war,
which was called a crusade, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">croisade</i>, because
the ensign on their banners was to be the Cross.</p>

<p>33. Robert, Duke of Normandy, was among
the first crusaders, and, as he wanted money to
keep himself and all the fighting men he took
with him, he pledged his duchy to his brother,
William Rufus, for a very large sum.</p>

<p>34. The English did not join in these wars, at
first, but after a time there was scarcely a knight
or noble in the land that did not go to the Crusades,
for they were continued, in all, more than
two hundred years; and, during two hundred
years; and, during that time, great numbers of
the lower order of people in England were freed
from bondage, in consequence of being allowed
to purchase their liberty to supply their lords
with money for these wars.</p>

<p>35. William Rufus, who was killed by accident
as he was hunting in the New Forest, was succeeded
by his brother, Henry the First, surnamed
Beauclerk, because he was a learned man,
who behaved much better to the Saxon English
than the two former kings had done, and restored
to some of the old families a part of their
ancient possessions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>36. He likewise altered the forest laws, which
had given so much discontent, and gave the
citizens of London leave to hunt in Epping
Forest, which then reached very nearly to the
walls of the city.</p>

<p>37. Winchester was then the capital of England,
but London was one of the best cities and
the richest, as many of its inhabitants were merchants
who traded with foreign countries; yet
the houses were only mean wooden buildings,
with no glass in the windows, and thatched with
straw.</p>

<p>38. Westminster was quite a separate city, and
divided from London by country houses, fields
and a village. The king had a palace at Westminster,
and William Rufus built Westminster
hall adjoining it, for his Christmas feasts.</p>

<p>39. A curious privilege was granted by Henry
the First to the citizens of London, which will
serve to show you what grievances the people
were subject to in those times.</p>

<p>40. There were a great number of persons
who were employed in various ways about the
court, and who followed the king wherever he
went; for great men, when they travelled, were
obliged to take every thing they wanted with
them, there being no public accommodation to
be had any where; so they carried with them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
waggon loads of furniture, plate, wine, cooking
utensils, and I do not know what besides; with
their domestics and retainers of all descriptions,
who formed a numerous retinue.</p>

<p>41. Now, the inhabitants of any city, where
the king happened to be holding his court, were
obliged to give board and lodging, at free cost,
to all these people, who generally behaved very
ill; for they would insist upon having the best
rooms, order whatever they chose, and treat the
family just as if they were their servants.</p>

<p>42. It was, therefore, a very good thing for
the Londoners when king Henry released them
from this heavy burthen, but all other towns had
to bear it for a very long period.</p>

<p>43. In this reign the first manufactory for
woollen cloth was established in this country, by
some weavers from Flanders, where the best
cloth was made from English wool, which was
the staple commodity of England at that period;
I mean, the thing of which they had most to
sell; for quantities of sheep were reared on every
estate.</p>

<p>44. England had no manufactures then, so
there were no employments for the lower classes
but agriculture, and the few useful arts, that
were but very imperfectly understood.</p>

<p>45. Henry the First died in the year 1135.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
He left the crown to his daughter Matilda, who
had been twice married; first, to the Emperor
of Germany, and again to Geoffrey Plantagenet,
Earl of Anjou, who was dead also, therefore she
was again a widow.</p>

<p>46. But there was a nephew of the late king,
named Stephen, who was rather a favorite among
the Barons, and was quite willing to take advantage
of their good will; so, before Matilda could
reach England, her cousin Stephen had mounted
the throne.</p>

<p>47. Then there was a civil war in this country,
which was carried on, at times, for fifteen
years, for a great many French noblemen came
here with Matilda to fight for her; and some of
the English Barons, who had become dissatisfied
with Stephen, because he had not done all they
expected he would do, joined the other party,
and there was fighting all over the country.</p>

<p>48. Wherever there is civil war, there is sure
to be famine and misery of all kinds, and there
never was more misery in England than during
the reign of king Stephen; for, in order to keep
as many of the Barons on his side as he could,
he let them do just as they pleased; and he gave
titles and estates to a great many bold and bad
men, who built castles and kept bands of ruffians,
who went at night to rob and plunder the towns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
and villages; so <ins class="corr" id="tn-81" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'that the peeple'">
that the people</ins>, when they shut
up their houses at night, used to kneel down and
pray that God would protect them from robbers
and murderers.</p>

<p>49. At last, it was settled that Stephen should
keep the crown as long as he lived; but that
Matilda’s son, Henry Plantagenet, should succeed
him; and, soon after this arrangement, he
died, having reigned nineteen years.</p>

<span class="fs60">HENRY THE SECOND, RICHARD THE FIRST, AND
JOHN.&mdash;1154 TO 1216.</span></h2>

  <div class="caption">JOHN SIGNING THE MAGNA CHARTA.</div>
</div>

<p>1. As soon as Henry the Second came to the
throne, he began to set things to rights again.
He had all the new castles pulled down, and
made the bad men who had lived in them, leave
the country; then he set people to work to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
rebuild the towns that had been burned down in
the late wars; and ordered that the judges
should go on circuits; that is, travel to all the
cities, and hold assizes, two or three times a
year, as they do now, to see that justice is done
to everybody.</p>

<p>2. But it was not quite so easy to do justice
then; for, as long as the feudal laws lasted, the
rich could always oppress the poor, and every
great man had an army of his own vassals, who
would do any thing he bade them, whether it
was lawful or not.</p>

<p>3. Now the king wisely thought that the best
thing in the world for the country would be to
give more freedom to the people, so that the
Barons might not have quite so much power.</p>

<p>4. He, therefore, granted charters to some of
the cities, which made them a little more independent;
but it was by very slow degrees that
the people of England became free, although
this happy change was beginning to take place.</p>

<p>5. Another thing the king wanted to do, was
to make the clergy answerable to the judges for
any bad acts they might commit, instead of
having particular laws and judges for themselves;
and, I am sorry to say, they sometimes
did very wicked things, for which they were not
punished half so severely as other people would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
have been for similar offences, which certainly
was unjust.</p>

<p>6. But the bishops were unwilling to let the
king have any thing to do with church affairs,
and the Pope encouraged them to oppose him,
in this respect; for the Pope, in those days, had
more power over all Europe than the kings
themselves, who seldom dared to disobey him.</p>

<p>7. The person who quarrelled most with
Henry about these things was Thomas à Becket,
archbishop of Canterbury, a very proud man,
who wanted to rule both king and state his own
way.</p>

<p>8. The king was so much annoyed at the opposition
he constantly met with from the archbishop,
that one day, in a fit of passion, he said
he wished that troublesome priest was dead; on
which some persons, who heard these incautious
words thinking to get into favor, rode off to
Canterbury, and killed the archbishop in his
Cathedral.</p>

<p>9. But they gained nothing by this wicked
deed; for the king was shocked when he heard
of it, and sorry for what he had said; which
shows how wrong it is for people to use violent
expressions when they feel angry.</p>

<p>10. One very remarkable event which occurred
in this reign, was the conquest of Ireland. That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
country had been, for many years, divided into
several small kingdoms, and the disputes of the
chiefs had often given rise to warfare among
themselves; but it now happened that the king
of Leinster, having been deposed by another
prince, went direct to the king of England, to
beg his assistance, which Henry readily promised,
on condition that, if he were restored, he
should hold his kingdom as a vassal of the English
crown.</p>

<p>11. Dermot, that was the name of the Irish
prince, agreed to these terms, and several English
knights and noblemen undertook the enterprise.
After a great many interesting adventures,
which are told in the history of Ireland,
Dermot was replaced on his throne; but other
quarrels arising among the chiefs, the English
continued the war, and, after some time, the
Irish chiefs acknowledged the king of England
as a lord and master of Ireland, which has been
under the authority of the English government
ever since.</p>

<p>12. Henry the Second died in 1189, and was
succeeded by his son Richard, who was called
Cœur-de-lion, because he was very brave, so that
everybody said he had the heart of a lion.</p>

<p>13. Now it is a very good thing for men to be
brave, for I do not know what we should do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
without brave men for soldiers and sailors, to
fight for us; but it is not the most useful quality
a king can possess; and I think you will agree
with me, when I tell you that Richard the First,
instead of staying at home to make good laws,
and take care of his subjects, went away to fight,
or gain glory, as fighting was then called, in the
Holy Land, while all things were going wrong
in England, for the want of somebody to keep
order.</p>

<p>14. But there was some excuse for him, as
everybody in those days thought that the most
praiseworthy act princes and nobles could do,
was to fight for their religion against all persons
who believed differently from themselves; so
Richard was very much admired by his people,
although he did nothing for their real benefit;
but, on the contrary, caused them very much
misery, and great distress.</p>

<p>15. Another evil was that the Barons, who
went with him to the Crusades, took all their
own money as well as all they could get from
their tenants, to support themselves and their
fighting men abroad, so that the generality of
the people were left very poor.</p>

<p>16. A great number, indeed, obtained their
freedom, by giving up all they had to their lords;
but then they were left without money or employment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
and many turned robbers, to save
themselves from starving; therefore, you see, it
was not always a good thing, at first, for the bondmen
to be set at liberty; but it was good in the
end, for their children were born free, and, as
times got better, the free middle classes began to
be of some consequence, and have gone on gradually
increasing in wealth and importance, till
they have now become the best safeguard and
support of the country.</p>

<p>17. While Richard was gone to the wars, his
brother John, who was a very bad man, wanted
to make himself king in England, and there
were some of the nobles who encouraged him,
while others defended the rights of the absent
monarch; so that there was great confusion, and
the laws were sadly disregarded.</p>

<p>18. At last, Richard heard of all these bad
doings, and left the Holy Land, intending to
come home as fast as he could; but, unfortunately,
he was made prisoner, on his way, by
the Duke of Austria, and confined in a castle in
Germany for some time before the English people
knew what had become of him.</p>

<p>19. Richard knew this duke was his enemy,
because he had affronted him when in the Holy
Land, so he had taken the precaution of disguising
himself in passing through his dominions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
and took with him only a single page; but, one
day, being tired and hungry, he stopped to rest
at a village near Vienna, and sent his page into
that city to buy some provisions.</p>

<p>20. The youth, foolishly, hung a pair of handsome
gloves in his belt, and as gloves were, in
those days, only worn by persons of the highest
rank, this circumstance excited suspicion, and
he was arrested, and obliged to confess the
truth.</p>

<p>21. The duke immediately sent a band of
soldiers to seize the king, whom they found busy
turning some meat that was roasting at the fire.</p>

<p>22. He started up, drew his sword, and fought
valiantly, but was captured, and sent to a strong
fortress, where he had remained a prisoner some
months, when he was discovered, it has been
stated, by a wandering minstrel, who heard him
singing in his prison, and knew his voice. But
this is a fabulous tale.</p>

<p>23. A large sum was raised in England, by
taxes, for his ransom, and he came back; but
he did not stay long at home; for he had quarrelled,
while in the Holy Land, with the king of
France, and went over to Normandy for the
purpose of going to war with him, where he was
killed by a poisoned arrow, aimed at him from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the walls of a castle he was besieging, in the
year 1199, having reigned ten years.</p>

<p>24. Prince John was now made king of England,
but he had no lawful right to the throne,
as prince Arthur, the orphan son of an elder
brother, was living, and was the true heir, according
to the rules of succession.</p>

<p>25. But this unfortunate prince was made
prisoner, in Normandy, by his wicked uncle,
and most people believe he met with a violent
death.</p>

<p>26. It was a very serious misfortune for the
country when the king happened to be a bad
man, because the government was, at that time,
despotic; that is, the king made the laws himself,
and had the power of doing whatever he
pleased; whereas, now, the laws are made by the
parliament; so that, before any new act can be
passed, a great many good and clever men must
agree to it, which is a great protection to the
people.</p>

<p>27. However, king John was compelled much
against his will, to make some very good laws,
and the reason of this was, that his tyranny
was felt by the nobles even more than the common
people, for their estates were often unjustly
seized, and they were obliged to give
him large sums of money to get them back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
again; then he would not let them marry unless
they paid him for leave to do so; and if any
person wanted to go out of the country, they
were obliged to buy his permission. In short,
no one was free to do any thing till the consent
of the king was obtained by a handsome present.</p>

<p>28. At length, his tyranny was carried to
such a height that the chief nobles resolved to
make him act more justly, or dethrone him; so
they wrote down, on parchment, all the things
they wished to have done, or altered, and agreed
with each other that, if he refused to sign it,
they would go to war with him, and they took
care to have all their vassals armed, and in
readiness.</p>

<p>29. John was very much frightened when he
found the barons were in earnest, and agreed to
meet them at a place called Runnymede, between
Staines and Windsor, where, after a great deal
of disputing, he was obliged to sign his name to
what they had written, which thus became the
law of the land. An ancient copy of this parchment
is now in the British Museum.</p>

<p>30. It is called Magna Charta, which is the
Latin name for ‘the Great Charter;’ and it was
framed with a view to take from the king the
power of doing unjust things, and to make him
govern according to the laws, and not to be able<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
to make new laws, or impose new taxes, at his
pleasure.</p>

<p>31. This famous act is generally regarded as
the beginning of the liberty which all Englishmen
are so justly proud of; but the laws it
contained were, in many respects often broken
by the sovereigns of England, for a very long
period.</p>

<p>32. The Barons of England still lived in their
castles, on their own estates, in the midst of
their vassals and serfs. Their castle-halls were
crowded with knights, squires, pages, and military
dependents, for it was their pride to have
as many of such retainers as they could possibly
maintain. The pages were boys of high
rank, generally the younger sons of noblemen,
whose profession was to be knight errantry.</p>

<p>33. Now, in order to obtain the honour of
knighthood, they were obliged to serve some
great baron, first as pages, then as esquires, for
several years, and to be very obedient and respectful
in their conduct, and do all that was
required of them readily and cheerfully.</p>

<p>34. While pages, they had to wait upon their
lords and his guests at dinner and supper, to
carry messages, and perform little services for
the ladies of the family; but they were themselves
waited upon by the domestic slaves, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
when they had finished their day’s duties, were
allowed to mix with the company.</p>

<p>35. They were taught to use the sword and
lance, and to manage a horse skilfully, and were
instructed in religious duties by the priests of
their lord’s household.</p>

<p>36. When old enough, they were made
esquires, and then their duties were to take care
of the horses and armour, and to attend their
lords on all occasions; which services he usually
rewarded by making them knights, when they
were free to go wherever they pleased; and you
have already been told what their mode of life
was afterwards.</p>

<p>37. The great people were very fond of hunting
and hawking, and fighting at tournaments;
but, perhaps, you do not know what a tournament
was, so I will tell you.</p>

<p>38. There was a place built up, something
like a large theatre, with galleries for the ladies
and gentlemen, to sit and see the combats in the
open space below, and this was called the lists.
Then the gentlemen, who wished to exhibit their
valour, used to come in armour, and fight with
each other on horseback till one was conquered,
when the victor received a prize from the greatest
lady present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>39. When only two knights fought, it was
called a tilt; but if there were several on each
side, it was a tournament; and, although these
combats were held for sport, the combatants
were often dangerously wounded, and sometimes
killed.</p>

<p>40. When John had signed Magna Charta, the
Barons went home to their castles, to enjoy
their usual pleasures; but the king had no intention
of behaving any better than before, and
secretly sent agents to Flanders, to raise troops
of foreigners, promising that they should be
allowed to plunder the estates of the Barons, if
they would enlist in his service.</p>

<p>41. Thus he soon appeared at the head of an
army, and went to war with the nobles, who, in
revenge, did a very wrong and foolish thing,
which was, to offer the crown to Louis, the son
of the king of France.</p>

<p>42. Louis soon came over with a French army,
and, after having in vain tried to take Dover
Castle, he entered London in triumph, whilst
John <ins class="corr" id="tn-93" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'was obiged to'">
was obliged to</ins> retreat; but the Barons began
to think they had done wrong, and, as John
died suddenly, in the midst of this confusion,
they turned their arms against Louis, and forced
him to leave the country.</p>

  <div class="caption">DEATH OF LLEWELLYN.</div>
</div>

<p>1. The reign of Henry the Third, who was
only nine years of age when he succeeded his
father, was a very long and a very unhappy one.</p>

<p>2. At first, things went on very well, because
the king had a good guardian, the Earl of Pembroke,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
who managed the government wisely; but
he, in a few years, died, and others came into
power who did not act so well, and the king was
too young to know what was right himself.</p>

<p>3. It was a pity the good earl died, for, if
Henry had been fortunate enough to have had
a wise instructer, he might have been a better
sovereign, but, as it was, he was a very bad one.</p>

<p>4. The great mischief was this. He married
a French princess, who had no more wisdom than
himself; and they were both so extravagant that
they spent a great deal more money than they
could afford; and, then, to get fresh supplies,
the king ordered the people to pay more taxes,
and began to do all the unjust things that had
caused so much misery in the time of his father.</p>

<p>5. Sometimes the Barons assembled and
obliged him to promise he would abide by the
terms of Magna Charta; but he soon forgot his
promises, and went on the same as before, so
that the people were worse and worse off every
year, and many men became robbers on the
highways, because they could not support their
families by honest industry.</p>

<p>6. This was the state of affairs for many
years, till at last, there was a civil war again,
and, after a great deal of fighting and bloodshed,
the king and his eldest son, Edward, were made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
prisoners in a battle, fought at Lewes, in Sussex,
in 1264, and the Earl of Leicester, the king’s
brother-in-law, took the government upon himself.</p>

<p>7. This was an important event, because the
earl summoned a parliament to consult as to
what it would be best to do under these circumstances;
and he desired that, besides the nobles
and bishops, there should come to this parliament
knights, or gentlemen from every county, and
citizens and burghers, from every city and burgh
to state what the condition of the people really
was, and to help to advise what could be done
for them; so that the commoners were now, probably,
for the first time, admitted to some share
in the government of the country, which was a
great step gained by the people, who, before
this, had no representatives in the national
council, or parliament, to take their part; and
this was the beginning of our House of Commons,
so it is worth remembering.</p>

<p>8. Prince Edward, after this, escaped from
Hereford, where he had been kept a prisoner,
and gained a great victory over the Barons, and
replaced his father Henry on the throne; after
which, he went on a crusade to the Holy Land.</p>

<p>9. He had married a Spanish princess, named
Eleanor, who was the first person, in England,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
that had a carpet, which she brought from Spain,
for the floors of the best apartments in the
palace were strewed with rushes; and, in houses,
where they could not get rushes, they used
straw.</p>

<p>10. Henry the Third died about seven years
after his restoration, in the year 1272, having
reigned fifty-seven years; and, although the
news was sent to his son as soon as possible, it
was nearly two years before he returned to England;
such was the difference between travelling
then and now; for the journey to and from the
Holy Land may now be accomplished in a few
weeks.</p>

<p>11. Edward the First was a much wiser and
better prince than his father, but he was too fond
of war, and too anxious to be renowned as a conqueror,
which was the cause of the long wars in
Scotland, for his great ambition <ins class="corr" id="tn-98" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'was to conquor'">
was to conquer</ins> that country.</p>

<p>12. But, the first thing he thought of, when
he came home, was to make such regulations as
were most likely to protect the people from robbery;
so he had watchmen and patrols appointed
in all the cities, and ordered that nobody should
be abroad in the streets of London, nor any
taverns kept open, after the curfew bell had
tolled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>13. The curfew was instituted by William the
Conqueror, to prevent fires, which were very
frequent, when houses were in general built of
wood, and thatched; so, when this bell tolled at
eight o’clock, the people, for a long time after
the conquest, were obliged to put out their fires
and candles; but the custom of tolling the bell
was continued after that of putting out fire and
candle was done away with, and even to this day,
in many places.</p>

<p>14. Edward the First took care that the magistrates
should do their duty, and punished those
who broke the laws, which the kings had been
afraid to do in the last two reigns, because their
lives would have been in danger if they had.</p>

<p>15. I must also tell you that this wise monarch
did not alter what the Earl of Leicester had
done about the parliament; but he made it a rule
that the people should continue to send their
members, and every freeholder of land in the
counties, and, in general, all men, in the cities
and burghs, who paid taxes, had a right to vote
at the election of members of parliament.</p>

<p>16. I should be glad to have nothing to say
about warfare in this reign; but the Scottish
wars form so large a portion of the history of
the times, that you ought to know something
about them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>17. First, however, the king invaded the
northern part of Wales, which had never been
conquered by the English, and was then governed
by a prince, named Llewellyn.</p>

<p>18. This chief made a gallant resistance, but
he was killed, and the whole country was then
united to England, and afterwards, in the reign
of Henry the Eighth, divided into shires.</p>

<p>19. The queen, Eleanor, of Castile, Edward’s
first wife, went to visit Wales soon afterwards,
and her son Edward was born there, so the king
said he should be called prince of Wales, and
that is the reason why the eldest son of the
English sovereign has since had that title.</p>

<p>20. After this, there were a few years of
peace, before the wars with Scotland were begun;
so I will fill up the time by saying a little about
the manners and customs of the English at this
period.</p>

<p>21. The nobles lived in, what we should think,
a very rough way indeed. Their large comfortless
rooms, and floors without carpets, unglazed
windows, and clumsy furniture, would not suit
our modern notions, either of comfort or convenience.</p>

<p>22. They had their dinner at ten o’clock in
the morning, in the great hall of the castle;
lords, ladies, knights, esquires, priests, dependents,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
and strangers, all together; for, when there
were no inns, it was usual for travellers to stop
at any castle, or monastery, on the road, where
they were never refused lodging and entertainment.</p>

<p>23. There were no table cloths, and the dishes
and cups were mostly of wood, but they were
well filled with meat, game, fish, or poultry,
which, with bread and ale, constituted the rude,
but substantial fare.</p>

<p>24. The Baron, with his friends, sat at an
upper table, which was served with wine; and,
sometimes he would have his hounds lying at his
feet, and his favorite hawk, upon a perch, beside
him.</p>

<p>25. The supper, at five o’clock, was just like
the dinner, and these were the only regular
meals at that period.</p>

<p>26. I said there were no inns in those days,
which reminds me to speak of the difficulty and
danger of travelling. The roads were very bad
and lonely, often running through forests and
across wide heaths, infested with robbers.</p>

<p>27. Then there were no public conveyances
of any kind, nor any way of making a journey,
but on horseback, or on foot; and, as to stopping
at the country towns, there was very little accommodation
to be had there, for they were poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
places, the houses in them being very little better
than wooden sheds.</p>

<p>28. There were no shops, so that every thing
was bought, as formerly, at the markets and
fairs.</p>

<p>29. A great many merchants, from London,
France, and Flanders, used to bring goods to
the fairs for sale, and they were obliged to pay
tolls and duties to the lord of the manor, which
came to a great deal of money, because they
brought a quantity of valuable merchandise, as
the nobles themselves purchased their wearing
apparel, jewellery, spices, and many other commodities,
at the fairs, which sometimes lasted
fifteen days.</p>

<p>30. The dress of the great nobility, in the
fourteenth century, was very handsome, for they
wore mantles of satin or velvet, with borders
worked in gold, over jackets highly embroidered;
and their velvet caps were often adorned with
jewels.</p>

<p>31. The middle classes wore close coats of
cloth, with leather belts round the waist, such
as the Blue-Coat Boys now wear, and they had
tight pantaloons, short boots, and cloth caps.</p>

<p>32. The clothing of the working people was
made of very coarse wool, sometimes undyed,
and all spun and woven at home by the women,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
who had nothing else for their own wearing, as
there were no cottons or stuffs made in England
then, nor any of the nice comfortable things that
the poor people can get so cheap now.</p>

<p>33. The country towns were at this period
inhabited chiefly by free artisans, such as blacksmiths,
carpenters, and others, of different
trades; but there were still a great many villeins
and serfs, on all the cultivated lands, for
slavery was never abolished in England by any
act of parliament, but gradually died away with
the feudal laws.</p>

<p>34. The armies were not raised then as they
were at an earlier period, by feudal service, but
soldiers were hired and paid by the day; but
there was no standing army, as there is at present;
for, as soon as the wars were over, the men
were all discharged, which was a bad thing, as it
often happened they had no homes or employment
to return to, and so formed themselves into
bands of robbers.</p>

<p>35. However, fighting men had plenty of occupation
during the reign of Edward the First,
of whose wars in Scotland I am now about to
speak.</p>

<p>36. The king of Scotland died about this
time, and as he left no son, and his grand-daughter
and heiress, Margaret, died soon after,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
unmarried, there were two princes, who each
thought he had a right to succeed to the throne;
so they agreed to let the king of England decide
the dispute, which he readily took upon himself
to do. One prince was named Robert Bruce,
the other, John Baliol.</p>

<p>37. Edward said Baliol ought to be king, and
he was crowned accordingly; but the English
monarch soon began to find fault with him, and
at last went to war, for he made up his mind to
try to unite England and Scotland into one
kingdom, and to be the king of both countries
himself; but he did not succeed, although he dethroned
Baliol, and was at war with Scotland
for nearly eleven years.</p>

<p>38. I dare say you have heard of a renowned
Scottish chief, called Sir William Wallace. He
fought bravely for his country in these wars, but
he was taken prisoner at the battle of Falkirk;
and, I am sorry to say, king Edward was so
cruel and unjust as to have his head cut off.</p>

<p>39. But this did not put an end to the war,
for another chief, Robert Bruce, grandson of
him before-mentioned, took the place of Wallace,
gained several victories, and was crowned
king.</p>

<p>40. The two sovereigns then prepared for a
long war, and Edward was on his way to Scotland,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
with his army, when he was taken ill, and
died in the year 1307, having reigned thirty-four
years.</p>

<p>41. His son, Edward the Second, was so
careless of every thing but his own pleasure,
that he neglected the affairs of both England
and Scotland, so that the Scots recovered all
they had lost; and when, at last, the king was
persuaded to renew the war, he met with such
a terrible defeat at the battle of Bannockburn,
that the Scots are proud of it to this very day.</p>

<p>42. There is nothing more worth telling about
the reign of Edward the Second, whose misconduct
caused many of the barons to rebel, and he
was, at last, made prisoner by them, and cruelly
murdered, in Berkeley castle, in 1327, having
reigned about twenty years.</p>

<p>43. His son, Edward the Third, was scarcely
fifteen, at the time of his father’s death; but he
was a very clever prince, and soon began to
manage the affairs of the country himself.</p>

<p>44. He married a Flemish princess, named
Philippa, who was much beloved by the English
people, as, indeed, she deserved to be, for she
was both good and beautiful, as well as one of
the cleverest ladies of her time, and she employed
her talents in doing all the good she
could for England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>45. She knew that the people of her own
country, which was Flanders, had grown rich
by their trade and manufactures, so she did all
in her power to increase the trade of England,
and paid a number of Flemish weavers to come
over here and settle at Norwich, that they
might improve the people there, in the art of
making woollen cloth and stuffs, for which a manufactory
had been established by Edward the
First.</p>

<p>46. She also founded several schools, and was
a friend to those who distinguished themselves
by their learning.</p>

<p>47. I must not forget to tell you that Chaucer,
the first great poet that wrote in English,
lived at this time, and received much kindness
from the king and queen.</p>

<p>48. The English language was now beginning
to be spoken by the higher classes, instead of
French, and was not very unlike the English
spoken now, as you might see, if you were to
look at the poems written by Chaucer.</p>

<p>49. Edward the Third was, unfortunately, as
fond of war as his grandfather. He renewed
the war with Scotland, but his great wars were
in France, for his ambition was to be king of
that country, and he pretended he had a right to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
the throne, because his mother was the sister of
the late king.</p>

<p>50. But the French thought otherwise, and
chose another prince for their king, so Edward
invaded France, where he commenced a long
and destructive war, which lasted nearly forty
years, and was carried on, for a great part of
that time, by his eldest son, who was called the
Black Prince, because he wore black armour.</p>

<p>51. He made great conquests in the south of
France, and, at the celebrated battle of Poictiers,
took the French king prisoner, and brought
him to England, where he remained a captive
for the rest of his life, but was treated with so
much kindness and respect, that he had little to
complain of but the loss of his liberty.</p>

<p>52. The Black Prince was not only a brave
warrior, but was a good and clever man; <ins class="corr" id="tn-107" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'there. fore, his'">
therefore, his</ins> death, which happened a few months before
that of his father, was a great grief to the
English people.</p>

<p>53. Edward the Third died in 1377, after
a long reign of fifty years. He had been a
pretty good king, had made the people obey the
laws, and, in general, observed them himself.</p>

<p>54. When he wanted money for the French
wars, he had allowed the villeins and serfs, on his
manors, or crown lands, to buy their freedom, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
that there were now, comparatively, but few of
the lower orders remaining in bondage; and the
agricultural labourers were paid for their labour,
as well as the artisans and mechanics.</p>

<p>55. Their wages were, in general, from twopence
to threepence a day, but you must remember
that twopence, at that time, was equal, in
purchasing the necessaries of life, to about one
shilling and eightpence of our money, and would
buy much more than sufficient food for a whole
family.</p>

<p>56. They lived chiefly on meat, brown bread,
and ale; for there were no vegetables for the
table, cultivated by the people in England, till
the time of Henry the Eighth; nor any potatoes,
till that of queen Elizabeth; and then they were
considered a dainty dish, and only seen at the
tables of very rich people.</p>

<p>57. However, there were gardens, orchards,
and vineyards, belonging to the monasteries, and
to persons of high rank and fortune.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_110.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">ABDICATION OF RICHARD.</div>
</div>

<p>1. Richard the Second, the son of Edward,
the Black Prince, was but eleven years old when,
by the death of his grandfather, he became king
of England. His uncles governed the country
till he was old enough to act for himself; but
they did not teach him to be a wise, nor a just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
man, and this injustice was the cause of all his
misfortunes.</p>

<p>2. One of the first things he did on his own
account, was to break a promise he made to the
people; and this was how it happened. A new
tax had caused great discontent among the
labouring classes, and their unwillingness to pay
it was increased by the insolence of the collectors,
who, one day, in the house of a man called
Walter, or Wat Tiler, behaved so ill to his
daughter, that he gave one of them a blow on
the head with his hammer, which unluckily killed
him.</p>

<p>3. Now the neighbours knew that if Walter
should be taken, he would be put to death for
the offence, and as they all had cause to complain
of the tax-gatherers, they assembled in
front of his cottage, and declared they would
protect him.</p>

<p>4. This was at Deptford, and they all proceeded
to London, being joined by thousands of
men from different towns, and a dreadful riot
there was; so that it was thought necessary for
the king to take some means of pacifying the
rebels.</p>

<p>5. Accordingly he went, with the lord mayor
and some nobles and gentlemen, to meet them
in Smithfield, and whilst Tiler, their leader, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
talking with the king, the mayor came behind
him, and struck him on the head with his mace,
and stunned him, and he was killed by Richard’s
party; and then the king, fearing the rioters
would kill him in return, asked them what they
wanted, saying, he was ready to do any thing
that was right and just.</p>

<p>6. They said they desired that the poll tax
should be taken off; slavery and villeinage
abolished by law; so that all who were still in
bondage should be made free; and that the old
feudal custom of paying duties on goods, at all
the markets and fairs, should be done away
with.</p>

<p>7. All this Richard promised to do; but no
sooner had the men dispersed and gone back to
their homes, than he sent out a military force to
seize all who had been concerned in the rebellion;
and I grieve to say that, although he had given
his word that they should all be pardoned, he
ordered the judges to have every one of them
executed.</p>

<p>8. After such conduct as this, you will not
expect to hear much good of Richard the Second,
whose selfish extravagance led him to do
all kinds of unjust things, for the purpose of
raising money to spend on his own pleasures;
so that it might truly be said that he was constantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
robbing his subjects; as, for instance, he
once wanted to borrow a large sum of the citizens
of London, which they would not lend him,
because they knew very well he would never
return it; so he took away their charter, that is,
the grant which gives them the right to elect a
lord mayor, and to manage the affairs of the
city independently of the king; and they were
obliged to give him ten times as much to get it
back again, as they had refused to lend.</p>

<p>9. The citizens of London were very rich at
this period, many of them being great merchants,
and it was in this reign that the famous Whittington
was Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>10. He had made a large fortune in the coal
trade, which was then a new branch of commerce,
for coals were very little used for firing till the
time of Edward the Third.</p>

<p>11. King Richard had unjustly banished his
cousin Henry, Earl of Hereford, and on the
death of Henry’s father, the Duke of Lancaster,
had taken possession of his estates.</p>

<p>12. This nobleman was a grandson of Edward
the Third, and was much liked by the English,
who would rather have had him for their
king than the unworthy sovereign they had got,
although he would have had no right to the
throne, even if Richard had been dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>13. However, he came back to England, and
finding most of the nobles as well as the people
willing to make him king, Richard was obliged
to resign the crown, and was imprisoned in
Pomfret castle, where it is supposed he died
by unfair means; but as this is not quite certain,
we will hope it was not so. He had
reigned twenty-two years, when he was deposed,
in 1399.</p>

<p>14. This usurpation of Henry the Fourth
was the cause of the long civil wars in England,
called the Wars of the Roses, which began in
the time of Henry the Sixth, whose right to the
throne was disputed, although his father and
grandfather had been suffered to reign without
opposition.</p>

<p>15. Henry the Fourth was, on the whole, a
popular monarch, and under his government
things went on pretty well with the generality
of the people.</p>

<p>16. There was an insurrection in Wales,
headed by a gentleman, named Owen Glendower,
who wished to restore the Welsh to their
former independence, and to be their prince,
as he was of the ancient royal family; and he
was joined by the powerful Earl of Northumberland,
and his son Henry Percy, better known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
by the name of Hotspur, who was one of the
bravest knights of the age.</p>

<p>17. These noblemen had a quarrel with the
king, and wanted to depose him; but he gained
a victory over them in a battle fought near
Shrewsbury, where Hotspur was killed. These
events are not of much importance, but I tell
them because when you hear any celebrated
characters spoken of, you ought to know who
they were, and when they lived.</p>

<p>18. The prince of Wales, afterwards Henry
the Fifth, was also celebrated for his valour,
but not for his good behaviour in his youth;
for his conduct was sometimes so disgraceful
that his father was quite ashamed of him, and
nobody would have supposed he was the son
of a king.</p>

<p>19. One thing he used to do was to go out at
night, with some idle companions, and rob people
on the highway, for amusement; yet he had
not a bad disposition, for once one of the judges
sent him to prison for trying to rescue one of
his wicked companions; and he not only submitted
to the punishment, but when he came to
be king, he treated that judge with great respect
and attention, because he knew he was a
just man, and would punish the rich as well
as the poor, if they did wrong. King Henry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
the Fourth died in 1413, in the fourteenth year
of his reign.</p>

<p>20. Henry the Fifth is famed as the conqueror
of France. He went to war with that
country, on the same pretext that Edward the
Third did before; and with better success, for
the French king was at last glad to make peace
by agreeing that Henry should be king of France
after his death.</p>

<p>21. The greatest victory gained by the English,
was at the battle of Agincourt. King
Henry married the French king’s daughter, but
he died soon afterwards, in 1422, having reigned
nine years; and leaving an infant son; and in
a little while the king of France died too, and
he also left a son.</p>

<p>22. Then there was a dispute which of these
princes should be king of France, and a new
war was begun which lasted many years, during
which the English lost all that the armies of
Henry the Fifth had won.</p>

<p>23. In the mean time the young king, Henry
the Sixth, grew up so weak in mind and sickly
in body, that he was not able to govern the
country; therefore, his ministers and the queen,
a French princess, named Margaret of Anjou,
had to manage every thing for him.</p>

<p>24. But many people did not like the queen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
and began to say that her husband had no right
to the throne as his grandfather was a usurper;
but that Richard, Duke of York, ought to be
king of England; while others said that, as the
Parliament had consented to let the family of
the Duke of Lancaster reign, it was lawful for
them to keep the crown; and that although king
Henry was not fit for a ruler, the rights of his
son, prince Edward, ought to be protected.</p>

<p>25. The Duke of York was then governor
of Ireland, but when he heard of these disputes,
he came back, and was placed at the
head of the government here, instead of the
queen.</p>

<p>26. I think you will now quite understand
why there was a civil war in England. Every
nobleman in the country took one side or the
other, and the friends of the Duke of York wore
a white rose or ribbon rosette; while those who
supported the king, or House of Lancaster, wore
a crimson one; as people now wear different
colored ribbons at an election, to show which
party they belong to; and this is why these wars
are called the Wars of the Roses.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_119.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">EDWARD IV.</div>
</div>

<p>1. The civil wars may be said to have lasted
thirty years, from the first battle at St. Alban’s,
in 1455, to the battle of Bosworth, in 1485; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
although there were intervals of peace, the quarrel
between the house of York and Lancaster
was not finally settled till the two families were
united by the marriage of Henry the Seventh,
who was heir of the House of Lancaster, with
Elizabeth, the grand-daughter of Richard, Duke
of York, and heiress of that family.</p>

<p>2. During that thirty years, the country was,
as you may suppose, in a very unhappy condition.
Every Baron wanted to collect as many
men around him as he could, to defend his castle
in case of siege; so the countrymen left their
rural labors and went to enlist in the service of
this or that nobleman, because they were sure of
getting plenty to eat and drink.</p>

<p>3. Thus the castle halls were crowded, but the
fields were left without sufficient laborers to
plough and sow them, consequently the crops
were generally bad, and bread was at times, so
dear, that many poor families could get none at
all, but were obliged to eat herbs and berries
that they found in the woods, which did not
nourish them, so that numbers died of want.</p>

<p>4. Many battles were fought in different parts
of England, and the queen was present at some
of them, for it was she who conducted the war,
as the king was incapable of so much exertion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
and Margaret could not bear to see her young
son Edward deprived of his birthright.</p>

<p>5. Three victories had been gained by the
Duke of York, when he was killed at the battle
of Wakefield; but this event did not put an end
to the contest, for his son Edward, who succeeded
to his title, continued the war and, in the end,
became king of England, while poor king Henry
was kept a prisoner in the Tower, where he died
in 1471.</p>

<p>6. Edward owed his success chiefly to the Earl
of Warwick, the richest and most powerful
nobleman in England, and considered as the last
of the great feudal Barons, for it is said that he
maintained no less than thirty thousand people
at his own expense, who were ready to devote
their lives to his service.</p>

<p>7. He had a great many castles in different
parts of England, and a noble mansion in Warwick
lane, London, which still bears that name,
although it presents a very different appearance
from what it did when this mighty Earl lived
there like a sovereign prince, and the place was
crowded with his armed retainers.</p>

<p>8. Edward had been very well received by the
citizens of London, and crowned, with their consent,
long before the death of king Henry.</p>

<p>9. Two battles were fought soon after his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
accession to the throne, one at Towton the other
at Hexham; and it was after the latter, that a
story is told how queen Margaret wandered
about in a forest with her little boy, till they
were both half dead with hunger and fatigue,
when she met with a robber, and instead of trying
to avoid him, told him who she was, and
begged he would protect her child.</p>

<p>10. The man took them to a cave, and gave
them food and shelter, until he found an opportunity
of getting them on board a vessel that
was going to Scotland.</p>

<p>11. People were now in hopes there would be
peace; but the new sovereign was so unwise as
to quarrel with the Earl of Warwick, who became
his enemy, and resolved to deprive him of
the crown he had helped him to win.</p>

<p>12. Then the war was begun again, and went
on for several years longer, till Warwick was
killed at the battle of Barnet, on Easter Sunday,
1471, just ten years after the battle of
Towton.</p>

<p>13. On the day of this battle, queen Margaret,
and her son, prince Edward, then a <ins class="corr" id="tn-122" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'youth of oighteen'">
youth of eighteen</ins>, landed in England, for they had
lived in France some years, and were sadly
grieved at the news of Warwick’s defeat and
death; but as they had a great many friends, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
queen determined upon trying another battle,
which was a great pity, for both herself and her
son were made prisoners, and the young prince
was killed in king Edward’s tent, for making a
spirited answer to some insulting question put to
him by the haughty monarch.</p>

<p>14. The miserable mother was sent to the
Tower, where her husband had just died; but
she was afterwards released, and ransomed by
her father; and she returned to live with him in
France, her native country.</p>

<p>15. And now, that we have done with the
wars, we may begin to think of something more
pleasant. Have you ever heard it was in the
reign of Edward the Fourth that books were
first printed in England?</p>

<p>16. The art of printing, which enables us to
have so many nice books to instruct and amuse
us, had lately been invented in Germany, and
was brought here by an English merchant, named
William Caxton, who went to Cologne, on purpose
to learn how to print, and when he came
back, he set up a printing-press in Westminster
Abbey, which, at that time, was a monastery.</p>

<p>17. We ought <ins class="corr" id="tn-123" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'to bo very much'">
to be very much</ins> obliged to
the clever person that invented printing; for
only think how very ignorant we should be, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
how much pleasure we should lose, if there were
no books to tell us any thing.</p>

<p>18. There were books, certainly, before that
time; but they were all written, and it took so
long to copy them, that they were very expensive,
so that none but very rich people could
have even a few volumes.</p>

<p>19. Printed books were also, for a long time,
much too dear to be in general use, but people
of rank soon began to be much better educated
than in former times, and their habits and manners
became much improved in consequence.</p>

<p>20. Then a great many of the old Norman
castles had been destroyed in the wars, which
put an end, after a time, to the customs of
chivalry; and the nobles, instead of sending
their sons to be brought up for warlike knights,
sent them to Oxford, or Cambridge, to become
scholars; or to Eton College, which had been
founded by Henry the Sixth.</p>

<p>21. King Edward died in 1483, when his eldest
son, who is called Edward the Fifth, although he
never was really king, was only thirteen years
old; and he, and his younger brother, the Duke
of York, were under the guardianship of their
uncle Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who was a
very bad man.</p>

<p>22. Instead of protecting the fatherless children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
entrusted to his care, he only thought how
he might take advantage of their youth to obtain
the crown himself; so he sent them both to the
Tower, but not as prisoners, for it was then used
occasionally as a royal residence, especially in
times of public disturbances; so Richard told
the people the boys would be safe there; but in
a little while it was reported that they were
dead, and it was thought he had caused them to
be murdered, which was most likely the truth,
although some people think they were not put
to death, but were kept there as prisoners for
some years.</p>

<p>23. Richard the Third was not a very bad
king, for he made some laws that were very
useful to the merchants who traded with foreign
countries, and he was the first who thought of
having postmen, or couriers, to carry letters, so
that, wicked as he was, we cannot say he did no
good as a sovereign.</p>

<p>24. The post was, at first, only for government
letters, and it was a long time before any
arrangements were made for private persons to
correspond by the same means; but this was
done by degrees, and in the time of Oliver
Cromwell, the General Post Office was established,
when everybody had the benefit of this
excellent institution, which adds so much to people’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
happiness; for who could possibly be happy
now, if they could not hear from their absent
friends?</p>

<p>25. Richard the Third reigned only two years,
for he was disliked by the nobility, and a conspiracy
was formed against him by the friends
of the House of Lancaster, who were desirous
of placing on the throne the heir of that family,
Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond.</p>

<p>26. This young nobleman was living in exile,
at the time, in France. But he was soon informed
of what was going on, and told the
French king, who lent him forty ships, and
about five thousand soldiers, with which he
sailed directly for England, where he found
friends ready to join him with more troops.</p>

  <div class="caption">LADY JANE GREY REFUSING THE CROWN.</div>
</div>

<p>1. Henry the Seventh was not an amiable
man, but he had many qualities that were good
and useful in a sovereign, and the country prospered
greatly under his government.</p>

<p>2. One of the conditions on which he succeeded
to the throne, was that he should marry
the princess Elizabeth, daughter of Edward the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
Fourth, and thus secure peace by uniting the
families of York and Lancaster:&mdash;the princess
Elizabeth was a lady much beloved by every
body, and her many acts of benevolence were
long remembered in England, so that she was
generally called the good queen Bess.</p>

<p>3. The king wished to increase the wealth
and prosperity of the nation, and he took the
best means of doing so by promoting commerce.
He made commercial treaties, that is, agreements
about trade, with foreign princes, by
which he obtained many advantages for the
English merchants, just as our government has
lately made a treaty with the emperor of China,
about our trade in his country.</p>

<p>4. No English ship had ever been to China
then, nor even to India; and America had not
yet been discovered; but in the time of Henry
the Seventh, the Spaniards and Portuguese
made longer voyages than had ever been made
before, and the celebrated Christopher Columbus,
whom I dare say you have often heard of,
found out by study, that there was an unknown
land on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean,
and although people laughed at him, he at last
persuaded the king and queen of Spain to let
him have ships, and sailors, and money, to go in
search of it, so he was the first that found out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
the way to America, which, for a long time, was
called the New World.</p>

<p>5. Soon after this, the Portuguese found out
the way to India by sea; and then the English
began to make voyages of discovery also, and
to find that the world had more countries in it
than they had ever dreamed of before.</p>

<p>6. Maps and charts, which had been known
to the Greeks and Romans, now began to be
much improved, though they were still incorrect,
as you may suppose.</p>

<p>7. However, all these new discoveries, together
with the invention of printing, made people
think more about learning, and less about
fighting than they used to do; especially as the
nobility were beginning to live more in the way
they do now, and to have handsome houses in
London, instead of living always in their gloomy
old castles.</p>

<p>8. Their domestics were no longer slaves, but
hired servants; their tenants were not villeins,
but free farmers, who paid rent for their land;
and <ins class="corr" id="tn-130" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the poor pesantry'">
the poor peasantry</ins>, no longer in bondage,
were at liberty to go where they pleased, and
were paid for their daily labour.</p>

<p>9. You remember that in the feudal times all
the land in the country belonged to the king,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the nobles, the knights, and the bishops, and
abbots.</p>

<p>10. But Edward the First made a law in
favour of the sale and purchase of all lands except
those held immediately of the king; and
Edward the Third gave his own vassals leave
to sell their estates.</p>

<p>11. Other laws were afterwards made, by
which landed property was made liable to seizure
for debt, and might be given by will, or
sold at the pleasure of the owner. And Henry
the Seventh, by another law, further encouraged
the sale of land, and the consequent division of
large estates.</p>

<p>12. Then many of the nobles, who had more
land than they wanted, sold some of it to
wealthy merchants and others, who built large
mansions, to which they often gave their own
family name, as for instance, if the name of the
proprietor happened to be Burton, he would
probably call his residence Burton Hall.</p>

<p>13. These country gentlemen formed quite a
new class of people in England, and they have
ever since that time continued to increase in
wealth, rank, and importance.</p>

<p>14. A strange thing happened in the reign
of Henry the Seventh, which has made some
people think the sons of Edward the Fourth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
were not put to death in the Tower, as is generally
believed, but you shall hear the story.</p>

<p>15. A young man, called Perkin Warbeck,
came to Ireland from Flanders, and declared
he was the younger of those two princes, and
the lawful heir to the throne, as his brother was
dead.</p>

<p>16. He told a wonderful tale, how he had
escaped from the Tower, and related many adventures
which he said had befallen him; so the
Irish people said they would fight for him, and
try to take the crown from king Henry; but as
they could not raise a sufficient force by themselves,
Warbeck applied to the king of France,
who also promised to help him, and then he
went to the Duchess of Burgundy, who was
Edward the Fourth’s sister, and, strange to say,
that lady declared she believed the young man
was her brother’s son, and persuaded the Flemings
to lend him their aid.</p>

<p>17. But the king of France changed his mind;
and made a treaty of peace with king Henry,
who ordered the English merchants not to carry
on any trade with Flanders while the Flemings
continued to favour the cause of Perkin Warbeck,
so they deserted him too.</p>

<p>18. I have not the room to tell you the rest
of his adventures, but they ended in his being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
taken prisoner by the king, who had him put to
death as a traitor. Henry the Seventh reigned
twenty-four years, and was succeeded in 1509
by his son, Henry the Eighth.</p>

<p>19. The young king was married to Catharine
of Arragon, the daughter of the king of
Spain, a beautiful and talented woman, who
deserved a better husband, for Henry was a
sad tyrant in his family, as well as over the
nation.</p>

<p>20. The greatest man in the kingdom next to
the king, was his minister, Cardinal Wolsey,
who governed the country for many years, and
was so rich, that he not only lived in as much
splendour as the king, but he built the palaces
of Hampton-court and Whitehall, and founded
the College of Christ Church at Oxford.</p>

<p>21. A Cardinal is a priest of high dignity in
the Catholic Church, being next in rank to the
Pope.</p>

<p>22. Wolsey was clever and learned; but he
was very proud, so he had many enemies, and
at last fell into disgrace with the king, and died
of grief.</p>

<p>23. Soon after this Henry chose to be separated
from his good wife, Catharine, because he
had seen a young lady named Anna Boleyn,
whom he thought he should like to marry; so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
he sent the queen and his daughter Mary, away
from court, and made Anna Boleyn queen; but
he soon began to dislike her, and said she had
done some very wicked things, as an excuse for
sending her to the Tower, where he had her
head cut off; and then he married another young
lady, named Jane Seymour, who soon died.
She left a little baby, who was king Edward the
Sixth; and Anna Boleyn also had a baby, who
was queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>24. I must now tell you of a great change
made by Henry the Eighth, with regard to religion,
and called the Reformation.</p>

<p>25. The church of England had, till this period,
been the same as that of Rome, and the
people were Roman Catholics; but there were a
good many people in Germany, and in England
also, who thought that some of the forms of the
Catholic religion were not right, and ought to
be altered, and these persons were called reformers,
and all who adopted their opinions took
the name of Protestants, because they protested
against certain things.</p>

<p>26. Now Henry the Eighth had a disagreement
with the Pope, about his second marriage;
so he determined to abolish the Catholic
religion, to seize on and destroy the monasteries
and nunneries, and to have Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
clergymen to preach and read the prayers in
the churches.</p>

<p>27. It would be too long a story to tell you
how he accomplished all this; but it was done.
There were nearly a thousand religious houses,
that is, convents, abbeys, and priories, in England,
inhabited by monks and nuns, clerks and
friars, of different orders, who had no other
homes, nor any means of living, but on the
property of the establishments to which they
belonged; and these were all suppressed, together
with many colleges and hospitals, which
also supported a great many poor people.</p>

<p>28. The poor were very sorry the convents
were broken up, for they had been accustomed
to go there when they were in distress, for food,
clothing, or medicine; and now they did not
know where to get relief, as there were no
workhouses; the hospitals, and all other charitable
institutions, except some alms-houses,
having been destroyed; nor was it till almost
the middle of the reign of queen Elizabeth that
any provision was made by law for the destitute
poor.</p>

<p>29. The manufactures of England were now
fast increasing. Manchester, Birmingham, and
Sheffield, were beginning to be known as manufacturing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
towns; the first, for woollens and
cottons; the others, for cutlery and hardware.</p>

<p>30. Pewter plates and dishes were made in
large quantities, for they were now used in
the most respectable families instead of wood;
hats were also made in England in this reign;
and a clock, the first ever manufactured in this
country.</p>

<p>31. But nothing was more useful than the
improvements made in gardening, for which we
are indebted to the Flemings and Dutch, who
were the best gardeners in Europe, and who
brought here many kinds of vegetables for the
table, such as cabbages, lettuces, &amp;c., and many
fruits that had not been cultivated in England
since the time of the Romans, particularly cherries
and currants.</p>

<p>32. Potatoes were not known until the reign
of queen Elizabeth, when Sir Walter Raleigh
brought some from America, and planted them,
first in Ireland, little thinking, perhaps, that this
root would, at a future time, be almost the only
food of the Irish people.</p>

<p>33. Henry the Eighth had three more wives,
Anne of Cleves, whom he divorced; Catherine
Howard, whom he had beheaded, like poor Anna
Boleyn; and Catherine Parr, who outlived him.</p>

<p>34. He reigned thirty-eight years, and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
succeeded by his son, Edward the Sixth, who
was only nine years old, and died before he was
sixteen; so that he can scarcely be reckoned
among the kings of England.</p>

<p>35. He was a pious and amiable prince, fond
of learning, and extremely charitable. He
founded St. Thomas’s Hospital, for the sick
poor; and Christ’s Hospital and School, for
the education of boys who had lost their fathers.</p>

<p>36. He had a cousin, Lady Jane Grey, whom
he was very fond of, for she was about his own
age, gentle and beautiful, and being fond of
study, was educated with him; so that it was no
wonder he liked her.</p>

<p>37. They were both Protestants; but Edward’s
eldest sister, Mary, was a Catholic; and
as some of the great noblemen were Protestants,
they did not like to have a Catholic queen; so
when the young king was dying, they persuaded
him to make a will, leaving the crown to Lady
Jane Grey, which was not right, because his
father had ordered, and the parliament confirmed
his will, that, if he died, Mary was to be
queen. Edward the Sixth died in the seventh
year of his reign.</p>

<p>38. Lady Jane was married to young Lord
Guildford Dudley, and knew nothing about
king Edward’s will till after he was dead, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
her husband’s father told her she was to be
queen.</p>

<p>39. At first she refused, but was, at length,
persuaded or compelled to allow herself to be
proclaimed; and very unhappy it made her, so
that she was very glad, at the end of ten days,
to give up the title of queen to her who had a
better right to it.</p>

<p>40. Now Mary was a woman of a morose
temper; and, unfortunately, at that time, and
long afterwards, people who differed in religious
opinions were very cruel to each other; so she
would not forgive poor Lady Jane Grey, but
sent her and her husband to the Tower, where
they were both beheaded.</p>

<p>41. The reign of queen Mary lasted only five
years, and there is little to tell about it, except
that she did all she could to restore the Roman
Catholic religion, and re-established some of the
monasteries; but they were suppressed again,
after her death, by her sister Elizabeth, who
had been brought up in the Protestant faith.</p>

  <div class="caption">QUEEN ELIZABETH REVIEWING HER TROOPS.</div>
</div>

<p>1. Elizabeth is one of the most celebrated
of our sovereigns, for she was a remarkably
clever woman, although, like her father, she was
harsh and tyrannical.</p>

<p>2. It was a merry day in England when she
was crowned, for great numbers of the people
had not liked queen Mary. The citizens of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
London testified their joy by decorating the outsides
of their houses with draperies of silk and
satin; and by having shows and pageants in the
streets, as was customary, at that time, on all
joyful occasions.</p>

<p>3. In one place, a fountain ran with wine;
in another, a boy, dressed to represent an
angel with wings, descended from the top of
an arch, as the queen’s chariot was passing
under, and presented her with a bible; then
was drawn up again by a cord, to look as if
he flew away; and there were many other
things of the same kind, which I have not room
to tell of.</p>

<p>4. The ladies and gentlemen who attended the
queeen rode on horseback, for coaches were not
used in England till some years afterwards,
when a gentleman, from Holland, brought a
carriage over here, and then the English soon
began to build coaches, and ladies of rank left
off riding on horses, as they used to do, seated
on a pillion, behind their husbands.</p>

<p>5. Elizabeth was a good queen in many respects,
for she was a friend to learning, commerce,
and all useful arts; and she chose able
ministers, who ruled the country with wisdom
and prudence; but she behaved very cruelly
about religion, for although numbers of the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
were still Catholics, she made a law that
everybody should go to Protestant churches;
and those who did not were put in prison, or
made to pay such large sums of money, that
they were quite ruined.</p>

<p>6. In other countries, particularly the Netherlands,
the Protestants were as ill-treated as
the Catholics were here, so that a great many
of them came to England, and were very useful
in teaching the English several arts and manufactures
they did not know before.</p>

<p>7. Pins, needles, and paper, were now first
made in England, and the cotton and other factories
were greatly improved, so that there was
more employment for the working classes.</p>

<p>8. Then workhouses were established for the
destitute, and all householders, for the first time,
were obliged to pay a tax, called the poor rate,
to support and find the poor in food and clothes,
so that they might not be driven, by want, to
beg or steal.</p>

<p>9. The middle classes became more wealthy,
and lived in better style than at any former period,
especially the citizens of London, many of
whom were rich merchants, living like noblemen,
and among these was Sir Thomas Gresham, who
built the first Royal Exchange, at his own expense,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
and gave a grand dinner there to the
queen, in the year 1570.</p>

<p>10. English merchants now began to think of
trading to the East Indies: but as it required a
great deal of money to fit out ships, to make so
long a voyage, for it took about four times as
long then as it does now, a number of rich merchants
joined together, and for a sum of money,
obtained a charter from the queen, which made
it unlawful for any other persons to carry on
any trade with that part of the world.</p>

<p>11. It is very interesting to read how this
East India Company first were only permitted
just to land in India, and buy and sell a few
goods; then, how they obtained permission of
the emperor, for there was an emperor of India
then, to build some warehouses on the sea coast,
and form a little settlement, called a factory;
then how they gradually established more factories,
and took soldiers to protect them, and
gained possession of lands, where they built
towns, so that many English families went to
live there.</p>

<p>12. Such was the beginning of the British
empire in India; and, I dare say, that if the
emperor could have foreseen the consequences,
he would not have consented to have an English
factory built on his coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>13. In the reign of Elizabeth, Captain Francis
Drake made a voyage all round the world,
though he was not the first navigator who did
so, but he was the first English one.</p>

<p>14. This was a grand exploit, as few people
had believed, then, that it was possible, or that
the world was really a round body; so you see
how these voyages tended to increase knowledge,
as well as to improve commerce.</p>

<p>15. When Drake returned, the queen went to
dine with him on board his ship, and made him
a knight, after which he was called Sir Francis
Drake, and he soon became an admiral.</p>

<p>16. In the mean time, several voyages had
been made to America, and Sir Walter Raleigh,
who was one of the great men of the time, had
taken possession of a tract of land for the queen
of England, which he called Virginia, and it
still bears that name.</p>

<p>17. The Europeans behaved very unjustly
about America, for although the natives were
savages, they had no right to take away their
lands.</p>

<p>18. But they did so in every place they went
to; and if they were Spaniards, they set up the
Spanish flag, and the commander of the ship
said, “I take this country for the king of Spain;”
and then would fight with the poor natives, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
kill them or drive them away; and, I am sorry
to say, the English used to act much in the same
manner.</p>

<p>19. The Spaniards who had taken some of
the West India Islands, and settled colonies in
South America, wanted slaves to work in the
gold mines, and their sugar plantations; so an
English captain took out some ships to Africa,
and carried off a great many negroes, whom he
sold in the West Indies, for a large price; and
from that time this trade was carried on to a
great extent, and was permitted, by government,
until the beginning of the present century.</p>

<p>20. But we must now think of what was
going on in England. Elizabeth had a cousin,
named Mary, who was queen of Scotland, and
was next heir to the English crown.</p>

<p>21. She was young and beautiful, and had
been married to the king of France, who was
now dead; so she had returned to Scotland, and,
after a time, married lord Darnley, and had a
son, who was our king James the First.</p>

<p>22. Lord Darnley was murdered, and Mary
married another lord, who was disliked by the
Scots, so that there was a civil war, and she was
obliged to resign the crown, and after much ill-treatment,
escaped to England, and begged the
protection of queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>23. Now the queen had always been jealous
of her, and she was now cruel enough to shut
her up in a castle, and, after keeping her a
prisoner for eighteen years, in different places,
gave orders for her execution, and the unfortunate
queen of Scots was beheaded in Fotheringay
castle.</p>

<p>24. Soon after this event, news arrived that a
large fleet was coming to invade England. The
king of Spain, Philip the Second, had been
married to our queen Mary; and had offered his
hand to queen Elizabeth, but she had resolved
not to marry at all, and at any rate, she would
not have had Philip, for she did not like him.</p>

<p>25. He was, therefore, offended; and was also
angry because the queen had been kind to the
Protestants who had fled to England from the
Netherlands, for he was king of those countries
as well as of Spain; and her admirals having
attacked some of his settlements in America, he
determined to invade England, and make himself
king there too, if he could.</p>

<p>26. He got ready the largest fleet that was
ever known, and called it the Invincible Armada;
but it did not prove to be invincible,
although the English had but a very small navy
at that time, not more than fifteen ships of war;
but the merchants lent their ships, and manned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
them at their own expense; and people of all
classes gave money to pay soldiers, to defend the
country, in case the Spaniards should effect a
landing.</p>

<p>27. But they never did land; for the English
vessels, though so much smaller than Spanish
ships, were lighter, and more manageable, and
kept them from coming near the shore; and when
they anchored off Calais, the English admiral
sent fire ships among them, and burnt some of
them, which created such terror, that they sailed
away as fast as they could, some one way and
some another, and the English ships chased
them and disabled a great many; while others
were wrecked by a violent storm; and thus the
Armada was nearly destroyed.</p>

<p>28. Small handbills were printed and sent
about the country, to let the people know that
the danger was over.</p>

<p>29. Many more books were now published,
and there were many clever authors in this reign,
especially Shakespeare, who wrote a number of
beautiful plays.</p>

<p>30. The queen was a great admirer of Shakespeare’s
plays, and used to go to see them acted;
but the theatres were then not much better than
the shows at a country fair, and the performance
was in the day time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>31. People of fashion, in those days, dined at
eleven o’clock; the merchants and tradespeople,
at twelve; and laborers, at one; and all public
amusements were between dinner and supper,
which was taken about six.</p>

<p>32. These amusements did not show very good
taste, for gentlemen and ladies of rank used to
go and see cock fighting, and bull and bear baiting,
which are cruel disgusting exhibitions, and
I only mention them to show you the difference
between the manners at that time and this.</p>

<p>33. I will now give you an idea what kind of
dress people used to wear in the time of queen
Elizabeth. The gowns were open before, with a
stiff bodice, just like a pair of stays, laced in
front, and a large ruff round the neck.</p>

<p>34. In the street, most ladies used to wear a
little black velvet mask, and shoes with such
high heels they could scarcely walk in them.
Gentlemen wore short jackets, reaching a little
below the waist, with a belt and sword, a cloak,
and a high-crowned hat.</p>

<p>35. One great improvement was made in dress
in this reign, by the invention of stockings,
which, for a long time, were all knitted; but they
were found much more convenient than the cloth
hose, that everybody used to wear, till then.</p>

<p>36. Queen Elizabeth died, after a long, prosperous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
and peaceful reign, of forty-five years, in
1603, having named for her successor, her
cousin, James Stuart, king of Scotland: and
thus the two kingdoms of England and Scotland
came to be united, and took the name of Great
Britain.</p>

  <div class="caption">CROMWELL EXPELLING THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.</div>
</div>

<p>1. The people of Scotland did not like the
union of the two kingdoms, at first, because the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
king and many of the nobility went away to
live in London, which, as there was little trade,
left Scotland in a very poor condition; and it
was a long time, indeed, not before the people
had experienced the great benefits of British
trade and commerce, that they began to feel as
a part of the English nation; but now that the
English and Scots have become like one people,
it is certainly much happier and better for both.</p>

<p>2. James had not been king two years, when
a conspiracy was formed against the government,
called the Gunpowder Plot. I cannot tell you
for certain by whom it was contrived, but it was
a wicked scheme to blow up the houses of parliament,
when the king, and most of the lords
and commons were there assembled; but, happily,
it was discovered a short time before the
meeting of parliament, and all the greatest men
in the country were saved from a dreadful death.</p>

<p>3. James the First was not a good king, for
he had a mistaken notion that a king ought to
do whatever he liked; and that, if he wanted
money he had a right to make new taxes, without
the consent of parliament, and, in fact, he
thought it unnecessary to have any parliament
at all, and he taught his son Charles to be of
the same opinion, which was the cause of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
monarch’s untimely fate, and the civil wars that
you will presently read about.</p>

<p>4. In the reign of James the First, there
were such severe laws against those who did not
conform to the church of England, that hundreds
of people emigrated to America, and settled
themselves in colonies in a wild country,
where at first they suffered many hardships and
privations; but these colonies, and others, afterwards
formed, gradually improved, till they became
large flourishing states, now called the
United States of America.</p>

<p>5. James the First reigned twenty-two years,
and was succeeded, in the year 1625, by his son
Charles, whose bad education led to all the miseries
of a long civil war, and to misfortunes that
fell upon his own head.</p>

<p>6. The quarrels between Charles and the parliament,
arose from his taking upon himself the
power of raising money by taxes, without the
consent of the House of Commons; and in other
things he chose to act by his own will, although
it might be quite contrary to the laws of the
country.</p>

<p>7. Many people were put in prison because
they would not lend him money when he desired
it; and, at last, he dissolved the parliament altogether,
and said he would govern without one,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
and then the people had no protection from his
tyranny.</p>

<p>8. Those who were treated the worst were the
Puritans, a religious sect, whose form of worship
was very similar to that of the present Scottish
Church, which is different from the English, as
they have no bishops, do not use prayer books,
and have particular rules about choosing their
own clergymen.</p>

<p>9. The Scots who hold these opinions are
called Presbyterians. The Puritans dressed
very plainly, like quakers, and had their hair
cut close, and on that account they obtained the
name of Roundheads; and those who took part
against the king in the civil war, generally
adopted that fashion, and were distinguished by
that name.</p>

<p>10. After a time, the king began to find that,
if he continued to govern by himself, there
would certainly be a serious rebellion; so he consented
to have a new parliament, and there was
an election directly, and as many of the new
members were Puritans, they perhaps wanted
the king to yield too much, and thus provoked
him not to give up so much as he ought.</p>

<p>11. I cannot tell how this might be; but a
great many people at length began to think it
would be better to have a Republic, that is, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
government without a king, and many of the
Puritans were of that opinion.</p>

<p>12. Charles had undoubtedly brought all his
troubles upon himself, but it was now evident he
must either give up his authority as a sovereign,
or fight to maintain it; so he chose the latter
alternative, and a war was commenced between
the king and the parliament. Each party raised
a large army.</p>

<p>13. The queen, who was sister to the French
king, went to France, to raise money to pay
soldiers to fight for her husband, and to bring
arms for them. He was supported by most of
the English nobility, while the principal commoners
sided with the parliament.</p>

<p>14. The first general for the parliament was
the Earl of Essex, who resigned in favor of general
Fairfax, but the greatest general of the
parliamentary army was a country gentleman
named Oliver Cromwell, who was very clever,
both as a military officer and a statesman; and,
after the death of Charles, he became the ruler
of England.</p>

<p>15. The war caused a great deal of unhappiness
in private families; for, although it was
principally the soldiers who fought, everybody
was interested in the question whether there
should be a king, or not; and such violent quarrels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
arose, that the nearest relatives, even fathers
and sons, and brothers often became enemies,
and many young men went to join one army, or
the other; so that sometimes two brothers might
be on different sides; and then think how dreadful
it was, when a battle took place, that they
should be fighting against each other.</p>

<p>16. The Royalists, who were called Cavaliers,
were known from the Roundheads by their handsome
style of dress, for they wore colored doublets
made of silk or satin, with lace collars falling
over them, and a short cloak over one shoulder.
Their hair was curled in long ringlets, and their
broad hats adorned with long feathers.</p>

<p>17. There was as much difference in dress
between the ladies as the gentlemen, for the
female Roundheads were very plain and prim in
their attire, while the Royalists were dressed in
the gayest fashion.</p>

<p>18. I shall not enter into the particulars of
the war. It is enough to say that after it had
gone on three years, the king was totally defeated,
at the battle of Naseby, in Northamptonshire,
and soon afterwards was made prisoner.</p>

<p>19. The Republicans then had it all their own
way. The king was brought to trial on a charge
of having broken the laws of the country; was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
condemned to death, and beheaded at Whitehall,
January 30th, 1649.</p>

<p>20. But the civil war did not end with the
death of Charles the First, for his son, prince
Charles, who was in Holland at the time, went
to Scotland, where the generality of the people
were not disposed to have a republican government,
so they made the prince promise not to
interfere with their religion, but to join the
Presbyterians, and then they proclaimed him
king, and soon raising an army, he marched into
England.</p>

<p>21. A battle was fought at Worcester, where
Cromwell gained a great victory, and the young
king had to make his escape, in disguise, with a
few friends, who were anxious to get him safely
out of the country; and many curious adventures
they met with, for parties of the republican
soldiers were sent off in all directions in
pursuit of the fugitive prince, who was several
times very nearly caught.</p>

<p>22. His escape was chiefly owing to the fidelity
of five brothers, named Penderel, farmers and
woodmen, who were tenants of a gentleman that
was warmly attached to the Royal family.
They lent him a woodman’s dress, called him
Will Jones; and rode about with him, to show<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
him what houses he might safely go to for shelter
and entertainment.</p>

<p>23. On the third day after the battle, he was
obliged to hide in a wood, in Boscobel, on the
borders of Staffordshire, where he met with a
friend, Major Carlis, who was hiding himself.</p>

<p>24. They heard soldiers about the wood, so
they both got up into an old oak tree, with some
bread and cheese and beer, that one of the Penderels
had brought to Charles, and while they
were there, they heard the soldiers talking close
under the tree, and saying how glad they should
be to find the king, and that they were sure he
must be somewhere thereabouts.</p>

<p>25. The tree was afterwards called the Royal
Oak; and there is a tree now on the same spot,
raised from an acorn of the original one, which
is still distinguished by that name.</p>

<p>26. One time he travelled with a lady, as her
groom, and when they stopped at an inn, he
went into the kitchen, where the cook told him
to wind up the jack, which he did so awkwardly,
that she scolded him.</p>

<p>27. He made an excuse, saying that where he
came from, they did not have roast meat very
often, and never used a jack; but I dare say,
he laughed heartily afterwards, for he was
always merry in the midst of his troubles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>28. At last, after being at hide and seek for
nearly two months, he embarked at Shoreham,
and reached the continent in safety.</p>

<p>29. Great Britain was now not a kingdom,
for there was no king, but it was a Republic, or
Commonwealth, which is a government managed
by the people, or their representatives in parliament.</p>

<p>30. But Oliver Cromwell was an ambitious
man, and wanted to have all the power in his
own hands; so he got the soldiers on his side,
and then told the members of parliament that it
was time for them to go out of office, that there
might be a new election; and on their refusal, he
went to the House of Commons with a regiment
of soldiers, turned out the members, locked the
doors, and took away the keys.</p>

<p>31. He soon formed a new Parliament of men
who were devoted to his interest, and he was
made chief ruler of the state, under the name
of Protector of the Commonwealth; but he
might as well have been called king, for he was
almost as absolute a sovereign as any that had
yet reigned.</p>

<p>32. However, he made a good use of his power
by promoting trade, and foreign commerce, besides
which, he had an excellent army, and a
good navy, so that England was considered of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
more importance, by other nations, than it had
ever been before.</p>

<p>33. The English Admiral, Blake, gained some
great victories over the Dutch at sea; and some
conquests were made both in the East and West
Indies, particularly that of Jamaica, which was
taken from the Spaniards.</p>

<p>34. The English people obeyed Cromwell more
from fear than love, yet he had so many great
qualities that he was respected, as well as feared.
Milton, the poet, was one of his secretaries, and
was much attached to him, as I believe most
people were, who belonged to his domestic circle,
for Cromwell was kind and mild in his family,
although severe and determined in his public
character.</p>

<p>35. There was not much merriment in England,
while he was its ruler, for the Puritans
thought it sinful to dance, or feast, or sing, or
play at any games; so all the theatres and other
places of public amusement were ordered to be
shut up, even at Christmas, which had previously
been a very gay time, when everybody, rich or
poor, used to make holiday for twelve days; and
in every country mansion, there was a good
Christmas dinner, and plenty of fun afterwards,
old and young playing at forfeits, blindman’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
buff, and other Christmas gambols, in the great
hall.</p>

<p>36. But these frolics were forbidden in Cromwell’s
time, and if any merry-hearted folks indulged
in such doings, it was by stealth, and
they kept it secret.</p>

<p>37. The prim dress, and hats with high
crowns, were worn by both sexes; for if any
persons had dressed in a gayer fashion, they
would have been taken for Royalists. Cromwell
died six years after he was made Protector, and
ten from the death of Charles the First.</p>

<p>38. A great many improvements were made
during the Commonwealth; for instance, coffee,
sugar, and India muslins, were first brought to
this country.</p>

<p>39. When Oliver Cromwell was dead, his son
Richard was made Protector; but he liked a
quiet life, and soon gave up the troublesome
task of ruling the country; and as most people
were now of opinion it was better to have a
king than not, the parliament resolved to recall
Charles, who was residing in Holland, and messengers
were sent to tell him that he would be
restored to the throne, on condition that all persons
should have liberty to follow their religious
belief, and that no one should be punished for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
having taken part against him, or his father,
before.</p>

<p>40. He returned to England, and entered
London in great state, on the 29th of May,
1660, on which day, every year, you may always
hear the bells ringing, to commemorate the restoration
of Charles the Second.</p>

<p>41. But the rejoicing is because the old form
of government was restored; for Charles was
not, by any means, a good sovereign, nor had
he one quality to be admired, except that he was
good natured to those about him, and liked to
make fun of every thing. However, I must not
forget to say that he rewarded the Penderels,
who had been so kind to him in his misfortunes.</p>

<p>42. England was now quite a different place
from what it had been. Every body might be
as merry as they chose; the theatres were re-opened;
holidays kept; the villagers danced
round their may-poles as they used to do, and
were not afraid to laugh and sing; while the
towns-people had their pleasant social meetings,
and the London citizens their grand feasts, and
fine shows, as in the days of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>43. During the Commonwealth, there were no
bishops, nor any music allowed in the churches;
but now, the bishops were restored to their former<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
dignity, and beautiful church music was
again heard.</p>

<p>43. But, I am sorry to say, the king did not
keep his promise to let all persons enjoy their
own religion, which caused a great deal of unhappiness,
for numbers of families, to escape
being put in prison, or having their property
taken from them, left their comfortable homes,
and went to settle in the new American colonies,
where they had to endure many hardships, for
it is a long time before the people in new settlements
can obtain the means of living in any
degree of comfort.</p>

<p>44. About five years after the return of king
Charles, the plague broke out in London, and
continued to rage for many months with fearful
violence.</p>

<p>45. The streets were, at that time, narrow
and dirty; the houses mostly of wood, and not
airy; nor was the city so well paved or cleansed,
nor so well supplied with water, as at present,
consequently it was not so healthy; and then,
the doctors were not so clever as they are now,
so that many died, who perhaps might have been
saved.</p>

<p>46. It was a melancholy time. The houses
were all shut up; no business was transacted,
and scarcely anybody was to be seen in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
streets, which were sad and silent, for death was
in almost every house.</p>

<p>47. The king and queen, and most of the
great people, went out of town, but some of the
clergymen and other benevolent persons, stayed
to do what good they could, and some of them
caught the infection, and died.</p>

<p>48. At last, when the heat of the summer was
over, the plague began to abate, and those who
had survived it, returned to their usual occupations;
but with sorrowful hearts, for most of
them had to mourn the loss of their dearest
friends.</p>

<p>49. The plague had often raged in London
before, but had never been so bad; and perhaps
the great fire that followed it, tended greatly to
remove the cause of this dreadful distemper.</p>

<p>50. The memorable fire of London happened
September, 1666. It began at a baker’s shop,
near London-bridge, and spread rapidly from
street to street, till almost all the town was in
flames.</p>

<p>51. It continued to burn for three days, and
destroyed nearly the whole city, with most of
the churches and public buildings; but there
were very few lives lost, as the people fled from
their houses when they saw the fire approaching
the street in which they lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>52. Many, however, were ruined by the loss
of their property, and all were left houseless, so
that they had to set up tents in the fields, to
shelter themselves till they could find some place
to go to; and subscriptions were made for the
relief of those who were most in need, for generally
the respectable citizens had saved their
plate, jewels, and money.</p>

<p>53. The fire put an end to the pestilence, and
so far proved a benefit, in the end; for the city
was rebuilt with wider streets; the houses were
built of brick or stone, and altogether it was
handsomer and more healthy; one proof of
which is, that the plague has not been known in
London since.</p>

<p>54. The visitation of the cholera, in 1829-30,
although partaking somewhat of the character
of a plague, was a different disease, and yielded
to cleanliness and medical treatment.</p>

<p>55. It was about this time, that tea was first
brought to England, from China, by the East
India Company; but it was so very dear, that a
pound of tea was thought a handsome present,
and it was a very long while before people drank
it as they do now.</p>

<p>56. Except in London, Liverpool, and some
of the principal towns, nobody had ever heard
of such a thing as tea; for there was but little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
intercourse between London and the country
towns at that time, as the roads were still bad,
and there were no stage coaches till a few years
after the death of Charles the Second, and then
only on three or four of the principal roads.</p>

<p>57. The rich country gentlefolks lived in a
plain homely way, and their daughters were
brought up to assist in domestic duties, such as
washing, ironing, cooking, knitting, and many
other useful things; but they seldom had any
other accomplishments, and very few could read
or write.</p>

<p>58. Charles the Second died in 1685, twenty-five
years after his restoration, and was succeeded
by his brother James, who was a Catholic,
and tried to restore the Catholic religion,
although he had promised not to do so.</p>

<p>59. The people soon began to feel that he did
not mind breaking the laws to accomplish this
object; so a great many Protestant noblemen
and gentlemen agreed that it would be better to
take the crown from him, and to place on the
throne a prince of another family, for they said,
the laws would never be rightly observed so long
as the Stuarts, or a Catholic king, reigned; so
they sent to William, prince of Orange, who was
married to the king’s daughter, Mary, and asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
him to become king of England, and he consented.</p>

<p>60. He came, with a large army, to Torbay,
in Devonshire; but there was no fighting, for
king James, with his wife and infant son, fled to
France, where he was kindly received by the
French king, Louis the Fourteenth, who promised
to try and replace him on the throne; but the
attempt was unsuccessful, as you will presently
see.</p>

<p>61. James the Second had only reigned in
England three years, and during that time the
Protestants were so cruelly treated in France,
that thousands of industrious artisans came over
here, chiefly silk weavers, but also watchmakers,
cutlers, and manufacturers of glass, writing
paper and many other things; from whom the
English learned to make all these things as well
as the French.</p>

<p>62. The middle classes were much better off
than at any former time, on account of the increase
of trade; but the lower orders were not
so well off, for wages were less, in proportion
to the prices of bread and meat, than they were
at earlier periods of our history.</p>

<span class="fs60">THE REVOLUTION.&mdash;1689 TO 1714.</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="figcenter illowe30" id="i_b_168">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_168.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH.</div>
</div>

<p>1. The changes made in the government by
taking the crown from James the Second, and
giving it to William the Third, was called the
Revolution, and was a good thing for England,
as it was then settled that no sovereign, in
the future, should follow his own will, or act
contrary to the laws of the country; that all
new laws should be proposed by the parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
and not by the king; who was only to have the
power of giving or refusing his consent to them;
which is very different from being able to make
laws without asking any one, as the kings and
queens of England had hitherto often done.</p>

<p>2. The way, now, is this:&mdash;when a gentleman
of the House of Commons, or a nobleman of
the House of Lords, thinks of any thing that
will be good for the nation, he mentions it to the
rest and they all consult about it, every one giving
his opinion whether he thinks it good or not;
and if the greater number think it will be good,
it is settled that it shall be done, if both Houses
of Parliament and the sovereign agree to it;
for whichever House of Parliament begins and
agrees to a measure, it is sent to the other
House for approval:&mdash;this is called passing the
bill.</p>

<p>3. When both Houses have done what they
consider good and necessary, it is submitted to
the queen or king, who generally approves of it
also; and then it becomes a law.</p>

<p>4. Another rule made at the Revolution was,
that the parliament should meet every year, and
that there should be a new election at least once
in three years, to give the people an opportunity
of choosing other members, if they had not approved
the votes of the old ones; but, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
reign of George the First, this arrangement was
altered to seven years, and so it has continued
ever since.</p>

<p>5. It was also agreed that none but a Protestant
should ever be king or queen of England;
and all these, with many other regulations, were
written down, and signed by king William, and
this is called the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>6. No one was to be persecuted on account
of his or her religion; but the Catholics were
not allowed to hold landed property, or to be
members of parliament; and it was not till the
reign of George the Fourth that people of the
Catholic faith were restored to their ancient
rights and privileges.</p>

<p>7. Soon after William was made king, he had
to go to Ireland, to fight against James the Second,
who had landed there with a French army,
thinking the Irish would assist him to recover
the throne. But he was defeated in a battle
fought on the banks of the river Boyne, and
obliged to go back to France, where he lived in
retirement for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>8. His daughter, Mary, the wife of king William,
was a very amiable woman, and much beloved
by the English. It was she who induced
the government to convert the palace at Greenwich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
into an asylum for poor old sailors; and the
king gave money for the purpose.</p>

<p>9. The East Indian trade was very much increased
during this reign, so that all things that
came from China and India, such as tea, silk,
cotton, spices, porcelain or china ware, and many
other beautiful and useful things, became more
easy to be procured in this country.</p>

<p>10. I must also tell you that the Bank of
England was now first established, for the purpose
of raising money for the government to
carry on war against Louis the Fourteenth, of
France; and this was the beginning of what you
will sometimes hear called the National Debt;
for when people put money into the bank, it is
the same as lending it to the king or the government;
and as long as they choose to lend it,
they are paid so much a year for doing so, and
this is called their dividend, which they go to
the Bank twice a year to receive.</p>

<p>11. The war in which king William was engaged,
had nothing whatever to do with the
English, but was only for the sake of helping
the Archduke of Austria, to fight out his quarrels
with the king of France; yet, after William’s
death, these wars were carried on during
the whole reign of queen Anne, who succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
William the Third, in the year 1702, after he
had reigned thirteen years.</p>

<p>12. These wars caused great distress in England,
where the taxes were increased, to pay the
expenses of the soldiers, and trade was much
injured, as we were at war with both France and
Spain.</p>

<p>13. There was a duty, for the first time, laid
upon many things that people have to use every
day, such as soap, starch, and paper, so that
all these articles became much dearer.</p>

<p>14. The meaning of a duty is this:&mdash;The parliament
says, no person may make any paper,
unless he give to the government so much money
for every ream he makes; so the paper-makers
pay the money, and charge more for their paper
to the shopkeepers, who buy it of them; then
you and I, and everybody who uses paper, must
pay more for it than if there was no duty; and
the same with all things on which there are
duties. So you see the expenses of war fall
upon every one, in some way or other.</p>

<p>15. Queen Anne was a daughter of James
the Second, but as she was a Protestant, no objection
was made to her accession, although her
brother was excluded from the throne, as being
a Catholic.</p>

<p>16. The most important event that took place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
in the reign of queen Anne, was the complete
union of England and Scotland, for although
they had been governed by one king, since the
time of James the First, they had separate parliaments,
and different laws; but it was now settled
that a certain number of the Scottish lords
and commons should sit in the English houses
of parliament, and that all the laws about trade,
and every thing that did not interfere with the
habits or religion of Scotland, should be the
same.</p>

<p>17. This union of the parliaments took place
in 1707, from which time England and Scotland
have been one country, called Great Britain.</p>

<p>18. There was a celebrated General, the Duke
of Marlborough, who won some famous battles
in Germany in the reign of queen Anne; and
there was a brave Admiral, Sir George Rooke,
who took the fortress of Gibraltar, which was
a conquest of some importance to England,
because it stands at the entrance of the Mediterranean
sea, and may be said to command the
passage taken by ships trading to the Grecian
islands, Egypt, Turkey, &amp;c. Queen Anne
died in the year 1714, having reigned twelve
years.</p>

  <div class="caption">DEATH OF GENERAL WOLFE.</div>
</div>

<p>1. When queen Anne died, the crown of
England went to a German prince, named
George, the elector or sovereign of Hanover,
whose mother was grand-daughter of James the
First.</p>

<p>2. He was rather advanced in age, and being
a stranger to the manners of the people, and to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
the language and laws of the country, was not
likely to become a popular monarch; yet it was
thought better that he should succeed to the
throne, than to let the son of James II., who
was now about six-and-twenty, be king of Great
Britain.</p>

<p>3. But there were a great many people in
Scotland who wished to see the family of their
ancient kings restored, and some of the great
men, there, raised an army, and invited prince
James Stuart, who is usually called the Pretender,
to place himself at the head of it, and go
to war with George the First.</p>

<p>4. The Pretender went to Scotland, and two
battles were fought, one near Dumblane, and the
other near Preston, in Lancashire; but the English
troops gained the victory at both places,
and the prince was glad to get back to France
again.</p>

<p>5. A great many English had joined in this
rebellion, for, as I said before, the new king was
not very generally liked; and it was mostly the
English party that fought for the Pretender at
Preston, and, I am sorry to say, all who were
made prisoners were very cruelly treated. The
leaders were put to death, and those who had
fought under their command, were mostly sent
to America, and sold for slaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>6. You remember how the American colonies
were first settled. Well, they had now become
large populous places, and cities had been built
there; but the people were cultivators, and had
no manufactures of any kind, for they were
obliged to have all they wanted of manufactured
goods, either for clothing, or any other purpose,
from England, which was a great advantage to
this country, by furnishing employment for English
manufactures.</p>

<p>7. Perhaps you will say, why could they not
have things from other countries, as well as
from England?&mdash;but you must bear in mind that
the American states were then under British
government, and remained so till the reign of
George the Third, when the Americans established
a government of their own, and went to
war with Great Britain, as you will presently
read, and with the assistance of France, made
themselves independent of this country.</p>

<p>8. George the First died in 1727, having
reigned nearly thirteen years, and he was succeeded
by his son, George the Second.</p>

<p>9. There had been a great change in the
mode of dress since the time of the Stuarts, for
queen Anne had introduced a fashion of setting
out the gowns with hoops; and gentlemen wore
coats with broad square-cut tails, waistcoats with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
long flaps, colored stockings drawn up over the
knee, lace ruffles, large shoe buckles, wigs with
rows of stiff curls, three-cornered hats bound
with gold-lace, and swords.</p>

<p>10. Towards the close of the eighteenth century
this formal inconvenient style of dress was
altered gradually; swords were left off; the hair
which, in the early part of the reign of George
the Third, was frizzed out, pomatumed and powdered,
was dressed in a more natural manner;
round hats came into fashion, and people began
to look something like what they do now.</p>

<p>11. The reign of George the Second, which
lasted thirty-three years, was on the whole rather
a prosperous one, the greater part of it being
spent in peace. There was no war for about
twelve years, and during that time improvements
were going on all over the country.</p>

<p>12. Most of the great towns were made larger,
and new manufactories built, for the trade of
England was increasing every year, and great
quantities of manufactured goods were sent out
to foreign countries; besides which, new roads
were opened, waste lands cultivated, canals
formed, and new harbors made for shipping, so
that there was plenty of employment for the
laboring people.</p>

<p>13. We had a good navy at this time, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
first war that broke out was carried on entirely
at sea. It was with the Spaniards, who had
taken possession of a great part of South
America, and, as they chose to keep all the
trade to themselves, they had ships constantly
sailing about, to prevent the ships of other nations
coming there, which was all very fair; but
not content with guarding their own possessions,
they interfered with British merchants, who
were going to or from other places, plundered
some of their vessels, and behaved so ill, that
the British government was obliged to declare
war, and sent out a great many ships to fight
the Spaniards.</p>

<p>14. I dare say you have heard stories about
press-gangs taking away poor men against their
will, to make sailors of them. This cruel expedient
for getting plenty of sailors, was resorted
to in all the wars during the reigns of George
the Second and George the Third, when many a
poor fellow, in going to or returning from his
daily labor, was met by a party of armed men,
called a press-gang, and carried off, by force, to
a ship, without being allowed to go home, or
take leave of his family. Such things ought not
to be done in a free country, and I hope they
never will be done again, even if we should have
the misfortune to be at war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>15. At this time, the French had large possessions
in India, as well as the English, and it
seemed doubtful which of the two nations would,
in the end, be masters of the country; but this
question was decided in the reign of George the
Second, for, while the war with Spain was going
on, a war broke out between France and England,
about the affairs of Germany, where our
king himself commanded the army, and fought
at the battle of Dettingen; but the fighting between
the French and English in India, was of
more consequence, as several great victories were
gained by a brave commander, named Clive, by
which the superiority of the English in India
was quite established, and ever since that time,
we have gained one place after another, in that
extensive and rich country, until a large portion
of India has become a province of the British
empire.</p>

<p>16. While these wars were going on abroad,
there was another great rebellion in Scotland;
for prince Charles Edward Stuart, the son of
the old Pretender, being now a man, had come
there to make another attempt to recover the
throne for his father; and being joined by some
of the Highland chiefs, and numbers of Scotch
people, as well as by many English who were
discontented with the government, he went to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
Holyrood house, the old palace of his ancestors,
at Edinburgh, where he held a court, and behaved
as if he had been sovereign of the country.</p>

<p>17. Of course, an army was sent from England,
to put down this rebellion, which caused a
great deal of misery; for, besides the numbers
of brave men that were killed in the several
battles which took place, many were afterwards
executed as traitors, which must have been more
dreadful for their families than if they had fallen
in battle.</p>

<p>18. If Charles Edward had any good feeling,
I think he must have been very sorry for the
mischief he caused. He was finally defeated at
the battle of Culloden, and obliged to escape,
like Charles the Second, after the battle of
Worcester, and his adventures are very similar,
but more full of suffering, than those of the
merry monarch. This is usually called the Rebellion
of ’45, because it was in the year 1745.</p>

<p>19. There is only one thing more of importance
to mention in the reign of George the Second,
and that is the conquest of the large country
of Canada, in North America, which had
belonged to the French, who had settled there
as the English had in the United States, and
built several good towns, one of which was
Quebec.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>20. There had frequently been quarrels between
the French and English in America,
respecting their possessions, which, at length,
occasioned a war there, and soldiers were sent
out both from France and England, the French
wanting to conquer the British states, the English
to gain possession of Canada.</p>

<p>21. This war had lasted about five years,
when the renowned General Wolfe gained a
great victory at the battle of Quebec; after
which, the French gave up Canada, which has
belonged to England ever since, and is a very
useful possession, supplying abundance of fine
corn, and timber for building.</p>

<p>22. General Wolfe was killed on the field of
battle, just as the victory was won, and his
death was much lamented in England, where the
news of the conquest arrived a few days before
the death of the king, which happened in October,
1760, after he had reigned thirty-three
years.</p>

<p>23. The eldest son of George the Second was
dead, but he had left a son, named George, who
succeeded his grandfather, and was about twenty-two
years old. He was a very good man and
was highly respected, although many people say
he was more fitted for a country gentleman than
a king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>24. He married a German princess, whose
name was Charlotte, and they had many children,
some of whom are yet living. Our queen
is the grand-daughter of George the Third.</p>

<p>25. About two years after the new king came
to the throne, peace was made with France and
Spain, and there were no more wars for thirteen
years, when the Americans became dissatisfied
with the English government, and resolved to
have a government of their own.</p>

<p>26. But let us see what useful things were
done in England during that thirteen years of
peace. First of all, the manufacture of China
ware was begun in Staffordshire, by a gentleman,
named Wedgewood, who built large factories
and employed a great number of people in
this new branch of art. Then a machine was
invented for spinning cotton, by which we were
enabled to manufacture cotton goods in much
larger quantities than before, and as they could
be sold abroad, this was a great benefit.</p>

<p>27. It was also discovered how very useful
steam engines might be made; but I fancy
nobody then imagined that we should ever travel
by steam, or print by steam, or do many other
wonderful things, that are now done by that
means.</p>

<p>28. Turnpike roads were established all over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
the kingdom, and travelling thus rendered safer
and more expeditious. People were in general
much better educated than in the preceding century,
and all arts and sciences were greatly improved.</p>

<p>29. And now I will tell you something about
the American war. The quarrel began about
some taxes which the British government imposed
on the Americans, to help to pay the expenses
of the wars with France and Spain, which
the Americans thought they had nothing to do
with; and considered it unjust that they should
have to find money towards paying for them.</p>

<p>30. British troops were sent out, to force
them to obey the orders of the government; but
instead of complying, all the colonies agreed to
join together and fight for their liberty; and a
very brave and good man, named General Washington,
took the command of the American
army.</p>

<p>31. This war lasted many years, and the
French and Dutch assisted the Americans with
troops, ships, and money.</p>

<p>32. There were many gentlemen in the English
parliament who wanted to put an end to the
war, by giving up all control over the Americans;
but others would not consent, the king
was unwilling to do so, till, at last, finding there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
was little chance of success, the English government
gave up the contest, and the American
colonies became independent of England, and
took the name of the United States.</p>

<p>33. This event took place in 1783, after which,
there were a few more years of peace, and then
the long wars with France were begun, which
lasted above twenty years, and were ended by
the famous battle of Waterloo.</p>

<p>34. The cause of the war was this. There
had been a great revolution in France. The
people rose up against king Louis the Sixteenth,
who was made prisoner, and beheaded; just as
Charles the First was treated here, and for
much the same cause. Then a number of persons
took the government into their own hands, and
governed without a king, and declared war
against the king of Great Britain, and also
against the stadtholder of Holland, and the king
of Spain, for disapproving of what the French
people had done.</p>

<p>35. The Spaniards and Dutch were afterwards
obliged to join the French, and many
battles were fought both on land and at sea, and
some naval victories were gained by the British
Admirals Duncan, Howe, and Nelson, and other
officers.</p>

<p>36. The greatest man in France at this time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
was Napoleon Bonaparte, an artillery officer,
who raised himself to the head of the state, just
as Cromwell did here, by getting the soldiers to
side with him. He was called consul, at first,
but afterwards he was made emperor, and he
conquered a great part of Europe, and he made
the governments of those countries which he did
not conquer do just as he pleased, except England,
for he had the largest armies of any sovereign
in the world.</p>

<p>37. The most celebrated of our generals in
the war against Bonaparte, were Abercrombie,
Sir John Moore, and the Duke of Wellington,
the last of whom won a great many battles in
Spain, and at last, with the assistance of the
Prussians, gained the great victory at Waterloo,
near Brussels, on the 18th of June, 1815, after
which, Bonaparte surrendered to the English,
and was banished to a small island, called St.
Helena, in the South Atlantic Ocean, where he
died in a few years. The fall of Bonaparte was
followed by a general peace.</p>

<p>38. George the Third was still living, but he
had been out of his mind, and blind, for some
time, so that his son George, prince of Wales,
had been made regent in the year 1810, and
conducted the government with that title, till his
father’s death, which happened in the year 1820,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
he having reigned above fifty-nine years, when
George the Fourth became king, instead of
regent.</p>

<p>39. But I must now go back some years to
tell you of something that was done at the beginning
of this century. You have been told
that Ireland had been subject to England, ever
since the time of Henry the Second; but there
had constantly been quarrels and warfare between
the native Irish, and the new Irish, who
were the descendants of the English, who had
settled there, after the conquest.</p>

<p>40. Then the new Irish were just as ready to
quarrel with new English settlers, as the old
Irish were with them; and, till the last fifty
years, little had been done to make the people
of Ireland a better or a happier race. They
had a parliament of their own, but it did not
encourage the people to be industrious, so they
were, of course, very poor.</p>

<p>41. A few years after the war with France
began, there was a great rebellion in Ireland,
and soldiers were sent from England, to put a
stop to it, which I am afraid was not done without
a great deal of cruelty; but it was in consequence
of this rebellion that the English government
resolved that the parliament and country of
Ireland should be united to that of England; as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
the parliament and country of Scotland had been,
and this union took place on the first of January,
1801, which you will easily remember, because
it was the first day of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>42. Many good laws have been made since
then, for the benefit of Ireland, and much been
done to improve the country; but numbers of
the Irish people still remain in a very distressed
condition, and some of them wanted to have a
separate Parliament again; and this is what is
meant by Repeal of the Union; but this feeling
is now fast dying away.</p>

<p>43. In the reign of George the Third, there
were National and Sunday schools established in
almost every part of England, so that the poor
people might be able to have their children
taught to read and write, which was a great
blessing to them; for although there had long
been charity schools in London, there were few
in the country, and many of the shopkeepers in
country towns, who had become quite respectable
people by their industry, were so ignorant that
they could not even make out their own bills, or
keep their own accounts.</p>

<p>44. There were two more great improvements
before the death of George the Third; the one
was the invention of gas lights, which make the
streets much lighter at night than the dim oil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
lamps that were formerly used; and the other
was the introduction of steam boats, which had
lately been invented in America.</p>

<span class="fs60">FROM THE DEATH OF GEORGE THE THIRD,
1830, TO THE PRESENT TIME.</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="figcenter illowe30" id="i_b_190">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_190.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">QUEEN VICTORIA’S VISIT TO THE CITY OF LONDON.</div>
</div>

<p>1. George the Fourth, who had been regent
ten years, reigned as a king from 1820, to 1830.
During that time, every improvement that had
been begun was carried to a greater extent.
The education of all classes of people was conducted
on a better system, and greater numbers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
of cheap books were published for the instruction
of the working classes.</p>

<p>2. London was greatly improved by the building,
in some parts, of wide handsome streets, in
the place of narrow, dirty, crowded ones, and
the manners of the English were improved also,
by their intercourse with foreign nations; for
after the peace, people began to visit France,
Italy, and other parts of Europe, while a great
number of foreigners came here, and we adopted
such of their customs as were superior to our
own; for people may always improve from each
other.</p>

<p>3. The French, German, and Italian languages
began to be more generally studied in
England: and the arts and sciences, especially
painting and music, were more highly cultivated.</p>

<p>4. But I am sorry to say that, amid all these
benefits, there was a great deal of distress
among the laboring people, for the expenses of
the war had been so heavy that it was some
years before the blessings of peace could be felt;
and thus all the necessaries of life continued to
be very dear, and wages, in proportion, very low,
which occasioned riots in many parts of the
kingdom; for the poor people had expected that,
as soon as there was peace, most of the taxes
pressing on them would be taken off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>5. But the government thought it right first
to take off the property tax, and then found
they could not do without the money the other
taxes produced. Then the people, not getting
relief from the taxation, thought some alterations
in the laws might remedy their distress, and
sent petitions to parliament praying that these
alterations might be made. The principal thing
they wanted was, what you have perhaps heard
called the Reform Bill.</p>

<p>6. This was a law to give the right of voting
for members of parliament to a greater number
of people, and also to make alterations with regard
to the places that were allowed to send
members to parliament; for there were many
old boroughs that were formerly important
places, but now had scarcely a house left standing,
yet still were represented by two members
in parliament; which was ridiculous, because the
object of sending a member to parliament is,
that he may do all the good he can for the people
of the place he represents, as well as for the
nation; then there were many large towns, such
as Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, &amp;c., that
had grown into importance since the time when
it was settled what places should have representatives,
and these had none at all.</p>

<p>7. Another thing desired by the people, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
an alteration in the Corn Laws, so that bread
might be cheaper; and this alteration was to be
made by letting corn be brought from abroad
without paying duty. Neither of these points
were gained while George the Fourth was king;
but the Reform Bill was passed during the reign
of his successor, William the Fourth; and, in
the year 1846, some important alterations were
made in the corn and provision laws.</p>

<p>8. William the Fourth was the brother of
George the Fourth, and on the death of that
monarch, in 1830, succeeded to the throne.</p>

<p>9. That same year is memorable for the opening
of the first Railway for travelling, which
was that between Manchester and Liverpool; a
circumstance that may be mentioned as the commencement
of one of the greatest changes of
modern times, and when we consider the number
and extent of the railways now in use, we cannot
but admire the immense works of the kind
that have been performed in so short a space of
time.</p>

<p>10. The speed with which we can now travel,
both by sea and land, would astonish our good
old ancestors, who used to think it a great and
dangerous undertaking to set out on a journey
of twenty or thirty miles.</p>

<p>11. In the time of Charles the Second, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
poet Cowley, who had a country house at Chertsey,
which is only twenty-two miles from London,
invited a friend in town to pay him a visit, saying
in his letter, that as he could not perform
the whole journey in one day, he might sleep at
Hampton.</p>

<p>12. I think he would have been glad of a
railway, which would have taken him all the
way before breakfast. In 1706, the stage coach
from York was four days coming to London;
and so late as 1763, there was only a coach once
a month from Edinburgh to London; and it was
a whole fortnight on the road; so I think you
will see the advantages of our present mode of
travelling.</p>

<p>13. The custom of buying and selling negroes
had been abolished by parliament during the
reign of George the Third, but there were many
thousands of slaves in the West India islands,
belonging to the British planters there.</p>

<p>14. During the reign of William the Fourth,
the British government gave twenty millions of
money to buy all the slaves of their masters and
then set them free. The day when the negroes
became free people was the first of August,
1838.</p>

<p>15. I told you that the Reform Bill was passed
in this reign. One consequence of this measure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
was, the lessening of the duties, or taxes, on
many articles of necessity, thereby reducing
their prices, so that the poor people could live
much better than they had formerly.</p>

<p>16. The harvests were also plentiful for several
years, so that bread was very cheap, and the
prices of all kinds of clothing were less than in
previous years.</p>

<p>17. Upon the whole, there had never been a
better time in England than the seven years that
William the Fourth occupied the throne. He
died in 1837, and was succeeded by her present
Majesty, queen Victoria, who was the daughter
of his deceased brother, the Duke of Kent.</p>

<p>18. In 1840, she married her cousin, Prince
Albert, of Saxe Coburg and Gotha. Their
family now consists of eight children, four princes,
and four princesses.</p>

<p>19. The most remarkable events that have
yet happened in the reign of queen Victoria,
are the wars in China and India: but I ought to
have mentioned an alteration made in the last
reign, with regard to the East India trade,
which you, perhaps, remember was carried on
solely by the East India Company, according to
a charter granted by queen Elizabeth, and renewed,
from time to time, by other sovereigns.</p>

<p>20. In 1813, however, it was made lawful for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
private merchants to trade to India; but this
right was not extended to the trade with China,
which was still confined to the Company till
1833, when a new law was made with regard to
that also, and any person then was at liberty to
go to China for tea, silk, and other commodities,
which have since been much cheaper in consequence.
Tea is little more than half the price
it used to be, which is a great benefit and comfort
to the poor.</p>

<p>21. But this had nothing to do with the war
in China, which arose from a dispute about the
British merchants selling opium to the Chinese,
who were forbidden by their emperor to buy it,
because it injures the health of those who take
it, like drinking spirits.</p>

<p>22. Still the merchants continued to carry
opium to China, and the people to buy it; so the
governor at Canton, the only Chinese town in
which foreigners were allowed to trade, seized
and burnt some ship-loads of opium, for which
he would not pay the owners; and this was the
cause of the war.</p>

<p>23. There were several battles fought, in
which the Chinese were always defeated, for
they were not much acquainted with the present
art of war; but, at last, after three years of
warfare, peace was made with the British; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
the Chinese emperor agreed to pay a sum of
money, and to cede, or give up, to the British
government, the Island of Hong Kong; besides
agreeing that English ships might land goods
for sale, at five ports, instead of one only, and
that British merchants might have warehouses,
and reside at those places. A treaty to this
effect was signed in August, 1842.</p>

<p>24. The war in India, was much more serious,
and lasted a great deal longer. It was begun
for the purpose of restoring to his throne an Indian
prince, the king of Caboul, who had been
deprived of his kingdom by another prince.</p>

<p>25. The wars occasioned by this usurpation
being likely to endanger the safety of the British
possessions, the Governor General thought it
necessary to interfere; and from the year 1839
to that of 1846, the British armies in India were
engaged in terrible and destructive wars with
the Affghans, and other nations in the north and
west of India.</p>

<p>26. These calamitous strifes were happily
ended by two great victories gained on the banks
of the Sutlej, at the beginning of 1846, the one
by General Sir Harry Smith, the other, by General
Sir Hugh Gough. By the conquests made
during these wars, the British empire is extended
over the greater part of India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>27. Among the important inventions of this
reign, may be mentioned that of the Electric
Telegraph, by means of which communications
can be made between places a hundred miles
apart in one moment, or indeed to any imaginable
distances.</p>

<p>28. I have already mentioned the distressed
condition of great numbers of the Irish people;
and am sorry to have now to say that their
misery has been greatly increased in the last
three years, by the failure of the potato crops,
on which the lower orders in Ireland depend for
their subsistence.</p>

<p>29. This food they can, with two or three
months labor in the year, grow for themselves;
and as they are, unfortunately, contented with
such poor living, it is a very sad thing for them
when a bad season occurs, and the potatoes are
spoiled; which happens generally once in six or
seven years.</p>

<p>30. But there have now been three bad seasons
following each other; and this calamity has
caused so much distress, that thousands have
died of fevers and other diseases, occasioned by
want of wholesome and sufficient food.</p>

<p>31. The Parliament expended several millions
of money in relieving their distresses, and providing
them employment. Large sums of money<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
were also subscribed by individuals in England,
Scotland, and America, for the relief of
the people in Ireland; and charitable committees
were formed in many parts of that country to
receive the money, and distribute the food and
clothing purchased with it.</p>

<p>32. New poor laws have also been made by
the government, to afford greater relief to the
destitute; and every thing has been done, that
humanity could suggest, to better their condition
and relieve their wants.</p>

<p>33. The year 1848 will ever be memorable for
the revolutions that have taken place in France
and other parts of the continent. Louis Philippe,
the French king, was dethroned on the
24th of February, 1848, and fled with his family,
to England.</p>

<p>34. At Berlin, the capital of Prussia, there
was also an insurrection in March, 1848, when
a frightful battle was fought in the streets, between
the soldiers and the people.</p>

<p>35. Great numbers of persons were killed on
both sides, and many houses were destroyed;
and although peace was restored by the king
granting the demands of his subjects, yet that
could not bring back happiness to those who had
lost their fathers, husbands, or brothers, in the
fatal conflict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>36. Besides those already named, revolutions,
attended with great loss of life and destruction
of property, have taken place at Vienna, the
capital of Austria, and other parts of Germany.
Italy, too, has shared in the spread of revolution;
Naples, Milan, and Venice, having been
scenes of fearful tumult and destruction of life.</p>

<p>37. In most of the places I have mentioned,
the people having been fighting for a constitutional
form of government, similar to that of our
own happy united kingdom; conveying the
strongest proof that we ought not to wish for a
change. Yet there have been some attempts
made to disturb the peace of this country, by
ill-informed or worthless persons.</p>

<p>38. Perhaps the desire for some increase in
the number of the electors, and in the places
represented in parliament, by uniting the adjacent
towns to the small boroughs, is not unreasonable.</p>

<p>39. But when we think of the dreadful state
of things in France, Italy and Germany, where
so many thousands of people have lost their
lives, where trade is ruined, where the middle
classes are reduced to poverty, and the working
people, in consequence, starving, for want of
employment, we cannot be too thankful for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
peace, the liberty, and prosperity, we enjoy in
this more favored and happier country.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
