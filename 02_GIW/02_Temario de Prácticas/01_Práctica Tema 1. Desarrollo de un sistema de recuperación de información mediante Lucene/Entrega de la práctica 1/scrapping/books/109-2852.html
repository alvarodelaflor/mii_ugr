<h3><a name="chap01"></a>Chapter 1.<br/>
Mr. Sherlock Holmes</h3>

    <p>
      Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon
      those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the
      breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which
      our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick
      piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a &ldquo;Penang
      lawyer.&rdquo; Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch
      across. &ldquo;To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.,&rdquo; was
      engraved upon it, with the date &ldquo;1884.&rdquo; It was just such a stick as the
      old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry&mdash;dignified, solid,
      and reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Watson, what do you make of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my
      occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back of
      your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of
      me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor&rsquo;s
      stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion
      of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear
      you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said I, following as far as I could the methods of my
      companion, &ldquo;that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,
      well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their
      appreciation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country
      practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so
      knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.
      The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a
      great amount of walking with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly sound!&rdquo; said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then again, there is the &lsquo;friends of the C.C.H.&rsquo; I should guess that
      to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has possibly
      given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small
      presentation in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Watson, you excel yourself,&rdquo; said Holmes, pushing back his chair
      and lighting a cigarette. &ldquo;I am bound to say that in all the accounts
      which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you
      have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may be that you are not
      yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light. Some people without
      possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my
      dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me
      keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my
      admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his
      methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system
      as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. He now took the stick
      from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then
      with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and carrying
      the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interesting, though elementary,&rdquo; said he as he returned to his favourite
      corner of the settee. &ldquo;There are certainly one or two indications upon the
      stick. It gives us the basis for several deductions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything escaped me?&rdquo; I asked with some self-importance. &ldquo;I trust
      that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were
      erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that
      in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth. Not
      that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a
      country practitioner. And he walks a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To that extent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my dear Watson, not all&mdash;by no means all. I would suggest,
      for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a
      hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials &lsquo;C.C.&rsquo; are placed
      before that hospital the words &lsquo;Charing Cross&rsquo; very naturally suggest
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a working
      hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of
      this unknown visitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, supposing that &lsquo;C.C.H.&rsquo; does stand for &lsquo;Charing Cross
      Hospital,&rsquo; what further inferences may we draw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in
      town before going to the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it in
      this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a
      presentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him a
      pledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer
      withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for
      himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has been
      a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then,
      stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the
      occasion of the change?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly seems probable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the <i>staff</i> of the
      hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could
      hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.
      What was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he
      could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician&mdash;little
      more than a senior student. And he left five years ago&mdash;the date is
      on the stick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into
      thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,
      amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog,
      which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller
      than a mastiff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and
      blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but at
      least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man&rsquo;s
      age and professional career.&rdquo; From my small medical shelf I took down the
      Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several Mortimers,
      but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record aloud.
    </p>
    <p class="letter">
        &ldquo;Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.
        House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital. Winner of
        the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with essay entitled
        &lsquo;Is Disease a Reversion?&rsquo;  Corresponding member of the
        Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of &lsquo;Some Freaks of
        Atavism&rsquo; (<i>Lancet</i> 1882).  &lsquo;Do We Progress?&rsquo;
        (<i>Journal of Psychology</i>, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the
        parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No mention of that local hunt, Watson,&rdquo; said Holmes with a mischievous
      smile, &ldquo;but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think that
      I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I said, if I
      remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my
      experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives
      testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the
      country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his
      visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a
      heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of
      his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog&rsquo;s jaw, as shown in the space
      between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not
      broad enough for a mastiff. It may have been&mdash;yes, by Jove, it <i>is</i> a
      curly-haired spaniel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess
      of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I
      glanced up in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very
      door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don&rsquo;t move, I beg you,
      Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be of
      assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when you
      hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you know
      not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of
      science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected a
      typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a long
      nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, grey eyes, set
      closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed
      glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for
      his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long
      back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head
      and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes fell upon
      the stick in Holmes&rsquo;s hand, and he ran towards it with an exclamation of
      joy. &ldquo;I am so very glad,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was not sure whether I had left it
      here or in the Shipping Office. I would not lose that stick for the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A presentation, I see,&rdquo; said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Charing Cross Hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear, that&rsquo;s bad!&rdquo; said Holmes, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment. &ldquo;Why was it
      bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage, you
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of a
      consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;And now,
      Dr. James Mortimer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mister, sir, Mister&mdash;a humble M.R.C.S.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a man of precise mind, evidently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores of
      the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes whom I
      am addressing and not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in connection
      with that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I had
      hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked
      supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my
      finger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until the
      original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological museum.
      It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your
      skull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. &ldquo;You are an
      enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in mine,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;I observe from your forefinger that you make your own
      cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other
      with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and
      restless as the antennæ of an insect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest
      which he took in our curious companion. &ldquo;I presume, sir,&rdquo; said he at last,
      &ldquo;that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you
      have done me the honour to call here last night and again today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that
      as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am myself
      an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a most
      serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the
      second highest expert in Europe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?&rdquo; asked
      Holmes with some asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon
      must always appeal strongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then had you not better consult him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man of
      affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I have
      not inadvertently&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do wisely
      if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature
      of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>

The Curse of the Baskervilles</h3>

    <p>
      &ldquo;I have in my pocket a manuscript,&rdquo; said Dr. James Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I observed it as you entered the room,&rdquo; said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an old manuscript.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say that, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time
      that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give
      the date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read
      my little monograph upon the subject. I put that at 1730.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The exact date is 1742.&rdquo; Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket.
      &ldquo;This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville,
      whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much
      excitement in Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as well
      as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,
      practical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document
      very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did
      eventually overtake him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon
      his knee. &ldquo;You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the
      long <i>s</i> and the short. It is one of several indications which
      enabled me to fix the date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. At
      the head was written: &ldquo;Baskerville Hall,&rdquo; and below in large, scrawling
      figures: &ldquo;1742.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears to be a statement of some sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the Baskerville
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon
      which you wish to consult me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided
      within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is intimately
      connected with the affair. With your permission I will read it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and
      closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the
      manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following
      curious, old-world narrative:
    </p>
    <p class="letter">
        &ldquo;Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been
        many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville,
        and as I had the story from my father, who also had it from his, I have
        set it down with all belief that it occurred even as is here set forth.
         And I would have you believe, my sons, that the same Justice which
        punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so
        heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed.  Learn then
        from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to be
        circumspect in the future, that those foul passions whereby our family
        has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing.<br/>

            &ldquo;Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the
        history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly commend
        to your attention) this Manor of Baskerville was held by Hugo of that
        name, nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and
        godless man.  This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned,
        seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there was
        in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a by-word
        through the West.  It chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed,
        so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter of
        a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young
        maiden, being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him, for
        she feared his evil name.  So it came to pass that one Michaelmas this
        Hugo, with five or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down
        upon the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and brothers being
        from home, as he well knew.  When they had brought her to the Hall the
        maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat
        down to a long carouse, as was their nightly custom.  Now, the poor
        lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and
        shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below, for they
        say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were
        such as might blast the man who said them.  At last in the stress of
        her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most
        active man, for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and
        still covers) the south wall she came down from under the eaves, and so
        homeward across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall
        and her father&rsquo;s farm.<br/>

            &ldquo;It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his guests
        to carry food and drink&mdash;with other worse things,
        perchance&mdash;to his captive, and so found the cage empty and the
        bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became as one that hath a
        devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the dining-hall, he sprang
        upon the great table, flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he
        cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night render
        his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the
        wench.  And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man,
        one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out
        that they should put the hounds upon her.  Whereat Hugo ran from the
        house, crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and
        unkennel the pack, and giving the hounds a kerchief of the
        maid&rsquo;s, he swung them to the line, and so off full cry in the
        moonlight over the moor.<br/>

            &ldquo;Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to
        understand all that had been done in such haste.  But anon their
        bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be done
        upon the moorlands.  Everything was now in an uproar, some calling for
        their pistols, some for their horses, and some for another flask of
        wine.  But at length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and
        the whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started in
        pursuit.  The moon shone clear above them, and they rode swiftly
        abreast, taking that course which the maid must needs have taken if she
        were to reach her own home.<br/>

            &ldquo;They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the
        night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him to know if he
        had seen the hunt.  And the man, as the story goes, was so crazed with
        fear that he could scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed
        seen the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  &lsquo;But I
        have seen more than that,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;for Hugo Baskerville
        passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a
        hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels.&rsquo;  So the
        drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward.  But soon their
        skins turned cold, for there came a galloping across the moor, and the
        black mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing bridle
        and empty saddle.  Then the revellers rode close together, for a great
        fear was on them, but they still followed over the moor, though each,
        had he been alone, would have been right glad to have turned his
        horse&rsquo;s head.  Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last
        upon the hounds.  These, though known for their valour and their breed,
        were whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal, as we
        call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some, with starting
        hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before
        them.<br/>

            &ldquo;The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may
        guess, than when they started.  The most of them would by no means
        advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may be the most drunken,
        rode forward down the goyal. Now, it opened into a broad space in which
        stood two of those great stones, still to be seen there, which were set
        by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining
        bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid
        where she had fallen, dead of fear and of fatigue.  But it was not the
        sight of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville
        lying near her, which raised the hair upon the heads of these three
        dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo, and
        plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast,
        shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has
        rested upon.  And even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of
        Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping
        jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life,
        still screaming, across the moor.  One, it is said, died that very
        night of what he had seen, and the other twain were but broken men for
        the rest of their days.<br/>

            &ldquo;Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound which
        is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever since.  If I have set
        it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than
        that which is but hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that
        many of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have been
        sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we shelter ourselves in the
        infinite goodness of Providence, which would not forever punish the
        innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in
        Holy Writ.  To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I
        counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in
        those dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted.<br/>

            &ldquo;[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,
        with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister
        Elizabeth.]&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed
      his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock
      Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not find it interesting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a collector of fairy tales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This is
      the <i>Devon County Chronicle</i> of May 14th of this year. It is a short account
      of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville which
      occurred a few days before that date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. Our
      visitor readjusted his glasses and began:
    </p>
    <p class="letter">
        &ldquo;The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name
        has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for Mid-Devon at
        the next election, has cast a gloom over the county.  Though Sir
        Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for a comparatively short
        period his amiability of character and extreme generosity had won the
        affection and respect of all who had been brought into contact with
        him.  In these days of <i>nouveaux riches</i> it is refreshing to find a case
        where the scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days
        is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to
        restore the fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is well
        known, made large sums of money in South African speculation. More wise
        than those who go on until the wheel turns against them, he realised
        his gains and returned to England with them.  It is only two years
        since he took up his residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common
        talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement
        which have been interrupted by his death.  Being himself childless, it
        was his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should,
        within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many will have
        personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.  His generous
        donations to local and county charities have been frequently chronicled
        in these columns.<br/>

            &ldquo;The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles
        cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest, but at
        least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local
        superstition has given rise. There is no reason whatever to suspect
        foul play, or to imagine that death could be from any but natural
        causes. Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to have
        been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In spite of his
        considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes, and his
        indoor servants at Baskerville Hall consisted of a married couple named
        Barrymore, the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.
        Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to show
        that Sir Charles&rsquo;s health has for some time been impaired, and
        points especially to some affection of the heart, manifesting itself in
        changes of colour, breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous
        depression. Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the
        deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.<br/>

            &ldquo;The facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville
        was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the
        famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.  The evidence of the Barrymores
        shows that this had been his custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles
        had declared his intention of starting next day for London, and had
        ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage.  That night he went out as
        usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the
        habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned.  At twelve o&rsquo;clock
        Barrymore, finding the hall door still open, became alarmed, and,
        lighting a lantern, went in search of his master.  The day had been
        wet, and Sir Charles&rsquo;s footmarks were easily traced down the
        alley.  Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to
        the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some
        little time here.  He then proceeded down the alley, and it was at the
        far end of it that his body was discovered. One fact which has not been
        explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master&rsquo;s
        footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the
        moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking
        upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no
        great distance at the time, but he appears by his own confession to
        have been the worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is
        unable to state from what direction they came.  No signs of violence
        were to be discovered upon Sir Charles&rsquo;s person, and though the
        doctor&rsquo;s evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial
        distortion&mdash;so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe
        that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him&mdash;it
        was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of
        dyspnœa and death from cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne
        out by the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing organic
        disease, and the coroner&rsquo;s jury returned a verdict in accordance
        with the medical evidence.  It is well that this is so, for it is
        obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Charles&rsquo;s heir should
        settle at the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly
        interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an
        end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection
        with the affair, it might have been difficult to find a tenant for
        Baskerville Hall.  It is understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry
        Baskerville, if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles
        Baskerville&rsquo;s younger brother.  The young man when last heard of
        was in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to
        informing him of his good fortune.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. &ldquo;Those are
      the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death of Sir Charles
      Baskerville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must thank you,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes, &ldquo;for calling my attention to a
      case which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed
      some newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied by
      that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the
      Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases. This article,
      you say, contains all the public facts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me have the private ones.&rdquo; He leaned back, put his finger-tips
      together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In doing so,&rdquo; said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some
      strong emotion, &ldquo;I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone. My
      motive for withholding it from the coroner&rsquo;s inquiry is that a man of
      science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to
      indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that Baskerville
      Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything
      were done to increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these
      reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I knew,
      since no practical good could result from it, but with you there is no
      reason why I should not be perfectly frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other
      are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a good deal of Sir
      Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall,
      and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of education
      within many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his
      illness brought us together, and a community of interests in science kept
      us so. He had brought back much scientific information from South Africa,
      and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the
      comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir
      Charles&rsquo;s nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He had taken
      this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart&mdash;so much so
      that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce him
      to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr.
      Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his
      family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of his
      ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence
      constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me
      whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange
      creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter question he put to me
      several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three
      weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had
      descended from my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw his
      eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression
      of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just time to catch a
      glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf passing at the
      head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to
      go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it. It
      was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the worst impression
      upon his mind. I stayed with him all the evening, and it was on that
      occasion, to explain the emotion which he had shown, that he confided to
      my keeping that narrative which I read to you when first I came. I mention
      this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the
      tragedy which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter
      was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London. His heart
      was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived, however
      chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a serious effect
      upon his health. I thought that a few months among the distractions of
      town would send him back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was
      much concerned at his state of health, was of the same opinion. At the
      last instant came this terrible catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the night of Sir Charles&rsquo;s death Barrymore the butler, who made the
      discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was sitting
      up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the event.
      I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the
      inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at
      the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the
      shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no other
      footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and finally I
      carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my arrival.
      Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug into the
      ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an
      extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. There was certainly
      no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was made by
      Barrymore at the inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the
      ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did&mdash;some little
      distance off, but fresh and clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Footprints?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Footprints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s or a woman&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank
      almost to a whisper as he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!&rdquo;

The Problem</h3>

    <p>
      I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a thrill
      in the doctor&rsquo;s voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by
      that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his
      eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As clearly as I see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you said nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the use?&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;How was it that no one else saw it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a
      thought. I don&rsquo;t suppose I should have done so had I not known this
      legend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say it was large?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enormous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it had not approached the body?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of night was it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damp and raw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not actually raining?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the alley like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and impenetrable.
      The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any other opening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the
      house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had Sir Charles reached this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he lay about fifty yards from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer&mdash;and this is important&mdash;the marks
      which you saw were on the path and not on the grass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No marks could show on the grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the
      moor-gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate closed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Closed and padlocked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How high was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About four feet high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then anyone could have got over it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None in particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven! Did no one examine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I examined, myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And found nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there for five
      or ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But the
      marks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I could
      discern no others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient
      gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had only been there!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It is evidently a case of
      extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities to
      the scientific expert. That gravel page upon which I might have read so
      much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs
      of curious peasants. Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you
      should not have called me in! You have indeed much to answer for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these facts to
      the world, and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so.
      Besides, besides&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you hesitate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of
      detectives is helpless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that the thing is supernatural?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not positively say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you evidently think it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears several
      incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a
      creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon, and
      which could not possibly be any animal known to science. They all agreed
      that it was a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I have
      cross-examined these men, one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a
      farrier, and one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this
      dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the
      legend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district, and
      that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know what to believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I have hitherto confined my investigations
      to this world,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;In a modest way I have combated evil, but to
      take on the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a
      task. Yet you must admit that the footmark is material.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The original hound was material enough to tug a man&rsquo;s throat out, and yet
      he was diabolical as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But now, Dr.
      Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have you come to
      consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it is useless to
      investigate Sir Charles&rsquo;s death, and that you desire me to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say that I desired you to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, how can I assist you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who
      arrives at Waterloo Station&rdquo;&mdash;Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch&mdash;&ldquo;in
      exactly one hour and a quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He being the heir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman and
      found that he had been farming in Canada. From the accounts which have
      reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way. I speak now not as a
      medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no other claimant, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was Rodger
      Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir Charles was
      the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the father of this lad
      Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family. He came of
      the old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image, they tell me,
      of the family picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold him,
      fled to Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is
      the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes I meet him at
      Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this
      morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise me to do with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every Baskerville
      who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that if Sir Charles
      could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against
      bringing this, the last of the old race, and the heir to great wealth, to
      that deadly place. And yet it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the
      whole poor, bleak countryside depends upon his presence. All the good work
      which has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no
      tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own
      obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before
      you and ask for your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes considered for a little time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put into plain words, the matter is this,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;In your opinion
      there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for a
      Baskerville&mdash;that is your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that
      this may be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could
      work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A devil with
      merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would probably
      do if you were brought into personal contact with these things. Your
      advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man will be as safe in
      Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty minutes. What would you
      recommend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is
      scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry
      Baskerville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my mind
      about the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long will it take you to make up your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-four hours. At ten o&rsquo;clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be much
      obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be of help to me
      in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry Baskerville with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do so, Mr. Holmes.&rdquo; He scribbled the appointment on his shirt-cuff
      and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded fashion. Holmes
      stopped him at the head of the stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir Charles
      Baskerville&rsquo;s death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three people did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did any see it after?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not heard of any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction
      which meant that he had a congenial task before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going out, Watson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless I can help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for
      aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view. When
      you pass Bradley&rsquo;s, would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest
      shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you could make it
      convenient not to return before evening. Then I should be very glad to
      compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been
      submitted to us this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in
      those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every
      particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced one
      against the other, and made up his mind as to which points were essential
      and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day at my club and did not
      return to Baker Street until evening. It was nearly nine o&rsquo;clock when I
      found myself in the sitting-room once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out,
      for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the
      table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears were set at rest,
      for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me by the
      throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision of
      Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay
      pipe between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caught cold, Watson?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s this poisonous atmosphere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it <i>is</i> pretty thick, now that you mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thick! It is intolerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I perceive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Holmes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, but how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed at my bewildered expression. &ldquo;There is a delightful freshness
      about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers
      which I possess at your expense. A gentleman goes forth on a showery and
      miry day. He returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his
      hat and his boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a
      man with intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not
      obvious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is rather obvious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever
      observes. Where do you think that I have been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fixture also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spirit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret to
      observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an incredible
      amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to Stamford&rsquo;s for the
      Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my spirit has hovered over
      it all day. I flatter myself that I could find my way about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A large-scale map, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very large.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He unrolled one section and held it over his knee. &ldquo;Here you have the
      particular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville Hall in the
      middle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a wood round it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that name, must
      stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon the right of
      it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of Grimpen, where our
      friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a radius of five miles
      there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings. Here is Lafter
      Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative. There is a house indicated
      here which may be the residence of the naturalist&mdash;Stapleton, if I
      remember right, was his name. Here are two moorland farmhouses, High Tor
      and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of
      Princetown. Between and around these scattered points extends the
      desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage upon which tragedy has
      been played, and upon which we may help to play it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a wild place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a hand
      in the affairs of men&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil&rsquo;s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There are two
      questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether any crime has
      been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime and how was it
      committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer&rsquo;s surmise should be correct, and we
      are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature, there is an
      end of our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses
      before falling back upon this one. I think we&rsquo;ll shut that window again,
      if you don&rsquo;t mind. It is a singular thing, but I find that a concentrated
      atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. I have not pushed it to the
      length of getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of
      my convictions. Have you turned the case over in your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very bewildering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of distinction
      about it. That change in the footprints, for example. What do you make of
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the
      alley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should a man
      walk on tiptoe down the alley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was running, Watson&mdash;running desperately, running for his life,
      running until he burst his heart&mdash;and fell dead upon his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Running from what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was crazed
      with fear before ever he began to run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor.
      If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had lost his
      wits would have run <i>from</i> the house instead of towards it. If the gipsy&rsquo;s
      evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help in the direction
      where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom was he waiting for
      that night, and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in
      his own house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that he was waiting for someone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an evening
      stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is it natural
      that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr. Mortimer, with more
      practical sense than I should have given him credit for, deduced from the
      cigar ash?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he went out every evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening. On the
      contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night he waited
      there. It was the night before he made his departure for London. The thing
      takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I ask you to hand me my
      violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until
      we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry
      Baskerville in the morning.&rdquo;

Sir Henry Baskerville</h3>

    <p>
      Our breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his
      dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual to
      their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr. Mortimer was
      shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was a small, alert,
      dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built, with thick
      black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed
      suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of
      his time in the open air, and yet there was something in his steady eye
      and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Sir Henry Baskerville,&rdquo; said Dr. Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, that
      if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning I
      should have come on my own account. I understand that you think out little
      puzzles, and I&rsquo;ve had one this morning which wants more thinking out than
      I am able to give it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you have
      yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not. It
      was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was of
      common quality, greyish in colour. The address, &ldquo;Sir Henry Baskerville,
      Northumberland Hotel,&rdquo; was printed in rough characters; the post-mark
      &ldquo;Charing Cross,&rdquo; and the date of posting the preceding evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?&rdquo; asked Holmes,
      glancing keenly across at our visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I had been staying with a friend,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements.&rdquo; Out
      of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four.
      This he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the middle of it a
      single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed words
      upon it. It ran:
    </p>
    <p class="letter">
        As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word &ldquo;moor&rdquo; only was printed in ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Sir Henry Baskerville, &ldquo;perhaps you will tell me, Mr. Holmes,
      what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes so much
      interest in my affairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is
      nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced that
      the business is supernatural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business?&rdquo; asked Sir Henry sharply. &ldquo;It seems to me that all you
      gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry. I
      promise you that,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes. &ldquo;We will confine ourselves for
      the present with your permission to this very interesting document, which
      must have been put together and posted yesterday evening. Have you
      yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Times</i>, Watson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is here in the corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I trouble you for it&mdash;the inside page, please, with the
      leading articles?&rdquo; He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and
      down the columns. &ldquo;Capital article this on free trade. Permit me to give
      you an extract from it.
    </p>
    <p class="letter">
     &lsquo;You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special
     trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a
     protective tariff, but it stands to reason that such
     legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the
     country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower the
     general conditions of life in this island.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that, Watson?&rdquo; cried Holmes in high glee, rubbing
      his hands together with satisfaction. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that is an
      admirable sentiment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest, and
      Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;but it seems to me we&rsquo;ve got a bit off the trail so far as that note is
      concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir
      Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I fear
      that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I confess that I see no connection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that the one
      is extracted out of the other. &lsquo;You,&rsquo; &lsquo;your,&rsquo; &lsquo;your,&rsquo; &lsquo;life,&rsquo; &lsquo;reason,&rsquo;
      &lsquo;value,&rsquo; &lsquo;keep away,&rsquo; &lsquo;from the.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t you see now whence these words
      have been taken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By thunder, you&rsquo;re right! Well, if that isn&rsquo;t smart!&rdquo; cried Sir Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that &lsquo;keep away&rsquo;
      and &lsquo;from the&rsquo; are cut out in one piece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now&mdash;so it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have imagined,&rdquo;
       said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. &ldquo;I could understand
      anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper; but that you should
      name which, and add that it came from the leading article, is really one
      of the most remarkable things which I have ever known. How did you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of
      an Esquimau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious. The
      supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally obvious.
      There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type
      of a <i>Times</i> article and the slovenly print of an evening half-penny paper
      as there could be between your negro and your Esquimau. The detection of
      types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special
      expert in crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I
      confused the <i>Leeds Mercury</i> with the <i>Western Morning News</i>. But a <i>Times</i>
      leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have been taken from
      nothing else. As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we
      should find the words in yesterday&rsquo;s issue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said Sir Henry
      Baskerville, &ldquo;someone cut out this message with a scissors&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nail-scissors,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;You can see that it was a very short-bladed
      scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over &lsquo;keep away.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of
      short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gum,&rdquo; said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word &lsquo;moor&rsquo; should
      have been written?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all simple
      and might be found in any issue, but &lsquo;moor&rsquo; would be less common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else in
      this message, Mr. Holmes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been
      taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in rough
      characters. But the <i>Times</i> is a paper which is seldom found in any hands
      but those of the highly educated. We may take it, therefore, that the
      letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated
      one, and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing
      might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you will observe that
      the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but that some are much
      higher than others. &lsquo;Life,&rsquo; for example is quite out of its proper place.
      That may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon
      the part of the cutter. On the whole I incline to the latter view, since
      the matter was evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer
      of such a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up the
      interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any letter posted
      up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he would leave his hotel.
      Did the composer fear an interruption&mdash;and from whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,&rdquo; said Dr.
      Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and choose
      the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination, but we have
      always some material basis on which to start our speculation. Now, you
      would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am almost certain that this address
      has been written in a hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in the world can you say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink
      have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a single
      word and has run dry three times in a short address, showing that there
      was very little ink in the bottle. Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is
      seldom allowed to be in such a state, and the combination of the two must
      be quite rare. But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is
      rare to get anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying
      that could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around Charing
      Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated <i>Times</i> leader we could
      lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this singular message.
      Halloa! Halloa! What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were pasted,
      holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said he, throwing it down. &ldquo;It is a blank half-sheet of paper,
      without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have drawn as much as we can
      from this curious letter; and now, Sir Henry, has anything else of
      interest happened to you since you have been in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,&rdquo; said our
      visitor. &ldquo;Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us before we go
      into this matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth
      reporting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Henry smiled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much of British life yet, for I have spent
      nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I hope that to lose
      one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lost one of your boots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; cried Dr. Mortimer, &ldquo;it is only mislaid. You will find it
      when you return to the hotel. What is the use of troubling Mr. Holmes with
      trifles of this kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;however foolish the incident may seem. You have
      lost one of your boots, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last night, and
      there was only one in the morning. I could get no sense out of the chap
      who cleans them. The worst of it is that I only bought the pair last night
      in the Strand, and I have never had them on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be cleaned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I put them
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you went out
      at once and bought a pair of boots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with me. You
      see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, and it may be
      that I have got a little careless in my ways out West. Among other things
      I bought these brown boots&mdash;gave six dollars for them&mdash;and had
      one stolen before ever I had them on my feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes. &ldquo;I
      confess that I share Dr. Mortimer&rsquo;s belief that it will not be long before
      the missing boot is found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the baronet with decision, &ldquo;it seems to me
      that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know. It is time
      that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all
      driving at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your request is a very reasonable one,&rdquo; Holmes answered. &ldquo;Dr. Mortimer, I
      think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it to
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket and
      presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before. Sir Henry
      Baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an occasional
      exclamation of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,&rdquo; said he
      when the long narrative was finished. &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ve heard of the hound
      ever since I was in the nursery. It&rsquo;s the pet story of the family, though
      I never thought of taking it seriously before. But as to my uncle&rsquo;s death&mdash;well,
      it all seems boiling up in my head, and I can&rsquo;t get it clear yet. You
      don&rsquo;t seem quite to have made up your mind whether it&rsquo;s a case for a
      policeman or a clergyman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now there&rsquo;s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I suppose
      that fits into its place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on
      upon the moor,&rdquo; said Dr. Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And also,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;that someone is not ill-disposed towards you,
      since they warn you of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted to you,
      Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which presents several
      interesting alternatives. But the practical point which we now have to
      decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to
      Baskerville Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I not go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seems to be danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from
      human beings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is what we have to find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell, Mr.
      Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to
      the home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer.&rdquo;
       His dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke. It
      was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was not extinct in
      this their last representative. &ldquo;Meanwhile,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have hardly had
      time to think over all that you have told me. It&rsquo;s a big thing for a man
      to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like to have
      a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look here, Mr. Holmes,
      it&rsquo;s half-past eleven now and I am going back right away to my hotel.
      Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson, come round and lunch with us at
      two. I&rsquo;ll be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strikes
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that convenient to you, Watson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join you in a walk, with pleasure,&rdquo; said his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we meet again at two o&rsquo;clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the
      front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to
      the man of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!&rdquo; He rushed into
      his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a few seconds in a
      frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs and into the street. Dr.
      Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible about two hundred yards ahead
      of us in the direction of Oxford Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I run on and stop them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with your
      company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for it is
      certainly a very fine morning for a walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us
      by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards behind, we followed
      into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street. Once our friends stopped and
      stared into a shop window, upon which Holmes did the same. An instant
      afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction, and, following the
      direction of his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside
      which had halted on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly
      onward again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s our man, Watson! Come along! We&rsquo;ll have a good look at him, if we
      can do no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing
      eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab. Instantly the
      trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed to the driver, and the
      cab flew madly off down Regent Street. Holmes looked eagerly round for
      another, but no empty one was in sight. Then he dashed in wild pursuit
      amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too great, and already
      the cab was out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now!&rdquo; said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with
      vexation from the tide of vehicles. &ldquo;Was ever such bad luck and such bad
      management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an honest man you will record
      this also and set it against my successes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not an idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A spy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville has been
      very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town. How else could
      it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which he had
      chosen? If they had followed him the first day I argued that they would
      follow him also the second. You may have observed that I twice strolled
      over to the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none. We are
      dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very deep, and though
      I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or a
      malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I am conscious always of
      power and design. When our friends left I at once followed them in the
      hopes of marking down their invisible attendant. So wily was he that he
      had not trusted himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so
      that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice.
      His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take a cab he
      was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one obvious disadvantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It puts him in the power of the cabman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity we did not get the number!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not seriously
      imagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is our man. But that
      is no use to us for the moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fail to see how you could have done more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked in the
      other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a second cab and
      followed the first at a respectful distance, or, better still, have driven
      to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there. When our unknown had
      followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of playing
      his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for. As it is, by an
      indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage of with extraordinary
      quickness and energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost
      our man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this conversation,
      and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished in front of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no object in our following them,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;The shadow has
      departed and will not return. We must see what further cards we have in
      our hands and play them with decision. Could you swear to that man&rsquo;s face
      within the cab?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could swear only to the beard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so could I&mdash;from which I gather that in all probability it was a
      false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard
      save to conceal his features. Come in here, Watson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he was warmly
      greeted by the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I had
      the good fortune to help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection, Wilson, that
      you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some ability
      during the investigation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, he is still with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you ring him up?&mdash;thank you! And I should be glad to have
      change of this five-pound note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons of the
      manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have the Hotel Directory,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Thank you! Now,
      Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in the
      immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will visit each of these in turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling.
      Here are twenty-three shillings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of yesterday. You
      will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are
      looking for it. You understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the <i>Times</i> with
      some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy of the <i>Times</i>. It is
      this page. You could easily recognize it, could you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter, to whom
      also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings. You will
      then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the waste
      of the day before has been burned or removed. In the three other cases you
      will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page of the <i>Times</i>
      among it. The odds are enormously against your finding it. There are ten
      shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a report by wire at
      Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only remains for us to
      find out by wire the identity of the cabman, No. 2704, and then we will
      drop into one of the Bond Street picture galleries and fill in the time
      until we are due at the hotel.&rdquo;

Three Broken Threads</h3>

    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching
      his mind at will. For two hours the strange business in which we had been
      involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed in the
      pictures of the modern Belgian masters. He would talk of nothing but art,
      of which he had the crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we
      found ourselves at the Northumberland Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;He
      asked me to show you up at once when you came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any objection to my looking at your register?&rdquo; said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The book showed that two names had been added after that of Baskerville.
      One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle; the other Mrs.
      Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,&rdquo; said Holmes to
      the porter. &ldquo;A lawyer, is he not, grey-headed, and walks with a limp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active gentleman,
      not older than yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you are mistaken about his trade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very well known
      to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the name.
      Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend one finds
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester.
      She always comes to us when she is in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have
      established a most important fact by these questions, Watson,&rdquo; he
      continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. &ldquo;We know now that
      the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down in
      his own hotel. That means that while they are, as we have seen, very
      anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not see
      them. Now, this is a most suggestive fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It suggests&mdash;halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry
      Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and he held an old
      and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was he that he was hardly
      articulate, and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more
      Western dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,&rdquo; he cried.
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll find they&rsquo;ve started in to monkey with the wrong man unless they
      are careful. By thunder, if that chap can&rsquo;t find my missing boot there
      will be trouble. I can take a joke with the best, Mr. Holmes, but they&rsquo;ve
      got a bit over the mark this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still looking for your boot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, and mean to find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was, sir. And now it&rsquo;s an old black one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you don&rsquo;t mean to say&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the world&mdash;the
      new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers, which I am wearing.
      Last night they took one of my brown ones, and today they have sneaked one
      of the black. Well, have you got it? Speak out, man, and don&rsquo;t stand
      staring!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no word
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I&rsquo;ll see the manager
      and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be found, sir&mdash;I promise you that if you will have a little
      patience it will be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind it is, for it&rsquo;s the last thing of mine that I&rsquo;ll lose in this den of
      thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you&rsquo;ll excuse my troubling you about such
      a trifle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s well worth troubling about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you look very serious over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you explain it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest, queerest
      thing that ever happened to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queerest perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; said Holmes thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make of it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t profess to understand it yet. This case of yours is very
      complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your uncle&rsquo;s death I am
      not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance which I
      have handled there is one which cuts so deep. But we hold several threads
      in our hands, and the odds are that one or other of them guides us to the
      truth. We may waste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later
      we must come upon the right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business which
      had brought us together. It was in the private sitting-room to which we
      afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his
      intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go to Baskerville Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the end of the week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the whole,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;I think that your decision is a wise one. I
      have ample evidence that you are being dogged in London, and amid the
      millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people
      are or what their object can be. If their intentions are evil they might
      do you a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent it. You did not
      know, Dr. Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mortimer started violently. &ldquo;Followed! By whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among your
      neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a black, full beard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;or, let me see&mdash;why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles&rsquo;s butler,
      is a man with a full, black beard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Where is Barrymore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in charge of the Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any possibility he
      might be in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a telegraph form. &lsquo;Is all ready for Sir Henry?&rsquo; That will do.
      Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the nearest
      telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a second wire to the
      postmaster, Grimpen: &lsquo;Telegram to Mr. Barrymore to be delivered into his
      own hand. If absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville,
      Northumberland Hotel.&rsquo; That should let us know before evening whether
      Barrymore is at his post in Devonshire or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Baskerville. &ldquo;By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is this
      Barrymore, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have looked after
      the Hall for four generations now. So far as I know, he and his wife are
      as respectable a couple as any in the county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the same time,&rdquo; said Baskerville, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s clear enough that so long as
      there are none of the family at the Hall these people have a mighty fine
      home and nothing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles&rsquo;s will?&rdquo; asked Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Dr. Mortimer, &ldquo;that you do not look with suspicious eyes
      upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir Charles, for I also had a
      thousand pounds left to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! And anyone else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large number of
      public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how much was the residue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. &ldquo;I had no idea that so gigantic a
      sum was involved,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not know how
      very rich he was until we came to examine his securities. The total value
      of the estate was close on to a million.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! It is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game.
      And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing that anything happened to
      our young friend here&mdash;you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis!&mdash;who
      would inherit the estate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles&rsquo;s younger brother died unmarried,
      the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are distant cousins. James
      Desmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met Mr.
      James Desmond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of venerable
      appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he refused to accept any
      settlement from Sir Charles, though he pressed it upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles&rsquo;s
      thousands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He would
      also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the
      present owner, who can, of course, do what he likes with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you made your will, Sir Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I&rsquo;ve had no time, for it was only yesterday
      that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I feel that the money
      should go with the title and estate. That was my poor uncle&rsquo;s idea. How is
      the owner going to restore the glories of the Baskervilles if he has not
      money enough to keep up the property? House, land, and dollars must go
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the
      advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay. There is only
      one provision which I must make. You certainly must not go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Mortimer returns with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is miles
      away from yours. With all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to
      help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with you someone, a trusty man, who
      will be always by your side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in person;
      but you can understand that, with my extensive consulting practice and
      with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters, it is
      impossible for me to be absent from London for an indefinite time. At the
      present instant one of the most revered names in England is being
      besmirched by a blackmailer, and only I can stop a disastrous scandal. You
      will see how impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom would you recommend, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes laid his hand upon my arm. &ldquo;If my friend would undertake it there
      is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight
      place. No one can say so more confidently than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had time to
      answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You see how
      it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter as I do. If you
      will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I&rsquo;ll never forget
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I was
      complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with which the
      baronet hailed me as a companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come, with pleasure,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I do not know how I could employ my
      time better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will report very carefully to me,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;When a crisis
      comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I suppose that by
      Saturday all might be ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that suit Dr. Watson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at the
      ten-thirty train from Paddington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry of triumph, and diving
      into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from under a
      cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My missing boot!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May all our difficulties vanish as easily!&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is a very singular thing,&rdquo; Dr. Mortimer remarked. &ldquo;I searched this
      room carefully before lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so did I,&rdquo; said Baskerville. &ldquo;Every inch of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was certainly no boot in it then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were
      lunching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter, nor
      could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been added to that
      constant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had
      succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting aside the whole grim story of Sir
      Charles&rsquo;s death, we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within the
      limits of two days, which included the receipt of the printed letter, the
      black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown boot, the loss
      of the old black boot, and now the return of the new brown boot. Holmes
      sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to Baker Street, and I knew
      from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind, like my own, was busy in
      endeavouring to frame some scheme into which all these strange and
      apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted. All afternoon and late
      into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second:
    </p>
    <p>
      Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry to report unable to
      trace cut sheet of <i>Times</i>. CARTWRIGHT.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more stimulating
      than a case where everything goes against you. We must cast round for
      another scent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have still the cabman who drove the spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the Official
      Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my
      question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ring at the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory than an
      answer, however, for the door opened and a rough-looking fellow entered
      who was evidently the man himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had been
      inquiring for No. 2704,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve driven my cab this seven years and
      never a word of complaint. I came here straight from the Yard to ask you
      to your face what you had against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing in the world against you, my good man,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;On
      the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear
      answer to my questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve had a good day and no mistake,&rdquo; said the cabman with a grin.
      &ldquo;What was it you wanted to ask, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all your name and address, in case I want you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of Shipley&rsquo;s
      Yard, near Waterloo Station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched this house
      at ten o&rsquo;clock this morning and afterwards followed the two gentlemen down
      Regent Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s no good
      my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I do already,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;The truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a detective and
      that I was to say nothing about him to anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may find
      yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me. You
      say that your fare told you that he was a detective?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did he say this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he left me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say anything more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He mentioned his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. &ldquo;Oh, he mentioned his name,
      did he? That was imprudent. What was the name that he mentioned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name,&rdquo; said the cabman, &ldquo;was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the
      cabman&rsquo;s reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement. Then he burst
      into a hearty laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A touch, Watson&mdash;an undeniable touch!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I feel a foil as
      quick and supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily that time.
      So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, that was the gentleman&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said that he was a
      detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what he
      wanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad enough to agree. First we
      drove down to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two
      gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank. We followed their cab
      until it pulled up somewhere near here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very door,&rdquo; said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew all about
      it. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half.
      Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and we followed down Baker
      Street and along&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my gentleman threw
      up the trap, and he cried that I should drive right away to Waterloo
      Station as hard as I could go. I whipped up the mare and we were there
      under the ten minutes. Then he paid up his two guineas, like a good one,
      and away he went into the station. Only just as he was leaving he turned
      round and he said: &lsquo;It might interest you to know that you have been
      driving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s how I come to know the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. And you saw no more of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not after he went into the station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cabman scratched his head. &ldquo;Well, he wasn&rsquo;t altogether such an easy
      gentleman to describe. I&rsquo;d put him at forty years of age, and he was of a
      middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir. He was dressed
      like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square at the end, and a pale
      face. I don&rsquo;t know as I could say more than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colour of his eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more that you can remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There&rsquo;s another one waiting for
      you if you can bring any more information. Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, sir, and thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a shrug of
      his shoulders and a rueful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The
      cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had
      consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street, conjectured that I had
      got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver, and so
      sent back this audacious message. I tell you, Watson, this time we have
      got a foeman who is worthy of our steel. I&rsquo;ve been checkmated in London. I
      can only wish you better luck in Devonshire. But I&rsquo;m not easy in my mind
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About sending you. It&rsquo;s an ugly business, Watson, an ugly dangerous
      business, and the more I see of it the less I like it. Yes, my dear
      fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad to
      have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more.&rdquo;
     </p>

Baskerville Hall</h3>

    <p>
      Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the appointed day,
      and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes drove with
      me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions and advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions, Watson,&rdquo;
       said he; &ldquo;I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest possible manner
      to me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of facts?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the case,
      and especially the relations between young Baskerville and his neighbours
      or any fresh particulars concerning the death of Sir Charles. I have made
      some inquiries myself in the last few days, but the results have, I fear,
      been negative. One thing only appears to be certain, and that is that Mr.
      James Desmond, who is the next heir, is an elderly gentleman of a very
      amiable disposition, so that this persecution does not arise from him. I
      really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our calculations.
      There remain the people who will actually surround Sir Henry Baskerville
      upon the moor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this Barrymore
      couple?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they are innocent
      it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be giving
      up all chance of bringing it home to them. No, no, we will preserve them
      upon our list of suspects. Then there is a groom at the Hall, if I
      remember right. There are two moorland farmers. There is our friend Dr.
      Mortimer, whom I believe to be entirely honest, and there is his wife, of
      whom we know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton, and there is
      his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions. There is Mr.
      Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor, and there are
      one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who must be your very
      special study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have arms, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I thought it as well to take them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, and never
      relax your precautions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were waiting
      for us upon the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we have no news of any kind,&rdquo; said Dr. Mortimer in answer to my
      friend&rsquo;s questions. &ldquo;I can swear to one thing, and that is that we have
      not been shadowed during the last two days. We have never gone out without
      keeping a sharp watch, and no one could have escaped our notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have always kept together, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day to pure amusement
      when I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of the College of
      Surgeons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I went to look at the folk in the park,&rdquo; said Baskerville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we had no trouble of any kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was imprudent, all the same,&rdquo; said Holmes, shaking his head and
      looking very grave. &ldquo;I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go about alone.
      Some great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did you get your other
      boot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, it is gone forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye,&rdquo; he added as the train
      began to glide down the platform. &ldquo;Bear in mind, Sir Henry, one of the
      phrases in that queer old legend which Dr. Mortimer has read to us, and
      avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil are
      exalted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the
      tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in making the
      more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing with Dr.
      Mortimer&rsquo;s spaniel. In a very few hours the brown earth had become ruddy,
      the brick had changed to granite, and red cows grazed in well-hedged
      fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a
      richer, if a damper, climate. Young Baskerville stared eagerly out of the
      window and cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features
      of the Devon scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr. Watson,&rdquo;
       said he; &ldquo;but I have never seen a place to compare with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county,&rdquo; I
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county,&rdquo; said
      Dr. Mortimer. &ldquo;A glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of the
      Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic enthusiasm and power of
      attachment. Poor Sir Charles&rsquo;s head was of a very rare type, half Gaelic,
      half Ivernian in its characteristics. But you were very young when you
      last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father&rsquo;s death and had never
      seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the South Coast. Thence
      I went straight to a friend in America. I tell you it is all as new to me
      as it is to Dr. Watson, and I&rsquo;m as keen as possible to see the moor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first sight
      of the moor,&rdquo; said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the carriage window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there
      rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged
      summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in a
      dream. Baskerville sat for a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and I read
      upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of that
      strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long and left
      their mark so deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his American
      accent, in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as I looked
      at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a
      descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and masterful
      men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his thick brows, his
      sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If on that forbidding moor a
      difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us, this was at least a
      comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk with the certainty that
      he would bravely share it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all descended.
      Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs was
      waiting. Our coming was evidently a great event, for station-master and
      porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage. It was a sweet,
      simple country spot, but I was surprised to observe that by the gate there
      stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short
      rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a hard-faced,
      gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in a few minutes
      we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road. Rolling pasture lands
      curved upward on either side of us, and old gabled houses peeped out from
      amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful and sunlit
      countryside there rose ever, dark against the evening sky, the long,
      gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through
      deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on either side, heavy
      with dripping moss and fleshy hart&rsquo;s-tongue ferns. Bronzing bracken and
      mottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun. Still steadily
      rising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream
      which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the grey boulders.
      Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak and
      fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of delight, looking
      eagerly about him and asking countless questions. To his eyes all seemed
      beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the countryside, which
      bore so clearly the mark of the waning year. Yellow leaves carpeted the
      lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed. The rattle of our wheels
      died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation&mdash;sad
      gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before the carriage of the
      returning heir of the Baskervilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; cried Dr. Mortimer, &ldquo;what is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor, lay in
      front of us. On the summit, hard and clear like an equestrian statue upon
      its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern, his rifle poised
      ready over his forearm. He was watching the road along which we travelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this, Perkins?&rdquo; asked Dr. Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our driver half turned in his seat. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a convict escaped from
      Princetown, sir. He&rsquo;s been out three days now, and the warders watch every
      road and every station, but they&rsquo;ve had no sight of him yet. The farmers
      about here don&rsquo;t like it, sir, and that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give
      information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared to
      the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it isn&rsquo;t like any ordinary
      convict. This is a man that would stick at nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had taken an
      interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wanton
      brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin. The
      commutation of his death sentence had been due to some doubts as to his
      complete sanity, so atrocious was his conduct. Our wagonette had topped a
      rise and in front of us rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled with
      gnarled and craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down from it and set
      us shivering. Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking this
      fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his heart full of
      malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out. It needed but
      this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren waste, the chilling
      wind, and the darkling sky. Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his
      overcoat more closely around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We looked back on
      it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads of
      gold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad
      tangle of the woodlands. The road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder
      over huge russet and olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. Now and
      then we passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone, with no
      creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into a cuplike
      depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been twisted and
      bent by the fury of years of storm. Two high, narrow towers rose over the
      trees. The driver pointed with his whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baskerville Hall,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining eyes.
      A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates, a maze of fantastic
      tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bitten pillars on either side,
      blotched with lichens, and surmounted by the boars&rsquo; heads of the
      Baskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of
      rafters, but facing it was a new building, half constructed, the first
      fruit of Sir Charles&rsquo;s South African gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels were again
      hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches in a sombre
      tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered as he looked up the long,
      dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the farther end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it here?&rdquo; he asked in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, the yew alley is on the other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such a
      place as this,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to scare any man. I&rsquo;ll have a row of
      electric lamps up here inside of six months, and you won&rsquo;t know it again,
      with a thousand candle-power Swan and Edison right here in front of the
      hall door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay before
      us. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a heavy block of
      building from which a porch projected. The whole front was draped in ivy,
      with a patch clipped bare here and there where a window or a coat of arms
      broke through the dark veil. From this central block rose the twin towers,
      ancient, crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To right and left of
      the turrets were more modern wings of black granite. A dull light shone
      through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high chimneys which rose
      from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a single black column of
      smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of
      the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow
      light of the hall. She came out and helped the man to hand down our bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?&rdquo; said Dr. Mortimer.
      &ldquo;My wife is expecting me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you will stay and have some dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I would stay
      to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a better guide than I.
      Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to send for me if I can be of
      service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned into the
      hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a fine apartment in
      which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and heavily raftered with huge
      baulks of age-blackened oak. In the great old-fashioned fireplace behind
      the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled and snapped. Sir Henry and I held
      out our hands to it, for we were numb from our long drive. Then we gazed
      round us at the high, thin window of old stained glass, the oak panelling,
      the stags&rsquo; heads, the coats of arms upon the walls, all dim and sombre in
      the subdued light of the central lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I imagined it,&rdquo; said Sir Henry. &ldquo;Is it not the very picture
      of an old family home? To think that this should be the same hall in which
      for five hundred years my people have lived. It strikes me solemn to think
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about him.
      The light beat upon him where he stood, but long shadows trailed down the
      walls and hung like a black canopy above him. Barrymore had returned from
      taking our luggage to our rooms. He stood in front of us now with the
      subdued manner of a well-trained servant. He was a remarkable-looking man,
      tall, handsome, with a square black beard and pale, distinguished
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your rooms. My
      wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you until you have made
      your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new
      conditions this house will require a considerable staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What new conditions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and we were
      able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish to have more
      company, and so you will need changes in your household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your family have been with us for several generations, have they not?
      I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family
      connection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler&rsquo;s white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to tell the truth, sir,
      we were both very much attached to Sir Charles, and his death gave us a
      shock and made these surroundings very painful to us. I fear that we shall
      never again be easy in our minds at Baskerville Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you intend to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves in
      some business. Sir Charles&rsquo;s generosity has given us the means to do so.
      And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to your rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall, approached
      by a double stair. From this central point two long corridors extended the
      whole length of the building, from which all the bedrooms opened. My own
      was in the same wing as Baskerville&rsquo;s and almost next door to it. These
      rooms appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the house,
      and the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the
      sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of shadow and
      gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where the
      family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependents. At one
      end a minstrel&rsquo;s gallery overlooked it. Black beams shot across above our
      heads, with a smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them. With rows of flaring
      torches to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time
      banquet, it might have softened; but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen
      sat in the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one&rsquo;s voice
      became hushed and one&rsquo;s spirit subdued. A dim line of ancestors, in every
      variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to the buck of the Regency,
      stared down upon us and daunted us by their silent company. We talked
      little, and I for one was glad when the meal was over and we were able to
      retire into the modern billiard-room and smoke a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, it isn&rsquo;t a very cheerful place,&rdquo; said Sir Henry. &ldquo;I suppose one
      can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the picture at present. I
      don&rsquo;t wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone in
      such a house as this. However, if it suits you, we will retire early
      tonight, and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out from my
      window. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall
      door. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind. A
      half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds. In its cold light I
      saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks, and the long, low curve of
      the melancholy moor. I closed the curtain, feeling that my last impression
      was in keeping with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet wakeful,
      tossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the sleep which would
      not come. Far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the hours,
      but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house. And then suddenly,
      in the very dead of the night, there came a sound to my ears, clear,
      resonant, and unmistakable. It was the sob of a woman, the muffled,
      strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow. I sat up
      in bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been far away and
      was certainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with every nerve on
      the alert, but there came no other sound save the chiming clock and the
      rustle of the ivy on the wall.

The Stapletons of Merripit House</h3>

    <p>
      The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our
      minds the grim and grey impression which had been left upon both of us by
      our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As Sir Henry and I sat at
      breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows,
      throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered
      them. The dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was
      hard to realise that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a
      gloom into our souls upon the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame!&rdquo; said
      the baronet. &ldquo;We were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive, so
      we took a grey view of the place. Now we are fresh and well, so it is all
      cheerful once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Did
      you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing in the
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard
      something of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was no more of it,
      so I concluded that it was all a dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob of a
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must ask about this right away.&rdquo; He rang the bell and asked Barrymore
      whether he could account for our experience. It seemed to me that the
      pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he listened to
      his master&rsquo;s question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;One is
      the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The other is my wife, and
      I can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after breakfast I met
      Mrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face. She
      was a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman with a stern set expression
      of mouth. But her telltale eyes were red and glanced at me from between
      swollen lids. It was she, then, who wept in the night, and if she did so
      her husband must know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery
      in declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did she
      weep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-bearded
      man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom. It was he
      who had been the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we had
      only his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man&rsquo;s
      death. Was it possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had seen
      in the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been the same. The
      cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an impression might
      easily have been erroneous. How could I settle the point forever?
      Obviously the first thing to do was to see the Grimpen postmaster and find
      whether the test telegram had really been placed in Barrymore&rsquo;s own hands.
      Be the answer what it might, I should at least have something to report to
      Sherlock Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that the time
      was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk of four miles
      along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a small grey hamlet, in
      which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and the house of
      Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the rest. The postmaster, who was also the
      village grocer, had a clear recollection of the telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I had the telegram delivered to Mr. Barrymore
      exactly as directed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who delivered it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore at the
      Hall last week, did you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father, I delivered it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into his own hands?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put it into
      his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore&rsquo;s hands, and she promised
      to deliver it at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see Mr. Barrymore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t see him, how do you know he was in the loft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is,&rdquo; said the postmaster
      testily. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he get the telegram? If there is any mistake it is for
      Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was clear
      that in spite of Holmes&rsquo;s ruse we had no proof that Barrymore had
      not been in London all the time. Suppose that it were so&mdash;suppose
      that the same man had been the last who had seen Sir Charles alive, and
      the first to dog the new heir when he returned to England. What then? Was
      he the agent of others or had he some sinister design of his own? What
      interest could he have in persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought
      of the strange warning clipped out of the leading article of the
      <i>Times</i>. Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone
      who was bent upon counteracting his schemes? The only conceivable motive
      was that which had been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the family could
      be scared away a comfortable and permanent home would be secured for the
      Barrymores. But surely such an explanation as that would be quite
      inadequate to account for the deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be
      weaving an invisible net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said
      that no more complex case had come to him in all the long series of his
      sensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the grey,
      lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations
      and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet behind
      me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned, expecting to see Dr.
      Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing me. He was
      a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired and lean-jawed,
      between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a grey suit and wearing
      a straw hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and
      he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,&rdquo; said he as he
      came panting up to where I stood. &ldquo;Here on the moor we are homely folk and
      do not wait for formal introductions. You may possibly have heard my name
      from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I am Stapleton, of Merripit House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your net and box would have told me as much,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for I knew that
      Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me from the
      window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the same way I
      thought that I would overtake you and introduce myself. I trust that Sir
      Henry is none the worse for his journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very well, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir Charles the new
      baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking much of a wealthy man to
      come down and bury himself in a place of this kind, but I need not tell
      you that it means a very great deal to the countryside. Sir Henry has, I
      suppose, no superstitious fears in the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think that it is likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here! Any number
      of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature upon the
      moor.&rdquo; He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to read in his eyes that he
      took the matter more seriously. &ldquo;The story took a great hold upon the
      imagination of Sir Charles, and I have no doubt that it led to his tragic
      end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have
      had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy that he really did see
      something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley. I feared that
      some disaster might occur, for I was very fond of the old man, and I knew
      that his heart was weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend Mortimer told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he died of
      fright in consequence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any better explanation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not come to any conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid
      face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was
      intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr. Watson,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;The records of your detective have reached us here, and you
      could not celebrate him without being known yourself. When Mortimer told
      me your name he could not deny your identity. If you are here, then it
      follows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself in the matter, and
      I am naturally curious to know what view he may take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engage his
      attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so dark to us.
      But as to your own researches, if there is any possible way in which I can
      be of service to you I trust that you will command me. If I had any
      indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to
      investigate the case, I might perhaps even now give you some aid or
      advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend, Sir Henry,
      and that I need no help of any kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; said Stapleton. &ldquo;You are perfectly right to be wary and
      discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable
      intrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road
      and wound away across the moor. A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon
      the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry. The
      face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and
      brambles growing in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a
      grey plume of smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit House,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure of
      introducing you to my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry&rsquo;s side. But then I
      remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was
      littered. It was certain that I could not help with those. And Holmes had
      expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor. I
      accepted Stapleton&rsquo;s invitation, and we turned together down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a wonderful place, the moor,&rdquo; said he, looking round over the
      undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite
      foaming up into fantastic surges. &ldquo;You never tire of the moor. You cannot
      think the wonderful secrets which it contains. It is so vast, and so
      barren, and so mysterious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it well, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only been here two years. The residents would call me a newcomer.
      We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my tastes led me to explore
      every part of the country round, and I should think that there are few men
      who know it better than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it hard to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the north here with
      the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observe anything remarkable
      about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a rare place for a gallop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their lives
      before now. You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stapleton laughed. &ldquo;That is the great Grimpen Mire,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;A false
      step yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I saw one of the
      moor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I saw his head for quite a
      long time craning out of the bog-hole, but it sucked him down at last.
      Even in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it, but after these autumn
      rains it is an awful place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart of
      it and return alive. By George, there is another of those miserable
      ponies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges. Then a
      long, agonised, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed over
      the moor. It turned me cold with horror, but my companion&rsquo;s nerves seemed
      to be stronger than mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The mire has him. Two in two days, and many more,
      perhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather and
      never know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches. It&rsquo;s a
      bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you say you can penetrate it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can take. I have
      found them out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut off on all
      sides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round them in the course
      of years. That is where the rare plants and the butterflies are, if you
      have the wit to reach them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall try my luck some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me with a surprised face. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake put such an idea
      out of your mind,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Your blood would be upon my head. I assure
      you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive. It
      is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It filled the
      whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it came. From a dull
      murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then sank back into a melancholy,
      throbbing murmur once again. Stapleton looked at me with a curious
      expression in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer place, the moor!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for its
      prey. I&rsquo;ve heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge swelling
      plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing stirred over the
      vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly from a tor behind
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an educated man. You don&rsquo;t believe such nonsense as that?&rdquo; said
      I. &ldquo;What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It&rsquo;s the mud settling, or the water
      rising, or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, that was a living voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very rare bird&mdash;practically extinct&mdash;in England now, but
      all things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be surprised to
      learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the hillside
      yonder. What do you make of those?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole steep slope was covered with grey circular rings of stone, a
      score of them at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they? Sheep-pens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man lived
      thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived there since, we
      find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them. These are his
      wigwams with the roofs off. You can even see his hearth and his couch if
      you have the curiosity to go inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neolithic man&mdash;no date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for tin when
      the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look at the great
      trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes, you will find some
      very singular points about the moor, Dr. Watson. Oh, excuse me an instant!
      It is surely Cyclopides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant
      Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of
      it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire, and my
      acquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft to tuft
      behind it, his green net waving in the air. His grey clothes and jerky,
      zigzag, irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself. I
      was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his
      extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the
      treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turning round,
      found a woman near me upon the path. She had come from the direction in
      which the plume of smoke indicated the position of Merripit House, but the
      dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had been
      told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I remembered
      that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty. The woman who
      approached me was certainly that, and of a most uncommon type. There could
      not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister, for Stapleton
      was neutral tinted, with light hair and grey eyes, while she was darker
      than any brunette whom I have seen in England&mdash;slim, elegant, and
      tall. She had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might have
      seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the beautiful
      dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant dress she was,
      indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her eyes were on
      her brother as I turned, and then she quickened her pace towards me. I had
      raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory remark when her own
      words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Go straight back to London, instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at me, and
      she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I go back?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot explain.&rdquo; She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a curious lisp
      in her utterance. &ldquo;But for God&rsquo;s sake do what I ask you. Go back and never
      set foot upon the moor again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have only just come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, man!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Can you not tell when a warning is for your own
      good? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from this place at all
      costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word of what I have said. Would
      you mind getting that orchid for me among the mare&rsquo;s-tails yonder? We are
      very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course, you are rather late
      to see the beauties of the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and
      flushed with his exertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloa, Beryl!&rdquo; said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his
      greeting was not altogether a cordial one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jack, you are very hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom found in the
      late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed him!&rdquo; He spoke
      unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the girl
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have introduced yourselves, I can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to see the
      true beauties of the moor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, who do you think this is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is Dr.
      Watson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. &ldquo;We have been talking
      at cross purposes,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you had not very much time for talk,&rdquo; her brother remarked with the
      same questioning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a
      visitor,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It cannot much matter to him whether it is early or
      late for the orchids. But you will come on, will you not, and see Merripit
      House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm of
      some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and
      turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the trees, as
      is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of the
      whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted by a strange,
      wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the
      house. Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an elegance
      in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I looked from
      their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor rolling unbroken to
      the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what could have brought
      this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to live in such a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer spot to choose, is it not?&rdquo; said he as if in answer to my thought.
      &ldquo;And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not, Beryl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite happy,&rdquo; said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a school,&rdquo; said Stapleton. &ldquo;It was in the north country. The work
      to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the
      privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds, and
      of impressing them with one&rsquo;s own character and ideals was very dear to
      me. However, the fates were against us. A serious epidemic broke out in
      the school and three of the boys died. It never recovered from the blow,
      and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet, if it were
      not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys, I could
      rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes for botany and
      zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here, and my sister is as
      devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr. Watson, has been brought upon
      your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull&mdash;less
      for you, perhaps, than for your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I am never dull,&rdquo; said she quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting neighbours.
      Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line. Poor Sir Charles was
      also an admirable companion. We knew him well and miss him more than I can
      tell. Do you think that I should intrude if I were to call this afternoon
      and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure that he would be delighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may in our
      humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he becomes
      accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you come upstairs, Dr. Watson,
      and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera? I think it is the most complete
      one in the south-west of England. By the time that you have looked through
      them lunch will be almost ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the moor, the
      death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been associated
      with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things tinged my
      thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of these more or less vague
      impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of Miss
      Stapleton, delivered with such intense earnestness that I could not doubt
      that some grave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all pressure to
      stay for lunch, and I set off at once upon my return journey, taking the
      grass-grown path by which we had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those who
      knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see Miss
      Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. Her face was
      beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her hand to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I
      had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my brother may
      miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the stupid mistake I
      made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please forget the words I said,
      which have no application whatever to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t forget them, Miss Stapleton,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am Sir Henry&rsquo;s
      friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. Tell me why it
      was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will understand
      that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look in your
      eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for ever since I
      have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me. Life has
      become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches everywhere
      into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track. Tell me then
      what it was that you meant, and I will promise to convey your warning to
      Sir Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face, but her
      eyes had hardened again when she answered me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make too much of it, Dr. Watson,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;My brother and I were
      very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him very
      intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house. He was
      deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family, and when this
      tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds for the
      fears which he had expressed. I was distressed therefore when another
      member of the family came down to live here, and I felt that he should be
      warned of the danger which he will run. That was all which I intended to
      convey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the story of the hound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe in such nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him away from a
      place which has always been fatal to his family. The world is wide. Why
      should he wish to live at the place of danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it <i>is</i> the place of danger. That is Sir Henry&rsquo;s nature. I fear
      that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it
      would be impossible to get him to move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything definite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no more
      than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your brother
      to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he, or anyone else,
      could object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks it
      is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He would be very angry if
      he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry to go away.
      But I have done my duty now and I will say no more. I must go back, or he
      will miss me and suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!&rdquo; She turned and
      had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, while I,
      with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to Baskerville Hall.

First Report of Dr. Watson</h3>

      From this point onward I will follow the course of events by transcribing
      my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before me on the table.
      One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly as written and show my

      clear as it is upon these tragic events, can possibly do.

    <p class="p2">
      Baskerville Hall, October 13th.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOLMES,
    </p>
    <p>
      My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as
      to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner of the world.
      The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into
      one&rsquo;s soul, its vastness, and also its grim charm. When you are
      once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of modern England behind
      you, but, on the other hand, you are conscious everywhere of the homes
      and the work of the prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk
      are the houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge
      monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. As you look at
      their grey stone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own
      age behind you, and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out
      from the low door fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his
      bow, you would feel that his presence there was more natural than your
      own. The strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what
      must always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I
      could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were
      forced to accept that which none other would occupy.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and will
      probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind. I can
      still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun moved
      round the earth or the earth round the sun. Let me, therefore, return to
      the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have not had any report within the last few days it is because up
      to today there was nothing of importance to relate. Then a very surprising
      circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you in due course. But, first of
      all, I must keep you in touch with some of the other factors in the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped convict
      upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that he has got right
      away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely householders of this
      district. A fortnight has passed since his flight, during which he has not
      been seen and nothing has been heard of him. It is surely inconceivable
      that he could have held out upon the moor during all that time. Of course,
      so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all. Any one of
      these stone huts would give him a hiding-place. But there is nothing to
      eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep. We think,
      therefore, that he has gone, and the outlying farmers sleep the better in
      consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take good
      care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments when I
      have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles from any help. There are
      one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the latter not a
      very strong man. They would be helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow
      like this Notting Hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance. Both
      Sir Henry and I were concerned at their situation, and it was suggested
      that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there, but Stapleton would
      not hear of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a considerable
      interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be wondered at, for time
      hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him, and she is a
      very fascinating and beautiful woman. There is something tropical and
      exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and
      unemotional brother. Yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires. He has
      certainly a very marked influence over her, for I have seen her
      continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what
      she said. I trust that he is kind to her. There is a dry glitter in his
      eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes with a positive and
      possibly a harsh nature. You would find him an interesting study.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the very next
      morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wicked
      Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It was an excursion of some miles
      across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might have suggested
      the story. We found a short valley between rugged tors which led to an
      open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton grass. In the middle
      of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end until
      they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast. In
      every way it corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy. Sir Henry was
      much interested and asked Stapleton more than once whether he did really
      believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the
      affairs of men. He spoke lightly, but it was evident that he was very much
      in earnest. Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see
      that he said less than he might, and that he would not express his whole
      opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the baronet. He told us
      of similar cases, where families had suffered from some evil influence,
      and he left us with the impression that he shared the popular view upon
      the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was there
      that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton. From the first
      moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and I
      am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual. He referred to her again
      and again on our walk home, and since then hardly a day has passed that we
      have not seen something of the brother and sister. They dine here tonight,
      and there is some talk of our going to them next week. One would imagine
      that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and yet I have more
      than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation in his face when
      Sir Henry has been paying some attention to his sister. He is much
      attached to her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life without her, but
      it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of
      her making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain that he does not wish
      their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several times observed that
      he has taken pains to prevent them from being <i>tête-à-tête</i>. By the way,
      your instructions to me never to allow Sir Henry to go out alone will
      become very much more onerous if a love affair were to be added to our
      other difficulties. My popularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out
      your orders to the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other day&mdash;Thursday, to be more exact&mdash;Dr. Mortimer lunched
      with us. He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has got a
      prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy. Never was there such a
      single-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons came in afterwards, and the
      good doctor took us all to the yew alley at Sir Henry&rsquo;s request to show us
      exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night. It is a long,
      dismal walk, the yew alley, between two high walls of clipped hedge, with
      a narrow band of grass upon either side. At the far end is an old
      tumble-down summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where the old
      gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with a latch.
      Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory of the affair and
      tried to picture all that had occurred. As the old man stood there he saw
      something coming across the moor, something which terrified him so that he
      lost his wits and ran and ran until he died of sheer horror and
      exhaustion. There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled. And from
      what? A sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and
      monstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter? Did the pale, watchful
      Barrymore know more than he cared to say? It was all dim and vague, but
      always there is the dark shadow of crime behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr. Frankland,
      of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south of us. He is an
      elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric. His passion is for the
      British law, and he has spent a large fortune in litigation. He fights for
      the mere pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take up either side
      of a question, so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly
      amusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the parish to
      make him open it. At others he will with his own hands tear down some
      other man&rsquo;s gate and declare that a path has existed there from time
      immemorial, defying the owner to prosecute him for trespass. He is learned
      in old manorial and communal rights, and he applies his knowledge
      sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against
      them, so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the
      village street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest exploit.
      He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands at present, which
      will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his
      sting and leave him harmless for the future. Apart from the law he seems a
      kindly, good-natured person, and I only mention him because you were
      particular that I should send some description of the people who surround
      us. He is curiously employed at present, for, being an amateur astronomer,
      he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies upon the roof of his own
      house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the
      escaped convict. If he would confine his energies to this all would be
      well, but there are rumours that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for
      opening a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up
      the Neolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep our lives
      from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the
      Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let me end on
      that which is most important and tell you more about the Barrymores, and
      especially about the surprising development of last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London in order
      to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have already explained that
      the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was worthless and that
      we have no proof one way or the other. I told Sir Henry how the matter
      stood, and he at once, in his downright fashion, had Barrymore up and
      asked him whether he had received the telegram himself. Barrymore said
      that he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?&rdquo; asked Sir Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife brought it
      up to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you answer it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning,
      Sir Henry,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I trust that they do not mean that I have done
      anything to forfeit your confidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving
      him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London outfit having now
      all arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid person, very
      limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You could
      hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told you how, on the
      first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then I have more
      than once observed traces of tears upon her face. Some deep sorrow gnaws
      ever at her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which
      haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic tyrant.
      I have always felt that there was something singular and questionable in
      this man&rsquo;s character, but the adventure of last night brings all my
      suspicions to a head.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that I am not
      a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this house my
      slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, about two in the
      morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. I rose, opened
      my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was trailing down the
      corridor. It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a
      candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to
      his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it
      was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly, and there was
      something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs
      round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I waited
      until he had passed out of sight and then I followed him. When I came
      round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor, and I
      could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had
      entered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and
      unoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The
      light shone steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down the
      passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the
      glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed to be
      rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor.
      For some minutes he stood watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and
      with an impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my way
      back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once
      more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had fallen into a
      light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could not tell
      whence the sound came. What it all means I cannot guess, but there is some
      secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we
      shall get to the bottom of. I do not trouble you with my theories, for you
      asked me to furnish you only with facts. I have had a long talk with Sir
      Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my
      observations of last night. I will not speak about it just now, but it
      should make my next report interesting reading.

The Light upon the Moor [Second Report of Dr. Watson]</h3>

    <p>
      Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOLMES,
    </p>
    <p>
      If I was compelled to leave you without much news during the early days
      of my mission you must acknowledge that I am making up for lost time, and
      that events are now crowding thick and fast upon us. In my last report I
      ended upon my top note with Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite
      a budget already which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably
      surprise you. Things have taken a turn which I could not have
      anticipated. In some ways they have within the last forty-eight hours
      become much clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated.
      But I will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the
      corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been on the night
      before. The western window through which he had stared so intently has, I
      noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house&mdash;it
      commands the nearest outlook on to the moor. There is an opening between
      two trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down
      upon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse
      which can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only
      this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for
      something or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so that I
      can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone. It had struck me
      that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot. That would have
      accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his
      wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal
      the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something
      to support it. That opening of the door which I had heard after I had
      returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some
      clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the morning, and I
      tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result may have
      shown that they were unfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore&rsquo;s movements might be, I
      felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until I could
      explain them was more than I could bear. I had an interview with the
      baronet in his study after breakfast, and I told him all that I had seen.
      He was less surprised than I had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to speak to
      him about it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Two or three times I have heard his steps in the
      passage, coming and going, just about the hour you name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window,&rdquo; I
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see what it
      is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he were
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;He
      would follow Barrymore and see what he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we shall do it together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely he would hear us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance of that.
      We&rsquo;ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he passes.&rdquo; Sir Henry
      rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was evident that he hailed the
      adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared the
      plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from London, so that we may
      expect great changes to begin here soon. There have been decorators and
      furnishers up from Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend has large
      ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of
      his family. When the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will
      need will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves there are
      pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing,
      for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman than he is with
      our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton. And yet the course of true love
      does not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstances
      expect. Today, for example, its surface was broken by a very unexpected
      ripple, which has caused our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry put
      on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of course I did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, are <i>you</i> coming, Watson?&rdquo; he asked, looking at me in a curious way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on whether you are going on the moor,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude, but you
      heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and
      especially that you should not go alone upon the moor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not foresee
      some things which have happened since I have been on the moor. You
      understand me? I am sure that you are the last man in the world who would
      wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say or what
      to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his cane and was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me
      bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight. I
      imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to you and to
      confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your
      instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought. It might
      not even now be too late to overtake him, so I set off at once in the
      direction of Merripit House.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything of
      Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor path branches off.
      There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the wrong direction after all, I
      mounted a hill from which I could command a view&mdash;the same hill which
      is cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw him at once. He was on the moor
      path about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could
      only be Miss Stapleton. It was clear that there was already an
      understanding between them and that they had met by appointment. They were
      walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making quick
      little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what she was
      saying, while he listened intently, and once or twice shook his head in
      strong dissent. I stood among the rocks watching them, very much puzzled
      as to what I should do next. To follow them and break into their intimate
      conversation seemed to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never for
      an instant to let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a friend was a
      hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to observe him from
      the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to him afterwards what
      I had done. It is true that if any sudden danger had threatened him I was
      too far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that you will agree with me
      that the position was very difficult, and that there was nothing more
      which I could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and were
      standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was suddenly aware
      that I was not the only witness of their interview. A wisp of green
      floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me that it
      was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken ground. It
      was Stapleton with his butterfly-net. He was very much closer to the pair
      than I was, and he appeared to be moving in their direction. At this
      instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm was
      round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from him with
      her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she raised one hand as
      if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly
      round. Stapleton was the cause of the interruption. He was running wildly
      towards them, his absurd net dangling behind him. He gesticulated and
      almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers. What the scene meant
      I could not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir
      Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as the other
      refused to accept them. The lady stood by in haughty silence. Finally
      Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a peremptory way to his
      sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir Henry, walked off by the
      side of her brother. The naturalist&rsquo;s angry gestures showed that the lady
      was included in his displeasure. The baronet stood for a minute looking
      after them, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come, his
      head hanging, the very picture of dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed to have
      witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend&rsquo;s knowledge. I ran down
      the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom. His face was flushed
      with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his wit&rsquo;s ends
      what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to
      say that you came after me in spite of all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to remain
      behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that had
      occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but my frankness disarmed
      his anger, and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for
      a man to be private,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but, by thunder, the whole countryside
      seems to have been out to see me do my wooing&mdash;and a mighty poor
      wooing at that! Where had you engaged a seat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was on that hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to the front. Did
      you see him come out on us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he ever strike you as being crazy&mdash;this brother of hers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that he ever did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today, but you can
      take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket. What&rsquo;s
      the matter with me, anyhow? You&rsquo;ve lived near me for some weeks, Watson.
      Tell me straight, now! Is there anything that would prevent me from making
      a good husband to a woman that I loved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he has
      this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt man or woman in my life
      that I know of. And yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of
      her fingers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I&rsquo;ve only known her these few
      weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me, and she,
      too&mdash;she was happy when she was with me, and that I&rsquo;ll swear. There&rsquo;s
      a light in a woman&rsquo;s eyes that speaks louder than words. But he has never
      let us get together and it was only today for the first time that I saw a
      chance of having a few words with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but
      when she did it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn&rsquo;t
      have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. She kept
      coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that she would
      never be happy until I had left it. I told her that since I had seen her I
      was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she really wanted me to go, the
      only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me. With that I
      offered in as many words to marry her, but before she could answer, down
      came this brother of hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman.
      He was just white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with
      fury. What was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer her attentions
      which were distasteful to her? Did I think that because I was a baronet I
      could do what I liked? If he had not been her brother I should have known
      better how to answer him. As it was I told him that my feelings towards
      his sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she
      might honour me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no
      better, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly
      than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing by. So it ended
      by his going off with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a
      man as any in this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and
      I&rsquo;ll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled
      myself. Our friend&rsquo;s title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his
      appearance are all in his favour, and I know nothing against him unless it
      be this dark fate which runs in his family. That his advances should be
      rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady&rsquo;s own wishes and
      that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very amazing.
      However, our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from Stapleton
      himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies for his
      rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with Sir Henry
      in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the breach is quite
      healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit House next Friday as a sign of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say now that he isn&rsquo;t a crazy man,&rdquo; said Sir Henry; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning, but I must
      allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he give any explanation of his conduct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural enough,
      and I am glad that he should understand her value. They have always been
      together, and according to his account he has been a very lonely man with
      only her as a companion, so that the thought of losing her was really
      terrible to him. He had not understood, he said, that I was becoming
      attached to her, but when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so,
      and that she might be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that
      for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did. He was very
      sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish and how
      selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman
      like his sister to himself for her whole life. If she had to leave him he
      had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else. But in
      any case it was a blow to him and it would take him some time before he
      could prepare himself to meet it. He would withdraw all opposition upon
      his part if I would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to
      be content with cultivating the lady&rsquo;s friendship during that time without
      claiming her love. This I promised, and so the matter rests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is something to have
      touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering. We know
      now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister&rsquo;s suitor&mdash;even
      when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And now I pass on to
      another thread which I have extricated out of the tangled skein, the
      mystery of the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs.
      Barrymore, of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice
      window. Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me that I have not
      disappointed you as an agent&mdash;that you do not regret the confidence
      which you showed in me when you sent me down. All these things have by one
      night&rsquo;s work been thoroughly cleared.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said &ldquo;by one night&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; but, in truth, it was by two nights&rsquo;
      work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up with Sir Henry in
      his rooms until nearly three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, but no sound of any
      sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs. It was a most
      melancholy vigil and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs.
      Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we determined to try again. The
      next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making
      the least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by, and
      yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient interest which
      the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into which he hopes the game
      may wander. One struck, and two, and we had almost for the second time
      given it up in despair when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our
      chairs with all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more. We had
      heard the creak of a step in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the distance.
      Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out in pursuit. Already
      our man had gone round the gallery and the corridor was all in darkness.
      Softly we stole along until we had come into the other wing. We were just
      in time to catch a glimpse of the tall, black-bearded figure, his
      shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage. Then he passed through
      the same door as before, and the light of the candle framed it in the
      darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor.
      We shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every plank before we dared to
      put our whole weight upon it. We had taken the precaution of leaving our
      boots behind us, but, even so, the old boards snapped and creaked beneath
      our tread. Sometimes it seemed impossible that he should fail to hear our
      approach. However, the man is fortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely
      preoccupied in that which he was doing. When at last we reached the door
      and peeped through we found him crouching at the window, candle in hand,
      his white, intent face pressed against the pane, exactly as I had seen him
      two nights before.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to whom the
      most direct way is always the most natural. He walked into the room, and
      as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of his
      breath and stood, livid and trembling, before us. His dark eyes, glaring
      out of the white mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as
      he gazed from Sir Henry to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here, Barrymore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, sir.&rdquo; His agitation was so great that he could hardly speak, and
      the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle. &ldquo;It was the
      window, sir. I go round at night to see that they are fastened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the second floor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, all the windows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Barrymore,&rdquo; said Sir Henry sternly, &ldquo;we have made up our minds
      to have the truth out of you, so it will save you trouble to tell it
      sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies! What were you doing at that
      window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands together
      like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why were you holding a candle to the window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, Sir Henry&mdash;don&rsquo;t ask me! I give you my word, sir, that
      it is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it concerned no one but
      myself I would not try to keep it from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the trembling
      hand of the butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have been holding it as a signal,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Let us see if there
      is any answer.&rdquo; I held it as he had done, and stared out into the darkness
      of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the trees and the
      lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the clouds. And then
      I gave a cry of exultation, for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had
      suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of
      the black square framed by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, sir, it is nothing&mdash;nothing at all!&rdquo; the butler broke in; &ldquo;I
      assure you, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move your light across the window, Watson!&rdquo; cried the baronet. &ldquo;See, the
      other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that it is a signal? Come,
      speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder, and what is this conspiracy
      that is going on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s face became openly defiant. &ldquo;It is my business, and not yours. I
      will not tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you leave my employment right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir. If I must I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be ashamed of yourself.
      Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under this roof,
      and here I find you deep in some dark plot against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, sir; no, not against you!&rdquo; It was a woman&rsquo;s voice, and Mrs.
      Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband, was standing at
      the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic were
      it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack our things,&rdquo;
       said the butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this? It is my doing, Sir Henry&mdash;all
      mine. He has done nothing except for my sake and because I asked him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak out, then! What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My unhappy brother is starving on the moor. We cannot let him perish at
      our very gates. The light is a signal to him that food is ready for him,
      and his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your brother is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The escaped convict, sir&mdash;Selden, the criminal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the truth, sir,&rdquo; said Barrymore. &ldquo;I said that it was not my secret
      and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have heard it, and you
      will see that if there was a plot it was not against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night and
      the light at the window. Sir Henry and I both stared at the woman in
      amazement. Was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of
      the same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. We humoured
      him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way in everything
      until he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure, and that
      he could do what he liked in it. Then as he grew older he met wicked
      companions, and the devil entered into him until he broke my mother&rsquo;s
      heart and dragged our name in the dirt. From crime to crime he sank lower
      and lower until it is only the mercy of God which has snatched him from
      the scaffold; but to me, sir, he was always the little curly-headed boy
      that I had nursed and played with as an elder sister would. That was why
      he broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and that we could not refuse
      to help him. When he dragged himself here one night, weary and starving,
      with the warders hard at his heels, what could we do? We took him in and
      fed him and cared for him. Then you returned, sir, and my brother thought
      he would be safer on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was
      over, so he lay in hiding there. But every second night we made sure if he
      was still there by putting a light in the window, and if there was an
      answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him. Every day we hoped
      that he was gone, but as long as he was there we could not desert him.
      That is the whole truth, as I am an honest Christian woman and you will
      see that if there is blame in the matter it does not lie with my husband
      but with me, for whose sake he has done all that he has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman&rsquo;s words came with an intense earnestness which carried
      conviction with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this true, Barrymore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget what I
      have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk further about this
      matter in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry had flung
      it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces. Far away in the
      black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder he dares,&rdquo; said Sir Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be so placed as to be only visible from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. How far do you think it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more than a mile or two off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to it. And
      he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By thunder, Watson, I am
      going out to take that man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the Barrymores
      had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had been forced from
      them. The man was a danger to the community, an unmitigated scoundrel for
      whom there was neither pity nor excuse. We were only doing our duty in
      taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no harm. With his
      brutal and violent nature, others would have to pay the price if we held
      our hands. Any night, for example, our neighbours the Stapletons might be
      attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of this which made Sir
      Henry so keen upon the adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner we start the
      better, as the fellow may put out his light and be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our expedition. We
      hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning of the autumn
      wind and the rustle of the falling leaves. The night air was heavy with
      the smell of damp and decay. Now and again the moon peeped out for an
      instant, but clouds were driving over the face of the sky, and just as we
      came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall. The light still burned
      steadily in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you armed?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a hunting-crop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a desperate fellow.
      We shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can
      resist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Watson,&rdquo; said the baronet, &ldquo;what would Holmes say to this? How
      about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of
      the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the borders of
      the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind through the silence of the
      night, a long, deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad moan in
      which it died away. Again and again it sounded, the whole air throbbing
      with it, strident, wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my sleeve and
      his face glimmered white through the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, what&rsquo;s that, Watson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s a sound they have on the moor. I heard it once
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood
      straining our ears, but nothing came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watson,&rdquo; said the baronet, &ldquo;it was the cry of a hound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice which
      told of the sudden horror which had seized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they call this sound?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The folk on the countryside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated but could not escape the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He groaned and was silent for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hound it was,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;but it seemed to come from miles away,
      over yonder, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was hard to say whence it came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It rose and fell with the wind. Isn&rsquo;t that the direction of the great
      Grimpen Mire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn&rsquo;t you think yourself that
      it was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You need not fear to speak
      the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stapleton was with me when I heard it last. He said that it might be the
      calling of a strange bird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in all these
      stories? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so dark a cause?
      You don&rsquo;t believe it, do you, Watson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is another
      to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as
      that. And my uncle! There was the footprint of the hound beside him as he
      lay. It all fits together. I don&rsquo;t think that I am a coward, Watson, but
      that sound seemed to freeze my very blood. Feel my hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was as cold as a block of marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all right tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get that cry out of my head. What do you advise that
      we do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we turn back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do it. We
      after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us. Come on!
      We&rsquo;ll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon the
      moor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of the
      craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning steadily in
      front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon a
      pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon the
      horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us. But at
      last we could see whence it came, and then we knew that we were indeed
      very close. A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which
      flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent
      it from being visible, save in the direction of Baskerville Hall. A
      boulder of granite concealed our approach, and crouching behind it we
      gazed over it at the signal light. It was strange to see this single
      candle burning there in the middle of the moor, with no sign of life near
      it&mdash;just the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on
      each side of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do now?&rdquo; whispered Sir Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a glimpse
      of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Over the
      rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was thrust out an
      evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed and scored with vile
      passions. Foul with mire, with a bristling beard, and hung with matted
      hair, it might well have belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in
      the burrows on the hillsides. The light beneath him was reflected in his
      small, cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the
      darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps of the
      hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been that
      Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give, or the
      fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not well,
      but I could read his fears upon his wicked face. Any instant he might dash
      out the light and vanish in the darkness. I sprang forward therefore, and
      Sir Henry did the same. At the same moment the convict screamed out a
      curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder
      which had sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short, squat, strongly
      built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run. At the same
      moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds. We rushed over
      the brow of the hill, and there was our man running with great speed down
      the other side, springing over the stones in his way with the activity of
      a mountain goat. A lucky long shot of my revolver might have crippled him,
      but I had brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an
      unarmed man who was running away.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we soon found
      that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw him for a long time in the
      moonlight until he was only a small speck moving swiftly among the
      boulders upon the side of a distant hill. We ran and ran until we were
      completely blown, but the space between us grew ever wider. Finally we
      stopped and sat panting on two rocks, while we watched him disappearing in
      the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and
      unexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to go home,
      having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low upon the right, and
      the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up against the lower curve of
      its silver disc. There, outlined as black as an ebony statue on that
      shining background, I saw the figure of a man upon the tor. Do not think
      that it was a delusion, Holmes. I assure you that I have never in my life
      seen anything more clearly. As far as I could judge, the figure was that
      of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs a little separated, his arms
      folded, his head bowed, as if he were brooding over that enormous
      wilderness of peat and granite which lay before him. He might have been
      the very spirit of that terrible place. It was not the convict. This man
      was far from the place where the latter had disappeared. Besides, he was a
      much taller man. With a cry of surprise I pointed him out to the baronet,
      but in the instant during which I had turned to grasp his arm the man was
      gone. There was the sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge
      of the moon, but its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it was some
      distance away. The baronet&rsquo;s nerves were still quivering from that cry,
      which recalled the dark story of his family, and he was not in the mood
      for fresh adventures. He had not seen this lonely man upon the tor and
      could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding
      attitude had given to me. &ldquo;A warder, no doubt,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The moor has
      been thick with them since this fellow escaped.&rdquo; Well, perhaps his
      explanation may be the right one, but I should like to have some further
      proof of it. Today we mean to communicate to the Princetown people where
      they should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that we have
      not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our own prisoner.
      Such are the adventures of last night, and you must acknowledge, my dear
      Holmes, that I have done you very well in the matter of a report. Much of
      what I tell you is no doubt quite irrelevant, but still I feel that it is
      best that I should let you have all the facts and leave you to select for
      yourself those which will be of most service to you in helping you to your
      conclusions. We are certainly making some progress. So far as the
      Barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions, and that has
      cleared up the situation very much. But the moor with its mysteries and
      its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as ever. Perhaps in my next
      I may be able to throw some light upon this also. Best of all would it be
      if you could come down to us. In any case you will hear from me again in
      the course of the next few days.

Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson</h3>

    <p>
      So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have forwarded
      during these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now, however, I have arrived
      at a point in my narrative where I am compelled to abandon this method and
      to trust once more to my recollections, aided by the diary which I kept at
      the time. A few extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes
      which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I proceed, then,
      from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the convict and our
      other strange experiences upon the moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>October</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of
      rain. The house is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and then
      to show the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver veins upon the
      sides of the hills, and the distant boulders gleaming where the light
      strikes upon their wet faces. It is melancholy outside and in. The
      baronet is in a black reaction after the excitements of the night. I am
      conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending
      danger&mdash;ever present danger, which is the more terrible because I am
      unable to define it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the long sequence of
      incidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is at
      work around us. There is the death of the last occupant of the Hall,
      fulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend, and there are
      the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange creature
      upon the moor. Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound which
      resembled the distant baying of a hound. It is incredible, impossible,
      that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature. A spectral
      hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its howling
      is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may fall in with such a
      superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one quality upon earth it
      is common sense, and nothing will persuade me to believe in such a thing.
      To do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants, who are
      not content with a mere fiend dog but must needs describe him with
      hell-fire shooting from his mouth and eyes. Holmes would not listen to
      such fancies, and I am his agent. But facts are facts, and I have twice
      heard this crying upon the moor. Suppose that there were really some huge
      hound loose upon it; that would go far to explain everything. But where
      could such a hound lie concealed, where did it get its food, where did it
      come from, how was it that no one saw it by day? It must be confessed that
      the natural explanation offers almost as many difficulties as the other.
      And always, apart from the hound, there is the fact of the human agency in
      London, the man in the cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry against
      the moor. This at least was real, but it might have been the work of a
      protecting friend as easily as of an enemy. Where is that friend or enemy
      now? Has he remained in London, or has he followed us down here? Could he&mdash;could
      he be the stranger whom I saw upon the tor?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet there are
      some things to which I am ready to swear. He is no one whom I have seen
      down here, and I have now met all the neighbours. The figure was far
      taller than that of Stapleton, far thinner than that of Frankland.
      Barrymore it might possibly have been, but we had left him behind us, and
      I am certain that he could not have followed us. A stranger then is still
      dogging us, just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never shaken
      him off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we might find
      ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one purpose I must
      now devote all my energies.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second and wisest
      one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to anyone. He
      is silent and distrait. His nerves have been strangely shaken by that
      sound upon the moor. I will say nothing to add to his anxieties, but I
      will take my own steps to attain my own end.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore asked leave
      to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in his study some little
      time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more than once heard the sound of
      voices raised, and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was
      under discussion. After a time the baronet opened his door and called for
      me. &ldquo;Barrymore considers that he has a grievance,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He thinks
      that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he, of
      his own free will, had told us the secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have spoken too warmly, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and if I have, I am sure
      that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much surprised when I
      heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you had
      been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has enough to fight against without
      my putting more upon his track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different
      thing,&rdquo; said the baronet, &ldquo;you only told us, or rather your wife only told
      us, when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir Henry&mdash;indeed
      I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered over the
      moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You only want to get
      a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr. Stapleton&rsquo;s house, for
      example, with no one but himself to defend it. There&rsquo;s no safety for
      anyone until he is under lock and key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon that. But
      he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I assure you, Sir
      Henry, that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been
      made and he will be on his way to South America. For God&rsquo;s sake, sir, I
      beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor. They
      have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the ship is
      ready for him. You can&rsquo;t tell on him without getting my wife and me into
      trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, Watson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shrugged my shoulders. &ldquo;If he were safely out of the country it would
      relieve the tax-payer of a burden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him with all that
      he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he was hiding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Sir Henry. &ldquo;Well, Barrymore&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would have killed my
      poor wife had he been taken again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after what we
      have heard I don&rsquo;t feel as if I could give the man up, so there is an end
      of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated and
      then came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the best I can
      for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should have
      said it before, but it was long after the inquest that I found it out.
      I&rsquo;ve never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man. It&rsquo;s about poor Sir
      Charles&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baronet and I were both upon our feet. &ldquo;Do you know how he died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I don&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To meet a woman! He?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the woman&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials. Her
      initials were L. L.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know this, Barrymore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had usually a
      great many letters, for he was a public man and well known for his kind
      heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him. But
      that morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter, so I took the
      more notice of it. It was from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a
      woman&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have done had
      it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out Sir
      Charles&rsquo;s study&mdash;it had never been touched since his death&mdash;and
      she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate. The
      greater part of it was charred to pieces, but one little slip, the end of
      a page, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it was
      grey on a black ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of
      the letter and it said: &lsquo;Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this
      letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were signed the
      initials L. L.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got that slip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should not have
      noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have no idea who L. L. is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our hands
      upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this important
      information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us. And
      then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir Charles, as we well
      might be considering all that he has done for us. To rake this up couldn&rsquo;t
      help our poor master, and it&rsquo;s well to go carefully when there&rsquo;s a lady in
      the case. Even the best of us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought it might injure his reputation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you have been kind
      to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to tell you
      all that I know about the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Barrymore; you can go.&rdquo; When the butler had left us Sir Henry
      turned to me. &ldquo;Well, Watson, what do you think of this new light?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up the whole
      business. We have gained that much. We know that there is someone who has
      the facts if we can only find her. What do you think we should do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the clue for which
      he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not bring him down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning&rsquo;s
      conversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been very busy
      of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street were few and short,
      with no comments upon the information which I had supplied and hardly any
      reference to my mission. No doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all
      his faculties. And yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention
      and renew his interest. I wish that he were here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>October</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;All day today the rain poured down,
      rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict
      out upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his
      crimes, he has suffered something to atone for them. And then I thought
      of that other one&mdash;the face in the cab, the figure against the moon.
      Was he also out in that deluged&mdash;the unseen watcher, the man of
      darkness? In the evening I put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the
      sodden moor, full of dark imaginings, the rain beating upon my face and
      the wind whistling about my ears. God help those who wander into the
      great mire now, for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found
      the black tor upon which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its
      craggy summit I looked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain
      squalls drifted across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured
      clouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in grey wreaths down the
      sides of the fantastic hills. In the distant hollow on the left, half
      hidden by the mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose above
      the trees. They were the only signs of human life which I could see, save
      only those prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the
      hills. Nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom I had seen on
      the same spot two nights before.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his dog-cart
      over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of
      Foulmire. He has been very attentive to us, and hardly a day has passed
      that he has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on. He
      insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart, and he gave me a lift
      homeward. I found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little
      spaniel. It had wandered on to the moor and had never come back. I gave
      him such consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the Grimpen
      Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Mortimer,&rdquo; said I as we jolted along the rough road, &ldquo;I
      suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom
      you do not know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly any, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are L. L.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom I
      can&rsquo;t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose
      initials are those. Wait a bit though,&rdquo; he added after a pause. &ldquo;There is
      Laura Lyons&mdash;her initials are L. L.&mdash;but she lives in Coombe
      Tracey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is Frankland&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Old Frankland the crank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching on the
      moor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The fault from what I
      hear may not have been entirely on one side. Her father refused to have
      anything to do with her because she had married without his consent and
      perhaps for one or two other reasons as well. So, between the old sinner
      and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does she live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be more, for
      his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she may have deserved
      one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad. Her story got about,
      and several of the people here did something to enable her to earn an
      honest living. Stapleton did for one, and Sir Charles for another. I gave
      a trifle myself. It was to set her up in a typewriting business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to satisfy his
      curiosity without telling him too much, for there is no reason why we
      should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow morning I shall find my
      way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of equivocal
      reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing one incident
      in this chain of mysteries. I am certainly developing the wisdom of the
      serpent, for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent
      I asked him casually to what type Frankland&rsquo;s skull belonged, and so heard
      nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive. I have not lived for
      years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and
      melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just now, which
      gives me one more strong card which I can play in due time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played écarté
      afterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the library, and I took
      the chance to ask him a few questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;has this precious relation of yours departed, or is he
      still lurking out yonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has brought
      nothing but trouble here! I&rsquo;ve not heard of him since I left out food for
      him last, and that was three days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see him then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he was certainly there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at Barrymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that there is another man then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know of him then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He&rsquo;s in hiding, too, but
      he&rsquo;s not a convict as far as I can make out. I don&rsquo;t like it, Dr. Watson&mdash;I
      tell you straight, sir, that I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; He spoke with a sudden
      passion of earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter but that
      of your master. I have come here with no object except to help him. Tell
      me, frankly, what it is that you don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst or found
      it difficult to express his own feelings in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all these goings-on, sir,&rdquo; he cried at last, waving his hand towards
      the rain-lashed window which faced the moor. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s foul play somewhere,
      and there&rsquo;s black villainy brewing, to that I&rsquo;ll swear! Very glad I should
      be, sir, to see Sir Henry on his way back to London again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is it that alarms you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at Sir Charles&rsquo;s death! That was bad enough, for all that the
      coroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night. There&rsquo;s not a man
      would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it. Look at this stranger
      hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! What&rsquo;s he waiting for? What
      does it mean? It means no good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and
      very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry&rsquo;s new
      servants are ready to take over the Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about this stranger,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Can you tell me anything about him?
      What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or what he was doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing away. At
      first he thought that he was the police, but soon he found that he had
      some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he was, as far as he could see,
      but what he was doing he could not make out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where did he say that he lived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among the old houses on the hillside&mdash;the stone huts where the old
      folk used to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how about his food?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings all
      he needs. I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what he wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some other time.&rdquo; When
      the butler had gone I walked over to the black window, and I looked
      through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline of
      the wind-swept trees. It is a wild night indoors, and what must it be in a
      stone hut upon the moor. What passion of hatred can it be which leads a
      man to lurk in such a place at such a time! And what deep and earnest
      purpose can he have which calls for such a trial! There, in that hut upon
      the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has vexed me
      so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have passed before I have
      done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery.

<h3><a name="chap11"></a>Chapter 11.<br/>
The Man on the Tor</h3>

    <p>
      The extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter has brought
      my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time when these strange
      events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion. The
      incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my recollection,
      and I can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time. I
      start them from the day which succeeded that upon which I had established
      two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons of Coombe
      Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made an appointment with
      him at the very place and hour that he met his death, the other that the
      lurking man upon the moor was to be found among the stone huts upon the
      hillside. With these two facts in my possession I felt that either my
      intelligence or my courage must be deficient if I could not throw some
      further light upon these dark places.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about Mrs.
      Lyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remained with him at cards
      until it was very late. At breakfast, however, I informed him about my
      discovery and asked him whether he would care to accompany me to Coombe
      Tracey. At first he was very eager to come, but on second thoughts it
      seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might be better. The
      more formal we made the visit the less information we might obtain. I left
      Sir Henry behind, therefore, not without some prickings of conscience, and
      drove off upon my new quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses, and I
      made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate. I had no
      difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and well appointed. A
      maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I entered the sitting-room a
      lady, who was sitting before a Remington typewriter, sprang up with a
      pleasant smile of welcome. Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was
      a stranger, and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme beauty. Her
      eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks, though
      considerably freckled, were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the
      brunette, the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose.
      Admiration was, I repeat, the first impression. But the second was
      criticism. There was something subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness
      of expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lip which
      marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are afterthoughts. At the
      moment I was simply conscious that I was in the presence of a very
      handsome woman, and that she was asking me the reasons for my visit. I had
      not quite understood until that instant how delicate my mission was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the pleasure,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;of knowing your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it. &ldquo;There is
      nothing in common between my father and me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I owe him nothing,
      and his friends are not mine. If it were not for the late Sir Charles
      Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have starved for all that
      my father cared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here to
      see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The freckles started out on the lady&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I tell you about him?&rdquo; she asked, and her fingers played
      nervously over the stops of her typewriter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew him, did you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. If I am able
      to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took in my
      unhappy situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you correspond with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the object of these questions?&rdquo; she asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I should ask
      them here than that the matter should pass outside our control.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she looked up
      with something reckless and defiant in her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll answer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What are your questions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you correspond with Sir Charles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and
      his generosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you the dates of those letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever met him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a very
      retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know enough
      about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to help
      me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir
      Charles&rsquo;s. He was exceedingly kind, and it was through him that Sir
      Charles learned about my affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his almoner
      upon several occasions, so the lady&rsquo;s statement bore the impress of truth
      upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?&rdquo; I continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again. &ldquo;Really, sir, this is a very
      extraordinary question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I answer, certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on the very day of Sir Charles&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before me. Her
      dry lips could not speak the &ldquo;No&rdquo; which I saw rather than heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely your memory deceives you,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I could even quote a passage
      of your letter. It ran &lsquo;Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this
      letter, and be at the gate by ten o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a supreme
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no such thing as a gentleman?&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do Sir Charles an injustice. He <i>did</i> burn the letter. But sometimes a
      letter may be legible even when burned. You acknowledge now that you wrote
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did write it,&rdquo; she cried, pouring out her soul in a torrent of
      words. &ldquo;I did write it. Why should I deny it? I have no reason to be
      ashamed of it. I wished him to help me. I believed that if I had an
      interview I could gain his help, so I asked him to meet me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why at such an hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I had only just learned that he was going to London next day and
      might be away for months. There were reasons why I could not get there
      earlier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what happened when you did get there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Lyons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went. Something
      intervened to prevent my going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir Charles at the
      very hour and place at which he met his death, but you deny that you kept
      the appointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get past that
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Lyons,&rdquo; said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive interview,
      &ldquo;you are taking a very great responsibility and putting yourself in a very
      false position by not making an absolutely clean breast of all that you
      know. If I have to call in the aid of the police you will find how
      seriously you are compromised. If your position is innocent, why did you
      in the first instance deny having written to Sir Charles upon that date?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and
      that I might find myself involved in a scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your
      letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have read the letter you will know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say that I had read all the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You quoted some of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned and it
      was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that you were so
      pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he received on
      the day of his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is a very private one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my unhappy history
      you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I abhor.
      The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the possibility that
      he may force me to live with him. At the time that I wrote this letter to
      Sir Charles I had learned that there was a prospect of my regaining my
      freedom if certain expenses could be met. It meant everything to me&mdash;peace
      of mind, happiness, self-respect&mdash;everything. I knew Sir Charles&rsquo;s
      generosity, and I thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he
      would help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how is it that you did not go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I received help in the interval from another source.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman&rsquo;s story hung coherently together, and all my questions were
      unable to shake it. I could only check it by finding if she had, indeed,
      instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of
      the tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been to
      Baskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be necessary to
      take her there, and could not have returned to Coombe Tracey until the
      early hours of the morning. Such an excursion could not be kept secret.
      The probability was, therefore, that she was telling the truth, or, at
      least, a part of the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened. Once
      again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every
      path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. And yet the more
      I thought of the lady&rsquo;s face and of her manner the more I felt that
      something was being held back from me. Why should she turn so pale? Why
      should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her? Why
      should she have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy? Surely the
      explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she would have me
      believe. For the moment I could proceed no farther in that direction, but
      must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought for among the
      stone huts upon the moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was a most vague direction. I realised it as I drove back and
      noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people. Barrymore&rsquo;s
      only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of these abandoned
      huts, and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout the length and
      breadth of the moor. But I had my own experience for a guide since it had
      shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of the Black Tor. That,
      then, should be the centre of my search. From there I should explore every
      hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right one. If this man were
      inside it I should find out from his own lips, at the point of my revolver
      if necessary, who he was and why he had dogged us so long. He might slip
      away from us in the crowd of Regent Street, but it would puzzle him to do
      so upon the lonely moor. On the other hand, if I should find the hut and
      its tenant should not be within it I must remain there, however long the
      vigil, until he returned. Holmes had missed him in London. It would indeed
      be a triumph for me if I could run him to earth where my master had
      failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now at last
      it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was none other than
      Mr. Frankland, who was standing, grey-whiskered and red-faced, outside the
      gate of his garden, which opened on to the highroad along which I
      travelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day, Dr. Watson,&rdquo; cried he with unwonted good humour, &ldquo;you must
      really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and to
      congratulate me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what I had
      heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was anxious to send Perkins
      and the wagonette home, and the opportunity was a good one. I alighted and
      sent a message to Sir Henry that I should walk over in time for dinner.
      Then I followed Frankland into his dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great day for me, sir&mdash;one of the red-letter days of my
      life,&rdquo; he cried with many chuckles. &ldquo;I have brought off a double event. I
      mean to teach them in these parts that law is law, and that there is a man
      here who does not fear to invoke it. I have established a right of way
      through the centre of old Middleton&rsquo;s park, slap across it, sir, within a
      hundred yards of his own front door. What do you think of that? We&rsquo;ll
      teach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of
      the commoners, confound them! And I&rsquo;ve closed the wood where the
      Fernworthy folk used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that
      there are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they like
      with their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr. Watson, and
      both in my favour. I haven&rsquo;t had such a day since I had Sir John Morland
      for trespass because he shot in his own warren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How on earth did you do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay
      reading&mdash;Frankland <i>v</i>. Morland, Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench.
      It cost me £200, but I got my verdict.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it do you any good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the matter.
      I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no doubt, for example,
      that the Fernworthy people will burn me in effigy tonight. I told the
      police last time they did it that they should stop these disgraceful
      exhibitions. The County Constabulary is in a scandalous state, sir, and it
      has not afforded me the protection to which I am entitled. The case of
      Frankland <i>v</i>. Regina will bring the matter before the attention of the
      public. I told them that they would have occasion to regret their
      treatment of me, and already my words have come true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man put on a very knowing expression. &ldquo;Because I could tell them
      what they are dying to know; but nothing would induce me to help the
      rascals in any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get away from
      his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it. I had seen enough
      of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong
      sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some poaching case, no doubt?&rdquo; said I with an indifferent manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that! What about
      the convict on the moor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stared. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you know where he is?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I could help
      the police to lay their hands on him. Has it never struck you that the way
      to catch that man was to find out where he got his food and so trace it to
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth. &ldquo;No
      doubt,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes
      him his food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in the power of
      this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took a weight from my
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child. I
      see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. He passes along the
      same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to the
      convict?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of interest. A
      child! Barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy. It was
      on his track, and not upon the convict&rsquo;s, that Frankland had stumbled. If
      I could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But
      incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of
      the moorland shepherds taking out his father&rsquo;s dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat.
      His eyes looked malignantly at me, and his grey whiskers bristled like
      those of an angry cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir!&rdquo; said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching moor. &ldquo;Do
      you see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see the low hill beyond
      with the thornbush upon it? It is the stoniest part of the whole moor. Is
      that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station? Your
      suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the facts. My
      submission pleased him and led him to further confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come to an
      opinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his bundle. Every day,
      and sometimes twice a day, I have been able&mdash;but wait a moment, Dr.
      Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment something
      moving upon that hillside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot
      against the dull green and grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sir, come!&rdquo; cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. &ldquo;You will see with
      your own eyes and judge for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon
      the flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a
      cry of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle upon his
      shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached the crest I saw the
      ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky.
      He looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air, as one who dreads
      pursuit. Then he vanished over the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But not one
      word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr. Watson.
      Not a word! You understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have treated me shamefully&mdash;shamefully. When the facts come out
      in Frankland <i>v</i>. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of indignation
      will run through the country. Nothing would induce me to help the police
      in any way. For all they cared it might have been me, instead of my
      effigy, which these rascals burned at the stake. Surely you are not going!
      You will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him from
      his announced intention of walking home with me. I kept the road as long
      as his eye was on me, and then I struck off across the moor and made for
      the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared. Everything was working
      in my favour, and I swore that it should not be through lack of energy or
      perseverance that I should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the hill, and the
      long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one side and grey shadow
      on the other. A haze lay low upon the farthest sky-line, out of which
      jutted the fantastic shapes of Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the wide
      expanse there was no sound and no movement. One great grey bird, a gull or
      curlew, soared aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be the only
      living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it.
      The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery and urgency of
      my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy was nowhere to be seen.
      But down beneath me in a cleft of the hills there was a circle of the old
      stone huts, and in the middle of them there was one which retained
      sufficient roof to act as a screen against the weather. My heart leaped
      within me as I saw it. This must be the burrow where the stranger lurked.
      At last my foot was on the threshold of his hiding place&mdash;his secret
      was within my grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do when with
      poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself that the
      place had indeed been used as a habitation. A vague pathway among the
      boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a door. All was
      silent within. The unknown might be lurking there, or he might be prowling
      on the moor. My nerves tingled with the sense of adventure. Throwing aside
      my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and, walking
      swiftly up to the door, I looked in. The place was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false scent. This
      was certainly where the man lived. Some blankets rolled in a waterproof
      lay upon that very stone slab upon which Neolithic man had once slumbered.
      The ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate. Beside it lay some
      cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water. A litter of empty tins
      showed that the place had been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my
      eyes became accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and a half-full
      bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of the hut a flat
      stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood a small cloth
      bundle&mdash;the same, no doubt, which I had seen through the telescope
      upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained a loaf of bread, a tinned
      tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. As I set it down again, after
      having examined it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a
      sheet of paper with writing upon it. I raised it, and this was what I
      read, roughly scrawled in pencil: &ldquo;Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the
      meaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who was
      being dogged by this secret man. He had not followed me himself, but he
      had set an agent&mdash;the boy, perhaps&mdash;upon my track, and this was
      his report. Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor
      which had not been observed and reported. Always there was this feeling of
      an unseen force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and
      delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment
      that one realised that one was indeed entangled in its meshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was one report there might be others, so I looked round the hut
      in search of them. There was no trace, however, of anything of the kind,
      nor could I discover any sign which might indicate the character or
      intentions of the man who lived in this singular place, save that he must
      be of Spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life. When I
      thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof I understood how
      strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that
      inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by chance our
      guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut until I knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet and
      gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant pools
      which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There were the two towers of
      Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the
      village of Grimpen. Between the two, behind the hill, was the house of the
      Stapletons. All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening
      light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of
      Nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview
      which every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves but a fixed
      purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with sombre
      patience for the coming of its tenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of a boot
      striking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming nearer and
      nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in my
      pocket, determined not to discover myself until I had an opportunity of
      seeing something of the stranger. There was a long pause which showed that
      he had stopped. Then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell
      across the opening of the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,&rdquo; said a well-known voice. &ldquo;I
      really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in.&rdquo;
     </p>

Death on the Moor</h3>

    <p>
      For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my ears. Then
      my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight of
      responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul. That cold,
      incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holmes!&rdquo; I cried&mdash;&ldquo;Holmes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and please be careful with the revolver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone outside,
      his grey eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished
      features. He was thin and worn, but clear and alert, his keen face bronzed
      by the sun and roughened by the wind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he
      looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with
      that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one of his
      characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as
      perfect as if he were in Baker Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was more glad to see anyone in my life,&rdquo; said I as I wrung him by
      the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or more astonished, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must confess to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no idea that
      you had found my occasional retreat, still less that you were inside it,
      until I was within twenty paces of the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My footprint, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your footprint
      amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriously desire to deceive
      me you must change your tobacconist; for when I see the stub of a
      cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know that my friend Watson is
      in the neighbourhood. You will see it there beside the path. You threw it
      down, no doubt, at that supreme moment when you charged into the empty
      hut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought as much&mdash;and knowing your admirable tenacity I was
      convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting
      for the tenant to return. So you actually thought that I was the
      criminal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent, Watson! And how did you localise me? You saw me, perhaps, on
      the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the
      moon to rise behind me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw you then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make it out
      when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.&rdquo; He rose and peeped
      into the hut. &ldquo;Ha, I see that Cartwright has brought up some supplies.
      What&rsquo;s this paper? So you have been to Coombe Tracey, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done! Our researches have evidently been running on parallel lines,
      and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly full
      knowledge of the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the
      responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my nerves.
      But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have you been
      doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that case of
      blackmailing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was what I wished you to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!&rdquo; I cried with some bitterness.
      &ldquo;I think that I have deserved better at your hands, Holmes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other
      cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a trick
      upon you. In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did it, and it
      was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down
      and examine the matter for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is
      confident that my point of view would have been the same as yours, and my
      presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their
      guard. As it is, I have been able to get about as I could not possibly
      have done had I been living in the Hall, and I remain an unknown factor in
      the business, ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why keep me in the dark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led to
      my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something, or in your
      kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an
      unnecessary risk would be run. I brought Cartwright down with me&mdash;you
      remember the little chap at the express office&mdash;and he has seen after
      my simple wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar. What does man want
      more? He has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of
      feet, and both have been invaluable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my reports have all been wasted!&rdquo;&mdash;My voice trembled as I
      recalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure
      you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day upon
      their way. I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the
      intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon
      me, but the warmth of Holmes&rsquo;s praise drove my anger from my mind. I felt
      also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was really
      best for our purpose that I should not have known that he was upon the
      moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face. &ldquo;And now
      tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons&mdash;it was not
      difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone, for I
      am already aware that she is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might be
      of service to us in the matter. In fact, if you had not gone today it is
      exceedingly probable that I should have gone tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had turned
      chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There, sitting together in
      the twilight, I told Holmes of my conversation with the lady. So
      interested was he that I had to repeat some of it twice before he was
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is most important,&rdquo; said he when I had concluded. &ldquo;It fills up a gap
      which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair. You are
      aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists between this lady and the man
      Stapleton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know of a close intimacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write, there is a
      complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a very powerful weapon
      into our hands. If I could only use it to detach his wife&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you have
      given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is in reality his
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he have
      permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Henry&rsquo;s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir Henry.
      He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to her, as you
      have yourself observed. I repeat that the lady is his wife and not his
      sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why this elaborate deception?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the
      character of a free woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and
      centred upon the naturalist. In that impassive colourless man, with his
      straw hat and his butterfly-net, I seemed to see something terrible&mdash;a
      creature of infinite patience and craft, with a smiling face and a
      murderous heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is he, then, who is our enemy&mdash;it is he who dogged us in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I read the riddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the warning&mdash;it must have come from her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed, loomed
      through the darkness which had girt me so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman is his
      wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of
      autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare say he
      has many a time regretted it since. He was once a schoolmaster in the
      north of England. Now, there is no one more easy to trace than a
      schoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies by which one may identify any
      man who has been in the profession. A little investigation showed me that
      a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances, and that the man
      who had owned it&mdash;the name was different&mdash;had disappeared with
      his wife. The descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man was
      devoted to entomology the identification was complete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons come in?&rdquo;
       I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a
      light. Your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much. I
      did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband. In
      that case, regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt
      upon becoming his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when she is undeceived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first duty to
      see her&mdash;both of us&mdash;tomorrow. Don&rsquo;t you think, Watson, that you
      are away from your charge rather long? Your place should be at Baskerville
      Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled upon
      the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One last question, Holmes,&rdquo; I said as I rose. &ldquo;Surely there is no need of
      secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it all? What is he
      after?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes&rsquo;s voice sank as he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is murder, Watson&mdash;refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. Do
      not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even as his are
      upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already almost at my mercy. There
      is but one danger which can threaten us. It is that he should strike
      before we are ready to do so. Another day&mdash;two at the most&mdash;and
      I have my case complete, but until then guard your charge as closely as
      ever a fond mother watched her ailing child. Your mission today has
      justified itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his
      side. Hark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A terrible scream&mdash;a prolonged yell of horror and anguish&mdash;burst
      out of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood to ice
      in my veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; I gasped. &ldquo;What is it? What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline at the
      door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward, his face
      peering into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out
      from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears,
      nearer, louder, more urgent than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his voice
      that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul. &ldquo;Where is it, Watson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, I think.&rdquo; I pointed into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the agonised cry swept through the silent night, louder and much
      nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered
      rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low,
      constant murmur of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hound!&rdquo; cried Holmes. &ldquo;Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if we are
      too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at his
      heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front
      of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy thud. We
      halted and listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the
      windless night.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. He
      stamped his feet upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, surely not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes of
      abandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has happened we&rsquo;ll
      avenge him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing our
      way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes,
      heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come. At
      every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were thick
      upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you see anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, hark, what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our left! On
      that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked a
      stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was spread-eagled some dark,
      irregular object. As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into a
      definite shape. It was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground, the
      head doubled under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the
      body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault. So
      grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant realise that
      that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a whisper, not a rustle,
      rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped. Holmes laid his hand
      upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror. The gleam of
      the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the
      ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim.
      And it shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint
      within us&mdash;the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed
      suit&mdash;the very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had
      seen him in Baker Street. We caught the one clear glimpse of it, and then
      the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out of our
      souls. Holmes groaned, and his face glimmered white through the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brute! The brute!&rdquo; I cried with clenched hands. &ldquo;Oh Holmes, I shall
      never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case well
      rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my client. It is the
      greatest blow which has befallen me in my career. But how could I know&mdash;how
      <i>could</i> I know&mdash;that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the
      face of all my warnings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we should have heard his screams&mdash;my God, those screams!&mdash;and
      yet have been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound which
      drove him to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks at this
      instant. And Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer for this deed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been murdered&mdash;the
      one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought to
      be supernatural, the other driven to his end in his wild flight to escape
      from it. But now we have to prove the connection between the man and the
      beast. Save from what we heard, we cannot even swear to the existence of
      the latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall. But, by
      heavens, cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power before another
      day is past!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,
      overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought all
      our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then as the moon rose we
      climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had fallen, and
      from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor, half silver and half
      gloom. Far away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady
      yellow light was shining. It could only come from the lonely abode of the
      Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we not seize him at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the last
      degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we make one
      false move the villain may escape us yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only perform
      the last offices to our poor friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the
      body, black and clear against the silvered stones. The agony of those
      contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the way to the
      Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing and
      laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern, self-contained
      friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the baronet&mdash;it is&mdash;why, it is my neighbour, the
      convict!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that dripping beard
      was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There could be no doubt about the
      beetling forehead, the sunken animal eyes. It was indeed the same face
      which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the rock&mdash;the
      face of Selden, the criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the baronet
      had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to Barrymore. Barrymore
      had passed it on in order to help Selden in his escape. Boots, shirt, cap&mdash;it
      was all Sir Henry&rsquo;s. The tragedy was still black enough, but this man had
      at least deserved death by the laws of his country. I told Holmes how the
      matter stood, my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the clothes have been the poor devil&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is clear
      enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of Sir Henry&rsquo;s&mdash;the
      boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all probability&mdash;and so
      ran this man down. There is one very singular thing, however: How came
      Selden, in the darkness, to know that the hound was on his trail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He heard him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict
      into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming
      wildly for help. By his cries he must have run a long way after he knew
      the animal was on his track. How did he know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all our
      conjectures are correct&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose that it
      does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would not let it go
      unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think that we
      shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain
      forever a mystery. The question now is, what shall we do with this poor
      wretch&rsquo;s body? We cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with
      the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far. Halloa,
      Watson, what&rsquo;s this? It&rsquo;s the man himself, by all that&rsquo;s wonderful and
      audacious! Not a word to show your suspicions&mdash;not a word, or my
      plans crumble to the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow of
      a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper shape
      and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped when he saw us, and then
      came on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dr. Watson, that&rsquo;s not you, is it? You are the last man that I
      should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night. But,
      dear me, what&rsquo;s this? Somebody hurt? Not&mdash;don&rsquo;t tell me that it is
      our friend Sir Henry!&rdquo; He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. I
      heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort he had
      overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked sharply from
      Holmes to me. &ldquo;Dear me! What a very shocking affair! How did he die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks. My friend
      and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy about Sir
      Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why about Sir Henry in particular?&rdquo; I could not help asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did not come I
      was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I heard
      cries upon the moor. By the way&rdquo;&mdash;his eyes darted again from my face
      to Holmes&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;did you hear anything else besides a cry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Holmes; &ldquo;did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound,
      and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor. I was wondering
      if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We heard nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is your theory of this poor fellow&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head.
      He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over
      here and broken his neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems the most reasonable theory,&rdquo; said Stapleton, and he gave a
      sigh which I took to indicate his relief. &ldquo;What do you think about it, Mr.
      Sherlock Holmes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend bowed his compliments. &ldquo;You are quick at identification,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came down. You
      are in time to see a tragedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend&rsquo;s explanation will cover the
      facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me
      tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you return tomorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my intention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have
      puzzled us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An investigator
      needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not been a satisfactory
      case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner. Stapleton
      still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it would give
      my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it. I think
      that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton&rsquo;s offer of hospitality, Holmes
      and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to return alone.
      Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad moor, and
      behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where
      the man was lying who had come so horribly to his end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re at close grips at last,&rdquo; said Holmes as we walked together across
      the moor. &ldquo;What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself together in
      the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that the
      wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot. I told you in London, Watson,
      and I tell you now again, that we have never had a foeman more worthy of
      our steel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry that he has seen you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows
      you are here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to desperate
      measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be too confident in
      his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we not arrest him at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your instinct is
      always to do something energetic. But supposing, for argument&rsquo;s sake, that
      we had him arrested tonight, what on earth the better off should we be for
      that? We could prove nothing against him. There&rsquo;s the devilish cunning of
      it! If he were acting through a human agent we could get some evidence,
      but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not
      help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely we have a case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a shadow of one&mdash;only surmise and conjecture. We should be
      laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Sir Charles&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died of sheer
      fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how are we to get twelve
      stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are there of a hound? Where are the
      marks of its fangs? Of course we know that a hound does not bite a dead
      body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the brute overtook him. But
      we have to prove all this, and we are not in a position to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, tonight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct connection
      between the hound and the man&rsquo;s death. We never saw the hound. We heard
      it, but we could not prove that it was running upon this man&rsquo;s trail.
      There is a complete absence of motive. No, my dear fellow; we must
      reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present, and that
      it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you propose to do so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when the
      position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own plan as well.
      Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I hope before the day is
      past to have the upper hand at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in thought, as
      far as the Baskerville gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word, Watson.
      Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that Selden&rsquo;s death
      was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will have a better nerve for
      the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow, when he is engaged, if
      I remember your report aright, to dine with these people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so am I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be easily
      arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think that we are both
      ready for our suppers.&rdquo;
     </p>

Fixing the Nets</h3>

    <p>
      Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes, for he
      had for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down
      from London. He did raise his eyebrows, however, when he found that my
      friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence.
      Between us we soon supplied his wants, and then over a belated supper we
      explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed desirable
      that he should know. But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the
      news to Barrymore and his wife. To him it may have been an unmitigated
      relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. To all the world he was the
      man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her he always remained
      the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the child who had clung to her
      hand. Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to mourn him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in the
      morning,&rdquo; said the baronet. &ldquo;I guess I should have some credit, for I have
      kept my promise. If I hadn&rsquo;t sworn not to go about alone I might have had
      a more lively evening, for I had a message from Stapleton asking me over
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,&rdquo; said
      Holmes drily. &ldquo;By the way, I don&rsquo;t suppose you appreciate that we have
      been mourning over you as having broken your neck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Henry opened his eyes. &ldquo;How was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your servant who
      gave them to him may get into trouble with the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s lucky for him&mdash;in fact, it&rsquo;s lucky for all of you, since you
      are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not sure that as
      a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole
      household. Watson&rsquo;s reports are most incriminating documents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how about the case?&rdquo; asked the baronet. &ldquo;Have you made anything out
      of the tangle? I don&rsquo;t know that Watson and I are much the wiser since we
      came down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation rather more
      clear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly difficult and most
      complicated business. There are several points upon which we still want
      light&mdash;but it is coming all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We heard the
      hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition. I
      had something to do with dogs when I was out West, and I know one when I
      hear one. If you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain I&rsquo;ll be ready
      to swear you are the greatest detective of all time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me
      your help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you tell me to do I will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without always
      asking the reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will do this I think the chances are that our little problem will
      soon be solved. I have no doubt&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air. The
      lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so still that it might
      have been that of a clear-cut classical statue, a personification of
      alertness and expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; we both cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal
      emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes shone with amused
      exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur,&rdquo; said he as he waved his hand
      towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall. &ldquo;Watson
      won&rsquo;t allow that I know anything of art but that is mere jealousy because
      our views upon the subject differ. Now, these are a really very fine
      series of portraits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say so,&rdquo; said Sir Henry, glancing with some
      surprise at my friend. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to know much about these things,
      and I&rsquo;d be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture. I
      didn&rsquo;t know that you found time for such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That&rsquo;s a Kneller,
      I&rsquo;ll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the stout
      gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are all family
      portraits, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my lessons
      fairly well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the gentleman with the telescope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the West
      Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William
      Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons under
      Pitt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this Cavalier opposite to me&mdash;the one with the black velvet and
      the lace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all the
      mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the Baskervilles.
      We&rsquo;re not likely to forget him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough, but I
      dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes. I had pictured him as
      a more robust and ruffianly person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the date, 1647,
      are on the back of the canvas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to
      have a fascination for him, and his eyes were continually fixed upon it
      during supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his
      room, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts. He led me back
      into the banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he held it
      up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see anything there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the white lace
      collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed between them. It
      was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim, hard, and stern, with a
      firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly intolerant eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it like anyone you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!&rdquo; He stood upon a chair,
      and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved his right arm over
      the broad hat and round the long ringlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; I cried in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces and not
      their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal investigator that
      he should see through a disguise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears to be
      both physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits is enough to
      convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. The fellow is a
      Baskerville&mdash;that is evident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With designs upon the succession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our most
      obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him, and I dare swear
      that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering in our net as helpless as
      one of his own butterflies. A pin, a cork, and a card, and we add him to
      the Baker Street collection!&rdquo; He burst into one of his rare fits of
      laughter as he turned away from the picture. I have not heard him laugh
      often, and it has always boded ill to somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier still, for I
      saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we should have a full day today,&rdquo; he remarked, and he rubbed his
      hands with the joy of action. &ldquo;The nets are all in place, and the drag is
      about to begin. We&rsquo;ll know before the day is out whether we have caught
      our big, lean-jawed pike, or whether he has got through the meshes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been on the moor already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death of
      Selden. I think I can promise that none of you will be troubled in the
      matter. And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright, who
      would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut, as a dog does at
      his master&rsquo;s grave, if I had not set his mind at rest about my safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the next move?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Holmes,&rdquo; said the baronet. &ldquo;You look like a general who is
      planning a battle with his chief of the staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so do I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our friends the
      Stapletons tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people, and I am
      sure that they would be very glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that Watson and I must go to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present
      juncture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baronet&rsquo;s face perceptibly lengthened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped that you were going to see me through this business. The Hall and
      the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I tell
      you. You can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have come
      with you, but that urgent business required us to be in town. We hope very
      soon to return to Devonshire. Will you remember to give them that
      message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you insist upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no alternative, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw by the baronet&rsquo;s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he
      regarded as our desertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you desire to go?&rdquo; he asked coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey, but
      Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you.
      Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that you regret that
      you cannot come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a good mind to go to London with you,&rdquo; said the baronet. &ldquo;Why
      should I stay here alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word that you
      would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then, I&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send back your
      trap, however, and let them know that you intend to walk home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To walk across the moor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every confidence in
      your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but it is essential that
      you should do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction
      save along the straight path which leads from Merripit House to the
      Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do just what you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as
      possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that Holmes
      had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate
      next day. It had not crossed my mind however, that he would wish me to go
      with him, nor could I understand how we could both be absent at a moment
      which he himself declared to be critical. There was nothing for it,
      however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful friend,
      and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of Coombe Tracey
      and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A small boy was
      waiting upon the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any orders, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you arrive you
      will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name, to say that if he
      finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is to send it by registered
      post to Baker Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ask at the station office if there is a message for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive five-forty.
      Lestrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the
      professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now, Watson, I
      think that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your
      acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use the baronet
      in order to convince the Stapletons that we were really gone, while we
      should actually return at the instant when we were likely to be needed.
      That telegram from London, if mentioned by Sir Henry to the Stapletons,
      must remove the last suspicions from their minds. Already I seemed to see
      our nets drawing closer around that lean-jawed pike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his
      interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the late
      Sir Charles Baskerville,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My friend here, Dr. Watson, has
      informed me of what you have communicated, and also of what you have
      withheld in connection with that matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I withheld?&rdquo; she asked defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate at ten
      o&rsquo;clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his death. You have
      withheld what the connection is between these events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no connection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one. But I
      think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection, after all. I
      wish to be perfectly frank with you, Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as
      one of murder, and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr.
      Stapleton but his wife as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady sprang from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for his sister
      is really his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms of her
      chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure of
      her grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife!&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;His wife! He is not a married man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come prepared to do so,&rdquo; said Holmes, drawing several papers from
      his pocket. &ldquo;Here is a photograph of the couple taken in York four years
      ago. It is indorsed &lsquo;Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,&rsquo; but you will have no
      difficulty in recognizing him, and her also, if you know her by sight.
      Here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and
      Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time kept St. Oliver&rsquo;s private school. Read
      them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid face of
      a desperate woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this man had offered me marriage on condition
      that I could get a divorce from my husband. He has lied to me, the
      villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of truth has he ever told
      me. And why&mdash;why? I imagined that all was for my own sake. But now I
      see that I was never anything but a tool in his hands. Why should I
      preserve faith with him who never kept any with me? Why should I try to
      shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what you
      like, and there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear to
      you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of any harm
      to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entirely believe you, madam,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes. &ldquo;The recital of
      these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps it will make it
      easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can check me if I make any
      material mistake. The sending of this letter was suggested to you by
      Stapleton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He dictated it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from
      Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping the
      appointment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other man should
      find the money for such an object, and that though he was a poor man
      himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles which
      divided us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heard nothing
      until you read the reports of the death in the paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with Sir
      Charles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and that I
      should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He frightened me into
      remaining silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. But you had your suspicions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated and looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But if he had kept faith with me I should always
      have done so with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,&rdquo; said Sherlock
      Holmes. &ldquo;You have had him in your power and he knew it, and yet you are
      alive. You have been walking for some months very near to the edge of a
      precipice. We must wish you good-morning now, Mrs. Lyons, and it is
      probable that you will very shortly hear from us again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins away
      in front of us,&rdquo; said Holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of the
      express from town. &ldquo;I shall soon be in the position of being able to put
      into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational
      crimes of modern times. Students of criminology will remember the
      analogous incidents in Godno, in Little Russia, in the year &rsquo;66, and of
      course there are the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case
      possesses some features which are entirely its own. Even now we have no
      clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very much surprised
      if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The London express came roaring into the station, and a small, wiry
      bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We all three
      shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way in which Lestrade
      gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the days when
      they had first worked together. I could well remember the scorn which the
      theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything good?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The biggest thing for years,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;We have two hours before we
      need think of starting. I think we might employ it in getting some dinner
      and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out of your throat by
      giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor. Never been there?
      Ah, well, I don&rsquo;t suppose you will forget your first visit.&rdquo;

The Hound of the Baskervilles</h3>

    <p>
      One of Sherlock Holmes&rsquo;s defects&mdash;if, indeed, one may call it a
      defect&mdash;was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full
      plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment. Partly it
      came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and
      surprise those who were around him. Partly also from his professional
      caution, which urged him never to take any chances. The result, however,
      was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants. I
      had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long drive
      in the darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we were
      about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing, and I
      could only surmise what his course of action would be. My nerves thrilled
      with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and the dark,
      void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we were back
      upon the moor once again. Every stride of the horses and every turn of the
      wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired
      wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our
      nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation. It was a relief to me,
      after that unnatural restraint, when we at last passed Frankland&rsquo;s house
      and knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and to the scene of action.
      We did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of the avenue.
      The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey
      forthwith, while we started to walk to Merripit House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you armed, Lestrade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little detective smiled. &ldquo;As long as I have my trousers I have a
      hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What&rsquo;s the game now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A waiting game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,&rdquo; said the detective with
      a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and at the
      huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire. &ldquo;I see the lights of a
      house ahead of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must request you to
      walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house, but
      Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will do,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;These rocks upon the right make an admirable
      screen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are to wait here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,
      Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson? Can you
      tell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed windows at this
      end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they are the kitchen windows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is certainly the dining-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep forward
      quietly and see what they are doing&mdash;but for heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t let
      them know that they are watched!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded
      the stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached a point whence I
      could look straight through the uncurtained window.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton. They sat
      with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table. Both of
      them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were in front of them.
      Stapleton was talking with animation, but the baronet looked pale and
      distrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened
      moor was weighing heavily upon his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir Henry filled
      his glass again and leaned back in his chair, puffing at his cigar. I
      heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon gravel. The
      steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall under which I
      crouched. Looking over, I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an
      out-house in the corner of the orchard. A key turned in a lock, and as he
      passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from within. He was only a
      minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn once more and he passed
      me and reentered the house. I saw him rejoin his guest, and I crept
      quietly back to where my companions were waiting to tell them what I had
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?&rdquo; Holmes asked when I had
      finished my report.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room except
      the kitchen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot think where she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white
      fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a
      wall on that side of us, low but thick and well defined. The moon shone on
      it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, with the heads of the
      distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. Holmes&rsquo;s face was turned
      towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s moving towards us, Watson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very serious, indeed&mdash;the one thing upon earth which could have
      disarranged my plans. He can&rsquo;t be very long, now. It is already ten
      o&rsquo;clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out
      before the fog is over the path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and bright,
      while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft, uncertain light.
      Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, its serrated roof and bristling
      chimneys hard outlined against the silver-spangled sky. Broad bars of
      golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard and the
      moor. One of them was suddenly shut off. The servants had left the
      kitchen. There only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two
      men, the murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted over
      their cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of the moor
      was drifting closer and closer to the house. Already the first thin wisps
      of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window. The
      farther wall of the orchard was already invisible, and the trees were
      standing out of a swirl of white vapour. As we watched it the fog-wreaths
      came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled slowly into one
      dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange
      ship upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand passionately upon the rock
      in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he isn&rsquo;t out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered. In half
      an hour we won&rsquo;t be able to see our hands in front of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think it would be as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half
      a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea, with the moon
      silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going too far,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;We dare not take the chance of his
      being overtaken before he can reach us. At all costs we must hold our
      ground where we are.&rdquo; He dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the
      ground. &ldquo;Thank God, I think that I hear him coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouching among the
      stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in front of us. The
      steps grew louder, and through the fog, as through a curtain, there
      stepped the man whom we were awaiting. He looked round him in surprise as
      he emerged into the clear, starlit night. Then he came swiftly along the
      path, passed close to where we lay, and went on up the long slope behind
      us. As he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder, like a man
      who is ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol.
      &ldquo;Look out! It&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of
      that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay, and
      we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror was about to break from
      the heart of it. I was at Holmes&rsquo;s elbow, and I glanced for an instant at
      his face. It was pale and exultant, his eyes shining brightly in the
      moonlight. But suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and
      his lips parted in amazement. At the same instant Lestrade gave a yell of
      terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground. I sprang to my
      feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind paralyzed by the dreadful
      shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog. A hound it
      was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes
      have ever seen. Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a
      smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in
      flickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of a disordered brain could
      anything more savage, more appalling, more hellish be conceived than that
      dark form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track,
      following hard upon the footsteps of our friend. So paralyzed were we by
      the apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our
      nerve. Then Holmes and I both fired together, and the creature gave a
      hideous howl, which showed that one at least had hit him. He did not
      pause, however, but bounded onward. Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry
      looking back, his face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in horror,
      glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down. But
      that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the winds. If
      he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound him we could kill
      him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that night. I am reckoned
      fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as much as I outpaced the little
      professional. In front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after
      scream from Sir Henry and the deep roar of the hound. I was in time to see
      the beast spring upon its victim, hurl him to the ground, and worry at his
      throat. But the next instant Holmes had emptied five barrels of his
      revolver into the creature&rsquo;s flank. With a last howl of agony and a
      vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet pawing
      furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped, panting, and
      pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head, but it was useless to
      press the trigger. The giant hound was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his collar, and
      Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was no sign
      of a wound and that the rescue had been in time. Already our friend&rsquo;s
      eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move. Lestrade thrust his
      brandy-flask between the baronet&rsquo;s teeth, and two frightened eyes were
      looking up at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;What was it? What, in heaven&rsquo;s name, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dead, whatever it is,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve laid the family ghost
      once and forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying
      stretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure
      mastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of the two&mdash;gaunt,
      savage, and as large as a small lioness. Even now in the stillness of
      death, the huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the
      small, deep-set, cruel eyes were ringed with fire. I placed my hand upon
      the glowing muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and
      gleamed in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phosphorus,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cunning preparation of it,&rdquo; said Holmes, sniffing at the dead animal.
      &ldquo;There is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent. We
      owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having exposed you to this fright.
      I was prepared for a hound, but not for such a creature as this. And the
      fog gave us little time to receive him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have saved my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for
      anything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures tonight. If you
      will wait, one or other of us will go back with you to the Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale and
      trembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he sat shivering
      with his face buried in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must leave you now,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;The rest of our work must be done,
      and every moment is of importance. We have our case, and now we only want
      our man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thousand to one against our finding him at the house,&rdquo; he
      continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. &ldquo;Those shots
      must have told him that the game was up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He followed the hound to call him off&mdash;of that you may be certain.
      No, no, he&rsquo;s gone by this time! But we&rsquo;ll search the house and make sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to room to
      the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us in the passage.
      There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes caught up the lamp
      and left no corner of the house unexplored. No sign could we see of the
      man whom we were chasing. On the upper floor, however, one of the bedroom
      doors was locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone in here,&rdquo; cried Lestrade. &ldquo;I can hear a movement. Open
      this door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the door just
      over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open. Pistol in hand,
      we all three rushed into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom
      we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an object so strange and so
      unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls were lined
      by a number of glass-topped cases full of that collection of butterflies
      and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of this complex
      and dangerous man. In the centre of this room there was an upright beam,
      which had been placed at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten
      baulk of timber which spanned the roof. To this post a figure was tied, so
      swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to secure it that
      one could not for the moment tell whether it was that of a man or a woman.
      One towel passed round the throat and was secured at the back of the
      pillar. Another covered the lower part of the face, and over it two dark
      eyes&mdash;eyes full of grief and shame and a dreadful questioning&mdash;stared
      back at us. In a minute we had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and
      Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us. As her beautiful head
      fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brute!&rdquo; cried Holmes. &ldquo;Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle! Put her in
      the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he safe?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Has he escaped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot escape us, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the hound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a long sigh of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treated me!&rdquo; She
      shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with horror that they were
      all mottled with bruises. &ldquo;But this is nothing&mdash;nothing! It is my
      mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled. I could endure it all,
      ill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long as I could
      still cling to the hope that I had his love, but now I know that in this
      also I have been his dupe and his tool.&rdquo; She broke into passionate sobbing
      as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bear him no good will, madam,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Tell us then where we
      shall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and so
      atone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is but one place where he can have fled,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;There is
      an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire. It was there that
      he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he might
      have a refuge. That is where he would fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held the lamp
      towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed with fierce
      merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may find his way in, but never out,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How can he see the
      guiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he and I, to mark the
      pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have plucked them out today.
      Then indeed you would have had him at your mercy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had
      lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house while Holmes
      and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville Hall. The story of the
      Stapletons could no longer be withheld from him, but he took the blow
      bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved. But
      the shock of the night&rsquo;s adventures had shattered his nerves, and before
      morning he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of Dr. Mortimer.
      The two of them were destined to travel together round the world before
      Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he had been
      before he became master of that ill-omened estate.
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
      And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative, in
      which I have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague
      surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a manner.
      On the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted and we were
      guided by Mrs. Stapleton to the point where they had found a pathway
      through the bog. It helped us to realise the horror of this woman&rsquo;s life
      when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband&rsquo;s
      track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm, peaty soil
      which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the end of it a small wand
      planted here and there showed where the path zigzagged from tuft to tuft
      of rushes among those green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred
      the way to the stranger. Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an
      odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces, while a false
      step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire,
      which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet. Its tenacious
      grip plucked at our heels as we walked, and when we sank into it it was as
      if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths, so
      grim and purposeful was the clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a
      trace that someone had passed that perilous way before us. From amid a
      tuft of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was
      projecting. Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize
      it, and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set his
      foot upon firm land again. He held an old black boot in the air. &ldquo;Meyers,
      Toronto,&rdquo; was printed on the leather inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is worth a mud bath,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is our friend Sir Henry&rsquo;s missing
      boot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. He retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound upon
      the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still clutching it. And
      he hurled it away at this point of his flight. We know at least that he
      came so far in safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But more than that we were never destined to know, though there was much
      which we might surmise. There was no chance of finding footsteps in the
      mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them, but as we at last
      reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them.
      But no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes. If the earth told a true
      story, then Stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards which he
      struggled through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in the heart of
      the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morass which
      had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is forever buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had hid his
      savage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish
      showed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it were the crumbling
      remains of the cottages of the miners, driven away no doubt by the foul
      reek of the surrounding swamp. In one of these a staple and chain with a
      quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined. A
      skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the <i>débris</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dog!&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor Mortimer will
      never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that this place contains any
      secret which we have not already fathomed. He could hide his hound, but he
      could not hush its voice, and hence came those cries which even in
      daylight were not pleasant to hear. On an emergency he could keep the
      hound in the out-house at Merripit, but it was always a risk, and it was
      only on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end of all his efforts,
      that he dared do it. This paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous
      mixture with which the creature was daubed. It was suggested, of course,
      by the story of the family hell-hound, and by the desire to frighten old
      Sir Charles to death. No wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and
      screamed, even as our friend did, and as we ourselves might have done,
      when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon
      his track. It was a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving
      your victim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire too
      closely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as many have done,
      upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson, and I say it again now, that
      never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is
      lying yonder&rdquo;&mdash;he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse
      of green-splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the
      russet slopes of the moor.

A Retrospection</h3>

    <p>
      It was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy
      night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in Baker
      Street. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to Devonshire he had been
      engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance, in the first of which he
      had exposed the atrocious conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection with the
      famous card scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second he had
      defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge of murder which
      hung over her in connection with the death of her step-daughter, Mlle.
      Carére, the young lady who, as it will be remembered, was found six months
      later alive and married in New York. My friend was in excellent spirits
      over the success which had attended a succession of difficult and
      important cases, so that I was able to induce him to discuss the details
      of the Baskerville mystery. I had waited patiently for the opportunity for
      I was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap, and that his
      clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its present work to dwell
      upon memories of the past. Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer were, however, in
      London, on their way to that long voyage which had been recommended for
      the restoration of his shattered nerves. They had called upon us that very
      afternoon, so that it was natural that the subject should come up for
      discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole course of events,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;from the point of view of the
      man who called himself Stapleton was simple and direct, although to us,
      who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of his actions
      and could only learn part of the facts, it all appeared exceedingly
      complex. I have had the advantage of two conversations with Mrs.
      Stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not
      aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us. You will
      find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my indexed list of
      cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from
      memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts in my
      mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out what
      has passed. The barrister who has his case at his fingers&rsquo; ends and is
      able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that a week or two
      of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more. So each of my
      cases displaces the last, and Mlle. Carére has blurred my recollection of
      Baskerville Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to
      my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French lady and the
      infamous Upwood. So far as the case of the hound goes, however, I will
      give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and you will suggest
      anything which I may have forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not
      lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He was a son of that
      Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir Charles, who fled with a
      sinister reputation to South America, where he was said to have died
      unmarried. He did, as a matter of fact, marry, and had one child, this
      fellow, whose real name is the same as his father&rsquo;s. He married Beryl
      Garcia, one of the beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a
      considerable sum of public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and
      fled to England, where he established a school in the east of Yorkshire.
      His reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had
      struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home,
      and that he had used this man&rsquo;s ability to make the undertaking a success.
      Fraser, the tutor, died however, and the school which had begun well sank
      from disrepute into infamy. The Vandeleurs found it convenient to change
      their name to Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his fortune, his
      schemes for the future, and his taste for entomology to the south of
      England. I learned at the British Museum that he was a recognized
      authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur has been
      permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his Yorkshire
      days, been the first to describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be of such
      intense interest to us. The fellow had evidently made inquiry and found
      that only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate. When he
      went to Devonshire his plans were, I believe, exceedingly hazy, but that
      he meant mischief from the first is evident from the way in which he took
      his wife with him in the character of his sister. The idea of using her as
      a decoy was clearly already in his mind, though he may not have been
      certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. He meant in the
      end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool or run any risk
      for that end. His first act was to establish himself as near to his
      ancestral home as he could, and his second was to cultivate a friendship
      with Sir Charles Baskerville and with the neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so prepared the
      way for his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue to call him, knew
      that the old man&rsquo;s heart was weak and that a shock would kill him. So much
      he had learned from Dr. Mortimer. He had heard also that Sir Charles was
      superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously. His ingenious
      mind instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to
      death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt to the
      real murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with considerable
      finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been content to work with a savage
      hound. The use of artificial means to make the creature diabolical was a
      flash of genius upon his part. The dog he bought in London from Ross and
      Mangles, the dealers in Fulham Road. It was the strongest and most savage
      in their possession. He brought it down by the North Devon line and walked
      a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without exciting any
      remarks. He had already on his insect hunts learned to penetrate the
      Grimpen Mire, and so had found a safe hiding-place for the creature. Here
      he kennelled it and waited his chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be decoyed
      outside of his grounds at night. Several times Stapleton lurked about with
      his hound, but without avail. It was during these fruitless quests that
      he, or rather his ally, was seen by peasants, and that the legend of the
      demon dog received a new confirmation. He had hoped that his wife might
      lure Sir Charles to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly
      independent. She would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a
      sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy. Threats
      and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her. She would have
      nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton was at a deadlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that Sir
      Charles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the minister of
      his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman, Mrs. Laura Lyons. By
      representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence over
      her, and he gave her to understand that in the event of her obtaining a
      divorce from her husband he would marry her. His plans were suddenly
      brought to a head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave the
      Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he himself
      pretended to coincide. He must act at once, or his victim might get beyond
      his power. He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons to write this letter,
      imploring the old man to give her an interview on the evening before his
      departure for London. He then, by a specious argument, prevented her from
      going, and so had the chance for which he had waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to get his
      hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring the beast round
      to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find the old
      gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by its master, sprang over the
      wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming down
      the yew alley. In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful
      sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing
      eyes, bounding after its victim. He fell dead at the end of the alley from
      heart disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the grassy border while
      the baronet had run down the path, so that no track but the man&rsquo;s was
      visible. On seeing him lying still the creature had probably approached to
      sniff at him, but finding him dead had turned away again. It was then that
      it left the print which was actually observed by Dr. Mortimer. The hound
      was called off and hurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a
      mystery was left which puzzled the authorities, alarmed the countryside,
      and finally brought the case within the scope of our observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. You perceive the
      devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make a
      case against the real murderer. His only accomplice was one who could
      never give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature of the device
      only served to make it more effective. Both of the women concerned in the
      case, Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left with a strong
      suspicion against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he had designs upon
      the old man, and also of the existence of the hound. Mrs. Lyons knew
      neither of these things, but had been impressed by the death occurring at
      the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only known to him.
      However, both of them were under his influence, and he had nothing to fear
      from them. The first half of his task was successfully accomplished but
      the more difficult still remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in
      Canada. In any case he would very soon learn it from his friend Dr.
      Mortimer, and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of
      Henry Baskerville. Stapleton&rsquo;s first idea was that this young stranger
      from Canada might possibly be done to death in London without coming down
      to Devonshire at all. He distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to
      help him in laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not leave her long
      out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her. It was
      for this reason that he took her to London with him. They lodged, I find,
      at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven Street, which was actually one
      of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence. Here he kept his
      wife imprisoned in her room while he, disguised in a beard, followed Dr.
      Mortimer to Baker Street and afterwards to the station and to the
      Northumberland Hotel. His wife had some inkling of his plans; but she had
      such a fear of her husband&mdash;a fear founded upon brutal ill-treatment&mdash;that
      she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger. If the
      letter should fall into Stapleton&rsquo;s hands her own life would not be safe.
      Eventually, as we know, she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words
      which would form the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised
      hand. It reached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir Henry&rsquo;s
      attire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he might always have
      the means of setting him upon his track. With characteristic promptness
      and audacity he set about this at once, and we cannot doubt that the boots
      or chamber-maid of the hotel was well bribed to help him in his design. By
      chance, however, the first boot which was procured for him was a new one
      and, therefore, useless for his purpose. He then had it returned and
      obtained another&mdash;a most instructive incident, since it proved
      conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound, as no
      other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot and
      this indifference to a new one. The more <i>outré</i> and grotesque an incident
      is the more carefully it deserves to be examined, and the very point which
      appears to complicate a case is, when duly considered and scientifically
      handled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed always by
      Stapleton in the cab. From his knowledge of our rooms and of my
      appearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am inclined to think
      that Stapleton&rsquo;s career of crime has been by no means limited to this
      single Baskerville affair. It is suggestive that during the last three
      years there have been four considerable burglaries in the west country,
      for none of which was any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at
      Folkestone Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling
      of the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannot doubt
      that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this fashion, and that
      for years he has been a desperate and dangerous man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got
      away from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in sending back my
      own name to me through the cabman. From that moment he understood that I
      had taken over the case in London, and that therefore there was no chance
      for him there. He returned to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the
      baronet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You have, no doubt, described the sequence of
      events correctly, but there is one point which you have left unexplained.
      What became of the hound when its master was in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly of
      importance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant,
      though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by sharing
      all his plans with him. There was an old manservant at Merripit House,
      whose name was Anthony. His connection with the Stapletons can be traced
      for several years, as far back as the school-mastering days, so that he
      must have been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and
      wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the country. It is
      suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England, while Antonio is
      so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries. The man, like Mrs.
      Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but with a curious lisping accent.
      I have myself seen this old man cross the Grimpen Mire by the path which
      Stapleton had marked out. It is very probable, therefore, that in the
      absence of his master it was he who cared for the hound, though he may
      never have known the purpose for which the beast was used.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were soon
      followed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how I stood myself at
      that time. It may possibly recur to your memory that when I examined the
      paper upon which the printed words were fastened I made a close inspection
      for the water-mark. In doing so I held it within a few inches of my eyes,
      and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine.
      There are seventy-five perfumes, which it is very necessary that a
      criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each other, and cases
      have more than once within my own experience depended upon their prompt
      recognition. The scent suggested the presence of a lady, and already my
      thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons. Thus I had made certain of
      the hound, and had guessed at the criminal before ever we went to the west
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that I could
      not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly on his guard. I
      deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and I came down secretly
      when I was supposed to be in London. My hardships were not so great as you
      imagined, though such trifling details must never interfere with the
      investigation of a case. I stayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey, and
      only used the hut upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene
      of action. Cartwright had come down with me, and in his disguise as a
      country boy he was of great assistance to me. I was dependent upon him for
      food and clean linen. When I was watching Stapleton, Cartwright was
      frequently watching you, so that I was able to keep my hand upon all the
      strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being
      forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey. They were of great
      service to me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece of
      biography of Stapleton&rsquo;s. I was able to establish the identity of the man
      and the woman and knew at last exactly how I stood. The case had been
      considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and
      the relations between him and the Barrymores. This also you cleared up in
      a very effective way, though I had already come to the same conclusions
      from my own observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a complete
      knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case which could go to a
      jury. Even Stapleton&rsquo;s attempt upon Sir Henry that night which ended in
      the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving
      murder against our man. There seemed to be no alternative but to catch him
      red-handed, and to do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently
      unprotected, as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a severe shock to
      our client we succeeded in completing our case and driving Stapleton to
      his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been exposed to this is, I
      must confess, a reproach to my management of the case, but we had no means
      of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing spectacle which the beast
      presented, nor could we predict the fog which enabled him to burst upon us
      at such short notice. We succeeded in our object at a cost which both the
      specialist and Dr. Mortimer assure me will be a temporary one. A long
      journey may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered
      nerves but also from his wounded feelings. His love for the lady was deep
      and sincere, and to him the saddest part of all this black business was
      that he should have been deceived by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout.
      There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an influence over her which
      may have been love or may have been fear, or very possibly both, since
      they are by no means incompatible emotions. It was, at least, absolutely
      effective. At his command she consented to pass as his sister, though he
      found the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her the
      direct accessory to murder. She was ready to warn Sir Henry so far as she
      could without implicating her husband, and again and again she tried to do
      so. Stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy, and when he
      saw the baronet paying court to the lady, even though it was part of his
      own plan, still he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst
      which revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so cleverly
      concealed. By encouraging the intimacy he made it certain that Sir Henry
      would frequently come to Merripit House and that he would sooner or later
      get the opportunity which he desired. On the day of the crisis, however,
      his wife turned suddenly against him. She had learned something of the
      death of the convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the
      outhouse on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. She taxed her
      husband with his intended crime, and a furious scene followed in which he
      showed her for the first time that she had a rival in his love. Her
      fidelity turned in an instant to bitter hatred, and he saw that she would
      betray him. He tied her up, therefore, that she might have no chance of
      warning Sir Henry, and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside
      put down the baronet&rsquo;s death to the curse of his family, as they certainly
      would do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact and to
      keep silent upon what she knew. In this I fancy that in any case he made a
      miscalculation, and that, if we had not been there, his doom would none
      the less have been sealed. A woman of Spanish blood does not condone such
      an injury so lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without referring to my
      notes, I cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case. I
      do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done the old
      uncle with his bogie hound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did not frighten
      its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the resistance which might
      be offered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton came into the
      succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the heir, had been
      living unannounced under another name so close to the property? How could
      he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much when you
      expect me to solve it. The past and the present are within the field of my
      inquiry, but what a man may do in the future is a hard question to answer.
      Mrs. Stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on several
      occasions. There were three possible courses. He might claim the property
      from South America, establish his identity before the British authorities
      there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to England at all, or
      he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be
      in London; or, again, he might furnish an accomplice with the proofs and
      papers, putting him in as heir, and retaining a claim upon some proportion
      of his income. We cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have
      found some way out of the difficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have had
      some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, we may turn our
      thoughts into more pleasant channels. I have a box for <i>Les Huguenots</i>.
      Have you heard the De Reszkes? Might I trouble you then to be ready in
      half an hour, and we can stop at Marcini&rsquo;s for a little dinner on the
      way?&rdquo;

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
