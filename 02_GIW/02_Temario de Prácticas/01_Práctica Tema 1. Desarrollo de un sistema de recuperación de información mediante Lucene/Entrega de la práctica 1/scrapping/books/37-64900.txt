Artists have reproduced its wonder of\r\nimposing and picturesque detail; arch\xc3\xa6ologists have explored its many\r\nmonuments; historians have discovered in its archives a record which,\r\nfor many centuries, represents the log-book of Spain. There is no\r\nsecret, apart from the impenetrable mystery of its origin, which has not\r\nbeen revealed; its chronicle is a well-thumbed volume. The beginnings of\r\nSpanish history go no further back than the earliest references we have\r\nto the natural stronghold founded on the seven rocks on the banks of the\r\nTagus, and Spanish tradition claims for the citadel an antiquity coeval\r\nwith the sun and stars. Both the history and the legends have been\r\ntranscribed in many languages, yet, in a series which is intended to\r\nembrace all Spain in its compendious design, the inclusion of the\r\ntwice-told tale of the \xe2\x80\x9ccity of generations\xe2\x80\x9d carries with it an\r\nunquestionable justification.\r\n\r\nThe ambition of the author has not been to throw fresh light on a\r\nwell-worn subject, nor to supplement the work of earlier and more\r\nerudite writers with new facts or theories, but simply, as in the case\r\nof the earlier volumes in this series, to equip the illustrations with a\r\nbrief, explanatory text. It would be futile to attempt to even outline\r\nthe story of Toledo in some hundred and fifty pages of letterpress, but\r\nI hope it may be found that in this limited space sufficient detail has\r\nbeen given to convey to the reader a general idea of the changing\r\nfortunes and unchanging character of the city, which Padilla has\r\ndescribed as \xe2\x80\x9cthe crown of Spain, the light of the world, free from the\r\ntime of the mighty Goths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe impression of grandeur and melancholy, of strength and silence,\r\nwhich the traveller receives from a visit to the one-time capital of the\r\nPeninsula, cannot be suggested by the written word, but it may be that\r\nthe illustrations will recall, if they do not suggest, the feeling which\r\nthe city inspires. Toledo is medi\xc3\xa6val in its architecture and its\r\natmosphere. The Moorish occupation has left no more than a scratch upon\r\nits Gothic character; the spirit of modernity has been defied by its\r\nvirile antiquity. But the Moslem remains have been made a feature of the\r\nillustrations, and, as in the volumes devoted to Seville, Cordova, and\r\nGranada in this series, the intricacies of Arabian decoration have been\r\nextensively reproduced.\r\n\r\nMany of the plates are included here by the courtesy of Messrs.\r\nAlguacil, Rafael Garzon, Hauser and Menet, and Moreno, and to these\r\ngentlemen I tender my sincere thanks for the permission accorded me to\r\nreproduce them. I have also to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. E. B.\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Auvergne for the assistance rendered by him in the compilation, and to\r\nMessrs. Martin and Gamoneda for their kindness in allowing me to make\r\nuse of the matter and illustrations contained in the volume on _Toledo_\r\nwhich they have published in the new series of the _Monumentos\r\nArquitect\xc3\xb3nicos de Espa\xc3\xb1a_.\r\n\r\nI venture to hope that no apology is needed for including the chapter on\r\nEl Greco, and the selection of his pictures, which appear in this\r\nvolume. A separate book, devoted entirely to this subject, which will be\r\nissued in this series, cannot be ready for some time, and as so little\r\nhas been written about Domeniko Theotokopouli, and so few of his\r\npictures have been reproduced, I have decided to incorporate these brief\r\nnotes concerning the Cretan painter, whose association with Toledo\r\nextended over a period of nearly forty years.\r\n\r\n                                                               A.

The flood of years has rolled onwards past and around them,\r\nand its billows have broken in vain against their shores. Such a spot is\r\nToledo. It lifts its head above the ever-shifting waters of the ages,\r\nand looks forth unchanged, unchanging, across the sea of centuries--a\r\nlast surviving beacon of the drowned medi\xc3\xa6val world.\r\n\r\nVery old is the city. It has outgrown decay. Nor can we conceive it as\r\nchanging. It has almost become a part of the everlasting hills on which\r\nit stands. The rock has grown into Toledo and Toledo into the rock.\r\n\r\nIn a land where all is old, men marvel at the antiquity of this city.\r\nAnd when it was younger by centuries, the chroniclers, groping amid\r\nlegends and fables the wildest and most extravagant, strove to penetrate\r\nthe darkness of the ages and to discern the pale glimmerings of Toledo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndawn. Here, surely, first trod the first man, thought the ancients, and\r\nhere was already a city when God first placed His sun exactly over it in\r\nthe yet-dark Heavens. If this was not so, said another chronicler, then\r\nbeyond doubt Toledo\xe2\x80\x99s seven hills were the first to appear above the\r\nwaters of the Deluge, and Tubal, the grandson of Noah, established here\r\na kingdom. So stories and traditions multiplied, each historian\r\ninventing a fresh one. These fables of the city\xe2\x80\x99s founding are quaint,\r\ncurious, and ingenious. Iberia and Hispania of course suggested persons,\r\nand so we find Iberia, daughter of King Hispan, and wife of a Persian\r\ncaptain, Pyrrhus, resorting in search of health to the banks of the\r\nTagus, and her husband making a bower for her on these rocky steeps.\r\nHercules, who is credited with the foundation of Seville, added the\r\nbuilding of Toledo to his many labours. \xe2\x80\x9cDismiss these far-fetched\r\nfables,\xe2\x80\x9d cries the learned prelate De Rada, \xe2\x80\x9cand admit that our city was\r\nfounded by the Consuls Tolemon and Brutus, in the reign of Ptolemy\r\nEvergetes.\xe2\x80\x9d But another conjecture as absolutely baseless as the others!\r\nMore interesting is the legend that the town was built by Jews flying\r\nfrom Nebuchadnezzar, by whom it was named Toledoth, \xe2\x80\x9cthe city of\r\ngeneration.\xe2\x80\x9d Certain it is that Jews lived in Toledo at the earliest\r\nperiods of its history, and played a great part, as we shall see, in its\r\naffairs. However picturesque may be these traditions and wonderings of\r\nthe sages, we cannot resist the conclusion that the beginnings of this\r\nold capital of Spain were obscure and commonplace enough. Along the\r\nbanks of the yellow Tagus savage tribesmen pastured their flocks and\r\nherds, and the more practical spirits among them recognised the\r\nadvantages of the cliff above the river as a settlement. Doubtless mere\r\ntemporary encampments succeeded each other here season after season,\r\ntill some sentiment or necessity attached men permanently to the spot,\r\nand a rude cluster of huts was formed--the rough inception of our\r\ngreatest towns.\r\n\r\nThe Celtiberians hereabouts were known to the Romans as Carpetani (how\r\nill these Latin forms seem to reproduce the uncouth designations which\r\nthese primitive peoples really bore!) The Carthaginians were the first\r\ncivilised nation to come in contact with them, and we hear of a Punic\r\ngovernor, Tago. It is impossible to resist the suspicion that his\r\npersonality arose, Aphrodite-like, from the river Tagus. But a Moorish\r\nwriter gives a plausible account of a revolt which arose among the\r\nCarpetani consequent on Tago\xe2\x80\x99s assassination by Hasdrubal, the\r\ncontemporary of Hannibal. This brought that great commander himself upon\r\nthe scene. Before him the tribesmen were scattered like chaff before the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nDid the African Ph\xc5\x93nicians found a permanent station at Toledo? It\r\nwould not seem so. No vestige or fragment, no trace whatever of their\r\ndomination has come down to us. Most likely this was a mere trading\r\ncentre, where the black-bearded, keen-eyed Semites bartered the wares of\r\nAfrica and the East against the ores and fleeces of Spain. The\r\npopulation remained almost purely Celtic. One wonders if a few\r\nCarthaginians settled amongst them, and if their descendants became\r\nconfounded with their kinsmen in race, the Jews. It is a wild\r\nconjecture, but might not the presence of such Semitic settlers have\r\ngiven rise to the fantastic legend of the founding of Toledo by the\r\nChildren of Israel?\r\n\r\nWhere the Carthaginian sowed, the Roman reaped. And now the Carpetanian\r\nvillage looms in the light not of mere tradition, but of history. Livy\r\ntells us that in the year 193 B.C. the Pro-Consul Marcus Fulvius\r\nNobilior defeated a host of Celtiberians, Vaccei and Vectones in this\r\nregion, and took prisoner a king called Hilerno. In consequence of this\r\nvictory Toledo--described as _urbs parva sed loco munito_--fell into the\r\npower of the conquerors. The wild rebellious Celts might henceforward\r\nchafe and lash themselves into impotent fury; on their necks the yoke of\r\nthe Roman was firmly riveted, never by the natives unassisted to be\r\nshaken off.\r\n\r\nHistorians have remarked on the aloofness of the Toledans during the\r\nlong winter of foreign domination. Between the various leaders and\r\nfactions who made Spain their cock-pit, the citizens observed strict\r\nneutrality. They rendered no assistance to Viriathus in his magnanimous\r\nattempt to recover national independence. Perhaps they were not wanting\r\nin sympathy for their compatriots; but the conquerors had long\r\nrecognised the military value of the town by the Tagus, and here we may\r\nsuppose was always a strong garrison ready to stamp out the first\r\nefforts at revolt.\r\n\r\nUnder the wings of the Roman eagle, the material prosperity of Toledo\r\nsteadily increased. From a collection of wretched huts, it had become a\r\n_colonia_, the capital of Carpetania. As such it would have had its\r\n_arx_, or citadel, pr\xc3\xa6torium, forum, temples, baths, and _vici_, or long\r\nsuburbs straggling into the country. Of all these practically no traces\r\nremain. But in the Vega, outside the town, may be traced a semicircular\r\nenclosure, formed by masses of stones and mortar, about a metre in\r\nthickness, but of varying height. This space has been dignified with the\r\nname of Circus Maximum, and is undoubtedly a Roman work. But Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nAmador de los Rios has demonstrated almost conclusively that the Circus\r\nnever advanced much beyond the foundations, which we now see before us\r\nprobably in no very different state from that in which they were left\r\nsome two thousand years ago. But though no Celtiberian captives or\r\nChristian martyrs here were \xe2\x80\x9cbutchered to make a Roman holiday,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nconsecration of the spot to the practice of cruelty bore fruit in after\r\nyears. For the fires lit by the Inquisition were kindled here, and the\r\nChristian put the incompleted amphitheatre to the use for which it had\r\nbeen designed by the Pagan. To-day the men of Toledo play at _pelota_ in\r\nthe enclosure, and their cheery shouts may well scare away the ghosts of\r\ntorturer and victim.\r\n\r\nThis may be regarded as the most important Roman remains in the\r\nneighbourhood of the city. The famous Cave of Hercules, which figures so\r\nlargely in legendary lore, was probably the crypt or substructure of a\r\nTemple of Jupiter; and on the cliff-side below the Alcazar are a few\r\nfragments of a once-important aqueduct.\r\n\r\nIt has been conjectured from the dimensions of the projected Circus that\r\nthe Romans had at one time thought of elevating Toledo to the rank of\r\nchief city of Spain. The design, if it ever was formed, was never\r\ncarried into execution. Of what passed in the town under Latin rule we\r\nhave but the vaguest notion. Toledo, like almost every other place in\r\nEurope, has its traditions of fierce persecution productive of local\r\nmartyrs. Almost as many Christians were massacred in Spain, if we\r\ncredit these stories, as Gibbon thinks perished in the whole Roman\r\nEmpire. Among the martyrs of Toletum, it is perhaps superfluous to say,\r\nwas a young and lovely virgin, in this instance called Leocadia. She was\r\ndone to death by the truculent Dacian. St. Eugenius, the first bishop of\r\nToledo, is said to have been a disciple of St. Paul. He was martyred at\r\nParis, and his alleged remains were obtained from Charles IX. of France\r\nand presented to the city by Philip II.\r\n\r\nIn early ecclesiastical annals Toledo has less shadowy claims on\r\nremembrance as the seat of several councils, the most celebrated being\r\nthose of 396, 400, 589. The minutes of the second council are preserved\r\nin the local archives. Miss Hannah Lynch makes merry over the fathers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nspirited denunciations of her sex. In truth, the irreverent reader is\r\nreminded of those other fulminations launched in the diocese of Rheims\r\nagainst certain persons unknown, and of the poet\xe2\x80\x99s surprised comment on\r\ntheir want of effect. The sex fared better at the hands of the Council,\r\nhowever, than vegetarians and mathematicians, both of whom were\r\nexcommunicated downright. Neither class is numerous in Spain at the\r\npresent day, so the labours of the fathers may not have been altogether\r\nineffectual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CITY UNDER THE VISIGOTH\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the fifth century the Toledans may well have listened with\r\nattention to spiritual discussions, for looking forth from their rocky\r\nperch, they beheld the kingdoms of the earth passing away, and all that\r\nhad seemed stable and eternal fading like the morning mist. The final\r\nbreaking-up of the great world-controlling power was evident. Nations,\r\nthe very names of which the men of the south had never heard, loomed\r\nfrom out the darkness of the north, and swept like a cloud of locusts\r\nover the land. The whole of Spain was desolate. Toledo, ever grim and\r\nstubborn, stood prepared to die hard. The tide of Vandal invasion surged\r\nin vain round her walls; then spent its fury in the south. The Visigoths\r\nestablished themselves in southern France. Under Walya they had overrun\r\nSpain, but had exchanged it, willingly enough, for Aquitania. Euric the\r\nBalthing, who succeeded his brother Theodoric as king in 466, seems to\r\nhave repented of the bargain. He reconquered all Spain, except Galicia,\r\nwhich was held by the Suevi, and took Toledo. Where the Vandal had\r\nfailed, the Visigoth succeeded. In the first years of the sixth century\r\nthe Franks stripped Euric\xe2\x80\x99s grandson, Amalaric, of practically all his\r\npossessions north of the Pyrenees, and the kingdom of the Visigoths\r\nbecame synonymous with Spain. Its capital was Narbonne during the\r\ntroubled reigns of Theudis and Theudigisel. But in 553 Athanagild was\r\nelected king. His wife was the sister of the Bishop of Toledo, and\r\npartly on that account, perhaps, but more probably because of its\r\ncentral position, he made that city his capital. That rank it retained\r\nduring the continuance of the Visigothic monarchy, with the brief\r\ninterval of the reign of Liuba, who succeeded Athanagild in 567 and\r\nremoved his Court to Narbonne.\r\n\r\nThe history of Toledo for the next century and a half becomes, in some\r\nsort, the history of Spain. Under Liuba\xe2\x80\x99s brother and successor\r\nLeovigild (more correctly Liobagilths) the monarchy was consolidated.\r\nThe Suevi in the north-west were subdued, and the nominal suzerainty of\r\nthe Eastern Emperor was disavowed. Despite the difference in religion\r\nbetween the Visigoths, who were Arians, and the Romanised Iberians, who\r\nwere Catholics, the two races began to intermingle, and the fusion of\r\nboth into a single nation commenced. Leovigild was the first of his line\r\nto assume the insignia and appurtenances of royalty, and struck coins\r\nwith his own likeness and the description, \xe2\x80\x9cKing in Toledo.\xe2\x80\x9d The title\r\nis significant of the increased importance of the city. The prosperity\r\nof the kingdom was temporarily interrupted by the celebrated\r\ninsurrection of the monarch\xe2\x80\x99s son Ermenegild. This was the outcome of\r\nthe marriage of that prince with Ingunthis, the daughter of the Prankish\r\nand Catholic king Sisebert. The wedding was solemnised in Toledo with\r\ngreat pomp, but the city shortly after became the scene of violent\r\nquarrels between Queen Goiswintha and her daughter-in-law. Ermenegild\r\nembraced his wife\xe2\x80\x99s religion, and headed a revolt against his father. He\r\nwas defeated, and paid the penalty with his life at Tarragona, after\r\nrefusing to accept the sacrament at the hands of an Arian bishop.\r\nUnedifying though his conduct may appear to us, he was regarded as a\r\nmartyr for the faith, and is enrolled among the saints of the Catholic\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nNor does his example seem to have been without its effect upon his\r\nbrother, Reccared, who succeeded Leovigild in 587. In the month of May\r\n589, Toledo was thronged with Catholic bishops and priests--many lately\r\nreturned from exile--and with nobles from all parts of Spain, making\r\ntheir way to the Basilica of Santa Maria de la Sede Real, to assist at\r\nthe solemn profession of the Catholic faith by the king and his queen,\r\nBaddo. Sixty-two prelates took part in this, the third Council of\r\nToledo, the most eminent being Massona, Bishop of Merida, Leandro of\r\nBaetica, Santardus of Braga, Ugno of Barcelona, Megecias of Narbonne,\r\nand Eufemio of Toledo. It was a memorable day for Spain. The king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexample was soon followed by his subjects of his own race, and the\r\nunification of the two peoples was greatly accelerated.\r\n\r\nDuring the hundred and ten years that elapsed between the death of\r\nReccared (601) and the rout of the Guadelete (711), no fewer than\r\nfifteen sovereigns sat on the throne of Spain. Toledo was the theatre of\r\ntheir barbaric triumphings, their violent entrances and tragic exits.\r\nNow the city would resound with the savage, exultant yells of the\r\ntownsmen, as they dragged the body of the usurper Witeric up and down\r\nthe steep, uneven streets--to cast the bleeding, shapeless thing that\r\nhad so lately been a king, upon a dunghill. Now, the people would be\r\nacclaiming Wamba, greatest of the Visigoths--after the strange scene at\r\nGerticos, where the crown was forced upon him at the sword\xe2\x80\x99s point;\r\nanother time, a long procession of captives would file through the\r\ngates, to witness to the old king\xe2\x80\x99s triumph in Narbonnese Gaul. Not a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdemise of the crown\xe2\x80\x9d but there would be angry mutterings among the\r\ntownsfolk, and whispers of murder, compulsion, and fraud. And while the\r\nkings raved and the people wept, the Church grew every day stronger--so\r\nstrong that usurper and legitimate sovereign alike had perforce to\r\nobtain her sanction to his election and accession. And as the years went\r\non, the spark of religious zeal in the breast of Spain was fanned into\r\nflame, and we read of fierce onslaughts on the Jewish citizens, and of\r\nmerciless edicts, condemning them to penalties painful and humiliating.\r\nDark days were these for the Children of Israel whose home Toledo so\r\nlong had been; but darker still were impending for their persecutors and\r\nfor the royal line of the Visigoths.\r\n\r\nAn exact picture of society in Spain at this period has been preserved\r\nin the Etymologies of Isidore Pacense. The Visigoths were a primitive,\r\nbarbarous people, who had imposed upon themselves the outward\r\nappearances of Roman, or rather of Byzantine, civilisation. The\r\ncontemptuous reference of Hallam to this \xe2\x80\x9cobscure race\xe2\x80\x9d is undeserved.\r\nEven in their earlier stages of development the Goths manifested many\r\nnoble qualities--notably, a clemency towards their enemies--which were\r\nnot conspicuous in the more polished nations of the South. And though\r\nthey never properly assimilated the culture of the Latins, they attained\r\nto a degree of refinement and civilisation which compares favourably\r\nwith that reached by contemporaries. \xe2\x80\x9cSpain,\xe2\x80\x9d remarks the author of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToledo\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\x9cMonumentos Arquitect\xc3\xb3nicos de Espa\xc3\xb1a,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmay then fairly\r\nand proudly claim that, while in Central Europe art had acquired no\r\ndistinctive form--in the midst of the bitterness of slavery, when,\r\nbefore the abjuration of Reccared, the fusion of the races was not\r\nlegally recognised--the Iberian Peninsula had developed a definite and\r\nevident artistic and literary individuality. That individuality must\r\nhave been the result of the fortuitous conjunction and union of Latin\r\ntraditions, more or less degenerate, with influences originally\r\nByzantine and with those other transformed elements introduced by the\r\nGermanic hosts of Atawulf; but, even then, it remains an individuality,\r\nwhich asserts itself in the surviving examples of Visigothic culture,\r\nand which was transmitted to the generations succeeding the Moslem\r\nconquest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccording to the standpoint of the critic, the Gothic kings\xe2\x80\x99 taste for\r\npomp and luxury may be interpreted as proof of their civilised instincts\r\nor of their native barbarism. For of the splendour of the Court of\r\nToledo we have abundant testimony. From the writings of Isidore, we\r\nlearn that the nobles used only goblets and basins of the precious\r\nmetals, that their garments were of superfine silk, and their ornaments\r\nof the richest jewels. The elaborate ceremonial of the royal household\r\nmay be inferred from the list of functionaries--the First Count, or\r\nChief Butler, the _Escancias_; the Count Chamberlain, or _Cubiculario_;\r\nthe Master of the Horse, _Estabulario_; the Major Domo, or _Numerario_;\r\nthe Steward, or _Silonario_; the Master of the Pages, or _Espartarius_;\r\nthe Count of the _Sagrarios_, or Sacred Things; and the Treasurer, or\r\n_Argentarios_. These offices were only held by the highest nobles. In\r\nthe Cluny Museum at Paris and the Royal Armoury at Madrid are preserved\r\nthe superb Votive Crowns discovered at Guarrazar in 1858. These\r\npriceless objects proclaim the wealth and munificence of the Visigothic\r\nmonarchs. They are composed of double hoops of gold, decorated on the\r\noutside by three bands in relief. The outer bands are set with pearls\r\nand sapphires, and the middle band with the same stones in a setting of\r\na red vitreous substance. The crown is suspended by four chains from a\r\ndouble gold rosette, which encloses a piece of rock crystal set in\r\nfacets. Each chain consists of four links, shaped like the leaf of the\r\npear-tree, and _perc\xc3\xa9es \xc3\xa0 jour_. In its original state the crown of King\r\nSwinthila, now in the Madrid Armoury, had, hanging from its lower rim, a\r\ncross and twenty-two letters, making up the inscription, SVINTHILANUS\r\nREX OFFERET. All and each of these letters were actual jewels, set in\r\nthe red glassy paste already mentioned, to them being attached large\r\nsingle pearls and pear-shaped sapphires. Though only twelve letters were\r\nremaining when the crown was discovered, the dedication was skilfully\r\nreconstructed by Se\xc3\xb1ores de Madrazo and Amador de los Rios. The crown of\r\nRecceswinth in the Cluny Museum and the crown of the Abbot Theodosius at\r\nMadrid do not differ greatly from that of Swinthila in style and\r\nmaterial. Though the workmanship is rude compared with modern specimens\r\nof the goldsmith\xe2\x80\x99s art, these crowns still excite admiration by their\r\nbeauty and richness. Inquiring into the origin of their style, Se\xc3\xb1or de\r\nRia\xc3\xb1o arrives at the conclusion that it \xe2\x80\x9cmust be looked for in the East;\r\ntheir manufacture was most probably Spanish. We cannot imagine the\r\nextraordinary magnificence of the Visigothic court, so similar to that\r\nof Constantinople and other contemporary ones, without the presence at\r\neach of a group of artists whose task was to satisfy these demands.\xe2\x80\x9d Not\r\nonly the applied arts, but letters and learning were cultivated at\r\nToledo. Swinthila and Recceswinth delighted in the composition of\r\nepistles and verses, in which, unfortunately, the taste, acquired from\r\nthe Byzantines, for long-winded, flowery and involved phrases is\r\npainfully apparent. Recceswinth interested himself in the collection and\r\nrevision of ancient manuscripts. In his reign flourished the learned and\r\nsaintly Ildefonso, who was publicly thanked for his work on the\r\nperpetual virginity of Mary by the martyr Saint Leocadia, who came\r\nexpressly from Heaven for the purpose. One of Ildefonso\xe2\x80\x99s successors in\r\nthe see of Toledo, Julian, was a Jew by birth, or at least descent. He\r\nwas renowned for his erudition and especially as a polemical writer.\r\nThough he narrowly escaped excommunication as a heretic, he is now\r\nvenerated as a saint, and was buried beside St. Ildefonso.\r\n\r\nAs the seat of a Court which did something more than ape the culture of\r\nthe Latins (_pace_ Mr. Leonard Williams), Toledo rose from an obscure\r\nRoman colony into a city of dignity and importance. It is supposed to\r\nhave reached its highest stage of development in the reign of King Wamba\r\n(672-680), whose mutilated statue confronts the traveller on approaching\r\nthe town from the railway-station. Most of the buildings ascribed by the\r\nchroniclers, however, to that king were in all probability only restored\r\nby his orders, and were originally constructed by his predecessors.\r\nIsidore Pacense enumerates among the edifices existing in his time in\r\nSpain, basilicas, monasteries, oratories, and hermitages; the _Aula\r\nRegia_, or royal residence, \xe2\x80\x9cdistinguished before all other buildings by\r\nthe richness of the four porticos which encircled it\xe2\x80\x9d; the _Atrii_ of\r\nthe nobility, which were allowed only three porticos; hospitals,\r\nguest-houses, and _Repositaria_, or treasure-houses. It is reasonable to\r\nassume that the capital of Spain would have possessed buildings of all\r\nthe kinds specified during the hundred years that elapsed between the\r\ndeath of Athanagild and the accession of Wamba.\r\n\r\nTo the former king is attributed the foundation of the sanctuary\r\nconverted later into the Hermitage of Cristo de la Luz, and the Church\r\nof Santa Justa, reconstructed in the sixteenth century. From an\r\ninscription on marble found in 1581, near the Convent of San Juan de la\r\nPenitencia, it would appear that Reccared built a church consecrated to\r\nthe Virgin in the year 587. The text runs: IN NOMINE DNI CONSECRA | TA\r\nECCLESIA SCTE MARIE | IN CATHOLICO DIE PRIMO | IDUS APRILIS ANNO FELI |\r\nCITER PRIMO REGNI D-NI | NOSTRI GLORIOSISSIMI H | RECCAREDI REGIS ERA |\r\nDCXXV. To Liuba II. is ascribed the erection of the Church of San\r\nSebastian, where some capitals and shafts, discovered in 1899, exist to\r\nattest its Visigothic origin. The Basilica of Santa Leocadia dated from\r\nthe days of Sisebut (612-621): and though the chroniclers assign no date\r\nto the dedication of the Church of San Gin\xc3\xa9s there can be no doubt that\r\nit took place in the seventh century. Wamba adorned with statuary and\r\npartially restored the city walls, but it is an error, based on a\r\ncorrupt text of Isidore Pacense\xe2\x80\x99s, to suppose that he built them.\r\n\r\nThe site of the Aula Regia, or Palace of the Visigothic kings, has long\r\nbeen a matter of dispute among arch\xc3\xa6ologists. The author of the article\r\non Toledo in the \xe2\x80\x9cMonumentos Arquitect\xc3\xb3nicos\xe2\x80\x9d decides in favour of the\r\nplot of ground covered by the Convents of the Concepcion and the\r\nComendadores de Santiago, the ruined Hospital of Santa Cruz, and the new\r\nextension of the Paseo del Miradero--close to the Zocodover, in the\r\nnorth-east angle of the city. Adjacent to the palace was the Basilica of\r\nSaints Peter and Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich seems,\xe2\x80\x9d says Se\xc3\xb1or Menendez y Pidal, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nhave been the royal pantheon, opened only for the entombment of the\r\nsovereign and the taking the oath of allegiance to his successor.\xe2\x80\x9d Here\r\nwere suspended the votive crowns, afterwards buried at Guarrazar; here\r\nprobably were interred Athanagild, Leovigild, Reccared I., Liuba II.,\r\nGundemar, Sisebut, Reccared II., Tulga, Erwig, Egica, and Witica. Their\r\nvery dust has long since been scattered by the wind--who shall say\r\nwhere? In a hall attached to that Basilica, in similar annexes to the\r\nBasilicas of Santa Leocadia and Santa Maria de la Sede Real, were held\r\nthose ecclesiastical synods which so powerfully contributed to the\r\nshaping of the destinies of Spain. Santa Leocadia\xe2\x80\x99s church is now known\r\nas the Cristo de la Vega; the Basilica de Santa Maria faced the Bridge\r\nof Alcantara and was in after years known as Santa Maria de Alficem.\r\nHere Recceswinth is said to have been crowned, the temple being\r\nafterwards restored by Erwig, Wamba\xe2\x80\x99s successor.\r\n\r\nNot a single building erected by the Visigothic kings exists to-day.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDestroyed by man\xe2\x80\x99s fury and by the vicissitudes of time,\xe2\x80\x9d regretfully\r\nobserves Se\xc3\xb1or Amador de los Rios, \xe2\x80\x9cor altered till all trace of their\r\noriginal form has been lost, by the pious care which intended to\r\npreserve them, you may seek in vain in the city of Wamba for an intact\r\nmonument of that age; not even the walls ascribed to that prince have\r\nremained entire. Fragments of friezes; isolated capitals, which have\r\nadorned later edifices, oddly out of place in the scheme of decorations,\r\nor cut and defaced; broken shafts, perhaps bearing some inscriptions;\r\npieces of a hinge, a metope, a lintel, or an impost, perhaps some\r\ndedicatory tablet--this is all that has escaped at Toledo the\r\ndevastating scythe of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese relics, however, are fortunately numerous. For a detailed\r\ndescription of the more important, the reader is referred to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonumentos Arquitect\xc3\xb3nicos de Espa\xc3\xb1a.\xe2\x80\x9d Some we shall notice more\r\nparticularly in dealing with the edifices of which they now form part.\r\n\r\nUnder Wamba the Visigothic monarchy reached the apex of its greatness.\r\nUnder his four successors, Erwig, Egica, Witica, and Roderic, State and\r\npeople are said to have become hopelessly enervated. The old Gothic\r\nvigour blazed up now and again in some individual ruler or statesman,\r\nbut failed to communicate itself to the nation. The kingdom was\r\ntottering to its fall. The taste for display and the amenities of\r\nexistence grew stronger in this period of decline. Never was there such\r\nwealth and splendour in Toledo as when it fell a prey to the hosts of\r\nIslam. The rapid decay of this once great and martial race is without a\r\nparallel in history. It is difficult to assign to it a cause. Luxury was\r\nthe privilege only of the nobility and clergy, and could hardly have\r\ncorrupted the whole people. Modern writers lamely attribute the final\r\ncatastrophe to ecclesiastical influence and domination. Perhaps when all\r\nhas been said, the state of Spain under Witica and Roderic was not much\r\nworse than under subsequent rulers of other dynasties; and the downfall\r\nmay have been due, not so much to the effeminacy of the vanquished, as\r\nto the extraordinary military genius of the conquerors. Historians would\r\nhave said little about the degeneracy of the Visigoths if the battle of\r\nthe Guadalete had had a different issue.\r\n\r\nThe Hispano-Goths, as Catholics, evinced a fanatical and intolerant\r\ntemper which had been conspicuously lacking in them as Arians. Harsh\r\nedicts continued to be promulgated against the Jews--then, as till a\r\nmuch later date, a most important element in the population of Toledo.\r\nThe unlucky Children of Israel may have derived in the intervals of\r\npersecution some malicious consolation from the bitter quarrels between\r\nthe king and the Catholic clergy. Witica was an enemy, or what was\r\nprobably regarded as the same thing, a would-be reformer of the Church.\r\nTo his impiety, indeed, monkish writers are fond of ascribing the\r\ndestruction of the Gothic kingdom. His predecessor, Egica, did not\r\nhesitate to condemn to excommunication, exile, and confiscation of\r\nproperty, Sisebert, the powerful Archbishop of Toledo. Perhaps some\r\nclerkly chronicler, by way of retaliation for this outrage upon his\r\norder, invented the following discreditable story, to be found in the\r\npages of Lozano.\r\n\r\nKing Egica had conceived an ardent passion for the beautiful Do\xc3\xb1a Luz,\r\nwho is described as the grand-daughter of Kindaswinth, and the sister of\r\nRoderic, afterwards king. Her love, however, was given to her uncle, Don\r\nFavila, Duke or Governor of Cantabria. The lovers, wearied at last by\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to their union, went through a secret and\r\nsimplified form of marriage in the lady\xe2\x80\x99s bedchamber before a statue of\r\nthe Virgin. In the course of time. Do\xc3\xb1a Luz became a mother. Egica\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspicions had already been enkindled, and fearing his wrath, she placed\r\nthe new-born infant in a little ark and set it afloat on the bosom of\r\nthe Tagus. As her maids pushed out the tiny craft from the foot of the\r\nsteep path that leads down from Toledo, a radiance diffused itself\r\naround the sleeping child and for long marked his passage down the broad\r\nstream. The irate monarch, divining that Do\xc3\xb1a Luz must in some way have\r\ndisposed of her child, caused a census to be taken of all the children\r\nborn in and around the city within the past three months with the names\r\nof the respective fathers. The number of births was recorded at\r\n35,428--a very surprising total for Toledo! And, which is still more\r\nremarkable and highly creditable to the city, the parentage of these\r\nnumerous infants was in every case authenticated. What then had become\r\nof Do\xc3\xb1a Luz\xe2\x80\x99s baby? Baffled in his quest, the king suborned one of his\r\nminions, Melias by name, to accuse the unfortunate lady of incontinency.\r\nThe penalty for this offence, we are told, was nothing less than death\r\nby fire; and for that fate Egica bade Do\xc3\xb1a Luz prepare, unless she could\r\nsecure a defender or otherwise clear her reputation. At the eleventh\r\nhour, the valorous champion appeared in the person of Don Favila, who\r\ndisproved the charge made against his lady-love to the satisfaction of\r\nmedi\xc3\xa6val intelligences, by the simple method of running her accuser\r\nthrough the body. This, however, did not satisfy the sceptical monarch,\r\nwho insisted on a further ordeal by combat. A knight named Bristes,\r\ncousin of the recreant Melias, was challenger and accuser on this\r\noccasion, and was quickly despatched by the doughty Favila.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the ark containing Pelayo, the infant child of Do\xc3\xb1a Luz\r\nand her champion, had reached Alcantara, where the little passenger\r\nalmost miraculously fell into the hands of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s other uncle,\r\nGrafeses. This benevolent prince took every care of the child,\r\nunsuspicious, of course, of his origin. Attracted to Court by the noise\r\nof these scandals and combats, he found a handkerchief in his niece\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, the counterpart of one which he had discovered in the little ark.\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Luz soon confessed to him the whole story, and he endeavoured to\r\nintercede for her with the king. Egica, probably more exasperated than\r\never, insisted on a third duel between Favila and a knight called\r\nLongaris. Both combatants had been wounded when a holy hermit appeared\r\non the scene, and admonished the king as to his wickedness and hardness\r\nof heart. Egica repented and consented to the public celebration of the\r\nmarriage of Favila and Do\xc3\xb1a Luz. Here we have a fine romantic account of\r\nthe origin of the heroic Pelayo, the restorer of the monarchy and the\r\nsaviour of the Spanish nation.\r\n\r\nWilder, more romantic still, and better known are the legends clustering\r\nround the last king of the Goths. The scene of most of these is laid in\r\nToledo. Here was held that wonderful tournament, to which resorted all\r\nthe crowned heads of Europe--aye, even such potentates as the Emperor of\r\nConstantinople and the King of Poland. A new city of palaces was reared\r\nin the Vega by the hospitable Roderic to accommodate his fifty thousand\r\nnoble guests. This splendid function may have taken place before or\r\nafter the king\xe2\x80\x99s strange marriage with the bewitching Moorish princess\r\nElyata (re-baptized Exilona), who had been washed ashore by the sea on\r\nthe coast of Valencia. Lovely as was his consort, Roderic did not, as we\r\nall know, remain faithful to her. Here enters the mournful and very\r\nshadowy figure of Florinda, otherwise known as La Cava. This peerless\r\ndamsel was confided to the care of the king by her father, the trusty\r\nJulian (or Ill\xc3\xa1n), governor of Ceuta. Alas for the maiden! while bathing\r\nin the Tagus, her charms were only too well revealed to Roderic, gazing\r\nfrom his palace windows on the cliff above. A glimpse of a shapely leg\r\nscarce concealed by a diaphanous mantle decided the fate of\r\nFlorinda--and of Spain. What he could not effect by persuasion, the\r\nking effected by violence. Perhaps he hoped that the proud Julian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter would keep silence as to her own dishonour. He was mistaken. A\r\ntrusty page, spurring night and day, quickly bore the fatal tidings to\r\nthe father at distant Ceuta, and the missive in which the wronged\r\nFlorinda implored vengeance on her betrayer.\r\n\r\nTo the no doubt conscience-stricken Roderic, seated in good old kingly\r\nfashion upon his throne, appeared two venerable strangers with a message\r\nof mysterious import. When Hercules had founded (as some men say)\r\nToledo, not far from the city, among the mountains, he had reared a\r\ntower, of which these uncouth brethren were the guardians, as their\r\nancestors, in an unbroken line, had been before them. On this tower and\r\non its unknown and fearful contents, the demigod had laid a necromantic\r\nspell. It had been the custom of each of the Kings of Spain to affix to\r\nthe massive doors a new lock, and now Roderic was summoned to fulfil\r\nthis duty, for failing this and if any rash mortal should discover the\r\nsecret of the tower, ruin, absolute and immediate, must overtake his\r\nkingdom. Agog with curiosity, with a brilliant cavalcade, the king\r\nclattered through the streets of his capital, and found the wondrous\r\ntower in the recesses of the hills. The aged custodians besought him to\r\nhasten and to affix his seal to the enchanted doors. In vain! it was\r\nwith another intention the impetuous sovereign had come hither. He burst\r\nopen the doors and rushed in, where never man since Hercules had dared\r\nto tread. Before him stood a gigantic statue in bronze, which dealt\r\nblows with a great mace unceasingly to right and left. On its breast\r\nwere inscribed the words, _I do my duty_. Roderic sternly adjured the\r\ncreature of enchantment to let him pass. It obeyed. In the interior of\r\nthe tower the King found a casket of rich workmanship. A legend thereon\r\nwarned him of the doom that would overtake him who should open it.\r\nRoderic forced open the lid. He beheld a fold of linen on which were\r\npainted the figures of Moorish warriors in battle-array. As he gazed the\r\nfigures seemed to move, to grow larger, to assume the proportions of\r\nmen. He beheld a battlefield where Goths and Moors contended for the\r\nmastery. Breathless, he awaited the issue. The Goths were flying, and he\r\nsaw his own white steed, Orelia, galloping through the fray--riderless.\r\nAffrighted, the king and his attendants rushed to the door. There lay\r\nthe two ancient custodians, dead. Thunder rolled, a storm burst over the\r\nland, and Roderic and his cavaliers drew not rein till they reached the\r\npalace of Toledo. Next day the stout-hearted Goths reascended to the\r\nhills. But as they approached, behold a great eagle swooped down from\r\nthe sky holding in its talons a flaming brand! The tower blazed up like\r\nmatchwood. Then arose a great wind which carried the ashes to every part\r\nof Spain; and every man on whom a portion of the ashes fell was\r\nafterwards slain in battle by the Moors.\r\n\r\nThese direful portents must surely have prepared Roderic for treachery,\r\nconspiracies, and unpleasantness of all kinds. But when Count Julian\r\narrived, smiling and deferential, to take his daughter home to Ceuta, he\r\nseems to have suspected nothing, feared nothing. The rest of the\r\nstory--Julian\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to the Moors, the rout of Guadalete, the\r\ndisappearance of Roderic--relates to the history of Spain generally, not\r\nto that of Toledo. Dozy believes that Julian actually existed, but he\r\nseems to have been a Byzantine governor of Ceuta, not a Spaniard. It is\r\nhardly necessary to say that Florinda is as much a figment of the\r\nimagination as the enchanted tower. Yet near the Puente de San Martin\r\n(above which never king\xe2\x80\x99s palace stood) some fragments of masonry are\r\npointed out as the Ba\xc3\xb1os de la Cava (Florinda\xe2\x80\x99s Bath). They are, in\r\nreality, but the remains of a Moorish tomb.\r\n\r\nIn July 711, King Roderic set out from Toledo, never to return. Upon the\r\nnews of the rout of Guadalete, all the magnates and prelates abandoned\r\nthe city. Its surrender to the Moorish host of the one-eyed Tarik was\r\nthe work of the Jews, who had not forgotten the persecutions of Sisebert\r\nand Egica. There were Jews in the invading army under the command of\r\nKaula-al-Yahudi. When Tarik appeared before the walls, a venerable\r\nIsraelite was let down in a basket, and, approaching him, offered to\r\nadmit him to the city if liberty and the free exercise of their religion\r\nwere guaranteed to his race. The Berber joyfully accepted these terms,\r\nand on the following day proud Toledo--deserted by its Christian\r\ninhabitants--was annexed to the Saracen Khalifate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOLEDO UNDER THE MOOR\r\n\r\n\r\nNever again was Toledo to attain to the wealth and splendour it\r\npossessed under Wamba and his successors. The invaders, fresh from the\r\nconquest of the richest provinces of Africa, were dazzled by the\r\nmagnificence of the spoils that fell to them in the dark-browed city\r\nabove the Tagus. The Arabian historians have need of all their powers of\r\nhyperbole to over-estimate the richness of the treasure. There was\r\nenough and to spare, Al Leyth Ibn Sa\xc3\xafd tells us, for every soldier in\r\nthe army. The humblest troopers might have been seen staggering under\r\nthe weight of priceless silks and garments, chains of gold, and strings\r\nof precious stones. The rude Berbers, fresh from their mountains, but\r\nill appreciated the value of the loot, and cut the costliest fabrics in\r\ntwo or more pieces to adjust their shares. A magnificent carpet,\r\ncomposed of superb embroidery, interwoven with gold and ornamented with\r\nfiligree work, and profusely set with gems, is said to have been treated\r\nin this way by the troopers into whose greedy hands it fell. It would be\r\ninteresting to learn the place of manufacture of this carpet, for from\r\nthe silence of St. Isidore upon the subject of textile fabrics, it would\r\nseem that they were not made in his time in Spain.\r\n\r\nBut, to credit the Moorish chroniclers, the rarest of exotic treasures\r\nhad been accumulated in the Visigothic capital. Here were found the\r\nPsalms of David, written upon gold leaf in a fluid made from dissolved\r\nrubies! and most wonderful of all, the Table of Solomon made out of a\r\nsingle emerald! It was brought to Toledo--so runs one version--after the\r\ntaking of Jerusalem, and was valued in Damascus at one hundred thousand\r\ndinars--equal to about \xc2\xa350,000. We are not surprised to hear that this\r\nunique piece of furniture \xe2\x80\x9cpossessed talismanic powers\xe2\x80\x9d; for tradition\r\naffirms it was the work of genii, and had been wrought by them for King\r\nSolomon the Wise, the son of David. This marvellous relic was carefully\r\npreserved by Tarik as the most precious of all his spoils, being\r\nintended by him as a present to the Khalifa; and, in commemoration of\r\nit, the city was called by the Arabs, Medina Almyda, that is to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe City of the Table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus far Washington Irving. With characteristic credulity, Ibn Hayyan,\r\nthe historian, gives in the translation of Gayangos a substantially\r\ndifferent account of the treasure: \xe2\x80\x9cThe celebrated table which Tarik\r\nfound at Toledo, although attributed to Solomon and named after him,\r\nnever belonged to the poet-king. According to the barbarian authors, it\r\nwas customary for the nobles and men in estimation of the Gothic Court,\r\nto bequeath a portion of their property to the church. From the money so\r\namassed the priests caused tables to be made of pure gold and silver,\r\ngorgeous thrones and stands on which to carry the Gospels in public\r\nprocessions, or to ornament the altars on great festivals. The so-called\r\nSolomon\xe2\x80\x99s table was originally wrought with money derived from this\r\nsource, and was subsequently emulously enlarged and embellished by\r\nsuccessive kings of Toledo, the latest always anxious to surpass his\r\npredecessor in magnificence, until it became the most splendid and\r\ncostly gem ever made for such a purpose. The fabric was of pure gold,\r\nset with the most precious pearls, emeralds and rubies. Its\r\ncircumference was encrusted with three rows of these valuable stones,\r\nand the whole table displayed jewels so large and refulgent that never\r\ndid human eye behold anything comparable with it.... When the Muslims\r\nentered Toledo it was discovered on the altar of the Christian Church,\r\nand the fact of such a treasure having been found soon became public and\r\nnotorious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGibbon accounts for the presence of the Table of Solomon at\r\nToledo--assuming that there ever was such a thing, and that it ever was\r\nthere at all--by supposing it to have been carried off by Titus to\r\nRome, whence it may have been taken by Alaric when the Goths sacked the\r\ncity. Whichever version of the table\xe2\x80\x99s origin be accepted, it seems\r\nstrange that it was not carried away by the clergy in their flight from\r\nToledo. Of its ultimate fate nothing is known, unless we can accept the\r\nlittle that is revealed in the following history.\r\n\r\nUpon Musa approaching the city to supersede Tarik, the latter broke off\r\nand concealed one of the legs of the table. Musa was already incensed\r\nagainst his lieutenant for having deprived him of the glory of the\r\nconquest of Spain, and emphasised his reprimands with strokes of a whip.\r\nWhen he found that the leg of the table was missing, his anger was very\r\ngreat. Tarik assured him he had found it in that mutilated condition,\r\nand Musa caused the missing leg to be replaced by one of gold. His\r\nsubordinate, however, he cast into prison, where the One-Eyed One\r\nremained till released by orders from the Khalifa himself. He was amply\r\nrevenged on Musa, when upon the latter presenting the table to his\r\nsovereign as his own discovery, he was able triumphantly to give him the\r\nlie by producing the missing leg of emerald. And so the wonderful Table\r\nof Solomon, of emerald, or of gold, or of both, passes out of the ken of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nWe hear of Musa\xe2\x80\x99s son, Abd-ul-Aziz (or \xe2\x80\x9cBelasis,\xe2\x80\x9d as he is quaintly\r\ntermed by old Spanish writers) marrying King Roderic\xe2\x80\x99s widow, Exilona,\r\nat Toledo. Abd-ul-Aziz, however, was Governor of Seville, where he met\r\nhis death, and it is not unlikely, if he married the queen at all, that\r\nhe did so in that southern city, where she may have been left by her\r\nfirst consort to await the result of the battle of the Guadalete. If\r\nthere be any truth in the legend that Exilona was of Moorish origin\r\nherself, the story of this second and apparently cold-blooded union\r\nseems less improbable. Tradition has it that the widow of the Goth only\r\nconsented to the match on Abd-ul-Aziz promising to observe towards her\r\nall the deference due to a Christian queen. He kept his promise only too\r\nfaithfully, and his forcing his officers to bend the knee to a woman and\r\nan infidel, is said to have contributed to bring about his assassination\r\nin the mosque at Seville.\r\n\r\nThe conquerors here, as in other parts of the kingdom, acted generously\r\ntowards the conquered. A moderate tribute was levied on the Christians,\r\nwho were allowed to practise their religion and be governed by their own\r\nlaws and customs. Seven churches were allotted to their use, the names\r\nof these being Santa Eulalia, Santa Maria de Alficem, Santa Justa, San\r\nSebastian, San Marcos, San Torcuato, and San Lucas. But these privileges\r\nmust have hardly consoled the citizens for the loss of the town\xe2\x80\x99s rank\r\nas capital of Spain. It became, as it had been under the Romans, \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nstrong place,\xe2\x80\x9d of which the dominant race valued the advantages, but, in\r\nconsequence of the rise of Cordoba and Seville it sank to the condition\r\nof a provincial town.\r\n\r\nAs such its career was throughout stormy and turbulent. The spirit of\r\nrebellion seemed instinct in the grim fortress-like city, and infused\r\nitself into Mohammedan and Christian, Arab and Castilian alike. The two\r\nraces fraternised well enough. They had a common interest: resistance to\r\nany external authority. This impatience of control was characteristic of\r\nthe Toledans for centuries. Its annals during the period of Mohammedan\r\noccupation are a tedious record of sieges, riots, usurpations and\r\nmassacres. Such events are only of interest when studied in the minutest\r\ndetail. A brief _r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9_ of them is, however, indispensable to a proper\r\nknowledge of the town.\r\n\r\nThe citizens\xe2\x80\x99 first appearance in the troubled arena of Muslim politics\r\nwas as loyalists--an uncongenial _r\xc3\xb4le_! In the civil wars that\r\ndistracted the reign of Abd-ul-Malik, Toledo was held by his son Omeya,\r\nand vainly besieged for a month by the rebels. On the approach of\r\nAbd-ul-Malik, the garrison, wishful of glory, made a vigorous sortie and\r\ncompletely routed the investing force. The townsmen had tasted blood.\r\nIt took much to quench their thirst. Knowing their character, in the\r\ntroubles fomented by the pretender Yusaf ben Debri, his partisan,\r\nMohammed Abu-l-Aswad took refuge among them in the year of the Hegira\r\n142. The place was immediately invested by the Wizir, Al Kama, and as\r\nusual offered a stout resistance. Wearied of their ruler, however, the\r\npeople played him false and betrayed the town to the Wizir. Abu-l-Aswad\r\nwas taken prisoner and sent to Cordoba.\r\n\r\nA year or two later the Toledans repented of their submission. While the\r\nAmir, Abd-ur-Rahman, was engaged in preparations for a war in the east\r\nof Spain, some powerful families, led by one Hixem ben Adra al Fehri,\r\nrose, seized the Alcazar, and put the Wizir to flight. They released the\r\nnotorious rebel, Kasim ben Yusuf, from prison, and raised an army of\r\nabout ten thousand men--mostly freebooters and masterless men who seemed\r\nto have regarded Toledo as the best market for their peculiar talents.\r\nThe Amir\xe2\x80\x99s appearance before the walls, with a powerful army, caused\r\nmoderate counsels to prevail among the insurgents. The citizens were\r\nanxious to be rid of the undesirables they had invited into their midst,\r\nand persuaded Hixem to visit the royal camp to solicit terms.\r\nAbd-ur-Rahman generously pardoned him, and once more incarcerating\r\nKasim, left the town to itself.\r\n\r\nHe soon had good reason to repent his forbearance. In 763 Kasim escaped\r\nfrom confinement, rallied the citizens round him, and declared the town\r\nsubject only to the Khalifa of Damascus. The siege that followed was\r\nlanguidly conducted. The people, we read, were suffered to cultivate\r\ntheir fields, and to carry produce into the city unmolested. At this\r\nrate the siege might have lasted as long as that of Candia. Kasim,\r\nmeanwhile lulled into a sense of security, abused his power, and\r\nalienated his unruly subjects. On the arrival of the Amir, he was given\r\nnotice to quit. Having seen him successfully elude the royal forces,\r\nToledo opened its gates to Abd-ur-Rahman. The Amir, despairing of the\r\ntownsmen\xe2\x80\x99s temper, exacted from them but a nominal obedience, but his\r\nsuccessor, Hakam, thought to coerce them by a bitter lesson. As\r\nGovernor, he sent them one Amru of Huesca, a renegade Christian, \xe2\x80\x9cby a\r\ncondescension,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich proves our extreme solicitude for your\r\ninterests.\xe2\x80\x9d The renegade\xe2\x80\x99s policy was thorough. He ingratiated himself\r\nwith the people, and posed as the champion of their liberties. It was at\r\ntheir own suggestion that he raised a fortress in their very midst. The\r\nplace being strongly garrisoned and all being ready, the approach of a\r\nlarge army, commanded by the Amir\xe2\x80\x99s son, Abd-ur-Rahman, was announced.\r\nAt the suggestion of the Governor, the prince was invited by the\r\nnobility into the city; and he, in return, as if to mark his sense of\r\nthe honour conferred upon him, ordered a great feast to be made ready at\r\nthe Castle. To this all the chief men were bidden. What followed is\r\nknown as the Day of the Fosse. The guests were allowed to enter only one\r\nby one. Behind the gate stood a man with bared arm and uplifted axe. As\r\neach guest entered there was a sweep of the arm, a flash of steel, and a\r\nhead rolled into the ditch already prepared. Without, nothing was heard,\r\nnothing was seen, nothing suspected. The episode reminds one of the\r\nfamous Blood Bath of Stockholm. The butchery is said at last to have\r\nbeen revealed to those waiting outside the wall by the thick vapour\r\nissuing from the gate. A physician, who had been watching for hours, and\r\nwho had noticed that none of the numerous guests who had entered, had\r\nissued forth, was the first to raise the alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cMen of Toledo,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nshouted, \xe2\x80\x9cI vow that yonder vapour is not the smoke of a feast, but\r\nrises from the blood of our butchered brethren!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis ghastly tragedy occurred in 807, and has given rise to a proverbial\r\nexpression current in Spanish--_una noche Toledana_, applied to a night\r\ndisagreeably passed in sleeplessness or pain.\r\n\r\nThe blow struck by the ferocious Amru was of the kind that alone met\r\nwith the approval of Macchiavelli: it not only intimidated, but it\r\ncrushed. For a quarter of a century we hear no more of tumults or\r\ndissensions in the City by the Tagus. Meantime it prospered. Arts and\r\nletters flourished. In the year 827 we have to record the death \xe2\x80\x9cof the\r\nvery learned alfaqui, Isa ben Dinar el Ghafeki, a native of that city\r\nand a disciple of Malik ben Anas. He was a man beloved by all--friendly\r\nin manner, admirable in conversation, and upright of life: such as were\r\ntaught by Isa ben Dinar acquired their learning with delight. He was in\r\nthe habit of practising some few observances that were considered\r\nextraordinary: he made, for example, the prayer of the dawn with the\r\npreparation and ablutions proper to that of the evening twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe opulence of the Jews and Christians decided the Wali, Aben Maf\xc3\xbbt ben\r\nIbrahim, to increase their tribute. This led to the outbreak of 832. A\r\nwealthy young citizen, named Hakam el Atiki, otherwise known as El\r\nDurrete, or \xe2\x80\x9cthe striker of blows,\xe2\x80\x9d had been insulted by the Wali, and\r\nused the discontent of the people as a means of avenging his injuries.\r\nHe distributed money freely among the more inflammable sections of the\r\npopulace, and collected about him a body of lawless followers. One of\r\nthese was seized in the Soko, or market-place (the Zocodover) by one of\r\nthe Wali\xe2\x80\x99s officers, and a tumult at once uprose. In the end the\r\nAlcazar fell into the hands of the rebels, and the Wali barely escaped\r\nwith his life. Hakam, however, was shortly afterwards obliged to abandon\r\nhis conquest, and spread abroad the report that he had left the country.\r\nThe vigilance of the garrison becoming in consequence relaxed, he seized\r\nthe city by a _coup de main_, and held it for some years. He was\r\nwounded, taken prisoner, and beheaded in 837, by Abd-el-Raf, his head\r\nbeing suspended from the gate of Bisagra.\r\n\r\nSo far the risings at Toledo had been mainly political, and the townsmen\r\nhad sunk their religious and racial differences to make common cause\r\nagainst the stranger. The cause of the insurrection of 854 was, by\r\nexception, an outburst of fanaticism on the part of the Muzarabes or\r\nChristians, who practised the ritual of the Spanish Goths. It was at\r\nthis time that the Catholics of Cordoba and Seville, subject to some\r\nextraordinary aberration, had in great numbers earned the doubtful\r\nhonour of martyrdom by blaspheming Mohammed. To Toledo, as the most\r\nlikely spot at which to create a disturbance, came Eulogius and stirred\r\nthe Christians to avenge the \xe2\x80\x9cwrongs\xe2\x80\x9d of their co-religionists. Under\r\nthe leadership of Sindola, they dispossessed their Moorish governors,\r\nand carrying the war into the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s own country, defeated the Amir\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforces at Andujar. Ordo\xc3\xb1o King of Leon, now came to the assistance of\r\nthe citizens, who, hitherto, had shown no eagerness to call in the help\r\nof the Christians of the north. Mohammed, the Amir, presently appeared\r\nbefore Toledo, and drew the allied forces into an ambush. The Christians\r\nwere totally defeated--almost annihilated. Nothing daunted, the\r\nToledans, later on, insulted their sovereign by electing Eulogius to the\r\nvacant archiepiscopal see. Mohammed, by way of reprisal, inveigled a\r\nlarge force of Christians on to a bridge which he had undermined. It was\r\nthe Day of the Fosse over again.\r\n\r\nIn the year 873, we find the independence of Toledo, subject to his\r\nsuzerainty, nominally acknowledged by the Amir, who was probably glad to\r\nmake any terms that promised peace with vassals so turbulent. In the\r\nreign of the Amir Al Mundhir even this faint shadow of outside authority\r\nwas shaken off by the city, which again asserted its complete\r\nindependence, in 886, under Ibn Hafs\xc3\xbbn. The town was besieged by the\r\nroyal forces under the Wizir Haksim. The wily Ibn Hafs\xc3\xbbn, seeing that\r\nthe stronghold must fall, proposed to the opposing general that he\r\nshould allow him to evacuate the place and transport his army to the\r\nfrontier of Valencia, on a train of beasts of burden to be provided by\r\nthe besiegers. Haksim joyfully assented to this capitulation, and on the\r\nday appointed, what was supposed to be the entire army of the rebel\r\nchief issued from the gates of the city and wended their way, with the\r\ntrain of packhorses, eastwards. Leaving what he considered a sufficient\r\ngarrison in Toledo, Haksim drew off the greater part of his forces and\r\nwent to Cordoba. Meanwhile the crafty Hafs\xc3\xbbn swiftly retraced his steps,\r\nand with the aid of the considerable detachment he had left concealed in\r\nthe town, put the garrison to the sword, and once more hurled defiance\r\nat the Amir. Great was Al Mundhir\xe2\x80\x99s wrath on the receipt of this\r\nintelligence, and before nightfall, the head of Haksim lay severed from\r\nhis body.\r\n\r\nIbn Hafs\xc3\xbbn proved a formidable antagonist. The Amir lead an army against\r\nhim in 888 and was defeated and killed. Twenty years later Hafs\xc3\xbbn died,\r\nbequeathing what was practically an independent sovereignty to his son.\r\nThe great Khalifa, Abd-ur-Rahman III., now sat on the throne of Cordoba.\r\nHe determined to put an end to the arrogant pretensions of the unruly,\r\nuntameable city. His summons to capitulate being contemptuously\r\nrejected, he took the field in 930. For eight years the siege went on,\r\nvaried by exploits and incidents, which might prove matter for a Moorish\r\nIliad. Famine stalked abroad in the obstinate city, but the Hafs\xc3\xbbns\r\nwould not hear of surrender. When at last it became plain that the\r\npeople would yield, the leaders and their partisans, to the number of\r\nfour thousand, made a last desperate sortie. Two thousand cavaliers,\r\nwith a foot-soldier clutching firmly hold of each horse\xe2\x80\x99s girth, they\r\nbroke through Abd-ur-Rahman\xe2\x80\x99s camp, and got clean away. Almost joyfully\r\nthe townsmen opened their gates to the great Amir--to be firmly bitted\r\nand bridled during the remainder of his reign.\r\n\r\nThat the town was still subject to the central authority in the year\r\n979, we gather from this incident. The Governor, Abd-ul-Malik Ibn Merw\xc3\xa2n\r\nhaving some difference with the Wali of Medina Selim (Medinaceli),\r\nchallenged him to single combat and slew him. For this, without more\r\nado, he was removed from office by orders from Cordoba.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of the eleventh century, Toledo recovered her\r\nfreedom, on the break-up of the Umeyyah empire. Under her sultan,\r\nIsmail, in 1023, she was able to boast that she knew no other lord or\r\nruler under the blue heavens. After Ismail came Abu-l-Hasan Yahya al\r\nRam\xc3\xa2n who reigned till 1075, and was then succeeded by Yahya Kadir, who\r\nlost his throne in 1085.\r\n\r\nBefore relating the incidents of the reconquest of Toledo by the\r\nChristians and its incorporation in the steadily expanding kingdom of\r\nLeon, we will take a glance at the city as it was under its Mohammedan\r\nrulers. Of its affluence, importance, and strength, the foregoing\r\ncursory sketch of its history has afforded us some idea. It ranked as\r\nthe metropolis of the Christian element in the Amir\xe2\x80\x99s dominions, and its\r\nprelates early obtained recognition from their Paynim sovereigns as\r\ndignitaries of the highest standing. Among them were such notable men as\r\nWistremir and Eulogius. One of the archbishops of Toledo, Elipando,\r\nembraced the heresy of Nestorius, and went the length of excommunicating\r\nhis fellow bishops. Upon his death, however, an orthodox successor was\r\nchosen. The Christians were wealthy and arrogant. They were classed in\r\ncongregations, dependent on their various churches, each division\r\nincluding certain families irrespective of their domiciles. Toledo,\r\nduring the three and a half centuries of Mohammedan dominion, never\r\nseems to have lost the outward character of a Christian town. Moorish\r\ninfluence she felt, and it served to soften and chasten her rough\r\nfeatures, but Moorish she never became as did Seville and Cordoba. Yet\r\nin every corner of the old city the guides are prone to point out the\r\nbuildings and remains that they fondly believe to be of Arabic\r\nworkmanship. In reality, very few monuments of the Mohammedan period\r\nhave survived. It is not by what we see but by what we read that we can\r\nform an idea of the city as it was in those days.\r\n\r\nIt was renowned for its clepsydras or water-clocks, invented by\r\nAbu-l-Kasim. These are described as follows in an Arabic document: \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nwhat is marvellous and surprising in Toledo, and what we believe no\r\nother town in all the world has anything to equal, are its water-clocks.\r\nIt is said that Az-Zagral [Abu-l-Kasim] hearing of a certain talisman\r\nwhich is in the city of Arin, of Eastern India, and which shows the\r\nhours by means of _aspas_ or hands, from the time the sun rises till it\r\nsets, determined to fabricate an artifice by means of which the people\r\ncould know the hour of day or night, and calculate the day of the moon.\r\nHe made two great ponds in a house on the bank of the Tagus, near the\r\nGate of the Tanners, making them so that they should be filled with\r\nwater or emptied according to the rise and fall of the moon.\xe2\x80\x9d The water\r\nbegan to flow into the ponds as soon as the moon became visible, and at\r\ndawn they were four-sevenths full. The water rose by one-seventh every\r\ntwenty-four hours, and were full at full moon. As the luminary waned,\r\nthe water fell in exact proportion. The exact working of these\r\ncontrivances was lost when an astronomer, deputed by Alfonso el Sabio to\r\nexamine them, broke parts of the intricate machinery.\r\n\r\nThe chroniclers relate wonders of the palace of An Na\xc3\xb4ra, so called from\r\nits celebrated _noria_ or hydraulic apparatus. The apartments were so\r\nsplendid as to rival those of the palace of the Amir himself, and \xe2\x80\x9cwere\r\nresplendent as the sun at noonday, and the moon at the full.\xe2\x80\x9d In the\r\nluxurious gardens was the lake or albuhera, in the centre of which rose\r\na pavilion of glass, where Al Ram\xc3\xa2n-bil-Lah, the last sovereign of\r\nToledo, used to pass the night. \xe2\x80\x9cThe clever architects\xe2\x80\x9d--we quote from\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cMonumentos Arquitect\xc3\xb3nicos\xe2\x80\x9d--who made the lake, not only raised the\r\nwaters from the river in order to fill it, but raised them above the\r\ncupola of the pavilion, over and around which they flowed incessantly,\r\nforming around it a diaphanous and crystalline mantle. Not a drop could\r\npenetrate the structure or touch the persons within. With the sonorous\r\nmurmur of these waters mingled that produced by the fountains that\r\ngushed forth from the mouths of the lions in metal guarding this\r\nwonderful pavilion. Illumined inside with lamps of various colours,\r\nwithout it presented a fantastic appearance, which was reflected back\r\nfrom the waters of the lake, and which the people of Toledo contemplated\r\nwith admiration through the dense foliage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf this exquisite pleasaunce, no trace remains. Nor is anything left of\r\nthe other palace of Al Hizem, built by Isma\xc3\xael, the first admittedly\r\nindependent Sultan of Toledo--afterwards inhabited by the Christian\r\nkings. The principal building in Moorish times was, of course, the\r\nAljama, or Chief Mosque. This seems to have been erected at the same\r\ntime as the great Mezquita at Cordoba, in the reign of Abd-ur-Rahman\r\nII., and to have been richly embellished and enlarged under the third\r\nand greatest Khalifa of that name. We read that in the fourth century of\r\nthe Hegira, the architect Fatho ben Ibrahim el Caxevi built two\r\nsumptuous mosques, called, the one, Adabejin, the other Gebel Berida;\r\nbut where these were situated, or what was the real Arabic spelling of\r\nthe names, we have no means of knowing.\r\n\r\nHappily a few specimens of the local architecture of that epoch remain.\r\nOf these one of the learned compilers of the \xe2\x80\x9cMonumentos\r\nArquitect\xc3\xb3nicos\xe2\x80\x9d writes: \xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of their varying degrees of\r\nintegrity, and although greatly damaged and changed by later\r\nrestorations, these works possess an extreme importance, and suffice to\r\nmanifest the peculiar physiognomy of the secondary religious edifices of\r\nthis part of the Peninsula at the most glorious epoch of the\r\nKhalifate--a physiognomy strikingly different from that of the principal\r\nreligious structures, or Aljamas, equivalent to our cathedrals, and\r\ndifferent also from that of the same buildings in the south. They show,\r\nfurthermore, decorative processes believed to have been unknown in\r\nSpain at that epoch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe most complete and remarkable of these buildings is the Mosque of\r\nBib-el-Mardom, now known as the Cristo de la Luz. It is situated to the\r\nnorth of the city, between the Puerta del Sol and the Puerta Bisagra.\r\nHere Alfonso VI., on entering Toledo on May 25, 1085, halted and caused\r\nMass to be celebrated, leaving his shield behind him as a memento of the\r\nincident.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of this most interesting building is unpromising. It is\r\nthus described by Mr. Street: \xe2\x80\x9cThe exterior face of the walls is built\r\nof brick and rough stone. The lower part of the side wall is arcaded\r\nwith three round arches, within the centre of which is a round horseshoe\r\narch for a doorway; above is a continuous sunk arcade of cusped arches,\r\nwithin which are window openings with round horse-shoe heads. The lower\r\npart of the walls is cut with single courses of brick, alternating with\r\nrough stonework; the piers and arches of brick, with projecting labels\r\nand strings also of unmoulded brick. The arches of the upper windows are\r\nbuilt with red and green bricks alternated.\xe2\x80\x9d Restorations carried out in\r\n1899 brought to light a most interesting pierced frieze running round\r\nthe north-eastern fa\xc3\xa7ade, and serving as a sort of ventilator. Above was\r\ndeciphered the following inscription in Arabic characters: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the name\r\nof God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. This mosque was rebuilt ... the\r\nrenewal of its upper part, proposing to render it more beautiful, and\r\n[the restoration] was finished, with the help of God, under the\r\ndirection of Musa Ibn Ali, the architect, and of Saada. It was completed\r\nin the Muharram of the year 370\xe2\x80\x9d [July 17, 979, to August 15, 980 A.D.]\r\nThe whole fa\xc3\xa7ade of the edifice has been much disfigured by successive\r\nreconstructions, coatings of plaster, &c., and has undergone much more\r\nserious transformation than the interior.\r\n\r\nEntering when the eyes have become accustomed to the obscurity, we make\r\nout the details of a very small and curious structure. Again to quote\r\nMr. Street, the nave is only \xe2\x80\x9c21 ft. 7\xc2\xbc in. by 20 ft. 2 in., and this\r\nspace is subdivided into nine compartments by four very low circular\r\ncolumns, which are about a foot in diameter. Their capitals are all\r\ndifferent. The arches, of which four spring from each capital, are all\r\nof the round horseshoe form; above them is a string-course, and all the\r\nintermediate walls are carried up to the same height as the main walls.\r\nThey are all pierced above the arches with arcades of varied design,\r\ngenerally cusped in very Moorish fashion, and supported on shafts; and\r\nabove these each of the nine divisions is crowned with a little vault,\r\nformed by intersecting cusped ribs, thrown in the most fantastic way\r\nacross each other, and varied in each compartment. The scale of the\r\nwhole work is so diminutive that it is difficult, no doubt, to\r\nunderstand how so much is done in so small a space; but looking to the\r\nearly date of the work it is impossible not to feel very great respect\r\nfor the workmen who built it, and for the ingenious intricacy which has\r\nmade their work look so much larger and important than it really is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAfter the Reconquest, the loftier portion of the temple, consisting of\r\napse and transept, and containing the altar, was added. Looking closer\r\ninto the details of the Moorish portion, one is struck by the contrast\r\npresented by rude shafts and capitals, evidently of Visigothic\r\nworkmanship, with the general elegance and delicacy of the whole. On\r\nmaking a careful study of these features, it is difficult to resist the\r\nconclusion (supported, indeed, by tradition) that they formed part of an\r\nearlier and less skilfully constructed mosque, itself merely a\r\nrestoration or adaptation of a Visigothic church. Se\xc3\xb1or Amador de los\r\nRios is of opinion that the existing structure constituted only the\r\ninner portion or _maksurah_ of the temple, and believes that the\r\nsouthern wall is the only part of the outer or enclosing _enceinte_\r\nremaining. In this he finds traces of the _kiblah_ or sanctuary,\r\n_membar_, and other features peculiar to Mohammedan worship. The mosque\r\nconsisted originally, in all probability, in addition to the fabric we\r\nnow see, of naves extending on each side of those still standing, from\r\nnorth-east to south-west. Even thus the mosque must have been very\r\nsmall. The exact configuration and plan of the original building is\r\nstill a matter of great perplexity to arch\xc3\xa6ologists, and a great many\r\nmore discoveries remain to be made before anything can be positively\r\nstated under this head.\r\n\r\nThe newer, or Christian, portion of the mosque contains some remarkable\r\nmural paintings, discovered in 1871. They date from about the close of\r\nthe twelfth century, and exhibit pronounced Byzantine influence. It\r\nseems satisfactorily established that two of the four female figures\r\nrepresent Saints Eulalia and Martiana; and the other two, in all\r\nprobability, the martyrs Leocadia and Obdulia. The fifth figure--that of\r\na man--represents a prelate. It may be, as Mr. Leonard Williams thinks,\r\nthe Archbishop Bernardo, who figures largely in the annals of the\r\nReconquest; or the prelate\xe2\x80\x99s patron saint. It is not to that archbishop,\r\nhowever, but to one of his successors--possibly Don Gonzalo Perez\r\n(1182-1193)--that the remodelling of the building into a Christian place\r\nof worship should be ascribed.\r\n\r\nThis intensely interesting monument is the subject of several curious\r\nand entertaining legends. In the days of Athanagild (and it is not\r\nimpossible, as we know, that the church may have existed at that time) a\r\ncrucifix, greatly venerated by the citizens, hung over the door. Two\r\nevil-minded Jews, Sacao and Abishai by name, to express their hatred for\r\nChristianity, drove a lance into the side of the figure. Instantly blood\r\ngushed forth. The terrified Israelites hid the miraculous object in\r\ntheir own home, but were traced by the stains of blood, and (it is\r\nhardly necessary to add) torn to pieces. This irritated their\r\nco-religionists, who, to avenge them, poisoned the feet of the statue.\r\nThis resulted in a second miracle, for when a devout woman was about to\r\nkiss the feet, they were withdrawn--to the discovery and undoing, once\r\nmore, of the villainous Jews. The right foot of the image remains\r\nwithdrawn to the present day, that all men may know the truth of the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nNow we come to the explanation of the name \xe2\x80\x9cCristo de la Luz.\xe2\x80\x9d When the\r\nMoors were about to take the city, the Christians walled up the\r\nmiraculous crucifix, with a lamp burning before it. Three hundred and\r\nseventy years passed; and on the glorious May 25, 1085, Alfonso VI. and\r\nhis Christian chivalry came riding into reconquered Toledo. Among the\r\ncavaliers was the Cid, Ruy Diaz de Bivar. The warrior\xe2\x80\x99s horse, on\r\npassing the mosque, stumbled, or, as others have it, knelt. With\r\npreternatural acuteness, the Cid suspected some unusual circumstance,\r\nand had the adjacent wall broken down. Then was discovered the crucifix\r\nwith the lamp still burning brightly, as when placed there nearly four\r\ncenturies before. The mosque was reconsecrated on the spot; and the King\r\nleft his shield as a memento. There it hangs to-day, above the central\r\narch, bearing a white cross on a crimson ground. Whether it is authentic\r\nor not, we cannot say, but below it one may read: _Esto es el escudo que\r\ndejo en esta ermita el Rey Don Alfonso VI., cuando gan\xc3\xb3 \xc3\xa1 Toledo y se\r\ndijo aqui la primera misa._\r\n\r\nThe Cristo de la Luz is no longer a church, and is now classed among the\r\nnational monuments of Spain.\r\n\r\nHardly less interesting, but very far from being as well known, is the\r\nancient mosque in the Calle de las Tornerias. It is contained in the\r\nupper part of the private houses numbered 27, 29, and 31. The mosque\r\nhaving been built against a steep incline, it was raised on a\r\nsubstructure of galleries, which now form the ground floor of the modern\r\nhouses. The mosque was never converted to Christian uses, and retains\r\nits original physiognomy almost unimpaired. In the opinion of Spanish\r\narch\xc3\xa6ologists, it belongs to the same period as the Cristo de la Luz;\r\nbut Street does not share this view, and thinks it a later work. Like\r\nthe other mosque, it is built more or less in the form of a square, and\r\nhas likewise Visigothic columns and capitals, pointing to the existence\r\nof a previous structure. Here, also, we find the horseshoe arch and the\r\ncupola, and evidences of the position of the kiblah. Recent restorations\r\nhave shown that the walls are composed of the finest brickwork,\r\nunsurpassed for smoothness and regularity. But so far no trace has been\r\nrevealed of any texts from the Koran, or inscription commemorating the\r\narchitect\xe2\x80\x99s name, such as were usual in the Mohammedan temples of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Puerta Antigua de Bisagra, or ancient gate of Bisagra--not to be\r\nconfounded with the new gate of the same name built by Charles V.--is\r\ndilapidated and falling to pieces. In Moorish times it was the principal\r\nentrance to the city. The name was probably originally Bib-Sahla. It\r\ndates from about the beginning of the tenth century, but to the\r\nprimitive structure only the foundations of the gate belong. A\r\nreconstruction seems to have been carried out at the time of the\r\nReconquest, and to that epoch the arch, or gate, properly speaking, may\r\nbe assigned. The upper portion of the time-worn fabric belongs to a\r\nstill later period. This is the only one remaining of the fifteen gates\r\nwith which the walls of Toledo appear to have been furnished during the\r\nMohammedan occupation.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Puente de Alcantara, as it exists to-day, must be\r\nregarded as the work of the Christians. It took the place of a\r\nstructure, built or restored by the Musulmans, and regarded by the\r\nwriters of their time and nation as one of the wonders of Spain.\r\nAccording to an inscription on the bridge tower, the work dated from the\r\nyear 997 A.D., and was built by \xe2\x80\x9cAlif, son of Mohammed Al Ameri,\r\nGovernor of Toledo, under the great Wizir, Al Mans\xc3\xbbr.\xe2\x80\x9d With it, no\r\ndoubt, were incorporated the remains of previous Gothic and Roman\r\nconstructions. It was almost entirely swept away in a great flood in the\r\nyear 1258, after having already undergone extensive repairs and\r\nrestorations since the Reconquest. Thus we may conclude that there can\r\nbe few if any traces of the Moorish bridge in the actual Puente de\r\nAlcantara. On the other side of the town there was probably a wooden\r\nbridge or bridge of boats, where the Puente de San Martin now spans the\r\nriver. A little below it is a brick tower, with open arches, the\r\nhorseshoe curve of which, and other features, bespeak its Moorish\r\norigin. Legend places here the incident of the Bath of Florinda. In\r\nlater times the work was believed to be the remains of a bridge. But an\r\nArabic inscription, recently redeciphered and translated, goes to prove\r\nthat the tower formed part of a very different monument: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the Name of\r\nGod, the Merciful, the Compassionate! Oh, men, believe that the promises\r\nof God are certain and let not yourselves be seduced by the flattery of\r\nthe world, nor be lured away from God by the deceits of the Evil One!\r\nThis is the tomb of Hos\xc3\xa0m (?)-ben-Abd ... [He confessed that there is no\r\nother God but] God. He died [may God have mercy on him] ... the year\r\neight ... and four hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d The Ba\xc3\xb1os de la Cava may now be safely\r\nregarded as a Musulman sepulchral monument of the fifth century after\r\nthe Hegira.\r\n\r\nWe have now briefly considered the only monuments of interest to any but\r\nthe most ardent arch\xc3\xa6ologists that can be ascribed, so far as their\r\ngeneral structure is concerned, to the Moslem lords of Toledo. Admitting\r\nthat the most important buildings of that time have long since\r\ndisappeared, it remains clear that the city could never have presented\r\nthe Oriental aspect of the Andalusian seats of Islam.\r\n\r\nThe history of the city as an independent State is soon told. Under\r\nIsmail and his son Al Mam\xc3\xbbn, Toledo became the most powerful Musulman\r\nState in Spain. The lesser principalities having been disposed of, a\r\nfierce struggle for supremacy was waged between Al Mam\xc3\xbbn and the Amir\r\nof Seville. A desperate battle before the walls of Murcia decided the\r\nissue in favour of the Toledan, and gave Valencia into his hands. But,\r\nas is often the case with men of all ranks, Al Mam\xc3\xbbn\xe2\x80\x99s strength and\r\nwisdom were undone and rendered unavailing by his fatal trait of\r\nmagnanimity.\r\n\r\nAlfonso of Leon, dispossessed of his kingdom by his brother, threw\r\nhimself upon the protection of the Amir of Tolaitola. The noble Muslim\r\nbestowed upon the fugitive prince a palace near his own, an oratory, and\r\na garden \xe2\x80\x9cwherein to recreate himself\xe2\x80\x9d; and allowed him to establish a\r\nminiature Court for himself and his followers at Brihuega. Lands were\r\nassigned to him as a source of revenue, and he became the most intimate\r\nand honoured friend of the Amir. It is said that in return an oath was\r\nexacted of Alfonso that he would assist his host against all men, and\r\nnever war upon him or his son. That some such pledge should have been\r\nasked for in return for such magnificent hospitality seems very\r\nprobable. The Archbishop Don Rodrigo relates that one day Al Mam\xc3\xbbn found\r\nhimself with his most trusty counsellors in a wood from which a full\r\nview of the city could be obtained. The Moorish sovereign fell to\r\ndiscoursing upon the defences of the place and the best means of\r\nattacking it. These words were overheard by Alfonso, who chanced to be\r\nby, and who at once feigned sleep beneath a tree. Here he was presently\r\ndiscovered by the Moors, to their great dismay. Some among them asked\r\nleave of Al Mam\xc3\xbbn to slay him. On this permission being indignantly\r\nrefused, they dropped hot lead on the Leonese prince\xe2\x80\x99s hand to see if he\r\nwere really asleep. Alfonso did not stir, which would have convinced\r\nmost people that he was feigning sleep. The Muslims, on the contrary,\r\nretired, satisfied that he had heard nothing and seen nothing.\r\n\r\nBefore returning to his kingdom, the Christian prince renewed his vows\r\nof loyalty and friendship to Al Mam\xc3\xbbn, with whom personally, indeed, he\r\nnever broke faith. The Moor\xe2\x80\x99s son, Yahya, reaped the reward of the\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s generosity. A weak and incapable sovereign, addicted to luxury\r\nand despised for his devotion to superstitious practices, he was\r\ndetested by his own subjects, who on one occasion drove him out of the\r\ncity, to take refuge at Cuenca. His authority was restored only with the\r\nhelp of his natural foes, the Castilians. Alfonso, unmindful of his vow,\r\nforgetful of the dead Al Mam\xc3\xbbn\xe2\x80\x99s princely generosity, could not resist\r\nthis opportunity of adding to his dominions the old capital of the Kings\r\nof Spain. For six years he laid waste the frontiers of the Amirate, and\r\nin the seventh year--carefully availing himself, no doubt, of the\r\ninformation unwittingly communicated by his old benefactor--invested\r\nToledo itself. Famine accomplished what arms could not, Yahya asked for\r\nterms. They were onerous enough. They involved the cession of all the\r\nMoorish King\xe2\x80\x99s dominions, except Valencia, the Muslims who elected to\r\nremain in Toledo being guaranteed the free exercise of their religion,\r\ntheir property, and liberty. They were to be subject to their own laws\r\nand tribunals and to retain their mosques. The terms, as remarks\r\nQuadrado, were, in fact, almost the same as those granted to the\r\nChristians by the Arabs three hundred and seventy years before. Only the\r\nAlcazar, the bridges, gates, and the garden called the Huerta del Rey,\r\nwere reserved to Alfonso himself. The capitulation completed, Yahya and\r\nhis court took the road to Valencia, and Alfonso VI. entered Toledo by\r\nthe Bib-el-Mardom on Sunday, May 25, 1085.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay God renew her past splendour, and inscribe once more the name of\r\nToledo on the list of the cities of Isl\xc3\xa2m!\xe2\x80\x9d This was the devout\r\naspiration of a Muslim chronicler, but in neither particular has it ever\r\nbeen fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOLEDO THE CAPITAL OF CASTILE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe incorporation of the haughty city of the Visigoths with the kingdom\r\nof Castile was, when the first wave of enthusiasm had subsided, regarded\r\nwith coldness and misgiving by its people. The Toledans were as\r\ntenacious as ever of their peculiar customs and privileges which they\r\nhad hoped to maintain intact. Even with the powerful assistance of the\r\nCid, whom he appointed Alcalde, Alfonso found the ordering of the\r\naffairs of his new capital a difficult and dangerous task. The\r\npopulation included (remarks Don Jose Quadrado) \xe2\x80\x9cthe conquered and\r\nresigned Musulman, the Israelite ever submissive and industrious, the\r\nMozarabe ennobled by his ancient lineage and constancy in his faith, the\r\nCastilian, proud of his conquests, the foreigner rewarded for his\r\nprowess, or attracted from remote countries by signal privileges; and\r\nthis multiplicity of races and diversity of creeds demanded as many\r\nseparate systems of law and administrations.\xe2\x80\x9d The Jews, Musulmans and\r\nforeigners continued subject to their own codes and tribunals; but while\r\nthe Mozarabe or native of Toledo clung to the old Fuero Juzgo or\r\nVisigothic law, inherited from his fathers, the Castilians and Leonese\r\nexpected to be ruled according to the ruder, rougher code of their\r\nwarrior counts and kings. Alfonso dealt with these two peoples of common\r\nrace and language as with the other more widely distinct races. Each had\r\nan Alcalde of its own, subject, however, to the Alcalde Mayor named by\r\nthe king. A compromise, too, was arrived at, the Castilians being\r\nsubject to their own law in civil cases, and to the Mozarabe in criminal\r\nmatters. On the whole, the tendency of these measures was to conciliate\r\nthe Toledans. But we find evidence of jealousies between them and their\r\nconquerors or deliverers from the North for many years afterwards.\r\n\r\nAlfonso\xe2\x80\x99s honour had not gone unstained in regard to his taking the city\r\nof his old friend and benefactor, and the Moors must have been sanguine\r\nindeed if they looked forward to a scrupulous fulfilment of the pledges\r\ngiven them by the conqueror while he was _outside_ the walls. The clause\r\nthat entitled the Muslims to the free and exclusive use of their mosques\r\nwas particularly obnoxious to the rabid ecclesiastics and crusaders who\r\naccompanied the king. With increasing irritation they compared the noble\r\nproportions of the Mohammedan mezquita with those of the humble\r\nprovisional Catholic Cathedral of Santa Maria de Alficem. While Alfonso\r\nwas absent in Leon, he left the city in charge of his queen, Constancia,\r\na Frenchwoman, and of her countryman, Bernard, now bishop, and formerly\r\na monk of Cluny. This prelate took advantage of his sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s absence\r\nto burst one night into the coveted mosque with an armed party, and\r\nhaving \xe2\x80\x9cpurified\xe2\x80\x9d it, suspended bells in the minarets, which announced\r\nat dawn the celebration of the Christian rite. When word was brought to\r\nthe King of this infamous violation of the treaty, he set out for\r\nToledo, announcing his intention of burning the bishop alive. Moved\r\neither by that magnanimity which in the person of Al Mam\xc3\xbbn had\r\ncontributed to their downfall, or, as Spanish writers say, by a\r\nfar-seeing prudence, the Moors went out in a body to meet the monarch,\r\nand besought him to forgive the highly placed thieves. Alfonso, with a\r\nshow of reluctance, acquiesced in their prayer, and the Christians were\r\nmost undeservedly confirmed in the possession of a church they had no\r\nhand in creating. The Alfaqui, or headman of the Muslims, was\r\nmunificently rewarded for his generosity, his statue being placed in the\r\nCapilla Mayor of the new cathedral, which was solemnly consecrated in\r\n1087. No nation has shown a very nice sense of honesty in respect of\r\nchurch property, yet it needs no subtle intelligence to perceive that a\r\nchurch is as much the property of the particular sect for whose special\r\nuse it was designed by members of that sect, as any private house is of\r\nits private owner.\r\n\r\nThe sturdy Toledans were attached, not only to their laws and customs,\r\nbut (which was of more importance in those days) to their own Gothic or\r\nMozarabic ritual. This differs in what are considered important\r\nparticulars from the Roman. The host is divided into nine parts,\r\nrepresenting the Incarnation, Epiphany, Circumcision, Passion, Death,\r\nResurrection, Ascension, and Eternal Kingdom of Christ. Of these\r\nfragments, seven are arranged to form a cross. Because it is not Roman,\r\nEnglish writers are fond of extolling the beauty and simplicity of this\r\nliturgy. It was a stumbling-block to Queen Constance and the zealous\r\nFrench bishop, who were anxious to reduce all things in Spain to\r\nCatholic uniformity. The King ordered the question to be decided by\r\nordeal of single combat. The Mozarabic champion remained the victor. The\r\nbishop then demanded the ordeal of fire. The two missals were\r\naccordingly thrown into a great blazing pile, and the local favourite,\r\nhaving probably been saturated with some incombustible preparation,\r\nremained unconsumed. Another version has it that neither book was\r\ninjured by the flames. Alfonso, after his fashion, clinched the\r\ncontroversy by ordering the Mozarabic ritual to be confined to the two\r\nparish churches allotted to the Christians by their Moorish rulers,\r\nwhilst everywhere else Mass was to be celebrated according to the Roman\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nAlfonso VI. had to fight hard to keep possession of Toledo. The\r\nAlmoravide invasion had burst like a tidal wave over Southern Spain.\r\nEverywhere the Musulmans were recovering their spirits and their\r\nstrength. The Castilian king fled, wounded, from the bloody field of\r\nZalaca, with only five hundred followers, leaving behind him twenty\r\nthousand slain. Toledo could have had no pleasant associations for its\r\nlatest conqueror. Here died three of his _six_ wives--Constancia of\r\nBurgundy, Isabel of France, and Zayda of Seville. At Ucles was slain his\r\nonly son, while yet a mere child. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your prince?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\nunhappy father of the warriors escaped from the rout. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the\r\nlight of my eyes and the staff of my age?\xe2\x80\x9d All were silent. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is dead\r\nand you live!\xe2\x80\x9d bitterly exclaimed the king. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Alvar Fa\xc3\xb1ez\r\nsternly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe live to save the throne, the country, and the lands\r\nacquired with our blood and sweat.\xe2\x80\x9d But the Alcazar re-echoed to the\r\nmournful plaint, \xe2\x80\x9cSancho! Sancho, my son!\xe2\x80\x9d till Alfonso VI. passed away\r\nin July 1109. The stones of which the church altars were built had\r\nmiraculously distilled tears in token of his approaching death. Before a\r\nyear had passed the Vega was blackened by the advancing hordes of Islam.\r\nThe Castle of Azeca, the monastery of San Servando, fell into their\r\nhands; but the City of the Goths, thanks to the leadership of Archbishop\r\nBernard and of Alvar Fa\xc3\xb1ez, hurled back the hosts of Ali and was held\r\nfast for Spain.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Alfonso VII. el Batallador brought brighter days to his\r\ncapital, but it was assailed during the twelfth century with a\r\nsuccession of calamities that might have broken down the patience of\r\nJob. The year 1113 was marked by an earthquake and disastrous\r\noverflowing of the Tagus; 1116, by a fire on a large scale; in 1117, the\r\nprice of wheat rose, to fourteen soldos the bushel; in 1168, the Tagus\r\nwas again in flood; again in 1181 and 1200; between 1187 and 1200, all\r\nthe grocery stores were burnt (how or why, we are not told), the Tagus\r\nwas frozen over in 1191, and there was a famine the following year.\r\nEclipses of the sun were of the commonest occurrence: we hear of them in\r\n1114, 1162, 1177, 1191, and 1207. We can easily imagine the Mohammedan\r\ndenizens shaking their heads and ascribing these phenomena, especially\r\nthe last, to the change of government, and extolling the good old times\r\nof Al Mam\xc3\xbbn when earth, river, and sun kept their places and behaved\r\naccording to rule.\r\n\r\nYet Toledo flourished, and her citizens were never more in their element\r\nthan in the spring of the year 1212, when their town became the\r\nrallying-point and base of the great crusading army, destined to achieve\r\nthe crowning mercy of the Navas de Tolosa. The dominant personality of\r\nthat time was the Archbishop Rodrigo Jimenez de Rada. A writer of\r\nhistory, a valiant soldier, a sagacious statesman, princely in his\r\nmagnificence, and angelic in his charity, he was a tower of strength in\r\nSpain, and especially for Toledo, in the dreadful years of famine and\r\nbrigandage that followed the victory over the Moor. His name will be for\r\never remembered as practically the founder of the great cathedral which\r\nis the city\xe2\x80\x99s crowning glory and title to fame.\r\n\r\nThe century of floods, earthquakes, and eclipses passed away, and found\r\nToledo a hotbed of civil strife and internecine discord. As in Italian\r\ncities at the same time, rival families and factions fought in the\r\nstreets, turned their houses into fortresses, and set the civic\r\nauthorities at defiance. The hidalgos of Toledo would hurry home from\r\nwarring with the infidel to plunge their swords into the bosoms of their\r\nfellow townsmen. Laras and Castros waged pitched battles for the\r\npossession of the capital of Castile. At last the royal power asserted\r\nitself, and with terrible effect. We read that \xe2\x80\x9cthe King Ferdinand came\r\nto Toledo, and hanged many men and boiled others alive in cauldrons.\r\nEra MCCLXII. (1224).\xe2\x80\x9d This boiler of his fellow men is known as _Saint_\r\nFerdinand. His father, Alfonso IX. of Leon, is also mentioned as having\r\nbroiled his rebellious subjects, and flayed others alive. But such\r\nperformances are not considered by a certain class of writers even now\r\nto argue any real depravity of character.\r\n\r\nThe sainted king\xe2\x80\x99s severity on another occasion is more creditable to\r\nhim. On his entry into the town, two young women threw themselves at his\r\nfeet and implored vengeance on their betrayer, Fernandez Gonzalo--the\r\nAlcalde himself. The high rank of the offender did not save him from\r\ninstant decapitation, and his head was within an hour gazing down on the\r\nscene of his amours from the Puerta del Sol. Whether the betrayed\r\ndamsels or any one else were benefited by these drastic measures, the\r\npanegyrists of the righteous king forgot to tell us.\r\n\r\nStill it was an age when strong measures were called for; and\r\nrecognising this, the citizens themselves instituted the famous Santa\r\nHermandad or Holy Brotherhood for the maintenance of public order and\r\nsuppression of brigandage. The organisation received the royal sanction,\r\nand was endowed with many privileges. It supplied the place of a regular\r\npolice force for all Castile for at least three centuries, and readers\r\nwill remember the frequent references to it in the pages of \xe2\x80\x9cDon\r\nQuixote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToledo had not yet become a capital in the sense of being the permanent\r\nresidence of the sovereign. Saint Ferdinand and his immediate\r\npredecessors and successors were essentially soldiers. Their Court was\r\nthe camp, and in the unremitting war of reconquest it was necessarily\r\ntransferred from place to place, from one confine of the ever-expanding\r\nkingdom to the other. When at Toledo the king resided at the\r\nAlcazar--which in Moorish days had been a fortress constructed of\r\n_tapia_ (a species of concrete), and which was fortified with masonry by\r\nAlfonso VI. The building was enlarged and embellished, and made more\r\nsuitable for a royal residence by Sancho el Bravo (1284-1295). But the\r\nstate of affairs in what may be termed the Epoch of the Reconquest\r\n(1085-1252), was obviously not favourable to the development of the\r\nbuilding arts. Toledo possesses few memorials of these days, for such\r\nedifices as may have been founded at or before that time have undergone\r\nsuch transformations as to render them practically the products of later\r\nages. Such supplies and energies as were not absorbed by the\r\nall-important business of war were naturally diverted to the building of\r\nthe cathedral, which was not, as we shall see, completed for another two\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nMedi\xc3\xa6val history concerns itself almost exclusively with kings and\r\nprinces, battles and treaties. Of the life of the people in Spain, as\r\nelsewhere, we hear very little. From stray references in the records we\r\nglean the information that the streets of Toledo were filthy and\r\nunpaved, and frequently encumbered with the carcases of beasts. Over the\r\ngates the heads of malefactors were ever rotting, poisoning the already\r\nvitiated air. We have concise details, too, of no particular interest,\r\nas to the municipal constitution of the city. Beyond this meagre\r\ninformation, we know something of the history of Toledo only so far as\r\nit was also the history of Spain.\r\n\r\nPedro I., the Cruel (1350-1368), had no liking for the gloomy, turbulent\r\ntown, and during his reign Seville might have been called the seat of\r\ngovernment. However much he may have endeared himself to the\r\nAndalusians, the ferocious king was no favourite with the Toledans. When\r\nthe ill-used queen, Blanche of Bourbon, escaped from her prison in the\r\nAlcazar and claimed the right of sanctuary in the cathedral, the city\r\nrose in her behalf, and a thousand native blades sprung from their\r\nscabbards to protect her. An alliance was concluded with Talavera and\r\nCuenca, and the gates opened to Don Enrique of Trastamara, the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhalf-brother. It is said that Pedro\xe2\x80\x99s faction held the bridge of San\r\nMartin, expecting the rebel prince to enter that way, while his\r\nsupporters introduced his troops into the town by the opposite bridge of\r\nAlcantara. The Trastamara partisans attacked the Jewish quarter, the\r\nIsraelites being especial favourites of Don Pedro, and a frightful\r\nmassacre ensued. Soon the king\xe2\x80\x99s party gained the upper hand, and the\r\nunfortunate Blanche was removed from the city, wherein she had found\r\nsuch staunch friends, to the castle of Sig\xc3\xbcenza.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time we read of a massacre of Jews at Toledo. Yet\r\nthe town was for many centuries one of the strongholds of Jewry in\r\nEurope, and a centre of Hebrew culture and activity. The story of the\r\nJews of Toledo is, in fact, one of the most interesting chapters in the\r\nhistory of the city and of Spain.\r\n\r\nJews were settled in the Peninsula at a remote period. The author of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Moorish Empire in Europe\xe2\x80\x9d (S. P. Scott) thinks their arrival in\r\nthat country \xe2\x80\x9cantedated the Christian Era by at least a thousand years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAs we know, legend actually ascribes the foundation of Toledo to the\r\nrace. This may, we think, be due to a confusion of the Israelites with\r\nPh\xc5\x93nician settlers. At the time of Christ, the Jews of Spain were very\r\nnumerous and opulent. Another legend tells how their chief men addressed\r\na letter to the Sanhedrim at Jerusalem, protesting against the\r\nCrucifixion. A document--altogether spurious, it need hardly be\r\nsaid--has been produced in support of this story. After the destruction\r\nof Jerusalem by Titus, there seems to have been a large influx of Hebrew\r\nrefugees into Spain. So long as the Visigoths remained Arians, they\r\nremained tolerant; but Reccared, soon after his conversion to\r\nCatholicism, levelled the severest enactments against the Israelites. He\r\nset a bad precedent. With Sisebut began the long era of persecution. His\r\nharsh edicts, forcing the Jews to choose between baptism and banishment,\r\nare still to be found in the Fuero Juzgo. Swinthila, Kindila,\r\nRecceswinth, Erwig, and Egica followed the same policy. Among the\r\ntyrannical enactments of this time is the grotesque command that the\r\nJews of Toledo should eat pork! Under these circumstances it is not to\r\nbe wondered that the Spanish Jews beheld with dawning hope the\r\nsuccessful progress of the Mohammedans in Northern Africa. A secret\r\nintelligence was established with these Semitic conquerors of a newer\r\nfaith, and thanks to the constant intercourse between the Jews of Africa\r\nand those of Spain, Musa and Tarik were fully supplied with the most\r\nminute particulars of the Visigothic State.\r\n\r\nThe period of the Khalifate was the Golden Age of Spanish Jewry. The\r\nnumbers of the race, depleted by persecution, were increased by the\r\nadvent of upwards of twelve thousand Yemenite Jews, invited by the\r\nMoorish conquerors. Never since the days of Solomon had the Children of\r\nIsrael known such peace and prosperity. Possessed already of a\r\nremarkably high degree of culture, they communicated their knowledge to\r\nthe Arabs, who showed themselves generous patrons and protectors. Nor\r\nwere the new rulers of Spain slow to perceive the advantages to be\r\nderived from the subject race\xe2\x80\x99s commercial enterprise and talent for\r\naffairs. Though the versatility of the Jew at this time was one of his\r\nmost remarkable characteristics, it was above all as a physician that he\r\nwas esteemed by Muslims and Christians alike. In this capacity he became\r\nthe indispensable and most trusted companion of sovereigns and prelates,\r\nand penetrated into the very arcana of power. From Court physician to\r\nMinister the transition in those days of personal government was easy,\r\nand we find Hasdai ben Isaac Ibn Shaprut occupying both positions under\r\nAbd-ur-Rahman I.\r\n\r\nAs far as was consistent with their religious beliefs, the Jews of\r\nToledo assimilated themselves with the conquerors. The minutes of the\r\ncongregation were kept in Arabic down to the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and that language was sedulously cultivated and almost\r\nexclusively employed by the brilliant succession of Jewish theologians\r\nand humanists who made the city a centre of literary and scholastic\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nWe have it on the authority of Mr. S. P. Scott that, under the Muslim\r\ndominion, the Jews were allowed to elect a king, always a prince of the\r\nHouse of Judah, \xe2\x80\x9cwho, while not openly invested with the insignia of\r\nroyalty, received the homage and tribute of his subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d It is\r\nillustrative of the respect of the race for learning that the erudite\r\nRabbi Moses, when recognised exposed as a slave at Cordoba, was\r\nimmediately elected to this dubious royalty.\r\n\r\nThe Jews of Toledo must have viewed with unpleasant apprehensions the\r\nre-establishment of the Catholic monarchy. Yet at first it seemed they\r\nhad no cause for alarm. Alfonso VI., as we know, granted to them the\r\nliberal privileges by which the Muslims also benefited. But in the\r\ncharter confirming the customs of the Mozarabes (1091) it was made plain\r\nthat no penalty would be exacted of a Christian for the murder of a Jew\r\nor Muslim. The result might have been foreseen. Seventeen years after,\r\nthe people rose in savage fury, broke into the synagogues and butchered\r\nthe rabbis in their pulpits, burnt and pillaged every Jewish house, and\r\nslaughtered the luckless objects of their animosity without mercy. But\r\nit was the people, rather than the governing classes, who manifested\r\nthis violent racial prejudice. As in every other land, in spite of\r\npersecution, the Chosen People grew in wealth and abated not their\r\nindustry and commercial activity. It was they who brought to the grim\r\nGothic city the choicest products of the East; they alone who could\r\ncombat the ravages of disease; they alone who could supply the needy\r\nking and nobles with the coin for which in Italy men paid as much as one\r\nhundred and twenty per cent. interest. Spain hated the Jew, but could\r\nnot as yet do without him.\r\n\r\nThe rule of Alfonso VI.\xe2\x80\x99s successors could not have been excessively\r\nharsh, for many Jewish families, hounded out of Southern Spain by an\r\nunusual manifestation of Mohammedan bigotry, took refuge within the\r\nwalls of Toledo. Thanks to the influence of Fermosa, the Jewish mistress\r\nof Alfonso VIII., many of her race exercised important functions at the\r\nCourt. But the fanatical temper of the populace attributed to the favour\r\nshown these unbelievers the disaster of Alarcos, and the beautiful\r\nfavourite and her friends were murdered in the very presence of the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the beginning of the thirteenth century,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Joseph Jacobs,\r\nB.A., in the \xe2\x80\x9cJewish Encyclop\xc3\xa6dia,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe Shushans, the Al-Fakhkhars, and\r\nthe Alnaquas, were among the chief Jewish families of Toledo, Samuel Ibn\r\nShushan being nasi [the chief of Sanhedrim] about 1204. His son built a\r\nsynagogue which attracted the attention of Abraham ben Nathan of Lunel,\r\nwho settled in Toledo before 1205. During the troubles brought upon\r\nCastile by the men of \xe2\x80\x98Ultrapuertos\xe2\x80\x99 in 1211-12, Toledo suffered a riot;\r\nand this appears to have brought the position of the Jews more closely\r\nto the attention of the authorities. In 1219 the Jewish inhabitants\r\nbecame more strictly subject to the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of\r\nToledo, who imposed upon every Jew over twenty years old an annual\r\npoll-tax of one-sixth of a gold mark; and any dispute about age was to\r\nbe settled by a jury of six elders, who were probably supervised by the\r\nnasi, at that time Solomon ben Joseph Ibn Shushan. In the same year\r\npapal authority also interfered with the affairs of the Toledo Jews,\r\nordering them to pay tithes on houses bought by them from Christians,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98as otherwise the Church would be a considerable loser.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA significant phrase! But not only houses and land all over the country\r\nwere mortgaged to the Jews, but also church plate and even the sacred\r\nvessels. Jewish usurers were said to drink out of the chalices used for\r\nthe Precious Elements. The exasperation of the Christians was\r\ndisregarded by Alfonso X. the Learned, who entertained a profound\r\nrespect for the erudition and traditions of the Jews. A Hebrew, Don Zag\r\nIbn Said, directed the compilation of the famous Alfonsine Tables; and\r\nunder the patronage of the monarch, Toledo became famous for its\r\ntranslations from the Arabic into Hebrew, Latin, and Spanish. The rabbis\r\ndistinguished themselves in medicine and astronomy. While doing his\r\nutmost to draw the oppressed race within the fold of the Catholic\r\nchurch, the Learned King granted permission to the Jews of Toledo to\r\nerect that beautiful synagogue which, under the name of Santa Maria la\r\nBlanca, ranks to-day among the national monuments of Spain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Spanish Jews,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Scott, \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of the peculiarities of\r\ntheir situation, the hostility of their rulers--which their pecuniary\r\nresources and natural acuteness often baffled, but never entirely\r\novercame--and their successive domination by races of different origin,\r\nfaith, and language, were impressed with mental peculiarities and\r\ncharacteristics not to be met with in their brethren of other countries.\r\nTheir religious formalism was proverbial, and the Hebrew of Toledo\r\nobserved more conscientiously the precepts of the Pentateuch and Talmud\r\nthan the Hebrew of Damascus or Jerusalem.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus we find the Jews of\r\nToledo siding against the rationalising theories of the great\r\nMaimonides, himself a native of Cordoba, and whose tomb is a conspicuous\r\nlandmark on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee.\r\n\r\nDon Amador de los Rios reproduces an ancient record for the year 1290,\r\nstating the amount of tribute payable by the various Jewish communities\r\nof Castile. Out of a total of 2,801,345 maravedis the Israelites of the\r\ncity of Toledo contributed 216,500, and those in the entire archdiocese\r\n1,062,902 maravedis. The pomp of Catholic public worship and the wealth\r\nof the clergy are partially accounted for by these figures.\r\n\r\nUp till then, always the most valuable (from a European point of view)\r\nand the most prosperous element of the population of Toledo, the Jews\r\nassumed yet greater prominence in the reign of Pedro I. That prince was\r\ndeclared by his numerous enemies to be the substituted child of a\r\nJewess, and his Court was reviled as a Jewish Court. He showed favour to\r\nthe race in many ways. His treasurer and confidential adviser was the\r\nfamous Don Samuel Ha Levi. Whether or not the Jewish statesman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadministration was in the interests of Castile, it is too late in the\r\nday to say; but there can be no doubt that he was a loyal servant of his\r\nking and a devoted friend of his own people. He it was who caused to be\r\nerected Toledo\xe2\x80\x99s other great synagogue, now called the Transito. He was\r\na warm ally of the beautiful Maria de Padilla, Pedro\xe2\x80\x99s gentle mistress,\r\nand for years, with consummate astuteness, defended himself against the\r\ninsidious and violent attacks of his innumerable enemies. His enormous\r\nwealth--honestly or dishonestly acquired--brought about his downfall. In\r\nthe very year (1360) the synagogue was completed, Samuel was seized at\r\nSeville, and, by order of the king, placed upon the rack. The haughty\r\nHebrew is said to have died of sheer indignation. Pedro shed crocodile\r\ntears over his ill-starred Minister\xe2\x80\x99s fate, and greedily confiscated his\r\nproperty. His fortune was found to consist of 70,000 doubloons, 4000\r\nsilver marks, twenty chests filled with treasure, and eighty Moorish\r\nslaves. The property of all Levi\xe2\x80\x99s relatives was also forfeited to the\r\nCrown, and was valued at 300,000 doubloons. Pedro did not, however,\r\nwithdraw his favour from the Jews as a race. It had been well for them\r\nif he had. Their loyalty to the Bluebeard King earned for them the\r\ndetestation of the partisans of Enrique de Trastamara, and brought\r\nabout, as we have seen, the massacre of 1355, in which 1200 Jews\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nThe new king, Enrique, took advantage of a riot said to have been\r\nexcited by the arrogance of the converted Jews in 1367, and in which\r\n1600 houses were burnt to the ground, to impose a tribute of no less\r\nthan twenty thousand gold doubloons on the afflicted people.\r\n\r\nIt was possibly due to the presence of a large Israelite population that\r\nToledo, very much against its will, had been held for King Pedro in\r\n1369. It was, in consequence, fiercely assailed by its own archbishop,\r\nDon Gomez Manrique, while Pedro sent an army largely composed of\r\nSaracens to its relief. The city was a prey to famine, internecine\r\nwarfare, pestilence, and to every description of calamity. The killing\r\nof Pedro and the accession of Enrique were hailed as an ineffable boon\r\nby the wretched citizens. But from that hour the position of the Jews\r\ngrew more and more pitiable. Their prosperity waned, and with it the\r\nprosperity of the old city in which they had so long been unwelcome\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nTheir final ruin as a community was effected mainly at the instance of\r\nSt. Vicente Ferrer, the Dominican. Visiting the city in 1391 he so\r\ninflamed the devout populace with apostolic zeal that they burst into\r\nthe larger of the two Juderias or Ghettos, put practically the whole of\r\nits inhabitants--including the venerable rabbis, Judah ben Asher and\r\nIsrael Alnaqua--to the sword, sacked the quarter from end to end, and\r\ndemolished most of the synagogues. The saintly Ferrer reappeared at\r\nToledo twenty years later, but there were nominally no Jews left to\r\nmassacre. The Hebrews that remained had been \xe2\x80\x9cconverted.\xe2\x80\x9d The good friar\r\ndid what he could, and induced the Toledans to confiscate the synagogue\r\nbuilt in Alfonso X.\xe2\x80\x99s reign and convert it into the Christian Church of\r\nSanta Maria la Blanca. We suggest that it should have been renamed San\r\nVicente del Sangre.\r\n\r\nThe work of destruction was done thoroughly, and henceforward we hear\r\nlittle in the story of Toledo of the Children of Israel. But their names\r\nhave not been altogether forgotten. Mr. Jacobs gives a long list of\r\nmembers of that luckless congregation, famous for their learning and\r\nscience. He enumerates theologians, physicians, astronomers,\r\ngrammarians, satirists, poets and astrologers. Toledo, thanks to these\r\nlatter, achieved an unenviable reputation as a centre of the magic art.\r\nIndeed, this was known at one time as the Arte Toledana. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is said\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(we quote Mr. Jacobs) \xe2\x80\x9cthat Michael Scott learned his magic from a\r\nToledo Jew named Andreas, who translated works on magic from the\r\nArabic.\xe2\x80\x9d The same writer elsewhere says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Spanish Jews differed but\r\nlittle from the Christian population with regard to customs and\r\neducation. They were fond of luxury, and the women wore costly garments\r\nwith long trains, also valuable jewellery; this tended to increase the\r\nhatred of the population towards them. They were quarrelsome and\r\ninclined to robbery, and often attacked and insulted one another even in\r\ntheir synagogues and prayer-houses, frequently inflicting wounds with\r\nthe rapier or sword they were accustomed to carry.\xe2\x80\x9d With royal\r\npermission a Jew might have two wives.\r\n\r\nDeprived of the more legitimate pastime of Jew-baiting, the Toledans\r\nbegan to turn their swords against each other and their sovereign.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d remarks Gamero, \xe2\x80\x9chad the nobility shown itself so arrogant and\r\nrebellious as during the reign of Juan II.\xe2\x80\x9d Envy of that great man and\r\npowerful Minister, Don Alvaro de Luna, was mainly the cause of this. The\r\nleading families took different sides, and the streets frequently were\r\nslippery with the blood of the citizens. The Alcalde, Pero Lopez de\r\nAyala, declared against the great Constable and held the town as an\r\nindependent seigneurie against the king\xe2\x80\x99s forces for five years. King\r\nJuan had deserved better things of his lieges of Toledo, for in 1431 he\r\nhad entertained them on his return from his campaign in Andalusia with\r\nfestivities and pageants of the gayest character. The people took part\r\nin bull fights and games in the Zocodover, while the knights and\r\n_ricoshombres_ jousted and feasted in the Vega. The Alcazar re-echoed to\r\nthe music of lute and lyre, and the songs of the minstrels. But Toledo\r\nwas not to be subdued with kindness. The artisan class presently\r\nrevolted on the imposition of a new tax, the tumult being the occasion\r\nof the saying, _Soplara il odrero, y alborozarse la Toledo_ (Let the\r\nironmonger blow and Toledo will rise). Next, the cruel and miserly\r\ngovernor, Pedro Sarmiento, followed Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s example, and demanded of the\r\nking the dismissal of the noble Constable. The royal forces were set at\r\ndefiance, and a pitched battle was fought below the walls. The fortune\r\nof the day remained with the rebels, and Sarmiento was able for a time\r\nto dictate to his sovereign. He was at last crushed, but was able to\r\ncarry off an enormous amount of treasure loaded on two hundred mules.\r\n\r\nThese events had produced a permanent feud between the families of Ayala\r\nand Silva, only terminated by the marriage of the heir and heiress of\r\nthe respective houses. Toledo, during the first three-quarters of the\r\nfifteenth century, was a prey to incessant warfare. Sometimes the whole\r\ntown would be contending against external foes for or against the king,\r\nsometimes it would be the nobles contending with the people, or the\r\nchurch with the nobles. Toledo, as a whole, supported its archbishop,\r\nCarrillo, when in 1465 he pronounced sentence of dethronement on Enrique\r\nIV. Three years later that unlucky monarch managed, by winning over the\r\nAyalas to his side, to make his entry into the city. The proud chief of\r\nthe family was himself obliged to flee from the town in 1471. The king\r\nwas besieged in the Alcazar; the balance inclined sometimes to this\r\nparty, sometimes to that. The old animosities between the Ayalas and\r\nthe Silvas blazed up again from time to time; and under its weak\r\nsovereign Toledo had its fill of fighting. But those brave days were\r\ndrawing to a close, and in 1474, came one before whom even Toledans had\r\nto bend the knee and whom, recognising in her a stronger spirit, they\r\nafterwards delighted to honour. The accession of Isabel the Catholic on\r\nthe death of Enrique IV., and to the exclusion of the rightful heiress,\r\nJuana, calumniously nicknamed La Beltraneja, marks the beginning of a\r\nnew era in the history of Spain, and therefore of Toledo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDINGS OF THE CASTILIAN PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest specimens of post-Moorish architecture in Toledo partake\r\nmore or less of the character of fortifications. For many years, as we\r\nhave seen, after the Reconquest the Christians\xe2\x80\x99 hold upon the city was\r\nprecarious, and the first efforts of the Castilian kings was naturally\r\ntowards strengthening its defences. The history of the walls of Toledo\r\nis obscure and confused; but it seems certain that a wall has always\r\nextended within historic times across the northern side of the loop\r\nformed by the river. The Conqueror Alfonso VI. strengthened and added to\r\nthis defence by the erection of the newer or outer wall, inclosing the\r\nsuburb or Arrabal del Antequeruela. He also appears to have restored the\r\ninner or Moorish wall, and has left traces on the magnificent Puerta del\r\nSol, a Moorish work which must have been quite new in his day. Indeed,\r\nit may possibly have been built by Moorish masons after the Reconquest.\r\nIt is a noble and impressive portal to the grand old city, and most\r\npowerfully impresses the beholder. Quadrado will have it that so\r\ndignified a monument can have been the work only of a ruling race, in\r\nthe days of its liberty and glory; it could not have been the mere\r\nafterglow of the ascendency and taste of a nation now subjugated. We\r\nmay, however, be permitted to doubt whether the political decadence of a\r\npeople becomes _instantly_ manifested in its artistic life. The gateway\r\nforms a high tower with two flanking turrets, one square and abutting on\r\nthe wall, the other rounded and finishing off the _enceinte_. The portal\r\nis composed of a succession of four arches, all being of the horseshoe\r\nshape, though the outer arches are more pointed than the inner ones.\r\nAbove the outermost arch is a double row of arcades of brickwork, the\r\narches intersecting. Over the second arch is a circular medallion in\r\nrelief, representing the Virgin offering the chasuble to St. Ildefonsus.\r\nAnother relief in marble is supposed to represent the summary punishment\r\nof Fernan Gonzalez by St. Ferdinand, for the seduction of two young\r\nwomen. The battlements are of a type common enough in Spanish Christian\r\narchitecture, but which Mr. Street thinks was derived originally from\r\nthe Moors. Another writer, Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Shea, remarks: \xe2\x80\x9cThis gate with its warm\r\norange tints, that contrast so admirably with the lapis-lazuli azure of\r\nthe cloudless sky, its battlement fringing the top, and opening vistas\r\nof most novel aspect, is a treasure for an artist.\xe2\x80\x9d The exceeding\r\nquaintness and majesty of this gateway have moved many writers to\r\nexpress themselves almost too rapturously. Toledo\xe2\x80\x99s other gates--the\r\nPuerta Nueva de Visagra and the Puerta del Cambr\xc3\xb3n--date from a much\r\nlater period.\r\n\r\nThe rude, dismantled pile of the Castle of San Servando, which crowns\r\nthe height opposite to the Bridge of Alcantara, marks the site of a\r\nmonastery, erected by Alfonso VI. in gratitude for his escape from the\r\nrout of Sacralias (1086). It was peopled by Benedictines from Sahagun\r\nand Cluny. These holy men soon found by the defensive works with which\r\ntheir new home was provided that their duties would not be entirely of a\r\nclerical description. Yusuf-ben-Tashfin, the Almoravide leader, almost\r\ndestroyed the building during his abortive siege of Toledo, and Alfonso\r\nsubsequently gave the establishment the aspect and features of a\r\nfortress. As such it bore the brunt of the repeated Saracen onslaughts\r\nin the first half of the twelfth century. It was abandoned in\r\nconsequence by the monks, and was bestowed by Alfonso VIII. on the\r\nKnights Templars. It continued in their possession till the suppression\r\nof the Order in 1312. It seems to have fallen into ruins soon after, and\r\nwas rebuilt about 1386, on the initiative of the great archbishop,\r\nTenorio. It is not a very interesting monument. It is built of masonry,\r\nwith facings of red brick here and there. Three of its four sides are\r\nstanding, and the same number of towers. These bear a resemblance to the\r\nouter or circular tower of the Puerta del Sol. The windows and arches\r\nexhibit Moorish, or rather Mudejar, influence. The castle in its day\r\nmust have been a fine specimen of the medi\xc3\xa6val stronghold. To-day its\r\nruin is complete. It serves as a home to the owl and the bat, and the\r\nvery ghosts of monks and templars seem to have deserted it as\r\nuninhabitable.\r\n\r\nThe castle is referred to by Calderon and other writers, and seems at\r\none time to have been a favourite spot for duels.\r\n\r\nThe increased importance of Toledo as the capital of Castile\r\nnecessitated the improvement of its communications with the outside\r\nworld. The Bridge of Alcantara was, at the time of the Reconquest, the\r\nonly permanent traject across the Tagus, and the bridge of boats on the\r\nwestern side of the town having been swept away, Alfonso X. (1252-1289)\r\ndecreed the construction of a stone bridge now known as the Puente de\r\nSan Martin. It was built of five arches and lasted till the reign of\r\nPedro I., when it was blown up by that king\xe2\x80\x99s partisans to obstruct the\r\nentry of Enrique de Trastamara. It continued in a practically demolished\r\ncondition for twenty years, when the great archbishop, Pedro Tenorio,\r\ndetermined to restore the missing arches at his own expense. It is said\r\nthat the architect entrusted with the work found, to his dismay, the\r\nnight before the day fixed for the opening, that, owing to some\r\noversight in his calculations, the whole fabric would collapse on the\r\nremoval of the scaffolding. He made known the cause of his anxiety to\r\nhis wife; and she rose at dead of night, and setting fire to the whole\r\nstructure preserved her husband\xe2\x80\x99s reputation and, not impossibly, his\r\nlife. The reconstructed bridge was, of course, without fault or flaw. A\r\nfinal reconstruction took place in 1690. On the town side, the Puente de\r\nSan Martin is defended by two square towers. Above the archway are two\r\ninscriptions relating to the works executed by order of Charles II. The\r\nfurther extremity of the bridge is defended by another square\r\nbattlemented tower with a horseshoe arch. Its two bridges are among the\r\nmost picturesque features of Toledo.\r\n\r\nWith the obvious exception of the cathedral, the most interesting\r\nmonuments of what we may term the middle age of Toledo are the two\r\nsynagogues, now styled Santa Maria la Blanca and El Transito. The Jews,\r\nas we have seen, everywhere loom large in the annals of Toledo.\r\n\r\nThe first-named of these temples derives its actual name from a\r\ntradition that a Christian church occupied the site in Visigothic times,\r\nto account for the dedication of which a legend is repeated similar to\r\nthat of Santa Maria ad Nives at Rome. It is situated on what was once\r\nthe Jewry or Ghetto, on the western side of the city, not far from the\r\nPuente de San Martin. Its foundation--as a synagogue--is variously\r\nascribed to the period of the Reconquest, to the last days of the\r\nMoorish dominion, and to the latter period of the Khalifate. The first\r\ndate seems the most probable. It continued to be used for the Jewish\r\nworship till 1405, when, as has been already told, it was seized and\r\nconverted into a Catholic church. It has long since become a merely\r\nsecular monument. The exterior, approached through the most miserable\r\nand sordid neighbourhood, is very far from reflecting the splendour the\r\nJews enjoyed at its foundation. The fa\xc3\xa7ade, mean and dilapidated like\r\nthe rest of the exterior, is probably of much more recent construction\r\nalso. Within, a strange, fantastic impression is created. The phrase,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are the mighty fallen!\xe2\x80\x9d involuntarily rises to the lips as one\r\ncontemplates the traces of grandeur and elegance subsisting amid ruin\r\nand decay. The temple is symbolical of the race: exotic, reminiscent of\r\na lost glory, depressed, oppressed. There is, however, no trace or\r\nsuggestion of the primitive Hebrew architectural style about the\r\nbuilding. The traditions of Jerusalem were either unknown to, or had\r\nbeen forgotten by, those who reared these walls--likely enough Moors,\r\nwhose skill was always at the disposal of Christian and Jew. In fact,\r\nthe synagogue may be taken as a fine example of late Saracenic work. The\r\nplan consists of a nave with two aisles on each side. The nave was\r\nprolonged in the seventeenth century so as to form a chancel. The\r\nbuilding is 81 feet long by 63 feet wide. The nave reaches to a height\r\nof 60 feet, and is 15 feet broad, while the aisles measure only 12 feet\r\nand rise from 40 to 50 feet high. The nave and aisles are separated by\r\nfour rows of octagonal columns, from which spring bold horseshoe arches\r\nof the true Moorish type. The capitals are of stucco and elaborately\r\ndesigned with floral devices, in which the fir-cone is conspicuous;\r\nthere is a vague suggestion of Byzantine influence. Mr. Street imagines\r\nthem to be much later than the original capitals which they overlay.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the Moorish decorative work seems to have been executed in the same\r\nway in plaster. This was of very fine quality, and was evidently cut and\r\ncarved as if it had been stone, and seldom, if ever, I think, stamped or\r\nmoulded, according to the mistaken practice of the present day. The\r\nconsequence is that there is endless variety of design everywhere\r\nand--wherever it was desired--any amount of undercutting. The spandrels\r\nabove the arches are filled in with arabesque patterns, and there is a\r\ncusped wall arcade below the roof.\xe2\x80\x9d All this stucco work appears to date\r\nfrom about the time of Alfonso X., or perhaps from a later restoration.\r\nAbove the nave is an exquisite frieze in low relief, formed of lines\r\ninterlacing and crossing each other. The roof is of pine-wood, and _not_\r\nof Lebanon cedar, as at one time alleged. Mr. Street thinks \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\npavement is very good, but must be about the date of the conversion of\r\nthe synagogue into a church. It is divided into compartments by border\r\ntiles laid down the length of the church on either side of the columns.\r\nThe spaces between them are filled in with a rich diaper of encaustic\r\nand plain red tiles, whilst the general area between these richer bands\r\nis paved with large red, relieved by an occasional encaustic, tiles. The\r\nlatter have patterns in white, dark blue, and yellow, and in all cases\r\nthey are remarkable for the beautiful inequality of the colours of the\r\nsurface of the design. Both colour and material are in themselves better\r\nthan the work of our tile manufacturers of the present day and\r\nillustrate very well the difference between hand-work and machinework.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe Catholics added three altars in the plateresque style, which, it is\r\nunnecessary to say, do not harmonise with the rest of the edifice. One\r\nof the retablos is attributed to Berruguete.\r\n\r\nComparing this old Jewish meeting-place with the other and later\r\nsynagogue, Miss Hannah Lynch remarks: \xe2\x80\x9cAs a religious temple, as the\r\nexpression of solemn worship rooted in the strange and mysterious East,\r\nthe former is by far the more imposing, the more earnest and harmonious.\r\nPrayer in the _Transito_ seems a matter of graceful and artistic\r\ndilettanteism; here it appears a great racial cry of the soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe later vicissitudes of this synagogue are curious. About the middle\r\nof the sixteenth century it was converted by Cardinal Siliceo into an\r\nasylum for the professional frail ones of Toledo; but about half a\r\ncentury later the establishment ceased to exist--whether because there\r\nwas no more frailty in Toledo or no more repentance, we are not told.\r\nSubsequently it was turned into a barracks, and then (O\xe2\x80\x99Shea says) into\r\na dancing-hall.\r\n\r\nThe Transito (so called after the Transit of the Blessed Virgin, _i.e._,\r\nthe Assumption) is situated in the same quarter. We have already told\r\nthe story of its foundation by Samuel Ha Levi, the powerful treasurer of\r\nPedro I. Upon the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, it was\r\nhanded over to the Order of Calatrava, who dedicated it to St. Benedict\r\n(San Benito). This synagogue is also purely Moorish in style, but of the\r\nlater or Granadan period. Its plan differs radically from that of Santa\r\nMaria la Blanca. It constitutes a parallelogram, undivided into naves\r\nand aisles, 76 feet by 31 feet, and 44 feet high. The effect is simple\r\nand graceful. The side walls are quite plain up to the height of about\r\ntwenty feet, where a broad frieze of stucco runs round the building,\r\nwith floral and star pattern designs, and bordered by inscriptions in\r\nHebrew. Above this is an arcade with double shafts, and extremely rich\r\ncapitals. The arches are of the horseshoe form, cusped into seven\r\npoints. Eight of the arches contain lattice-work of the most beautiful\r\ndesign. Indeed, the whole of the arcading is rich and graceful beyond\r\nall praise. The western wall, where was formerly the Rabbinical chair,\r\nand is now the altar, is profusely decorated with patterns,\r\ninscriptions, and coats of arms, down to within seven feet of the floor.\r\nIn the opposite wall windows have been pierced, breaking into the\r\nfrieze. The roof is of cedar, and a fine specimen of _artesonado_ work.\r\nAcross it run tie-beams, superfluous in this case, but of which the\r\nMoorish builders were fond. The rafters slope down equally to a deep\r\ncornice, which is carried right across the angles, \xe2\x80\x9cso as to give\r\npolygonal ends to the roof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn either side of the altar are long Hebrew inscriptions now illegible,\r\nand the precise meaning of which has been a subject of fierce and\r\nperpetual controversy. The text on the Epistle side may be translated:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mercies which God hath shown us, raising up amongst us judges and\r\nprinces to deliver us from our enemies and oppressors.... And we of this\r\nland have built this house with a strong and mighty arm. The day that it\r\nwas built was great and delightful for the Jews, who, attracted by the\r\nfame of these things, came from the ends of the earth to see ... if a\r\nruler should be given us who should be as a tower of strength ... to\r\ngovern our commonwealth.... And there was raised up to help us, Samuel\r\n[Levi,] and God was with him and with us, and who found for us grace and\r\nmercy. He was a man of peace, powerful among all the people, and a great\r\nbuilder. These things were accomplished in the reign of the King Don\r\nPedro; may God be his helper, enlarge his dominions, prosper him and\r\nsuccour him, and place his seat over all princes. May God be with him\r\nand all his house, and may every man be humbled before him ... and let\r\nthose who hear his name rejoice to hear it in all the Kingdoms, and let\r\nit be manifest that he has been unto Israel a defender and a shield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe inscription on the Gospel side proclaims the Rabbi Myir Abdali as\r\nthe architect and extols his pre-eminent virtues, and pathetically\r\ncelebrates the return of good and prosperous times--times not destined\r\nto last for the luckless race!\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of the synagogue exists the skeleton of the palace\r\nbuilt by the great Jewish treasurer. It afterwards passed into the hands\r\nof the Marquises of Villena, and is associated with Don Enrique de\r\nAragon, uncle of Juan II., a very interesting personality. He was a man\r\nof vast learning, and was, probably in consequence, reputed to be a\r\nmagician and in league with the Evil One. Indeed, his magnificent\r\nlibrary, including his own writings, was, in after years, burnt by order\r\nof the Inquisition. Beneath the mansion are still to be found various\r\nsubterranean chambers, which popular superstition declares to have been\r\nthe scene of Don Enrique\xe2\x80\x99s conferences with Satan and his satellites.\r\nThis necromancer was indeed Marquis of Villena, but it is by no means\r\ncertain that he inhabited this house, which afterwards became the\r\nproperty of another family (the Pachecos), on whom the title was\r\nconferred by Enrique IV. The palace was deliberately burnt by its owner,\r\nthe Duque de Escalona, in the reign of Charles V., it having been\r\ncontaminated, as he thought, by the temporary residence within its walls\r\nof the Constable de Bourbon, then in arms against his own country. The\r\nCastilian grandee\xe2\x80\x99s sense of honour was not a mere pose. The building is\r\nnow the property of the Marquis de la Vega, who has tastefully restored\r\nit. It receives additional interest from its having been, as is now\r\nbelieved, the home of El Greco.\r\n\r\nTwo ruinous structures are pointed out as the palaces of Don Pedro and\r\nof Enrique de Trastamara respectively. The latter probably belonged to\r\none of the Counts of Trastamara, not to the king who bore that title. It\r\nis in the Moorish style, with horseshoe arches, friezes, and _ajimeces_.\r\nThe so-called palace of Don Pedro is of the same class of architecture,\r\nbut has much less to show--a horseshoe arch, a dado, and an almost\r\nillegible Arabic inscription which reads, \xe2\x80\x9cLasting glory and perpetual\r\nprosperity to the master of this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetter examples of the Mudejar (or late Moorish) style are the Casa del\r\nMesa and the Taller del Moro. The former is situated close to the church\r\nof San Rom\xc3\xa1n, and was built soon after the Reconquest by that prominent\r\nToledan, Esteban Ill\xc3\xa1n. The saloon is one of the very best examples of\r\nthis style of architecture. It is 60 feet long by 22 feet wide, and 36\r\nfeet high. The artesonado ceiling is thus described by Street: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\npatterns are formed by ribs (square in section) of dark wood with a\r\nwhite line along the centre of the soffit of each. The sides of the ribs\r\nare painted red, and the recessed panels have lines of white beads\r\npainted at their edges, and in the centre an arabesque on a dark blue\r\nground. The colours are so arranged as to mark out as distinctly as\r\npossible the squares and patterns into which it is divided, and the\r\nsinking of some panels below the others allows the same pattern to be\r\nused for borders and grounds with very varied effect. The reds are\r\nrather crimson in tone, and the blues very dark.\xe2\x80\x9d The entrance--of a\r\nslightly horseshoe pattern--is framed in exquisite and luxuriant\r\ntraceries. So also is the opposite _ajimez_ window, but here the designs\r\nshow Gothic influence. A high dado of _azulejos_ and a very deep cornice\r\nand frieze of delicate workmanship complete the decoration of this very\r\nbeautiful hall.\r\n\r\nThe Taller del Moro is (quite without foundation) said to occupy the\r\nsite of the massacre of the _Noche Toledana_. It was so called because\r\nit was used as a workshop during the building of the cathedral. There is\r\na conflict of opinion as to its age, but it probably dates from about\r\nthe time of the Reconquest. The Arabic inscriptions, however, imply that\r\nit was intended for the habitation of a Moor, the Latin texts being\r\ndoubtlessly added by later owners. The Taller consists of a large hall,\r\n54 feet long by 23 feet wide, and of two adjacent smaller apartments. It\r\nexhibits the artesonado ceiling, the delicate stucco-work and friezes\r\nwith star-like and floral designs we are led to expect in specimens of\r\nMudejar architecture. Street doubts if the stucco-work dates further\r\nback than 1350. The portal is in good Gothic style, and was added by\r\nCardinal Mendoza.\r\n\r\nAs in all other Spanish cities, after their reacquisition by the\r\nChristians, in Toledo, for many, many years, Moorish architects and\r\nmasons continued to be employed even in the construction of sacred\r\nedifices. This accounts for the mixed Christian and Saracenic style of\r\nseveral of the churches, even where these had not originally been\r\nmosques. The interesting church of San Rom\xc3\xa1n had been a Mohammedan\r\ntemple remodelled to the requirements of Christian worship, while the\r\ntower or steeple is a Mudejar work added by Esteban Ill\xc3\xa1n, and (to quote\r\nMr. Street), \xe2\x80\x9cthe finest example of its class to be seen here.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nsteeple is of rough stone and brick, of a warm brown tone, and quite\r\nplain for more than half its height. The upper stages are pierced with\r\nwindows which exhibit a very ungraceful trefoiled variation of the\r\nhorseshoe arch--then fast dying out. Notwithstanding, the steeple has a\r\nnoble and rugged appearance, like most things Toledan. The church itself\r\nhas been so often restored, that it is hard to assign it to any one\r\nepoch. The Capilla Mayor is of the sixteenth century, and of the\r\nplateresque style. One of the altars has a front of black stone, carved\r\nat the edges in imitation of an altar-cloth with embroidery and lace.\r\nHere and there traces may be detected of the original mosque. The\r\nsteeples of the churches of Santa Magdalena, Santo Tom\xc3\xa9, San Pedro\r\nMartir, San Miguel, Santa Leocadia, and La Concepcion, resemble that of\r\nSan Rom\xc3\xa1n, but differ greatly in size.\r\n\r\nThe minor churches of Toledo are not specially interesting. Without the\r\nwalls, however, is one with noteworthy characteristics. The little\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbasilica\xe2\x80\x9d of the Cristo de la Vega occupies the site of the famous\r\nchurch of St. Leocadia, built by the Visigothic King, Sisebuth, in the\r\nseventh century, to mark the place of the virgin saint\xe2\x80\x99s martyrdom.\r\nSeveral of the great councils were held here. The story is told that the\r\nsaint appeared in person here to St. Ildefonso, in the presence of King\r\nRecceswinth, and having expressed her satisfaction at the theologian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmasterly defence of the virginity of the Blessed Virgin, allowed him,\r\nwith the royal dagger, to cut off a piece of her veil as a souvenir of\r\nher visit. This event naturally raised the \xe2\x80\x9cbasilica\xe2\x80\x9d in the estimation\r\nof the devout. It was demolished by the Moors, and restored in 1162. It\r\nunderwent many restorations and was finally ruined by the French during\r\nthe War of Independence. The present edifice represents little more than\r\nthe apse of the chapel of the Cristo de la Vega. There was a miraculous\r\ncrucifix, attached to which is a particularly silly legend. Two lovers\r\nhad plighted their troth before the image, and the man afterwards denied\r\nthe promise. The girl adjured the Christ to bear witness to the truth of\r\nher statement, and the figure obligingly extended a wooden arm while a\r\nvoice from on high proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9c_I testify._\xe2\x80\x9d Another version has it\r\nthat the figure testified in favour of a Christian who (_mirabile\r\ndictu_) had lent money to a Jew; and yet another, that it expressed\r\napprobation of the magnanimity of a cavalier who had pardoned his enemy\r\nunder extraordinary circumstances. Whatever it may have done, the\r\ncrucifix has long since disappeared. An Arabic inscription deduces that\r\nMohammed ben Rahman, first King of Toledo, was buried here, A.D. 743. As\r\nthere was no king in the city of that year, and as the first independent\r\nsovereign was otherwise named, the inscription must be apocryphal or\r\nelse the word \xe2\x80\x9cking\xe2\x80\x9d must signify in the original merely _Vali_ or\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nA legend, better known and rather less silly than that of the Cristo de\r\nla Vega, deals with the love affairs of an imaginary Moorish princess,\r\ncalled Galiana \xe2\x80\x9cla mora mas celebrada de toda la moreria,\xe2\x80\x9d the daughter\r\nof an equally mythical king, called Galafre. _He_ is linked up with\r\nhistory by some writers alleging him to have been the nephew of the\r\nwicked Count Julian, Galiana was the apple of her parent\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and for\r\nher delectation he built a palace abounding in all conceivable delights.\r\nThe young lady had, in some way, compromised herself with a gigantic\r\nMoor, Bradamante by name; and to rid her of this truculent wooer, no\r\nless a personage than Charlemagne appeared on the scene. All, of course,\r\nended happily (except for Bradamante) by the conversion of the lovely\r\nprincess and her marriage to the gallant Frank. In the Puerta del Rey,\r\noutside the town, may still be seen a building dilapidated, let out in\r\ntenements, which is pointed out as the Palace of Galiana. The place was\r\na mansion of the great Guzman family and exhibits traces of fine Moorish\r\nwork--horseshoe arches, twin-windows, a defaced inscription or two, some\r\ntiling, and arabesques--enough, in short, to conjure up a splendid\r\nMoorish palace, which, however, need not have antedated the Reconquest.\r\n\r\nThe building is the property of H.I.M. the Empress Eug\xc3\xa9nie, and it is\r\nsomewhat to be regretted that her attention has not been directed to its\r\npresent condition and to the chance here presented of retarding the\r\ndecay of a valuable monument of antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscending in importance all the other monuments of Toledo and,\r\nindeed, of Castile, is the Cathedral--one of the noblest specimens of\r\nGothic architecture the world affords. The metropolitan church of Spain,\r\nit is sumptuous without gaudiness, austere without gloominess, admirably\r\ninterpreting the spirit of Spanish Catholicism before it withered under\r\nthe chilling influence of Philip II. and the Inquisition. The Cathedral\r\nof Toledo does not impress the foreigner as typically national. Indeed\r\nit corresponds no longer to the temper of the nation. And it was raised\r\nas a protest against those Moorish influences which have passed into the\r\nlife and art of Spain, and without which nothing can be taken as\r\nrepresentatively Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral of Toledo, then, is Gothic, and may be said to embody the\r\nideals of old Spain--of the young fighting nation that looked forward,\r\nnot backward. Splendid as the Mosque seized by Archbishop Bernard and\r\nconverted to Christian uses may have been, it was the work of the\r\ninfidel. In 1227 King Ferdinand III. and the Archbishop Don Rodrigo de\r\nRada were able at last to give effect to a determination arrived at some\r\nyears before; and on August 14 the first stone of a new temple, which\r\nshould never have been contaminated by Muslim rites, was laid with\r\nsolemn ceremony. The name of the architect continues to be a matter of\r\ncontroversy. An epitaph in the sacristy of the Capilla de los Doctores\r\naffords some clue to his identity. It runs as follows:\r\n\r\n    Agni: jacet: Petrus Petri: magister\r\n    Eclesia: Scte: Marie: Toletani: fama:\r\n    Per exemplum: pro more: huic: bona:\r\n    Crescit: qui presens: templum: construxit\r\n    Et hic quiescit: quod: quia: tan: mire:\r\n    Fecit: vili: sentat: ire: ante: Dei:\r\n    Vultum: pro: quo: nil: restat: multum:\r\n    Et sibi: sis: merce: qui solus: cuncta:\r\n    Coherce: obiit: x dias de Novembris:\r\n    Era: de M: et CCCXXVIII (A.D. 1290).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPetrus Petri\xe2\x80\x9d is interpreted by Spanish writers \xe2\x80\x9cPedro Perez,\xe2\x80\x9d but we\r\nincline to Mr. Street\xe2\x80\x99s view that the correct rendering is probably\r\nPierre le Pierre, the architect having been, as the name implies, a\r\nFrenchman. \xe2\x80\x9cThis, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d continues Mr. Street, \xe2\x80\x9cis certain: the\r\nfirst architect of Toledo, whether he were French or Spanish, was\r\nthoroughly well acquainted with the best French churches, and could not\r\notherwise have done what he did. In Spain, there was nothing to lead\r\ngradually to the full development of the Pointed style. We find, on the\r\ncontrary, buildings, planned evidently by foreign hands, rising suddenly\r\nwithout any connection with other buildings in their own district, and\r\nyet with most obvious features of similarity to works in other countries\r\nerected just before them. Such is the case with the cathedrals at\r\nBurgos, at Leon, and at Santiago, and such even more decidedly is the\r\ncase here. Moreover, in Toledo, if anywhere, was such a circumstance to\r\nbe expected. In this part of Spain there was in the thirteenth century\r\nno trained school of native artists. Even after the conquest the Moors\r\ncontinued to act as architects for Christian buildings whether secular\r\nor ecclesiastical, and, indeed, to monopolise all the art and science of\r\nthe country which they no longer ruled. In such a state of things I can\r\nimagine nothing more natural than that, though the Toledans may have\r\nbeen well content to employ Mohammedan art in their ordinary works, yet,\r\nwhen it came to be a question of rebuilding their cathedral on a scale\r\nvaster than anything which had as yet been attempted, they would be\r\nanxious to adopt some distinctly Christian form of art; and lacking\r\nentirely any school of their own, would be more likely to secure the\r\nservices of a Frenchman than one of any other nation.... But however\r\nthis may have been, the church is thoroughly French in its ground-plan\r\nand equally French in all its details for some height from the ground;\r\nand it is not until we reach the triforium of the Choir that any other\r\ninfluence is visible; but even here the work is French work, only\r\nslightly modified by some acquaintance with Moorish art....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stupendous fabric, once begun, whether by French or Spanish hands,\r\ntook two hundred and sixty-six years to finish. From the death of the\r\nfirst architect in 1270 to the year 1425 the names of the architects\r\nhave been lost. During this period, the successive styles of\r\narchitecture naturally influenced the original scheme and found\r\nexpression in the building. It was in January 1493 that the roof was\r\nfinished and the main structure completed. Certain chapels, such as the\r\nReyes Nuevos, Sagrario, &c., were later additions. Among the later\r\narchitects we find Rodrigo Alfonso, Alvar Gomez, Martin Sanchez, and\r\nJuan Guas. The stone employed inside (according to O\xe2\x80\x99Shea) was quarried\r\nat Oliguelas, some nine miles from the city. It becomes harder with age.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe external portion is all of Berroque\xc3\xb1a stone, save the ornamentation\r\nof the portals, which is also of Oliguelas white stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral forms an oblong, semicircular at the eastern end, and\r\nlying east and west. In width it is exceeded only by the Cathedrals of\r\nMilan and Seville, measuring 178 feet broad by 395 feet long. On the\r\nnorth side are the cloisters and additional chapels and sacristies. From\r\nthe eastern side project the chapels of the Reyes Nuevos, San Ildefonso,\r\nand Santiago, and the Winter Chapter-room. The plan of the interior is\r\neasy of comprehension. The nave extends from the western entrance to the\r\nCapilla Mayor: on either side of it are two aisles which are continued\r\nround and behind this chapel in a semicircular sweep. Street extols the\r\nskill with which this arrangement has been carried out. Between the\r\nChoir and the Capilla Mayor a transept extends across the church, not\r\nprojecting, however, beyond the outer walls of the farther aisles. The\r\neighty-eight pillars which support the fabric and mark off these\r\ndivisions are composed each of from eight to sixteen light columns,\r\nstanding on the same base. The capitals are moulded in plain foliage.\r\nThe arches resting on these pillars make up the seventy-two vaults of\r\nwhich the roof is composed. The aisles rise gradually in towards the\r\ncentral nave, which is 116 feet high. The crypt or substructure\r\ncorresponds in its divisions and the number of its piers to the edifice\r\nabove. The pavement is of bluish white marble arranged in chequers.\r\n\r\nIn the original plan no side-chapels appear to have been contemplated.\r\nBut the chapel of Santa Lucia was added by Archbishop de Rada in memory\r\nof Alfonso VI. And, in addition to chapels built since the rest of the\r\nchurch, the spaces between the buttresses in the outer aisles have been\r\nrailed off so as to form twenty-three chapels of various styles and\r\nperiods. The interior is lit by 750 stained-glass windows of rich hues\r\nthat delight the spectator. They depict episodes from the Scriptures,\r\nand are said to have been as carefully designed as if intended for close\r\ninspection. Among the artists were Dolfin (1418), De Vergara, Albert of\r\nHolland, Maese Cristobal, Juan de Campos, Vasco Troya, and Pedro\r\nFranc\xc3\xa9s. The effect of the light falling in rays of richest colour on\r\nthe pavement and columns is magical. The walls are denuded of colour and\r\nrudely whitewashed.\r\n\r\nThe centre of the Cathedral is occupied by the choir (_Coro_), to the\r\neast of which, separated by the transept, is the Capilla Mayor. The\r\nchoir is enclosed by walls and cloisters, except on the side facing the\r\nCapilla Mayor, where it is railed in by the magnificent reja, designed\r\nby Domingo de Cespedes and Hernando Bravo (1548). Like the corresponding\r\nrailing of the High Chapel opposite, this work was formerly heavily\r\nsilver-plated and gilded, but at the time of the French invasion it was\r\nrecoated with iron to secure it from spoliation. Unfortunately, no\r\nmeans have yet been discovered of restoring the reja to its original\r\nstate. Among the elaborate ornamentation may be noticed the arms of\r\nCardinal Siliceo and of the Ayala family, with the interwoven\r\ninscriptions _Procul esto prophani_ and _Psale et psile_. The Choir is\r\npaved with white marble inlaid with dark. The vaulting above the Choir\r\nitself rises to the height of a hundred feet, the aisle round it to\r\nninety feet, and the outer aisle to thirty-five feet. In the outer aisle\r\nare small chapels placed between the buttresses. Mr. Street describes\r\nthis part of the building in great detail and considers that the\r\noriginal scheme of the Cathedral is only to be seen here. The triforium,\r\nformed of an arcade of cusped arches, in the outer wall of the inner\r\naisle exhibits Moorish influence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d writes the\r\nauthority just mentioned, \xe2\x80\x9cto imagine any circumstance which could\r\nafford better evidence of the foreign origin of the first design than\r\nthis slight concession to the customs of the place in a slightly later\r\nportion of the works. An architect who came from France, bent on\r\ndesigning nothing but a French church, would be very likely, after a few\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x99 residence in Toledo, somewhat to change in his views, and to\r\nattempt something in which the Moorish work, which he was in the habit\r\nof seeing, would have its influence. The detail of this triforium is,\r\nnotwithstanding, all pure and good....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Choir is enriched by a magnificent screen, lecterns, and stalls. The\r\nscreen, or _respaldo_, which at one time seems to have been continued\r\nright across the transept, encloses the Choir on three sides, and\r\nconsists of an arcade carried on fifty-two columns of jasper and marble,\r\nand supporting and enclosing admirable statuary and sculpture. Above the\r\ncapitals of the columns is a series of fifty-six medallions in high\r\nrelief, dating from 1380, and representing scenes from the Old\r\nTestament. These reliefs are worthy of close study, and are beautiful\r\nexamples of simple and faithful medi\xc3\xa6val treatment. The series is\r\nsupplemented by a medallion with a bust by Berruguete and the statues of\r\nInnocence and Sin, by Nicolas de Vergara--works on which Street outpours\r\nthe vials of his wrath.\r\n\r\nOf the wonderful Choir Stalls of Toledo everyone has heard. They are\r\nunsurpassed triumphs of the carver\xe2\x80\x99s art. The lower tier, including\r\nfifty seats, is the work of Maese Rodrigo, and dates from 1495. The\r\nstalls are of walnut wood, and the carving portrays the campaign against\r\nGranada by the Catholic Sovereigns. The carving being almost\r\ncontemporary with the events illustrated has given these reliefs an\r\nhistorical as well as an artistic value. The names of the fortresses\r\nare here and there indicated by labels, and the designs are somewhat\r\nmarred by the introduction of fanciful monsters. The whole breathes very\r\nmuch of the medi\xc3\xa6val spirit, and we can, therefore, hardly complain of a\r\ncertain stiffness and lack of variety. They form an admirable contrast\r\nto the finer, more finished work of the upper tier of stalls, executed\r\nfifty years later by Berruguete and Philip of Burgundy, surnamed\r\nVigarni. Thirty-five seats, including the Primate\xe2\x80\x99s, are the work of the\r\nSpaniard, the thirty-six opposite exhibiting the skill of the\r\nBurgundian. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were wrought,\xe2\x80\x9d says O\xe2\x80\x99Shea, \xe2\x80\x9cin rivalry of each other,\r\nand finished in 1543; and as Cardinal Tavera\xe2\x80\x99s inscription runs:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certaverunt turn artificum ingenia; certabunt semper spectatorum\r\njudicia.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The stalls are placed in recesses of alabaster, and separated\r\nby fine red jasper columns, with capitals in white marble. Over the\r\nrecesses is a series of alabaster figures in low relief of the prophets\r\nand patriarchs. The carvings on the stalls themselves depict episodes\r\nfrom both the New and Old Testaments. The work breathes the spirit of\r\nthe Renaissance, interpreted by Berruguete and his colleague with a\r\nskill, it has been truly observed, worthy of Benvenuto Cellini himself.\r\nBerruguete was a pupil of Michelangelo. His work is more vigorous than\r\nthat of Vigarni, who excels in elegance and softness of outline.\r\nStreet\xe2\x80\x99s denunciations of these triumphs of the carver\xe2\x80\x99s art are a\r\ncurious instance of the length to which an artistic bias may lead a\r\nclever writer and critic. The reliefs representing the visits of the\r\nBlessed Virgin to Purgatory and to St. Ildefonso are not by Philip of\r\nBurgundy, but by his brother Gregorio.\r\n\r\nVery fine are the reading-desks, with friezes of gilded bronze, executed\r\nby the two Vergaras in the middle of the sixteenth century. Those on the\r\nEpistle side are carved in low relief with the stories of David and\r\nSaul, the Blessed Virgin and St. Ildefonso, and the Apocalypse; those on\r\nthe Gospel side, the stories of St. Ildefonso, the Ark of the Covenant,\r\nand the Passage of the Red Sea. In the centre of the Choir is a\r\nmagnificent brass lectern upheld by a great eagle with wings outspread;\r\nits eyes are of red stones and it crushes with its talons a struggling\r\ndragon. It was executed in 1646 by Salinas. The pedestal on which it\r\nstands is older by two hundred years, and is thoroughly Gothic in\r\ncharacter, with buttresses, pinnacles, and statuary. The work is said to\r\nbe German. The pedestal is borne by six lions, finely sculptured.\r\n\r\nThe northern entrance to the transept, which separates the Choir from\r\nthe Capilla Mayor, affords the best and least interrupted view of the\r\nCathedral. That view impressed the writer with its calm majesty and\r\nsanctity, but by way of contrast it is worth while recording the\r\nimpressions of a traveller only lately returned (Mr. Stewart Dick): \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nfirst feeling was one of disappointment--a feeling that even now has\r\nhardly worn away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is vast and cold. A white expanse. Huge pillars towering up to a\r\ngreat height. A blaze of harsh daylight. In the middle, blocking up the\r\nview down the nave, the tawdry gilt of the Coro. Doors opening and\r\nbanging all round, people promenading, sitting on the bases of the\r\npillars and talking with undropped voices. You ask yourself with\r\namazement, Is this a church? The form is here, but where is the spirit?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, it is only in the evening that Toledo Cathedral comes into its\r\nown. It is quiet and peaceful then. The promenaders have all gone away,\r\nthe blaring of the organ has ceased, and through the open door you hear\r\nthe twittering of birds in the cloisters. The shadows darken among the\r\npillars, the beautiful windows begin to glow, and a soft light fills the\r\nupper part of the church. It is like the opening of a flower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen at last you begin to feel the impressiveness and the dignity of\r\nthose avenues of mighty pillars. The trivialities that annoyed you are\r\nlost, the effects are broad, grand, and majestic, and at last the\r\nbuilding is a temple; it seems as if the Holy Spirit had entered with\r\nthe fall of the twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Capilla Mayor, or High Chapel, occupies the eastern end of the nave,\r\nthe aisles sweeping round behind it. The hinder portion was originally\r\nthe Capilla de los Reyes Viejos, the chapel in which were entombed\r\nSancho el Bravo, Sancho el Deseado, Alfonso VII., and others. In the\r\nyear 1498 the two chapels were thrown into one by Cardinal Cisneros, who\r\nleft the royal tombs for a time undisturbed. The High Chapel, according\r\nto O\xe2\x80\x99Shea, measures 56 feet in length, 50 feet in breadth, and 116 feet\r\nin height. The piers are sculptured with the effigies of kings,\r\nprelates, and saints, and with \xe2\x80\x9ca multitude of angels playing on\r\ndifferent instruments, and with outspread wings, that want but incense\r\nto raise them again from the spot where they have alighted.\xe2\x80\x9d The walls\r\nof the chapel are pierced or of open-work, the stone in parts being\r\nalmost transparent, and thus adding to the brightness of the effect. Two\r\nrows of statuary enhance the beauty of the stonework, which is among the\r\nearliest portions of the fabric. But these walls, for all their\r\nmagnificence, are put in the shade by the superb reja or railing, facing\r\nthat of the Choir, and contemporary with it. This work is thus described\r\nby Se\xc3\xb1or Ria\xc3\xb1o: \xe2\x80\x98The reja is 42 feet wide by 19 inches high; it rests\r\non a pediment of marble ornamented with masks and bronze work upon which\r\nrises the reja, which is divided horizontally by means of a frieze of\r\nornamentation, and this again vertically into five compartments. In each\r\nvertical division there is a pilaster of four sides formed of _repouss\xc3\xa9_\r\nplates, carved with a fine ornamentation in the Renaissance style; this\r\nis again terminated with life-size figures in high relief of bronze. The\r\nsecond compartment rises upon the band which divides it in a horizontal\r\nsense; it follows the same decoration in its pilasters, and is\r\nterminated by a series of coats of arms, torches, angels, and a variety\r\nof foliage which finishes the upper part. Upon the centre, hanging from\r\na thick chain, supported from the roof, is suspended a life-size Rood of\r\nadmirable effect, which completes the decoration. In several spots there\r\nare labels with mottoes in Latin; in one of them appears the following\r\ninscription, and the date of 1548, when the splendid work was finished:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anno MDXLVIII. Paul III. P.M. Carol. V. Imper. Rege. Joannes Martinez\r\nSiliccus Archiepiscopus Tolet. Hispaniae Primat.\xe2\x80\x99 The railings of the\r\nreja are silvered, and the reliefs and salient points gilt. The artist\r\nwho made it was Francisco Villalpando, a native of Valladolid; this\r\nmodel was chosen in preference to those of several artists, who\r\npresented their plans in competition before the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities; it is calculated that ten years elapsed before it was\r\nfinally finished, Villalpando was greatly distinguished likewise as a\r\nsculptor and architect.\xe2\x80\x9d By him are the gilt pulpits in the plateresque\r\nstyle, made from the bronze tomb that the Great Constable, De Luna, had\r\ncaused to be designed for himself. On a pier at the extremity of the\r\nchapel is the statue of the celebrated shepherd, Martin Alhaga, who is\r\nsaid to have, semi-miraculously, guided Alfonso VIII. and his army to\r\nthe rear of the Moorish forces at Las Navas de Tolosa--thus securing the\r\nvictory to the Christians. The king, who alone saw his features, is said\r\nto have designed the statue. Opposite is the figure of the Moorish\r\nAlfaqui, Abu Walid, whose intercession secured the old mosque to the\r\nCatholics, in the manner already narrated.\r\n\r\nThe splendour of the High Altar, with its jasper and bronzes, renders a\r\ndetailed description impossible and inadequate. Its magnificent retablo,\r\nrising to the very roof, is the richest gem of the Cathedral. Designed\r\nby Philip Vigarni (Borgo\xc3\xb1a), and painted and gilded by his brother Juan,\r\nnumerous other masters contributed to its excellences. We may name\r\nMa\xc3\xaetre Petit Jean (of France or Aragon), Almonacid (a converted Moor),\r\nCopin (a Dutchman), Francesco of Antwerp, Fernando del Rincon, Egas, and\r\nPedro Gumiel. The retablo is of wood and divided into five compartments\r\nby gorgeous columns. The subjects are from the New Testament, and are\r\nworked out with immense and ornate elaboration. The whole is crowned\r\nwith a colossal Calvary. Behind the High Altar is placed that\r\nextraordinary example of eighteenth-century bad taste, the too famous\r\n_Transparente_. The whole architecture, painting, statues, carving and\r\nbronze is the work of the same person, Narciso Thom\xc3\xa9 who completed it in\r\n1734. Much as we may denounce the taste (or rather the lack of it) of\r\nthis triumph of the Churrigueresque style, we are obliged to admire the\r\nwonderful execution of this misdirected genius.\r\n\r\nThe royal tombs lie around the High Altar. They were placed in recesses,\r\nsculptured in the Gothic style by Diego Copin of Holland, by order of\r\nCardinal Cisneros in 1507. The arches are peculiarly graceful and light.\r\nThe tombs themselves date from much earlier times. Here sleep their last\r\nsleep Alfonso VII., Sancho el Bravo, Sancho el Deseado, and several\r\nInfantes. To the left of the altar is the sepulchre, more glorious than\r\nany king\xe2\x80\x99s, of the great Cardinal Mendoza, erected by order of Isabel\r\nthe Catholic, who owed so much to him. It was the work of Covarrubias,\r\nand is all of precious marbles. One side is formed by the sarcophagus\r\nwith its recumbent effigy, the other by an altar. Above this last is a\r\nmedallion representing the Archbishop Adoring the Cross. Part of the\r\nwall was demolished to make room for this stately mausoleum. Beneath the\r\nCapilla Mayor is a subterranean chapel, not of special interest. It\r\ncontains a Burial of Christ by Copin, deserving of an inspection that in\r\nthe dim light is well-nigh impossible, and some pictures by Ricci.\r\n\r\nAt the eastern extremity of the Cathedral, behind the Capilla Mayor and\r\nprojecting beyond the general outline, is the chapel of San Ildefonso.\r\nErected by Archbishop de Rada, it remains the last important\r\nmiddle-pointed feature of the building, though considerably modified by\r\nCardinal Albornoz in the latter part of the fourteenth century. It is\r\neight-sided, and has beautiful traceried windows, and arches richly\r\nmoulded and decorated. In arched recesses, beneath gabled and pinnacled\r\ncanopies, are the tombs of Cardinal Albornoz, and several members of his\r\nfamily. There is much beautiful detail on the tomb of Don I\xc3\xb1igo de\r\nMendoza, who fell at Granada in 1491; and the sepulchre of the Bishop of\r\nAvila by Tejada is a noble temple of the plateresque. The altar is\r\nmodern. St. Ildefonso was the prelate who distinguished himself by his\r\nadvocacy of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. In return he is\r\nsaid to have received signal marks of favour from the Blessed Virgin,\r\nwho invested him with a cassock, came down to attend Matins in his\r\ncompany, and so forth.\r\n\r\nTo the north of this chapel is the larger Capilla de Santiago, likewise\r\nprojecting beyond the original ground plan, and dating from 1435. It was\r\nbuilt by order of the Great Constable, Alvaro de Luna, to be the place\r\nof sepulchre of himself and wife, on the site of an earlier chapel\r\ndedicated to St. Thomas \xc3\xa0 Becket. The plan is similar to that of the\r\nlast chapel described. Outside, the flat-pitched tile roof is finished\r\nwith a battlement and circular turrets at the angles. The most\r\nconspicuous features of the chapel are the tombs, in Carrara marble, of\r\nthe Constable Alvaro de Luna and his wife Do\xc3\xb1a Juana Pimentel. The\r\nConstable is shown in full armour, and at each corner of his tomb kneels\r\na knight of Santiago, of which order he was Grand Master. Four\r\nFranciscan monks attend on his lady. In niches in the wall repose\r\nkinsmen of the ill-fated Constable, the tombs all having been executed\r\nby permission of Isabel the Catholic, by Pablo Ortiz in 1488,\r\nthirty-five years after De Luna\xe2\x80\x99s death on the scaffold at Valladolid.\r\nThe tombs designed for the Constable in his lifetime were to have been\r\nfurnished with life-size figures in bronze, which, by mechanical\r\ncontrivance, were to have risen each time Mass was celebrated, and to\r\nhave remained during the service in a kneeling posture. These figures\r\nwere destroyed by the Infante Don Enrique, and the bronze was used by\r\nVillalpando for the pulpits in the Capilla Mayor. The retablo of the\r\nHigh Altar reveals the portraits of the founder and his wife by Juan de\r\nSegovia. \xe2\x80\x9cThe chapel,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Street, \xe2\x80\x9cbears evidence in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98perpendicular\xe2\x80\x99 character of its panelling, arcading and crocketing, of\r\nthe poverty of the age in the matter of design. At this period, indeed,\r\nthe designers were sculptors rather than architects, and thought of\r\nlittle but the display of their own manual dexterity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPassing down a corridor between this chapel and that of Santa Leocadia\r\nwe reach the Capilla de los Reyes Nuevos, lying quite outside the\r\noriginal plan of the Cathedral. It was founded by Enrique II. of\r\nTrastamara, and contains his tomb, his wife\xe2\x80\x99s, and the sepulchres of\r\nEnrique III., his Queen, Katharine of Lancaster, Juan I. and Queen\r\nLeonor, and the effigy of Juan II., who is buried near Burgos. The\r\nchapel is a fine specimen of the Renaissance style, reconstructed by\r\nAlfonso de Covarrubias in 1534. The portal is fine, and is guarded by\r\ntwo kings armed and bearing escutcheons. During Mass, a gorgeously\r\napparelled functionary holds upright a mace, crowned and jewelled, and\r\nwith the arms of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe side-chapels of the Cathedral are not, on the whole, as interesting\r\nas one would expect in a building of such antiquity and associations. To\r\nthe south of the Capilla de San Ildefonso is the Capilla de la Trinidad;\r\nnext comes the entrance to the Chapter House or Sala Capitular, an early\r\nsixteenth-century work with an artesonado ceiling in red, blue, and\r\ngold, excelling anything of the kind in Andalusia. The thirteen frescoes\r\nadorning the walls of the Chapter House are by Juan de Borgo\xc3\xb1a, who was\r\nalso responsible for the earlier series of portraits of the archbishops.\r\nCopin\xe2\x80\x99s work is to be recognised in the archiepiscopal throne, the other\r\nstalls being by Francisco de Lara. Returning to the church through a\r\nportal in the Moorish style, we find on the left the chapel of San\r\nNicolas, followed by the chapels of San Gil, San Juan Bautista, Santa\r\nAna, and the Reyes Viejos, founded in 1290 as the Capilla del Espritu\r\nSanto, with a fine reja by C\xc3\xa9spedes. The chapel of Santa Lucia, founded\r\nby Archbishop de Rada, is, of course, in the best Gothic style, and has\r\n\xe2\x80\x9can extremely rich recessed arch in stucco, of late Moorish work--a\r\ncurious contrast to the fine pointed work of the chapel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Capilla de San Eugenio contains the alabaster effigy of Bishop del\r\nCastillo (1521), and the tomb in the Mudejar style of the Alguacil\r\nFernan Gudiel (1278). The statue of the saint is by Copin, the\r\npaintings on the retablo by Juan de Borgo\xc3\xb1a. Adjacent to the chapel is\r\nthe colossal figure of Saint Christopher, usually seen in Spanish\r\nchurches. This figure is probably coeval with the fabric, but was\r\nrestored in 1638. A primitive style of art is also to be seen in the\r\naltar-piece of the Capilla de San Martin. The next two chapels--de la\r\nEpifania and de la Concepcion--do not present any features of special\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn the south-west angle of the church is the interesting Moz\xc3\xa1rabic\r\nChapel, built in 1504 by Enrique de Egas, under the orders of the famous\r\nCardinal Ximenes de Cisneros. It is devoted to the celebration of Mass\r\nand the offices of the church according to the Moz\xc3\xa1rabic ritual, which\r\ntill the middle of the last century was followed in six of the parish\r\nchurches. The Cupola dates from 1626, and was the work of Jorge Manuel\r\nTheotocopuli. The porch is Gothic, and the reja in good Renaissance\r\nstyle, executed by Juan Frances in 1524. The frescoes, of no great\r\nvalue, painted by Juan de Borgo\xc3\xb1a, represent the expedition against\r\nOran, in which the great Cardinal took part. Miss Hannah Lynch gives a\r\nvigorously worded account of a service in this chapel according to its\r\npeculiar rite: \xe2\x80\x9cThe quaint old ritual may be heard every morning at 9\r\nA.M., and will be found extremely puzzling to follow. The canons, in a\r\nsombre, flat monotone, chant responses to the officiating priest at the\r\naltar. The sound combines the enervating effect of the hum of wings,\r\nwhirr of looms, wooden thud of pedals, the boom and rush of immense\r\nwings circling round and round. After the first stupefaction, I have\r\nnever heard anything more calculated to produce headache, nervous\r\nirritation, or the contrary soporific effect. In summer, it must be\r\nterrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the opposite, or north-west, angle of the church is the Chapel of San\r\nJuan or of the Canons, so called because Mass can be celebrated here\r\nonly by those dignitaries. It was built in 1537 by Covarrubias in the\r\nRenaissance style, and occupies the site of the old tower chapel, called\r\nthe Quo Vadis. The ceiling is of artesonado, in gold and black, with\r\ncarved flowers and figures. Since 1870 this chapel has been the\r\nrepository of the Cathedral Treasure, styled Las Alhajas, or the Jewels.\r\nHere is kept the gorgeous _custodia_, or portable tabernacle, made by\r\norder of Cardinal Cisneros by Juan de Arfe, who began it in 1517 and\r\ncompleted it without assistance in 1524. This triumph of the\r\nsilversmith\xe2\x80\x99s craft is in the form of a Gothic temple, eight feet high,\r\nwith all the architectural details, such as columns, arches, and\r\nvaultings, the whole resembling delicate lacework. Scenes from the life\r\nof our Saviour are illustrated in reliefs. There are no fewer than two\r\nhundred and sixty statues of various sizes, all exhibiting the same\r\nskill. The tabernacle was gilded over in 1595 by Valdivieso and Morino.\r\nThe _viril_ inside, in which the Host is exposed, was made of the first\r\ngold brought from America, is completely covered with precious stones,\r\nand weighs twenty-nine pounds. In the Treasure is also included the\r\nmantle of the Virgen del Sagrario, considered by Se\xc3\xb1or de Ria\xc3\xb1o the most\r\nremarkable specimen of embroidery that exists in Spain. It is described\r\nin the following manner: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is made of twelve yards of cloth of silver,\r\nentirely covered with gold and precious stones. In the centre is an\r\nornament of amethysts and diamonds. Eight other jewels appear on each\r\nside of enamelled gold, emeralds, and large rubies; a variety of other\r\njewels are placed at intervals round the mantle, and at the lower part\r\nare the arms of Cardinal Sandoval [seventeenth century] enamelled on\r\ngold and studded with sapphires and rubies. The centre of this mantle is\r\ncovered with flowers and pomegranates embroidered in seed-pearls of\r\ndifferent sizes. Round the borders are rows of large pearls. Besides the\r\ngems which are employed in this superb work of art, no less than 257\r\nounces of pearls of different sizes, 300 ounces of gold thread, 160\r\nounces of small pieces of enamelled gold, and eight ounces of emeralds\r\nwere used.\xe2\x80\x9d The beautiful dish, repouss\xc3\xa9 in silver, the designs on\r\nwhich represent the Rape of the Sabines and the Death of Darius, was\r\nbelieved to be the work of Benvenuto Cellini, but is now ascribed to the\r\nFlemish artist, Mathias M\xc3\xa9line. Among the Alhajas are also four\r\ngeographical globes, with large silver figures, gleaming with\r\ngems--eighteenth-century work. Of historical interest is the sword, said\r\nto have been worn by Alfonso VI. on his entry into Toledo, and the\r\noriginal letter written by St. Louis of France to the Chapter, bestowing\r\nsacred relics obtained from the Great Emperor: \xe2\x80\x9cGiven at Etampes, the\r\nyear of our Lord, 1248, month of May.\xe2\x80\x9d Other objects of value are the\r\nCope of Cardinal Albornoz and the Cruz de la Manga, made in the\r\nsixteenth century by Gregorio de Varona, a native of the city. Here,\r\nalso, are the archiepiscopal cross, planted by Cardinal Mendoza on the\r\nsummit of the Alhambra in 1492, and the Golden Bible in three volumes,\r\ndating from the twelfth century. It is to be doubted if the accumulation\r\nof these splendid objects, intended for diverse practical uses, in one\r\ncollection, serves to show any of them to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nOn the north aisle are the chapels of Teresa de Haro, Nuestra Se\xc3\xb1ora de\r\nla Antigua--where the Spanish colours used in the Moorish campaigns were\r\nblessed--of the Pila Bautism\xc3\xa1l, with a beautiful bronze font, and a\r\nreja by C\xc3\xa9spedes; and the large Capilla de San Pedro, built in 1442 in\r\nthe Gothic style by Archbishop de Rojas. The founder\xe2\x80\x99s fine monument was\r\nplaced here in the eighteenth century. On the other side of the Puerta\r\ndel Reloj is the Capilla de la Virgen del Sagrario, noted for a statue\r\nof the Blessed Virgin, which she is said to have kissed on her visit to\r\nSt. Ildefonso. The statue is of dark-coloured wood, and was formerly\r\nclothed in a mantle embroidered by Felipe Corral; and composed of gold,\r\nrubies, emeralds, and pearls, now kept in the Treasury. In this chapel\r\nthe degree of doctor is conferred on licentiates. The two small chapels\r\nof the Cristo and of Santa Leocadia are adjacent to the entrance to the\r\nCapilla de los Reyes Nuevos.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the Chapel of the Virgen del Sagrario are a set of apartments,\r\nbuilt with it upon the site of an old hospital, by Nicolas de Vergara,\r\njunior, at the close of the sixteenth century. These rooms are the\r\nSacristia, Vestuario, Cuarto de la Cust\xc3\xb3dia, and Ochavo. The Sacristia,\r\nentered through a portal 26 feet high, contains paintings by El Greco,\r\nto be noticed in the chapter on that master; the \xe2\x80\x98Betrayal of Christ,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nby Goya; and a ceiling fresco by Luca Giordano, representing the Miracle\r\nof San Ildefonso. The Vestuario contains pictures by several Italian\r\nmasters, among them \xe2\x80\x98Paul III.\xe2\x80\x99 by Titian; a replica of the portrait at\r\nNaples; a \xe2\x80\x98Madonna\xe2\x80\x99 by Rubens; and a \xe2\x80\x98St. Francis\xe2\x80\x99 by El Greco. The\r\nCustodia was till lately the Cathedral Treasury. The Ochavo, at the back\r\nof the Capilla de la Virgen, is richly adorned and contains the\r\ncollection of relics, among them massive silver caskets, wonderfully\r\nwrought, for the bones of the saints Leocadia and Eugenius.\r\n\r\nThe vestments preserved here, to the number of forty sets, belong mostly\r\nto the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and are of the most splendid\r\ndescription. \xe2\x80\x9cEach set [says Ria\xc3\xb1o] generally includes a chasuble,\r\ndalmatic, cope, altar frontal, covers for the gospel stands, and other\r\nsmaller pieces. The embroideries on the orphreys, which are formed of\r\nfigures of saints, are as perfect as the miniatures on illuminated MSS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Cloisters to the north-west of the church were built by Cardinal\r\nTenorio in 1389. They are not, as Miss Lynch observes, to be compared\r\nwith those of Burgos, of Santiago, or of Oviedo. The garden they enclose\r\nlends a brighter, gayer note to the columned and arched galleries than\r\nis found in those other cathedrals. The frescoes in the lower cloister\r\nwere painted by Francisco Bayeu, and illustrate the lives of St.\r\nEugenius and the legend of the _Ni\xc3\xb1o perdido_.\r\n\r\nWe should, perhaps, have described the exterior of the Cathedral first,\r\nbut from the sightseer\xe2\x80\x99s point of view the interior is, of course, more\r\nimportant. It is a general subject of complaint that it is extremely\r\ndifficult to obtain a good view of any considerable part of the fabric\r\nfrom the outside, nor does it stand out as conspicuously from a distance\r\nas its imposing dimensions would lead one to suppose. The best view is\r\nto be obtained from the church of Nuestra Se\xc3\xb1ora de la Valle, above the\r\nPuente de San Martin. The exterior, with its flying buttresses, finials,\r\nand rose-windows, reflects the Gothic spirit of the interior. The west\r\nfa\xc3\xa7ade is flanked by two towers, that above the Chapel of the Canons\r\nalone being complete. It is 295 feet high, and was begun by order of\r\nArchbishop Tenorio, in 1380, by Rodrigo Alfons, and completed under\r\nArchbishop Contreras in 1440 by Alvar Gomez. On the summit is a small\r\nspire, surmounted by a cross, a vane, and an arrow. Here are hung the\r\nbells, among them the famous Campana Gorda, weighing nearly two tons,\r\nand whose note reaches to Madrid. The tower also contains a peal called\r\nthe Matraca, worked continuously by mechanism from Maundy Thursday till\r\nEaster Saturday. The view from the summit is far-reaching and inspiring.\r\n\r\nAmong the finest features of this noble church are its eight principal\r\nentrances. In the western fa\xc3\xa7ade are three portals--the Puerto del\r\nPerdon in the centre, flanked by the Puertas de los Escrib\xc3\xa1nos and de\r\nla Torre. All date from the first half of the fifteenth century and are\r\nin the Gothic style. The Puerta del Perdon forms a noble arch, richly\r\nornamented, and divided into two smaller arches by a column surmounted\r\nby the figure of Christ, above which are the Twelve Apostles. Above\r\nthese again is a relief in the Renaissance style representing the gift\r\nof the Chasuble to San Ildefonso. The smaller doors are in single\r\narches, and are sculptured with statues of angels and patriarchs. The\r\nPuerta de los Escrib\xc3\xa1nos is so called because through it the notaries\r\nenter the church to take their oaths. It is also called the Puerta del\r\nJuicio. Above it is a long inscription commemorating the taking of\r\nGranada and the expulsion of the Jews. Above the portals the fa\xc3\xa7ade is\r\nadorned with a colossal sculpture of the Last Supper, the Saviour and\r\nthe Apostles being seated each in a niche, and the table reaching from\r\nbuttress to buttress. The fa\xc3\xa7ade is pierced with a beautiful rose-window\r\nthirty feet across with a glazed arcade beneath.\r\n\r\nOn the south side are the Puertas Llana and de los Leones. The former in\r\nthe classic style, was made by Ignacio Ha\xc3\xa1m in 1800. The Puerta de los\r\nLeones gives access to the transept, and is a magnificent Gothic work,\r\nerected in 1460 by the Fleming, de Egas, and ornamented by Juan Alem\xc3\xa1n.\r\nThe sculpture of the portal is perfect. The six columns of the atrium\r\nare surmounted by six lions holding shields. Here are the famous bronze\r\ndoors, wrought by Villalpando and Ruy Diaz del Corral in 1545. The\r\nwood-carving and decoration employed a great many masters, among whom\r\nmay be mentioned Velasco, Troyas, and the two Copins. Between them was\r\ndivided the sum of 68,672 maravedis. At the opposite or northern end of\r\nthe transept is the Puerta del Reloj, dating from the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth century, and so named from the clock above it. The door is of\r\nbronze and above it is a fine rose-window of about the same period. It\r\nis considered by Street the best example of stained glass now remaining\r\nin the Cathedral. West of this, the Puerta de Santa Catalina leads into\r\nthe eastern cloister. The decoration is profuse. St. Catharine, and the\r\ninstruments of her martyrdom, are shown, with the arms of Spain and the\r\nTenorio family. The Puerta de la Presentacion, also leading into the\r\ncloister, is in the Renaissance style, and dates from 1565. Pedro\r\nCasta\xc3\xb1eda, Juan Vasquez, Torribio Rodriguez, Juan Manzano, and Andr\xc3\xa9s\r\nHernandez are named as the designers of this very fine portal. The\r\ncloisters are entered from the west side next to the tower, by the\r\nPuerta del Mollete, so called because _molletes_ or rolls were or are\r\ndistributed to the poor here.\r\n\r\nThe chapel and cloister of San Bias on the north side of the cloisters\r\nare the most important additions made to the structure in the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The chapel contains the monument of the founder, Cardinal\r\nTenorio, and \xe2\x80\x9cin the cloister walls,\xe2\x80\x9d says Street, \xe2\x80\x9ca door which, in the\r\ncapricious cusping and crocketing of its traceried work, illustrates the\r\nextremes into which Spanish architects of this age ran in their\r\nelaboration of detail and affectation of novelty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DECLINE OF THE CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nToledo, up till then hardly distinguished for its loyalty to the Crown,\r\nloved Isabel the Catholic, and on her account, perhaps, rendered\r\nobedience to her Aragonese husband. The Catholic sovereigns liked the\r\ncity, and generally held their Court there. The magnificent Cardinal\r\nMendoza was the prime mover in the expedition against Granada, and\r\nplanted the Cross on the summit of the Alhambra. The power of the\r\nprimacy was in no way diminished by the consolidation of the monarchy,\r\nand Toledo still looked rather to its archbishop than to its king for\r\nguidance and governance. Under Ferdinand and Isabel it prospered\r\nexceedingly. The arts of peace were studied, industries flourished, and\r\nthe more adventurous and restless spirits found an outlet for their\r\nenergies in colonial enterprises beyond the seas instead of cutting each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s throats in the byways of the city. Toledo became courtly and\r\nurbane. The luckless princess, Juana, was born at the Alcazar in 1479;\r\nand here the Infanta Isabel was married on April 29, 1498, to the King\r\nof Portugal. Only a few months later her corpse was brought hither from\r\nZaragoza, to be laid in the convent of Santa Isabel.\r\n\r\nThe death of Queen Isabel, and the proclamation of Juana and Felipe I.\r\non May 22, 1502, put an end to the long spell of peace. Toledo sided at\r\nfirst with Ferdinand against his son-in-law, and was held by the Silvas\r\nagainst the latter\xe2\x80\x99s forces under the Marquis de Villena. In the\r\nfollowing year (1506) the Ayalas, supported by the townsmen generally,\r\ntook possession of the town, and resolved to maintain its liberties\r\nagainst the Flemish favourites and centralising tendencies of the new\r\n_r\xc3\xa9gime_. The Silvas, as a matter of course, ranged themselves on the\r\nopposite side, and the streets ran red with blood. Toledo was herself\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe accession of the Flemish prince, Charles, afterwards emperor,\r\ndetermined the Castilians to make a stand for national independence.\r\nWhat city had so good a claim to be the headquarters of the movement,\r\nthe focus of anti-foreign agitation, as Toledo the turbulent? In 1520\r\noccurred the outbreak of the _Comuneros_ movement. At its head were four\r\ngentlemen of Toledo: Hernando D\xc3\xa1valos, Gonzalo Gaytan, Pedro de Ayala,\r\nand (greatest of all) Juan de Padilla. Twenty thousand citizens rallied\r\nto the cry of \xe2\x80\x9cPadilla y Comunidad!\xe2\x80\x9d and the movement spread from the\r\nTagus to Salamanca and westwards to the frontiers of Portugal. To\r\nJuana, imprisoned at Tordesillas, herself a Toledan, protestations of\r\nloyalty and devotion were addressed. But denounce her son\xe2\x80\x99s fraudulently\r\nobtained sovereignty she would not. Meanwhile Charles\xe2\x80\x99s forces were not\r\nidle. The Alcaide, Clemente de Aguayo, held the tower of San Martin, and\r\nDon Juan de Silva, the Alcazar, against the insurgents. But the townsmen\r\nwere victorious. Padilla, however, was defeated at Villalar, and\r\nexecuted, with his brave lieutenants, Juan Bravo and Maldonado.\r\n\r\nIn the Comunero leader\xe2\x80\x99s dauntless wife, Maria de Pacheco, liberty found\r\na new champion and Spain a new heroine. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was found praying at the\r\nfoot of the Cross,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Lynch, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen her servants brought her the\r\nnews of Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s defeat and death. She rose, robed herself in black,\r\nand walked to the Alcazar between her husband\xe2\x80\x99s lieutenants, D\xc3\xa1valos and\r\nAcu\xc3\xb1a, who bore a standard representing Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s execution. They named\r\nher captain of the insurgents, and found her implacable and violent, but\r\nstill a sovereign commander.\xe2\x80\x9d For sixteen months under this Castilian\r\nJoan of Arc the old city of the Visigoths held out against the armies of\r\nCharles V. Routed in a bloody sortie on October 16, 1521, by Zu\xc3\xb1iga,\r\nprior of San Juan, the Comuneros were obliged, ten days later, to\r\nabandon the gates to the besiegers. A truce was agreed to, while the\r\ndemands of the citizens should be presented to the Emperor. Maria\r\nremained in her own house, as in a fortress, guarded by her faithful\r\ntroops. But on February 3 the murder of a citizen brought on a renewal\r\nof the conflict. Desperate battle waged in every street and lane. Maria,\r\nassailed and valiantly defended in her stronghold, at last cut her way\r\nthrough, and retired to Portugal, dying at Oporto years afterwards. The\r\ntownsmen were worsted, and sullenly submitted. Toledo had fought her\r\nlast fight.\r\n\r\nHer day was over. Charles V. forgave her, and would come at times to\r\nlive in the Alcazar. She was still the capital of Spain. But her haughty\r\ntemper and the arrogance of her clergy matched ill with the policy of\r\nPhilip II. In 1560 Madrid--upstart, provincial Madrid--was proclaimed\r\nthe _\xc3\xbanica corte_. Less important than under the Khalifate, Toledo\r\nbecame a mere provincial town. But the Church did not desert her. She is\r\nstill the metropolitan see of Spain.\r\n\r\nLet us see what the monarchs of United Spain did for the old city, and\r\nwhat monuments remain of the days when it was Court and capital.\r\n\r\nThe church of San Juan de los Reyes, near the Puente de San Martin, was\r\nbuilt in 1476 by Ferdinand and Isabel, in thanksgiving for the victory\r\nof Toro gained over the Portuguese allies of Juana, nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cla\r\nBeltraneja.\xe2\x80\x9d The first architect was a Fleming, Juan Guas, one of the\r\nbuilders of the cathedral. The church was intended to receive the ashes\r\nof the royal founders, but after the capture of Granada it was decided\r\nto establish the mausoleum in that city, and the completion of San Juan\r\nde los Reyes was delayed till the seventeenth century. In consequence,\r\nthe architecture exhibits the transition from the Late Gothic to the\r\nLate Renaissance style. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d remarks Street, \xe2\x80\x9ccan be more\r\nelaborate than much of the detail of this church, yet I have seen few\r\nbuildings less pleasing or harmonious.\xe2\x80\x9d The exterior is unpromising, and\r\nis decorated, if we can use the word in such a connection, with festoons\r\nof rusty chains which fettered the limbs of the Christians in Moorish\r\nprisons. The chief entrance, to the north, was completed by Covarrubias\r\nin 1610, and is in the decadent style of architecture. It is adorned\r\nwith inferior statuary, and the arms and initials of the Catholic\r\nsovereigns.\r\n\r\nThe interior is composed of a single nave, two hundred feet long and\r\nfrom forty-three to seventy feet wide. There are four chapels on one\r\nside and three on the other. At the east end of the church is a shallow\r\nfive-sided apse, forming the Capilla Mayor. Over the junction of the\r\nnave and transept is an octagonal cupola, resting on four fine pillars,\r\nwith a pointed dome and a window in each face. At the west end of the\r\nchurch is a deep gallery, containing the choir. The altar dates from the\r\nRenaissance period, and is brought well forward into the nave. It came\r\nfrom the suppressed church of Santa Cruz. Above it is a blue velvet\r\ncanopy, embroidered with the eagle, the symbol of St. John. The whole\r\nfabric is enriched with statuary, tracery, carving, and heraldic devices\r\nin almost reckless profusion. The yoke and the arrows--the devices of\r\nthe Catholic sovereigns--and their coats of arms are repeated again and\r\nagain. Among the inscriptions is one commemorating the foundation of the\r\nchurch. It runs: \xe2\x80\x9cEste monasterio \xc3\xa9 \xc3\xa9glesia mandaron hacer los muy\r\nesclarecidos Principes \xc3\xa9 se\xc3\xb1ores D. Hernando \xc3\xa9 Do\xc3\xb1a Isabel, Rey y Reina\r\nde Castilla, de Leon, de Aragon, de Sicilia, los cuales se\xc3\xb1ores por\r\nbienaventurado matrimonio y u\xc3\xb1aron los dichos Reinos, seyendo el dicho\r\nrey y se\xc3\xb1or natural de los reinos de Aragon y Sicilia, y seyendo la\r\ndicha se\xc3\xb1ora Reina y se\xc3\xb1ora natural de los Reinos de Castilla y Leon; el\r\ncual fundaron \xc3\xa1 gloria de nuestro se\xc3\xb1or Dios, y de la bienaventurada\r\nMadre suya, nuestra Se\xc3\xb1ora la Virg\xc3\xa9n Maria, y por especial devocion que\r\nle ovieron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdmirable as is the church in its general structure, and in the detail\r\nand execution of its ornamentation, it is garish and ostentatious. There\r\nis a superabundance of light and luxury. Here there is no dim religious\r\nlight, no suggestion of mystery or devotion. Prayer would seem\r\nincompatible with the whole character of the edifice. More favourable\r\nwas the opinion of Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier, who declared that \xe2\x80\x9cGothic art\r\nnever produced anything more suave, more elegant, or more fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAttached to the church is the convent, bestowed on the Franciscans, and\r\npillaged by the French in 1808. It has been converted into a museum,\r\nwhich does not contain much of great interest. The most important\r\nexhibits are fragments of Visigothic inscriptions and Moorish tile-work.\r\n\r\nThe cloister of San Juan de los Reyes is a gem of florid Gothic, and the\r\nfinest part of the whole fabric. There are two galleries, one above the\r\nother, the lower with traceried openings, the upper with large open\r\narches. As in the church, there is here an excess of decoration, hardly\r\na square inch on pillar, arch, and vaulting being free from sculptured\r\nornamentation. There is a bewildering profusion of statues of angels,\r\nmen, and animals, of scroll-work and foliage, heraldic devices and\r\ninscriptions. The whole is dazzlingly white--more like a temple of the\r\nSun than a shrine of \xe2\x80\x9cthe pale Galilean.\xe2\x80\x9d The original effect, perhaps,\r\nwas less crude, for the church and cloisters have been recently\r\nrestored, and, it must be confessed, not too skilfully.\r\n\r\nA most beautiful specimen of azulejo work has been built into the\r\nnorth-west wall. It comes from the suppressed monastery of the Calced\r\nAugustines, and is said to have been a part of the ornamentation of the\r\nancient palace of Don Rodrigo--wherever that may have been situated.\r\n\r\nBefore the finishing touches had been put to San Juan de los Reyes, the\r\nlast important Gothic work of Toledo, the erection of one of the two\r\nearliest examples of the Renaissance style in Spain had been begun. The\r\nhospital of Santa Cruz was built between the years 1494 and 1514 by\r\nEnrique de Egas, of Brussels, some ten years after he had completed the\r\ncollege of the same name at Valladolid. The hospital was designed by the\r\nfounder, the mighty Cardinal Mendoza, as an asylum for foundlings. He\r\ndied in 1495, and left 75,000 ducats to the queen for the completion of\r\nthe work. Isabel it was who chose the site overlooking the bridge of\r\nAlcantara, where formerly the palace of the legendary King Galafre is\r\nfabled to have stood. Among other stories connected with the spot is\r\nthat of a Leonese princess wedded against her will to a Moorish prince,\r\nher union with whom was prevented by the intervention of an angel. As in\r\nall the early specimens of Spanish Renaissance architecture, the\r\ngroundwork of the building approximates to the Gothic, the new ideas\r\nmanifesting themselves in the decoration and carving. The portal is\r\nsuperb. The reliefs represent the Adoration of the Cross by St. Helena,\r\nSt. Peter, St. Paul, and the founder, Cardinal Mendoza, two pages also\r\nappearing, bearing mitre and helmet. Other reliefs, exquisitely\r\nchiselled, have for subjects the espousals of St. Joachim and St. Anne,\r\nand Charity. The four cardinal virtues are shown, and everywhere, amidst\r\na maze of ornamentation, occur Mendoza\xe2\x80\x99s arms and device. The\r\nplateresque windows, with their rejas in the local style, are deserving\r\nof admiration. Entering, we find a vast _patio_, enclosed by a double\r\narcaded gallery of marble, and, crossing it, ascend a grand staircase\r\nwith a fine ceiling of the _artesonado_ kind. The chapel, in the form of\r\na Maltese cross, has also a fine ceiling, and Gothic pillars,\r\nbeautifully carved, that attest the splendid appearance once presented\r\nby this dismantled building. Some of the columns adorning Santa Cruz\r\nwere brought from the Visigothic church of Santa Leocadia.\r\n\r\nTo the same period belongs the Franciscan convent and church of San Juan\r\nde la Penitencia, begun by order of Cisneros in 1514, and finished by\r\nhis secretary, Fray Francisco Ruiz, Bishop of Avila. The semi-Moorish\r\npalace of the Pantojas was utilised in its construction, and the whole\r\nbuilding bears traces of Arabic, or rather Mudejar, workmanship.\r\nEntering the chapel by a porch adorned with the great Cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s arms\r\nand foliations in the Gothic style, we find ourselves in a sombre\r\nedifice of a single nave, revealing a curious medley of styles. The roof\r\nis a fine example of the artesonado. Over the transept, which is divided\r\nfrom the nave by a plateresque reja, is a cupola with a stalactite roof\r\nof the Moorish pattern. The principal retablo is early Renaissance, and\r\nseveral of the altars may be classed as Baroque. The most interesting\r\nfeature of the church is the tomb of the Bishop of Avila, who died in\r\n1528. It is in the Renaissance style, and was the work of a Lombard\r\nartist. It is wrought in Sicilian marble, and is thus described by Ponz:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbove a large stone divided by three pilasters to form three pedestals\r\nthere are an equal number of statues seated, representing Faith, Hope,\r\nand Charity. Between the pilasters are the arms of the Bishop--five\r\ncastles. In a framed recess are the urn, couch, and recumbent figure. In\r\nfront of the urn are seen two weeping children, and within the recess\r\nfour angels draw aside the curtains. On either side are two Doric\r\npillars supporting the frieze, which is inscribed, \xe2\x80\x98Beati mortui qui in\r\nDomino moriantur.\xe2\x80\x99 On the edge are two antique columns admirably\r\nexecuted. Between these columns and pilasters are statues, St. James and\r\nSt. Andrew, and above, the figures of children. Over all is a bas-relief\r\nof the Annunciation, with the statues of St. John the Divine and St.\r\nJohn Baptist, one-half the size of the Virtues below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Emperor-King Charles V. had, as we have seen, small reason to love\r\nToledo, but he did something for the permanent embellishment of the\r\ncity, and the last architectural monuments reared on its craggy\r\npeninsula belong to his era.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to ascribe the Alcazar, to which reference has so often\r\nbeen made, to any one epoch. It has undergone so many vicissitudes, so\r\nmany reconstructions, that the name, as we have employed it, must be\r\nunderstood to represent a site rather than the actual palace. A\r\nstronghold of some sort has always been here--possibly, in Roman times,\r\nthe Arx, where tradition avers the martyr Leocadia suffered death. The\r\nArabian geographer, Jerif al Edris, writing in 1154, describes Toledo as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ca town great in extent and population, extremely strong, with fine\r\nramparts, and an Alcazaba, fortified and impregnable.\xe2\x80\x9d This citadel was\r\ndoubtless the Alcazar, which was strengthened and rebuilt by successive\r\nCastilian kings, and is said to have been the residence of the Cid, the\r\nfirst Christian Alcaide. Added to, reconstructed, partially demolished\r\nand repeatedly restored, it must have presented an aspect rude and\r\nheterogeneous enough when, in 1538, Charles V. ordered Alonso de\r\nCovarrubias and Luis de Vega to rebuild the palace entirely on the\r\nlines of the new Alcazar of Granada. The Flemish Emperor may, then,\r\nfairly be considered the founder of the present fortress-palace, though\r\nit has since his time undergone radical transformations. It was burnt\r\ndown during the War of Succession in 1710, restored sixty years later,\r\ndestroyed again by the French in 1810, and devastated by a third\r\nconflagration as late as 1887. Since 1882 it has been the seat of the\r\nRoyal Military Academy.\r\n\r\nThe northern fa\xc3\xa7ade was constructed after the designs of Covarrubias,\r\nand looks on the square created by Ferdinand and Isabel in 1502. The\r\nreconstruction was so complete that probably no stone of the older\r\nfa\xc3\xa7ade was left in its place. The fa\xc3\xa7ade is severe and majestic,\r\nrevealing classical influence, though not without important traces of\r\nthe plateresque. It is flanked by towers, and adorned with a handsome\r\nportal--the work of Enrique de Egas, brother-in-law of Covarrubias. Over\r\nthe door are the Imperial arms, supported by the figures of two heralds\r\nor mace-bearers. The fortress-like eastern fa\xc3\xa7ade is believed to be a\r\npart of the original Alcazar as restored by Alfonso X.; the western side\r\nof the building dates from the reign of the Catholic sovereigns, and the\r\nsouthern, with massive Doric pillars and square turrets, was built after\r\ndesigns by Juan de Herrera.\r\n\r\nThe inner court, or _patio_, is described by a Spanish writer as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csolemn, grandiose, full of majesty ... constructed for the\r\ndwelling-place of the August C\xc3\xa6sar.\xe2\x80\x9d It forms a spacious parallelogram\r\nand is enclosed by an arcade in two storeys with columns of the\r\nCorinthian order. Above the capitals are displayed the escutcheons of\r\nthe various kingdoms ruled over by Charles. The modern restorers of the\r\npalace have adorned the court with a statue of the Emperor in the Roman\r\ncostume in which he was so fond of being represented.\r\n\r\nThe finest feature of the palace must have been the staircase, designed\r\nby Villalpando and Herrera, which has been to some extent restored after\r\nits destruction by Stahremberg in 1710. One of the widest staircases in\r\nthe world, \xe2\x80\x9cit ends,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Hannah Lynch \xe2\x80\x9cin the void!\xe2\x80\x9d In truth,\r\nthe Alcazar is not to-day a very interesting building. It is, in\r\nreality, quite impossible to identify the scenes of the romantic and\r\nhistorical episodes which we know occurred in one or other of the\r\nsuccessive Alcazars. But the room in which Alfonso VI. died and the\r\nwindow at which the hapless Blanche de Bourbon wept, _pace_ the local\r\nguides, must have disappeared to the last stone and fragment ages ago.\r\nAll that can be said of the palace to-day is that it forms an imposing\r\nlandmark, and affords from its northern terrace one of the finest views\r\nof Toledo.\r\n\r\nTo the age of Charles V. (or Carlos I. as in Spain he would properly be\r\ncalled) belongs the Hospital de San Juan Bautista, styled the Hospital\r\nde Afuera (outside) in the suburb of Covachuelas. The building was begun\r\nin 1541 by order of Archbishop Juan de Tavera, who died on his return\r\nfrom the baptism of Prince Carlos at Valladolid. The building was\r\ncarried on after Bustamente\xe2\x80\x99s death by the two Vergaras, and completed\r\nabout 1600. The fa\xc3\xa7ade dates from the eighteenth century and is still\r\nunfinished. The courtyard, spacious and imposing, is divided into two\r\nand enclosed by colonnades. A fine Renaissance portal by Berruguete\r\nleads into the large chapel, which is in the form of a cross and\r\nsurmounted by a dome. The pavement is of black and white marble. Before\r\nthe altar is the tomb of Archbishop Tavera by Berruguete. This is one of\r\nthe finest monuments in Spain. It was finished by Berruguete when he was\r\nover eighty years old, in 1561, his death taking place the same year in\r\none of the rooms under the great clock. His sons received nearly a\r\nmillion maravedis for the work. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cardinal,\xe2\x80\x9d says Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis stretched out upon his tomb in his pontifical habit. Death has\r\npinched his nose with its strong fingers, and the last contraction of\r\nthe muscles, in their endeavour to retain the soul about to leave the\r\nbody for ever, puckers up the corners of the mouth and lengthens the\r\nchin; never was there a cast taken after death more horribly true; and\r\nyet the beauty of the work is such, that you forget any amount of\r\nrepulsiveness that the subject may possess. Little children in attitudes\r\nof grief support the plinth and the Cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s coat of arms. The most\r\nsupple and softest clay could not be more easy or more pliant; it is not\r\ncarved, it is kneaded!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hospital contains some of El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s most notable work, which will\r\nbe noticed in the chapter on that master.\r\n\r\nTo Charles V. Toledo also owes the grand New Gate of Visagra, built in\r\n1550, and restored in 1575. It consists of two separate structures, or\r\ngateways, enclosing a _patio_. On the exterior of the north gate is\r\nshown the double eagle with the Spanish arms and a Latin\r\ninscription--all in sculptured granite. On the inside is a fine statue\r\nof St. Eugenio, variously attributed to Berruguete and Monegro. The\r\nstatues of Gothic kings, a life-sized angel with unsheathed sword,\r\nelegant capitals and balconies, combine to make this gateway one of the\r\nfinest approaches possessed by any city in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Ayuntamiento, or town hall, of Toledo was erected in the time of\r\nFerdinand and Isabel by the corregidor Gomez Manrique, and enlarged and\r\nrestored between 1576 and 1618 by the corregidor Juan Tello, under the\r\nsupervision of El Greco. The fa\xc3\xa7ade is composed of two storeys, the\r\nfirst consisting of nine arches with Doric columns which spring from\r\nmassive pillars, the second of as many arches with Ionic columns. The\r\nedifice is surmounted by two towers, crowned with steeples and\r\nweather-vanes. On the fine staircase may be read in letters of gold on a\r\nblue ground this admonition to the civic dignitaries of Toledo:\r\n\r\n    Nobles, discretes varones,\r\n    Que gobernais \xc3\xa1 Toledo,\r\n    En aquellas escalones,\r\n    Desechad las aficiones,\r\n    Codicio temor, y miedo,\r\n    For los comunes provechos,\r\n    Dejad los particulares;\r\n    Pues vos fizo Dios pilares\r\n    De tan riquisimos techos,\r\n    Estad firmes y derechos.\r\n\r\nThe Summer Council Chamber is handsomely decorated with _azulejos_, and\r\ncontains some battle pictures. The portraits of Carlos II. and his wife\r\nare the work of Carre\xc3\xb1o.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Bridge of Alcantara, of which mention has so often been\r\nmade in these pages, belongs indifferently to all the epochs of Toledo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhistory, so no apology is needed for mentioning it here. \xe2\x80\x9cIt constitutes\r\nto-day as in the past,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Amador de los Rios, \xe2\x80\x9cthe principal\r\nentrance to the city, and, constructed very wisely on one of the\r\nnarrowest parts of the river, it is formed of a great central arch of\r\nmore than twenty-eight metres in breadth, resting on the right on a\r\nsolid pile, often demolished, behind which is a smaller semicircular\r\narch, which is, in turn, sustained by the bridge head, founded on the\r\nrock and pierced by a still smaller arch or passage, where several\r\nVisigothic remains have been discovered.\xe2\x80\x9d At the outer or country end of\r\nthe historic bridge formerly stood a fortified tower, which was in 1787\r\nreplaced by the existing structure. This is in a pretentious style, and\r\nis decorated with various inscriptions, among them one commemorating the\r\nbuilding by order of Philip V. The majestic hexagonal tower on the town\r\nside, with its picturesque turrets, dates probably from 1259. Above it\r\nis a statue of St. Ildefonso, by Berruguete. Over the archway are\r\nsculptured the badges of Ferdinand and Isabel (the yoke and bundle of\r\narrows), commemorating the restoration of the tower, in 1489, by Gomez\r\nManrique. A noble bridge is this of Alcantara; old--old as the city--the\r\nwork of all Toledo\xe2\x80\x99s rulers, and like Toledo, grim, stern, rude,\r\ndestined, it would seem, to endure for ever. Romans, Visigoths, Moors\r\nand Castilians have lingered on it, triumphed on it, fled across it,\r\nfought upon it, and across it to-day must walk every traveller entering\r\nwith reverence this great temple of the medi\xc3\xa6val and bygone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL GRECO\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nALBERT F. CALVERT AND C. GASQUOINE HARTLEY\r\n\r\n\r\nDomeniko Theotokopuli,[A] known to us to-day as El Greco, was the first\r\ngreat painter of Spain, and in his strange and fascinating art, the\r\nSpanish School compels for the first time the attention of the world.\r\nAnd El Greco was not Spanish. He was born in Crete, it would seem about\r\nthe year 1548, and died at Toledo in 1614. Learning his art in Venice,\r\nin his early manner he is a pure Venetian, owing much to the work of the\r\nBassani, and more to the inspiration of Tintoretto, but in Toledo he\r\nbecame Spanish and himself, developing there a manner in which the\r\nspecial temper of the race finds an expression passionate enough, not\r\nequalled again, indeed, until the advent of Goya.\r\n\r\nThere will always be some men imaginative, entirely personal, who,\r\nlike El Greco, seek to express themselves, and in so doing, quite\r\nunwittingly probably, express the life of their age. Having the\r\ninterpretative--creative would perhaps be the truer word--genius, their\r\nwork becomes, as it were, a mirror, which reflects not the man alone,\r\nbut the circumstances that have formed his life. For, after all, what\r\nthe artist does is to use up what he has seen.\r\n\r\nThis is why El Greco seems to chronicle for us our impressions of\r\nToledo, and of Spain.\r\n\r\nSurely no other painter has lived in a city in such strong agreement\r\nwith his spirit. Think of the place--wind-swept, heat-dried,\r\nextraordinarily austere, yet flushed with colour, ochre-red shading to\r\nunusual greens; heaped upon its rocky throne above the yellow flowing\r\nTagus, its rugged silhouette straight cut against a sky hard and clear\r\nas enamel; and, beyond, the sierra like a great brown sea in which it\r\nall stands as an island starting from the waves. A suggestion of\r\nstrenuousness seems to linger everywhere, a spirit, personal and keen,\r\ncruel almost as the sword-blades the city fashions. The very buildings,\r\nplaced upon the crags beneath the great hulk of the Alcazar, repeat this\r\nimpression, they rise in sharp upward and downward lines like an\r\narrangement of swords, and make their appeal by the strange strength of\r\ntheir aspect. The streets are a tortuous net of steep-rising\r\npassage-ways. A city strongly itself that has suffered no change,\r\nfantastic as a city seen in a dream.\r\n\r\nYes, to those who know Toledo, the impression of the character of the\r\ncity upon El Greco will bring no surprise. His art corresponds perfectly\r\nwith its setting. Everywhere his work is around you, for El Greco is one\r\nof those painters who has but a single home. He built churches and other\r\nbuildings--the classic fa\xc3\xa7ade of the Ayuntamiento, for instance, was\r\nmodelled on his design; he carved statues, he painted pictures, there\r\nare canvases of his in the museum, in the cathedral, and in many of the\r\nchurches. And in all this mass of work, it is the living force behind it\r\nthat is the first impression that you gain; a kind of driving power that\r\nfascinates you, just as Toledo fascinates you, by reason of its power.\r\nEl Greco was a painter able to create--that is the secret of it all.\r\nAnd, be it remembered, the artist does not find his matter straight from\r\nthe springs of his brain, what he is able to see he sets down, and that\r\nis all. His art is great in exact measure as it is able to transfer this\r\nvision from him to us. In this way El Greco, to whom vision seems to\r\nhave been the whole of life, does in his pictures transfer to us the\r\nentire impression of Toledo, so that it is difficult to speak of his art\r\nwithout making Toledo the refrain.\r\n\r\nAnd as we wait with his pictures and note, after the first surprise has\r\nleft us, the qualities of the work, throughout they confirm this. The\r\nvery form of his composition is moulded upon Toledo. Just as its\r\nbuildings cluster around the Alcazar, almost as bees swarming about\r\ntheir queen, so he groups everything around a central figure. Never,\r\nafter he came to Toledo, did El Greco use Italian backgrounds. And in\r\nhis long, lithe figures, so fantastic in their hard outlines, sometimes\r\nwe catch that suggestion of the sword that haunts Toledo. Then when we\r\ncome to more tangible things, we find to-day El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s models in the\r\ndark peasants of Toledo. Nowhere else can we quite believe in the\r\nreality of those coldly fervent, self-absorbed, ecstatic men, who greet\r\nus with such fascination from his canvases, their lean, long profiles\r\nsuggesting again that aspect of a sword.\r\n\r\nThen, El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s colour was drawn from the landscape around him. And\r\ncolour, if we may credit the truth of the conversation recounted by\r\nPacheco, was to him the one quality in painting, form, drawing, all\r\nelse, being of secondary significance. This, too, was learnt in Toledo,\r\nwhere colour has an allurement--illusive and insistent. Toledo it was\r\nshowed him the existence of cold tones, and the fascination of its greys\r\nand livid greens led him to anticipate modern colour, at a time when\r\nevery one else was painting warm tonalities. In the Convent of San Juan\r\nde los Reyes, now the Museo Provincial, is that \xe2\x80\x98Bird\xe2\x80\x99s-Eye View of\r\nToledo,\xe2\x80\x99 the picture in which we have a portrait of George Manuel\r\nTheotokopuli, El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s son. At first you will be astonished, it is the\r\nstrangest landscape in the world. But wait with the picture--always the\r\ndanger with El Greco is that you will not linger enough. The painter who\r\nsees for himself must be studied, not dismissed as he who but sets down\r\nthe common vision of things. And El Greco does give us the real Toledo\r\nin this fantastic landscape. Do you doubt this? Then go when night falls\r\nupon the city to some such vantage-point as the Puerta del Camb\xc3\xb3n, where\r\nbeneath the dome of the evening sky you will see Toledo, heaped roof\r\nagainst roof, tower against tower. You will forget the strangeness of\r\nthe picture\xe2\x80\x99s statement, as you come to see that it is just this effect\r\nthat El Greco has caught. Now you will recognise the reality of those\r\nbluish whites, those tones of green that surprised you, and, in\r\ngladness, you will yield to the truth, the beauty--are not the two the\r\nsame?--of the painter\xe2\x80\x99s vision, and avow how much he has taught you to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nAlways El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s pictures leave an impression of their own upon the\r\nspectator; and this is the test of vital work. It is personality that\r\ncounts in art. Whether he paints the visible truth of outward things, as\r\nin his portraits--that wonderful series in the Prado, for instance, in\r\nwhich he startles us with his revelation of his model--or pure fancies\r\nof the mind, as \xe2\x80\x98The Vision of Philip II.,\xe2\x80\x99 in the Escorial, a picture\r\nthat would seem to have no conscious reference to things seen, one feels\r\nthat he had something definite to express. And although his style at\r\nfirst may have been formed largely on that of the great Venetian\r\npainters, of Tintoretto especially--a \xe2\x80\x9csort of shorthand of the\r\nVenetian,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ricketts calls it--in all his pictures there is but one\r\npersonality--that of himself. At the back of his art was a force of\r\npassionate character--unbalanced? Yes! capricious and arbitrary; a\r\ntyrannical need that compelled expression. But in spite of his singular\r\nconventions and, from a theorist\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, the strangeness and\r\nexaggeration of his qualities, he does convey his meaning, splendidly\r\neffective, if not the best. And because of this intensity of vision we\r\nhave those pictures of exaggerated statement that give credit to the\r\nfable of the painter\xe2\x80\x99s madness, such as the \xe2\x80\x98St. John the Baptist,\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nthe Hospital San Juan Bautista, a picture which many have found ugly,\r\nwhile the few see in its new conception a striving for personal\r\nutterance, and find many things in its suggestion.\r\n\r\nEl Greco stumbled in his methods maybe, never in his purpose, which was,\r\nit would seem to us, the significance of movement. All his strange\r\nskill, the power of his imagination, his new knowledge of colour and\r\nlight, are used in this service, to bring home to us the vision of\r\nmovement that everywhere he saw. Even in his portraits it is this that\r\nholds us. There is something more in them than the outward likeness;\r\nthere is a power of reaching to and showing us the unquiet spirit\r\nwithin. He makes his portraits live and speak. This quality is present\r\nin all his work. Every picture is built up by its effect; and this\r\neffect is movement--life. By concentrating on a particular passage, by a\r\ncontempt for detail and peddling accuracy, he directs our minds to this\r\nprincipal thing. His interest, as it were, compels ours; he realises his\r\nvision and makes us share in his imagination.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said that in many of these pictures the effect is forced;\r\nin the \xe2\x80\x98St. Maurice,\xe2\x80\x99 the rejected altar-piece of the Escorial, for\r\ninstance, in the \xe2\x80\x98Baptism of Christ\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98Descent of the Holy\r\nSpirit,\xe2\x80\x99 in the Prado, and in many pictures in Toledo, easily\r\nrecognised, in which realities are replaced by a series of conventions.\r\nIt is not necessary to wait to particularise examples. Certainly one\r\ndoes not see in the pictures of other painters those greens, those ashen\r\nwhites and crimsons, those livid blacks; El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s use of colour is\r\nunusual and his own. Light is not used as he uses it, as a quantity for\r\nemotional appeal; those faces, so elongated or contracted, and with such\r\nextravagant expressions, those figures with hard anatomical outlines, do\r\nnot correspond with life as we see it. Yes, this is true. But look\r\nlonger at these pictures.... Well, would it be possible to gain their\r\n_effects_ without the _defects_? If things are forced out of harmony it\r\nis for the sake of \xe2\x80\x9ctelling strongly.\xe2\x80\x9d All this search for expression is\r\ndone quite consciously. El Greco throughout was strong enough to be true\r\nto himself and to his imagination. He knew that no system of art is\r\nfinal, that the achievements of artists are, in truth, the stones\r\nwherewith the Temple of Art is built. Imagination does not see\r\ncommonplaces. And we recall the statement of Blake--he, too, a painter\r\nof visions of the mind: \xe2\x80\x9cHe who does not imagine in stronger and better\r\nlineaments, and in stronger and better light, than his perishing mortal\r\neye can see, does not imagine at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEl Greco might have said these words.\r\n\r\nAnd the man? There is a portrait Domeniko Theotokopuli has left of\r\nhimself now in the Museum of Seville. In it we see the long, striking\r\nprofile, with its large, strong nose, restless eyes and straight mouth,\r\ncruel slightly, framed by the great white ruff that forms such fitting\r\nsetting to the fine head. The forehead is high, the dark hair scant upon\r\nthe temples. We may read in the face, and still more in the perfectly\r\nshaped hands--the left holds a square palette upon which are the five\r\nprimary colours, white, black, yellow-ochre, vermilion, and lake, the\r\ncolours he used most frequently--the fastidiousness of the artist, the\r\ninstinct for beauty; we may read a peculiar suggestion of mysticism and\r\nardour; self-assertion, too, and impatience--both wait in those long,\r\nnervous fingers. It is a face of genius, but of a kind restless,\r\nunbalanced, decadent perhaps. And we understand the driving energy that\r\nburned to fever, so that at times the balance was lost between the\r\npainter\xe2\x80\x99s aim and the result, and we realise that the work of such a man\r\nmust be introspective, experimental, neurotic.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing almost of El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s life, and if external happenings\r\nwere all, the most original painter of Spain would remain an unexplained\r\npersonality. His very name is uncertain, and contemporary writers,\r\ndisregarding the Theotokopuli, speak of him as Domeniko Greco. We do not\r\nknow the year in which he was born, for the information given by\r\nPalomino in \xe2\x80\x9cEl Museo\xe2\x80\x9d must certainly be questioned, no register of his\r\nbirth as yet having been found among the Cretan archives, or in the\r\nparochial books of the Greek colony in Venice, the city in which it\r\nseems certain that he lived--a pupil, we may well think, of Tintoretto,\r\nrather than of Titian; and this in spite of the letter of his friend\r\nand compatriot the miniature-painter, Clovio,[B] in which Clovio speaks\r\nof the young Greek painter\xe2\x80\x99s skill, tells of his coming to Rome, and,\r\nafter commending him to the patronage of the Cardinal Nepote Farnese,\r\nrefers to his having learnt his art from the greatest Venetian. But the\r\ntestimony of his work gives more truth than this statement; his early\r\npictures, their authorship so long unknown, again and again have been\r\nattributed to Tintoretto, to Bassano, to Veronese even, never to Titian.\r\n\r\nThat El Greco was a Cretan we know by his signature, always in Greek, on\r\nmany pictures, \xce\x9b\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xce\xae\xce\xbd\xce\xb9\xce\xba\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 \xce\x98\xce\xb5\xce\xbf\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xce\xba\xcf\x8c\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xcf\x85\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 \xce\x9a\xcf\x81\xce\xae\xcf\x83\xce\xb5\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xaf\xce\xb5\xce\xb9--the \xe2\x80\x98San Maurice,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nin the Escorial, is one. And again, when called, in 1582, by the\r\nTribunal of the Inquisition to act as interpreter in the case of a\r\nCretan accused of being a Morisco, he describes himself as \xe2\x80\x9cDomeniko\r\nTheotokopuli, native of Candia, painter, resident in Toledo,\xe2\x80\x9d as we\r\nlearn from a document discovered by Se\xc3\xb1or Cossio, to whose research, and\r\nto that of Se\xc3\xb1or Foradada and of Se\xc3\xb1or de Beruete, we owe the few\r\ndiscovered facts of El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nWe know that Domeniko Greco came to Toledo some time before 1577, and in\r\nthat year he was at work in the convent of Santo Domingo el Antigua,\r\nwhere the Church was built and its statues carved by him, and where he\r\npainted the screens of the fine retablo; that further, he would seem\r\nnever to have left Toledo; that he married there, and had a son, George\r\nManuel, who was architect and sculptor to the cathedral from 1628 to his\r\ndeath in 1631, and also a daughter, whose portrait figures in several\r\npictures--in \xe2\x80\x98Christ Despoiled of his Vestments,\xe2\x80\x99 in the cathedral, for\r\none; that he died in Toledo, and was buried in Santo Domingo el Antigua\r\non April 7, 1614[C]--and that is about all. We have record of much\r\nwork--Toledo still has more than fifty Grecos--and there were pictures\r\npainted for the small town of Illescas, and also for Madrid. We read of\r\ntwo lawsuits, one undertaken to compel the Cathedral Chapter to pay in\r\nfull for the \xe2\x80\x98Expolio,\xe2\x80\x99[D] the second to vindicate the painter\xe2\x80\x99s right\r\nto sell his pictures without paying the tax levied upon merchandise.\r\nThese lawsuits, his pictures, with their dates and signatures, certain\r\ncontracts and receipts, are the few facts to be reported.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that this strange, self-contained life wished to be\r\nsilent; for it is perhaps not too fanciful to read this meaning into\r\nthat answer given by El Greco when asked, in connection with the writ\r\nserved on him for the \xe2\x80\x98Expolio,\xe2\x80\x99 whether he had been brought to Toledo\r\nto paint the retablo of Santo Domingo: \xe2\x80\x9cI am neither bound to say why I\r\ncame to this city nor to answer the other questions put to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Here we\r\ngain hints of certain very real traits of character.\r\n\r\nAnd, if the facts of his life are meagre enough, we can find suggestions\r\nof this same temper, silent, yet passionate, in that visit of Pacheco to\r\nthe Toledan painter when he was old, in 1611, of which we have spoken\r\nbefore. Pacheco tells us that El Greco was a student of many things, a\r\nwriter on art, a great philosopher given to witty sayings, a sculptor\r\nand architect as well as a painter. He writes of much work that he saw,\r\nand speaks in particular of a cupboard in which were models in clay of\r\neach picture El Greco had finished. The two painters talked on many\r\nsubjects, of colour and its supreme quality in painting, of Michael\r\nAngelo and his failure as a colourist. But in all the account of\r\nPacheco, always so minutely laborious, it is significant to note in one\r\nsentence the impression he formed of Domeniko Greco: \xe2\x80\x9cHe was in all\r\nthings as singular as in his painting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNor will it do to overlook the testimony of Giuseppe Martinez, whose\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPractical Letters on the Art of Painting,\xe2\x80\x9d though not printed until\r\n1866, were written a century before. He too speaks of Domeniko Greco as\r\nof extravagant disposition, and in proof recounts that he engaged\r\nmusicians to play to him that he might \xe2\x80\x9cenjoy an additional luxury\r\nduring meals.\xe2\x80\x9d The prudent Aragonese condemns this \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much\r\nostentation,\xe2\x80\x9d but we capture again some fresh clues and hints of this\r\nstrangely effective personality--a fanatic of life, a fanatic of\r\npainting.\r\n\r\nBut we have not settled the account of genius when we have called it\r\nunusual, fanatic, or decadent. It is the solution of the dull that\r\ngenius is extravagant consciously. El Greco can have had no desire, no\r\npower, to repeat the easy, the commonplace. If strange, exaggerated\r\neven, his art is without a trace of affectation. When he painted a\r\nvision he felt it natural to symbolise his idea in the way that he did.\r\nIn colour, in form, he painted only what his imagination saw, gaining in\r\ncolour fresh harmonies for himself, and a new suggestion of movement in\r\nhis imaginative compositions, to which our imagination must find answer.\r\n\r\nEl Greco understood all nature as a Living Presence; his art was a\r\nseries of experiments to express this. And every one must be struck with\r\nthe peculiar development of this special personality in his art from\r\nstage to stage--stages that with sufficient accuracy may be divided into\r\nthree periods.\r\n\r\nThe first is the pupil\xe2\x80\x99s search for truth; the Venetian stage, in which\r\nwe find a consciousness of tradition, showing itself in the\r\nstill-fettered design, in the attitudes of the figures, in the use of\r\nwarm colour, in a flowing quality in the paint, and, especially perhaps,\r\nin the landscape backgrounds, so Venetian with palaces and marble-paved\r\npiazzas; yet mingled with all this tradition is an emphatic personality,\r\nan ardour of expression, very difficult to define, seen in such early\r\npictures as \xe2\x80\x98The Blind Man,\xe2\x80\x99 in the Parma Gallery, or \xe2\x80\x98The Cardinal,\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nthe National Gallery, both painted before 1577. Over the whole Venetian\r\nperiod the influence of Tintoretto is obvious; while the portraits of\r\nthese years recall in their method the work of the Bassani; and of the\r\npre-Spanish pictures, as, for instance, the \xe2\x80\x98Cleansing of the\r\nTemple,\xe2\x80\x99[E] now in the possession of the Countess of Yarborough, and the\r\nreplica of the same subject on a small scale, in the Cook collection at\r\nRichmond, Surrey, a picture of real beauty that testifies to El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nskill in miniature--these, and many other works, were thought until\r\nquite recently to be the work of the Venetians, the first being\r\nattributed to Paul Veronese, the latter to Tintoretto, and this in spite\r\nof their marked character.\r\n\r\nAnd the Venetian influence remained in the first years in Toledo. It is\r\nseen in the beautiful Virgin in the early \xe2\x80\x98Assumption,\xe2\x80\x99 painted for the\r\ncentral altar-screen of Santo Domingo el Antigua, but now in the\r\nPrado.[F] But the chief work of this period is the \xe2\x80\x98Christ Despoiled of\r\nHis Vestments,\xe2\x80\x99 still in the sacristy of the cathedral in Toledo, for\r\nwhich it was painted in 1577. Here, perhaps, in the fine simplicity of\r\nthe grouping, in the dignity of the inspired head of the Saviour, in the\r\nrich and strong colour and in the vivid light and shade, we have the\r\nbest results of all El Greco learnt in Venice. But even in this\r\nbeautiful picture we see the development, or rather the co-existence, of\r\nhis two styles: on the one hand carefully and thoroughly worked-out\r\nqualities, a balanced art remembered from Venice, but with it all a\r\npower that was his own, that seized the elements in the picture and gave\r\nthem life--his life. And again, we have in the excessive height of the\r\nChrist, in the hands of many of the figures in this picture and in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Assumption,\xe2\x80\x99 first hints of the special conventions with which the name\r\nof El Greco is certainly most associated.\r\n\r\nWe come to the second stage, in which the painter, forgetting tradition,\r\nseeks to set down his vision in his own way; it is the period of\r\nexperiment, as we see it first in the \xe2\x80\x98St. Maurice,\xe2\x80\x99[G] painted in 1581,\r\nthat strange picture, rejected, as we may so well believe, by Philip\r\nII., who, misunderstanding, as many have done since, the intensity of\r\nfeeling that animates the work, attributed its exaggerated expression to\r\nmadness. Here, and in other pictures of this time, in the seizing\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vision of Philip II.\xe2\x80\x99 and in the \xe2\x80\x98St. John the Baptist\xe2\x80\x99 in particular,\r\nwe have splendid examples of imaginative work. Maybe the details are\r\nimpossible, perhaps absurd--many have found them so--but for others the\r\ninspiration of the painter triumphs, and the longer they gaze at these\r\nvisions the more they are impelled. For, be it remembered, the idea\r\nshould be the starting-point in all imaginative pictures, and should\r\ncontrol both the design and its treatment, and these Greco\xe2\x80\x99s are\r\nsplendid in this respect. Whether the imagination is exaggerated and\r\nperverted in wilful experiment, whether from an uncertain technical\r\nequipment, or whether it is, as we would think, the natural and true\r\nexpression of intense dramatic vision, it is not easy to say. Who shall\r\ndecide whether to call these mad pictures or visions that breathe the\r\nsublime? That is a question hard to answer in much of El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacteristic work. Perhaps the truth is that we dislike too readily\r\nwhat we do not easily understand. El Greco goes back to first principles\r\nand speaks in symbols with which we are not familiar. Those spectres of\r\nhuman kind that surprise us in so many of his pictures in Toledo, in\r\nthose in the Prado, as well as in these two in the Escorial, do not\r\nsuggest life as we see it; but they are inspired--they do convey his\r\nmeaning. This painter\xe2\x80\x99s method is a real enigma; he essayed surprising\r\neffects by separating colour into its original values; he used light as\r\na means of emotional appeal, giving us sometimes most delicate\r\nharmonies, sometimes discordant contrasts. Domeniko Greco had to teach\r\nhis world to see what he saw, and in this way he came, it may seem to\r\nsome, to over-emphasise what to him was truth.\r\n\r\nAnd his third stage was a fevered expression of his imaginative vision.\r\nWe have entered a new world of extraordinary restlessness, the\r\nrestlessness that must exist when spirit struggles from the bonds of the\r\nflesh. Toledo, the ardent arid city, burnt fiercely in El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s blood,\r\nand, more and more, he seems to have felt that it was not enough to\r\nrecord facts; to have cared less to give \xc3\xa6sthetic pleasure; but that the\r\nobject of his art should be to clothe abstract ideas with life. It is\r\nsomething of all this that we find in his later pictures. In each there\r\nis emphasis--or, if you like, exaggeration--of statement; in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Coronation of the Virgin\xe2\x80\x99 in San Jos\xc3\xa9, for instance, a picture that in\r\na strange, left-handed way carries us forward to the picture by\r\nVelazquez[H] on the same subject. The exaggeration is equally visible in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Assumption\xe2\x80\x99 in San Vicente, more beautiful, and the most\r\ninteresting of these rare visions, a picture in which we have\r\nmovement--the very sensation of a figure passing through the air as we\r\nhave, perhaps, in no other picture. It is even stronger in the group of\r\npictures in Madrid, the \xe2\x80\x98Baptism,\xe2\x80\x99 the \xe2\x80\x98Descent of the Holy Spirit,\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Resurrection,\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98Christ Dead in the Arms of God\xe2\x80\x99; it meets us\r\nagain in the \xe2\x80\x98St. Joseph with the Child Jesus,\xe2\x80\x99 and in the \xe2\x80\x98Virgin and\r\nChild with Saints Justa and Gertrude,\xe2\x80\x99[I] both in San Jos\xc3\xa9, the church\r\nthat is the museum of so much of the master\xe2\x80\x99s work--pictures all similar\r\nin their intense sentiment; while emphasis burns to a white flame of\r\nardent expression in the famed \xe2\x80\x98St. John the Baptist,\xe2\x80\x99 the wonderful\r\npicture of which we have spoken already. It is there, too, in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Christ Crucified,\xe2\x80\x99 one in the Prado, one in San Nicolas, surely the\r\nmost terrible realisation possible of that scene of sacrifice, in which\r\nthe agony of spirit so outweighs the agony of the flesh, and sky and\r\nearth seem to take their share in the struggle.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to translate the effect of these animated religious\r\npictures into words. El Greco was not content to embody the old myths in\r\nfresh forms, but he gave fresh forms to the ideas that are, as it were,\r\nthe soul of each myth--that which lives when the form of the stories\r\nchange. Even in his pictures with few figures, such for instance, as the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mary and Jesus,\xe2\x80\x99 in San Vicente, the \xe2\x80\x98St. Francis,\xe2\x80\x99 of which there are\r\nfour replicas in Toledo, or that earlier picture, a beautiful rendering\r\nof a difficult theme, \xe2\x80\x98La Veronica,\xe2\x80\x99 one of the series painted for the\r\nSanto Domingo el Antigua in 1575-76, we have this exaggeration. Then,\r\nsometimes, exaggeration, which in each picture, after all, only\r\nemphasises the idea, disappears altogether, and we are given figures of\r\nsingular beauty, as the \xe2\x80\x98San Martin,\xe2\x80\x99 in San Jos\xc3\xa9, or the really fine\r\nMadonnas--dark, oval-faced angels that surprise us at times with a\r\nbeauty of type we hardly expect from El Greco. But, as a rule, in the\r\npictures of this period, roughly marked by the painting of that\r\nexperimental picture the \xe2\x80\x98St. Maurice,\xe2\x80\x99 there is this intensity of\r\nexpression; and especially we find a new, and often strange, use of\r\ncolour; colour, as well as form, being used as a means of dramatic\r\nstatement, with a result that to many is exaggeration. For El Greco\r\nlearnt first, perhaps, from the Venetians, and afterwards certainly in\r\nToledo, many new possibilities of colour--that it has a quality that\r\nspeaks, and further that the appeal of a picture depends first of all on\r\nthe tone of its colour. It is for this reason he used colour as a means\r\nof emotional appeal; it was another quality by which to convey his idea\r\nto the world. For El Greco held truly that the province of art is to\r\ninterpret, not to imitate. Every development of his art seems to have\r\ncome from his own mind, hardly at all from the work of other painters;\r\nfrom the first he was true to his ideals. And always his pictures seem\r\nto be more the work of his soul than of his hand; which, in other words,\r\nis to say that he was greater as an artist than as a painter.\r\n\r\nDomeniko Greco, like so many of the painters of Spain, was great in\r\nportraiture; and some of his portraits, such as those of Antonio\r\nCovarrubias and of Juan de Alava, in the Museo de San Juan de Los Reyes,\r\nthat of Cardinal Tavera, in the Hospital de Afuera, the whole series in\r\nthe Prado, and many others not possible to name, are as fine portraits\r\nas have ever been done in the world. In his earliest portraits even, in\r\nthat of Julio Clovio, in the Museum of Naples, or that of \xe2\x80\x98A Student,\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nportrait, it well may be, of the young painter himself, we have the\r\nqualities of his later work; always it is the spirit of his model that\r\nhe seeks.\r\n\r\nAnd this inward interpretation of life is seen, too, in that picture\r\nwhich is accounted rightly the most interesting, though not perhaps the\r\nmost typical, of his work, \xe2\x80\x98The Burial of Gonzalo Ruiz, Count of Orgaz,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstill in the Church of Santo Tom\xc3\xa9, where it was painted in 1584. Look at\r\nthis gallery of living portraits, all the life of Toledo--the life of\r\nSpain--is reflected back from those ardent faces. In St. Augustine,\r\nsplendid in ecclesiastical robes, is the magnificent opulence of the\r\nCatholic Church; in the livid face of the dead count, in the cowled monk\r\nand two priests is the fervid piety of a people who have felt themselves\r\nin mystical communion with God; in the young, warm beauty of St. Stephen\r\nand the lovely acolyte is the full joy and rich colour of Spain; and\r\nlastly, in the long line of mourners who stand behind the group of the\r\nprincipal figures, and where the painter\xe2\x80\x99s own nervous face is the sixth\r\nportrait counting from the right side, you have types unchanged in\r\nCastile to-day.

ILLUSTRATED BY OVER 165 REPRODUCTIONS FROM\r\nPHOTOGRAPHS OF HIS MOST CELEBRATED PICTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the names of Murillo and Velazquez are inseparably linked in the\r\nhistory of Art as Spain\xe2\x80\x99s immortal contribution to the small band of\r\nworld-painters, the great Court-Painter to Philip IV. has ever received\r\nthe lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of public attention. Many learned and critical works\r\nhave been written about Murillo, but whereas Velazquez has been\r\nfamiliarised to the general reader by the aid of small, popular\r\nbiographies, the niche is still empty which it is hoped that this book\r\nwill fill.\r\n\r\nIn this volume the attempt has been made to show the painter\xe2\x80\x99s art in\r\nits relation to the religious feeling of the age in which he lived, and\r\nhis own feeling towards his art. Murillo was the product of his\r\nreligious era, and of his native province, Andalusia. To Europe in his\r\nlifetime he signified little or nothing. He painted to the order of the\r\nreligious houses in his immediate vicinity; his works were immured in\r\nlocal monasteries and cathedrals, and, passing immediately out of\r\ncirculation, were forgotten or never known.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nSPANISH ARMS AND ARMOUR\r\n\r\nA HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE ROYAL ARMOURY AT MADRID.\r\nILLUSTRATED WITH 386 REPRODUCTIONS FROM PHOTOGRAPHS. DEDICATED BY\r\nSPECIAL PERMISSION TO H.M. QUEEN MARIA CRISTINA OF SPAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough several valuable and voluminous catalogues of the Spanish Royal\r\nArmoury have, from time to time, been compiled, this \xe2\x80\x9cfinest collection\r\nof armour in the world\xe2\x80\x9d has been subjected so often to the disturbing\r\ninfluences of fire, removal, and re-arrangement, that no hand catalogue\r\nof the Museum is available, and this book has been designed to serve\r\nboth as a historical souvenir of the institution and a record of its\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\nThe various exhibits with which the writer illustrates his narrative are\r\nreproduced to the number of nearly 400 on art paper, and the selection\r\nof weapons and armour has been made with a view not only to render the\r\nseries interesting to the general reader, but to present a useful text\r\nbook for the guidance of artists, sculptors, antiquaries, costumiers,\r\nand all who are engaged in the reproduction or representation of\r\nEuropean armoury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nTHE ESCORIAL\r\n\r\nA HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE SPANISH ROYAL PALACE,\r\nMONASTERY AND MAUSOLEUM. ILLUSTRATED WITH PLANS AND 278 REPRODUCTIONS\r\nFROM PICTURES AND PHOTOGRAPHS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal Palace, Monastery, and Mausoleum of El Escorial, which rears\r\nits gaunt, grey walls in one of the bleakest but most imposing districts\r\nin the whole of Spain, was erected to commemorate a victory over the\r\nFrench in 1557. It was occupied and pillaged by the French two and\r\na-half centuries later, and twice it has been greatly diminished by\r\nfire; but it remains to-day, not only the incarnate expression of the\r\nfanatic religious character and political genius of Philip II., but the\r\ngreatest mass of wrought granite which exists on earth, the leviathan of\r\narchitecture, the eighth wonder of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the text of this book the author has endeavoured to reconstitute the\r\nglories and tragedies of the living past of the Escorial, and to\r\nrepresent the wonders of the stupendous edifice by reproductions of over\r\ntwo hundred and seventy of the finest photographs and pictures\r\nobtainable. Both as a review and a pictorial record it is hoped that the\r\nwork will make a wide appeal among all who are interested in the\r\nhistory, the architecture, and the art of Spain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nTOLEDO\r\n\r\nA HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE \xe2\x80\x9cCITY OF GENERATIONS,\xe2\x80\x9d WITH\r\n510 ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of Imperial Toledo, \xe2\x80\x9cthe crown of Spain, the light of the\r\nworld, free from the time of the mighty Goths,\xe2\x80\x9d is lost in the\r\nimpenetrable mists of antiquity. Mighty, unchangeable, invincible, the\r\ncity has been described by W\xc3\xb6rmann as \xe2\x80\x9ca gigantic open-air museum of the\r\narchitectural history of early Spain, arranged upon a lofty and\r\nconspicuous table of rock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut while some writers have declared that Toledo is a theatre with the\r\nactors gone and only the scenery left, the author does not share the\r\nopinion. He believes that the power and virility upon which Spain built\r\nup her greatness is reasserting itself. The machinery of the theatre of\r\nToledo is rusty, the pulleys are jammed from long disuse, but the\r\ncurtain is rising steadily if slowly, and already can be heard the\r\ntuning-up of fiddles in its ancient orchestra.\r\n\r\nIn this belief the author of this volume has not only set forth the\r\nstory of Toledo\xe2\x80\x99s former greatness, but has endeavoured to place before\r\nhis readers a panorama of the city as it appears to-day, and to show\r\ncause for his faith in the greatness of the Toledo of the future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nSEVILLE\r\n\r\nA HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT, WITH 300 ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nSeville, which has its place in mythology as the creation of Hercules,\r\nand was more probably founded by the Ph\xc5\x93nicians, which became\r\nmagnificent under the Roman rule, was made the capital of the Goths,\r\nbecame the centre of Moslem power and splendour, and fell before the\r\nmilitary prowess of St. Ferdinand, is still the Queen of Andalusia, the\r\nfoster-mother of Velazquez and Murillo, the city of poets and pageantry\r\nand love.\r\n\r\nSeville is always gay, and responsive and fascinating to the receptive\r\nvisitor, and all sorts of people go there with all sorts of motives. The\r\nartist repairs to the Andalusian city to fill his portfolio; the lover\r\nof art makes the pilgrimage to study Murillo in all his glory. The\r\nseasons of the Church attract thousands from reasons of devotion or\r\ncuriosity. And of all these myriad visitors, who go with their minds\r\nfull of preconceived notions, not one has yet confessed to being\r\ndisappointed in Seville.\r\n\r\nThe author has here attempted to convey in the illustrations an\r\nimpression of this laughing city where all is gaiety and mirth and\r\never-blossoming roses, where the people pursue pleasure as the serious\r\nbusiness of life in an atmosphere of exhilarating enjoyment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nTHE PRADO\r\n\r\nA GUIDE AND HANDBOOK TO THE ROYAL PICTURE GALLERY OF MADRID. ILLUSTRATED\r\nWITH 221 REPRODUCTIONS FROM PHOTOGRAPHS OF OLD MASTERS. DEDICATED BY\r\nSPECIAL PERMISSION TO H.R.H. PRINCESS HENRY OF BATTENBERG\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume is an attempt to supplement the accurate but formal notes\r\ncontained in the official catalogue of a picture gallery which is\r\nconsidered the finest in the world. It has been said that the day one\r\nenters the Prado for the first time is an important event like marriage,\r\nthe birth of a child, or the coming into an inheritance; an experience\r\nof which one feels the effects to the day of one\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of the Madrid gallery is the excellence of exclusion; it\r\nis a collection of magnificent gems. Here one becomes conscious of a\r\nfresh power in Murillo, and is amazed anew by the astonishing apparition\r\nof Velazquez; here is, in truth, a rivalry of miracles of art.\r\n\r\nThe task of selecting pictures for reproduction from what is perhaps the\r\nmost splendid gallery of old masters in existence, was one of no little\r\ndifficulty, but it is believed that the collection is representative,\r\nand that the letterpress will form a serviceable companion to the\r\nvisitor to The Prado.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nGRANADA AND THE ALHAMBRA\r\n\r\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF THE MOSLEM RULE IN SPAIN, TOGETHER WITH A PARTICULAR\r\nACCOUNT OF THE CONSTRUCTION, THE ARCHITECTURE, AND THE DECORATION OF THE\r\nMOORISH PALACE, WITH 460 ILLUSTRATIONS. DEDICATED BY SPECIAL PERMISSION\r\nTO H.I.M. THE EMPRESS EUG\xc3\x89NIE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume is the third and abridged edition of a work which the author\r\nwas inspired to undertake by the surpassing loveliness of the Alhambra,\r\nand by his disappointment in the discovery that no such thing as an even\r\nmoderately adequate illustrated souvenir of \xe2\x80\x9cthis glorious sanctuary of\r\nSpain\xe2\x80\x9d was obtainable. Keenly conscious of the want himself, he essayed\r\nto supply it, and the result is a volume that has been acclaimed with\r\nenthusiasm alike by critics, artists, architects, and arch\xc3\xa6ologists.\r\n\r\nIn his preface to the first edition, Mr. Calvert wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Alhambra\r\nmay be likened to an exquisite opera which can only be appreciated to\r\nthe full when one is under the spell of its magic influence. But as the\r\nwitchery of an inspired score can be recalled by the sound of an air\r\nwhistled in the street, so--it is my hope--the pale ghost of the Moorish\r\nfairy-land may live again in the memories of travellers through the\r\nmedium of this pictorial epitome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nEL GRECO\r\n\r\nA BIOGRAPHY AND APPRECIATION. ILLUSTRATED BY REPRODUCTIONS OF OVER 140\r\nOF HIS PICTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a Series such as this, which aims at presenting every aspect of\r\nSpain\xe2\x80\x99s eminence in art and in her artists, the work of Domenico\r\nTheotoc\xc3\xb3puli must be allotted a volume to itself. \xe2\x80\x9cEl Greco,\xe2\x80\x9d as he is\r\ncalled, who reflects the impulse, and has been said to constitute the\r\nsupreme glory of the Venetian era, was a Greek by repute, a Venetian by\r\ntraining, and a Toledan by adoption. His pictures in the Prado are still\r\ncatalogued among those of the Italian School, but foreigner as he was,\r\nin his heart he was more Spanish than the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nEl Greco is typically, passionately, extravagantly Spanish, and with his\r\nadvent, Spanish painting laid aside every trace of Provincialism, and\r\nstepped forth to compel the interest of the world. Neglected for many\r\ncenturies, and still often misjudged, his place in art is an assured\r\none. It is impossible to present him as a colourist in a work of this\r\nnature, but the author has got together reproductions of no fewer than\r\n140 of his pictures--a greater number than has ever before been\r\npublished of El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s works.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nVELAZQUEZ\r\n\r\nA BIOGRAPHY AND APPRECIATION. ILLUSTRATED WITH 142 REPRODUCTIONS FROM\r\nPHOTOGRAPHS OF HIS MOST CELEBRATED PICTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nDiego Rodriguez de Silva y Velazquez--\xe2\x80\x9cour Velazquez,\xe2\x80\x9d as Palomino\r\nproudly styles him--has been made the subject of innumerable books in\r\nevery European language, yet the Editor of this Spanish Series feels\r\nthat it would not be complete without the inclusion of yet another\r\ncontribution to the broad gallery of Velazquez literature.\r\n\r\nThe great Velazquez, the eagle in art--subtle, simple, incomparable--the\r\nsupreme painter, is still a guiding influence of the art of to-day. This\r\ngreatest of Spanish artists, a master not only in portrait painting, but\r\nin character and animal studies, in landscapes and historical subjects,\r\nimpressed the grandeur of his superb personality upon all his work.\r\nSpain, it has been said, the country whose art was largely borrowed,\r\nproduced Velazquez, and through him Spanish art became the light of a\r\nnew artistic life.\r\n\r\nThe author cannot boast that he has new data to offer, but he has put\r\nforward his conclusions with modesty; he has reproduced a great deal\r\nthat is most representative of the artist\xe2\x80\x99s work; and he has endeavoured\r\nto keep always in view his object to present a concise, accurate, and\r\nreadable life of Velazquez.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nROYAL PALACES OF SPAIN\r\n\r\nA HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE SEVEN PRINCIPAL PALACES OF\r\nTHE SPANISH KINGS. PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED\r\n\r\n\r\nSpain is beyond question the richest country in the world in the number\r\nof its Royal Residences, and while few are without artistic importance,\r\nall are rich in historical memories. Thus, from the Alcazar at Seville,\r\nwhich is principally associated with Pedro the Cruel, to the Retiro,\r\nbuilt to divert the attention of Philip IV. from his country\xe2\x80\x99s decay;\r\nfrom the Escorial, in which the gloomy mind of Philip II. is perpetuated\r\nin stone, to La Granja, which speaks of the anguish and humiliation of\r\nChristina before Sergeant Garcia and his rude soldiery; from Aranju\xc3\xa9z to\r\nRio Frio, and from El Pardo, darkened by the agony of a good king, to\r\nMiramar, to which a widowed Queen retired to mourn: all the history of\r\nSpain, from the splendid days of Charles V. to the present time, is\r\ncrystallised in the Palaces that constitute the patrimony of the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Palaces of Spain are open to visitors at stated times, and it\r\nis hoped that this volume, with its wealth of illustrations, will serve\r\nthe visitor both as a guide and a souvenir.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nVALLADOLID, OVIEDO, SEGOVIA, ZAMORA, AVILA AND ZARAGOZA\r\n\r\nA HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT, WITH 390 ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe glory of Valladolid has departed, but the skeleton remains, and\r\nattached to its ancient stones are the memories that Philip II. was born\r\nhere, that here Cervantes lived, and Christopher Columbus died. In this\r\none-time capital of Spain, in the Plaza Mayor, the fires of the Great\r\nInquisition were first lighted, and here Charles V. laid the foundation\r\nof the Royal Armoury, which was afterwards transferred to Madrid.\r\n\r\nMore than seven hundred years have passed since Oviedo was the proud\r\ncapital of the Kingdoms of Las Asturias, Leon, and Castile. Segovia,\r\nthough no longer great, has still all the appurtenances of greatness,\r\nand with her granite massiveness and austerity, she remains an\r\naristocrat even among the aristocracy of Spanish cities. Zamora, which\r\nhas a history dating from time almost without date, was the key of Leon\r\nand the centre of the endless wars between the Moors and the Christians,\r\nwhich raged round it from the eighth to the eleventh centuries.\r\n\r\nIn this volume the author has striven to re-create the ancient greatness\r\nof these six cities, and has preserved their memories in a wealth of\r\nexcellent and interesting illustrations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nLEON, BURGOS AND SALAMANCA\r\n\r\nA HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT, WITH 462 ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Leon, once the capital of the second kingdom in Spain; in Burgos,\r\nwhich boasts one of the most magnificent cathedrals in Spain, and the\r\ncustodianship of the bones of the Cid; and in Salamanca, with its\r\nuniversity, which is one of the oldest in Europe, the author has\r\nselected three of the most interesting relics of ancient grandeur in\r\nthis country of departed greatness.\r\n\r\nLeon to-day is nothing but a large agricultural village, torpid, silent,\r\ndilapidated; Burgos, which still retains traces of the Gotho-Castilian\r\ncharacter, is a gloomy and depleting capital: and Salamanca is a city of\r\nmagnificent buildings, a broken hulk, spent by the storms that from time\r\nto time have devastated her.\r\n\r\nYet apart from the historical interest possessed by these cities, they\r\nstill make an irresistible appeal to the artist and the antiquary. They\r\nare content with their stories of old-time greatness and their\r\ncathedrals, and these ancient architectural splendours, undisturbed by\r\nthe touch of a modernising and renovating spirit, continue to attract\r\nthe visitor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nMADRID\r\n\r\nA HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE SPANISH CAPITAL, WITH 450\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nMadrid is at once one of the most interesting and most maligned cities\r\nin Europe. It stands at an elevation of 2,500 feet above the sea level,\r\nin the centre of an arid, treeless, waterless, and wind-blown plain; but\r\nwhatever may be thought of the wisdom of selecting a capital in such a\r\nsituation, one cannot but admire the uniqueness of its position, and the\r\nmagnificence of its buildings, and one is forced to admit that, having\r\nfairly entered the path of progress, Madrid bids fair to become one of\r\nthe handsomest and most prosperous of European cities.\r\n\r\nThe splendid promenades, the handsome buildings, and the spacious\r\ntheatres combine to make Madrid one of the first cities of the world,\r\nand the author has endeavoured with the aid of the camera, to place\r\nevery feature and aspect of the Spanish metropolis before the reader.\r\nSome of the illustrations reproduced here have been made familiar to the\r\nEnglish public by reason of the interesting and stirring events\r\nconnected with the Spanish Royal Marriage, but the greater number were\r\neither taken by the author, or are the work of photographers specially\r\nemployed to obtain new views for the purpose of this volume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nGOYA\r\n\r\nA BIOGRAPHY AND APPRECIATION.

He was born at a time when the\r\ntradition of Velazquez was fading, and the condition of Spanish painting\r\nwas debased almost beyond hope of salvation; he broke through the\r\nacademic tradition of imitation; \xe2\x80\x9che, next to Velazquez, is to be\r\naccounted as the man whom the Impressionists of our time have to thank\r\nfor their most definite stimulus, their most immediate inspiration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe genius of Goya was a robust, imperious, and fulminating genius; his\r\niron temperament was passionate, dramatic, and revolutionary; he painted\r\na picture as he would have fought a battle. He was an athletic, warlike,\r\nand indefatigable painter; a naturalist like Velazquez; fantastic like\r\nHogarth; eccentric like Rembrandt; the last flame-coloured flash of\r\nSpanish genius.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to reproduce his colouring; but in the reproductions of\r\nhis works the author has endeavoured to convey to the reader some idea\r\nof Goya\xe2\x80\x99s boldness of style, his mastery of frightful shadows and\r\nmysterious lights, and his genius for expressing all terrible emotions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME_\r\n\r\nCORDOVA\r\n\r\nA HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE ANCIENT CITY WHICH THE\r\nCARTHAGINIANS STYLED THE \xe2\x80\x9cGEM OF THE SOUTH,\xe2\x80\x9d WITH 160 ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nGay-looking, vivacious in its beauty, silent, ill-provided, depopulated,\r\nCordova was once the pearl of the West, the city of cities, Cordova of\r\nthe thirty suburbs and three thousand mosques; to-day she is no more\r\nthan an overgrown village, but she still remains the most Oriental town\r\nin Spain.\r\n\r\nCordova, once the centre of European civilisation, under the Moors the\r\nAthens of the West, the successful rival of Baghdad and Damascus, the\r\nseat of learning and the repository of the arts, has shrunk to the\r\nproportions of a third-rate provincial town; but the artist, the\r\nantiquary and the lover of the beautiful, will still find in its streets\r\nand squares and patios a mysterious spell that cannot be resisted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBY ALBERT F.

No hizo testamento, recibo los sacramentos, en\r\nteroso en Santo Domingo el Antigua.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[D] Two judges were appointed to settle the dispute, which arose from\r\nthe introduction of the three Marys into the picture. The Chapter\r\nobjected to their presence. El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s defence was characteristic\r\nenough--What did it matter? and, besides, the women were a long way\r\noff. The judges disagreed; whereupon the dispute was settled by Alezo\r\nde Montoyo as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving seen the said painting which has been executed by the said\r\nDomeniko, and the appraisements of the judge appointed by both parties,\r\nand other persons who understand the said painting, its execution and\r\nadmirable finish; and the reasons which the said judges have given;\r\nand seeing that the said painting is one of the best that I have seen;\r\nand that, if it were to be estimated for all its valuable qualities,\r\nit would be valued at a much higher sum, which but few would care to\r\npay for it; but, in view of the nature of the times and the price paid\r\ngenerally for the paintings of great artists in Castile; and in view\r\nof, and taking into consideration all the above and all other points\r\nthat were necessary, I find that I must order, and I do order, that for\r\nthe said painting the said Garcia de Loaysa, in the name of the said\r\nHoly Church, shall give and pay to the said Domeniko Theotokopuli three\r\nthousand and five hundred reals: and above this sum the said Domeniko\r\nTheotokopuli cannot ask, nor must he ask, for anything more for the\r\nsaid painting; and as regards the judges for the said workers, they\r\nsay that it is improper for the Marys to be introduced into the story;\r\nas regards this I am sending the declaration of it to some theologians\r\nversed in such matters, that they may decide upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[E] This is another rendering of the same picture; and still another is\r\nin the collection of Se\xc3\xb1or de Beruete, Madrid.\r\n\r\n[F] This picture passed into the collection of the Infanta Do\xc3\xb1a Isabel\r\nFarnese, and is now in the Museo del Prado. The \xe2\x80\x98Assumption\xe2\x80\x99 in the\r\nChurch of Santo Domingo el Antigua is a poor copy of the original\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n[G] The picture was painted for the altar of St. Maurice, but it was\r\nrejected by Philip II., and the commission given to a third-rate\r\nItalian. To-day the picture hangs in the Sala Capitulare.\r\n\r\n[H] This likeness is more striking even in another \xe2\x80\x98Coronation of the\r\nVirgin,\xe2\x80\x99 by El Greco, in the collection of Colonel P. Bosch, Madrid.\r\n\r\n[I] Some authorities name these saints Sta. Inez and Sta.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
