    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and
      happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of
      existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very
      little to distress or vex her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,
      indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage, been
      mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had died too
      long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her
      caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as
      governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a
      governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of
      Emma. Between <i>them</i> it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before
      Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the
      mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and
      the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living
      together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just
      what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed
      chiefly by her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having
      rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well
      of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her
      many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that
      they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorrow came&mdash;a gentle sorrow&mdash;but not at all in the shape of any
      disagreeable consciousness.&mdash;Miss Taylor married. It was Miss
      Taylor's loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this
      beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance.
      The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and herself were
      left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long
      evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and
      she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was a
      man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant
      manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what
      self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the
      match; but it was a black morning's work for her. The want of Miss Taylor
      would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her past kindness&mdash;the
      kindness, the affection of sixteen years&mdash;how she had taught and how
      she had played with her from five years old&mdash;how she had devoted all
      her powers to attach and amuse her in health&mdash;and how nursed her
      through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of gratitude was
      owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing
      and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on
      their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.
      She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,
      well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,
      interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in
      every pleasure, every scheme of hers&mdash;one to whom she could speak
      every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as could
      never find fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was she to bear the change?&mdash;It was true that her friend was
      going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be
      the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a
      Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and
      domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual
      solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He
      could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had not
      married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits; for
      having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind or
      body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere
      beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his
      talents could not have recommended him at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being
      settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily
      reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled
      through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from
      Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,
      and give her pleasant society again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to
      which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name,
      did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were first in
      consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many acquaintance in the
      place, for her father was universally civil, but not one among them who
      could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day. It was a
      melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for
      impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be
      cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous man, easily
      depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with
      them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the origin of change, was
      always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own
      daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion,
      though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now obliged
      to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness,
      and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel
      differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor
      had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a
      great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.
      Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such
      thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly
      as he had said at dinner,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Miss Taylor!&mdash;I wish she were here again. What a pity it is
      that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a
      good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good
      wife;&mdash;and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever,
      and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A house of her own!&mdash;But where is the advantage of a house of her
      own? This is three times as large.&mdash;And you have never any odd
      humours, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!&mdash;We
      shall be always meeting! <i>We</i> must begin; we must go and pay wedding
      visit very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could not
      walk half so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage, to
      be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a
      little way;&mdash;and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying
      our visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we have
      settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last
      night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going to
      Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there. I only doubt
      whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing, papa. You
      got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned
      her&mdash;James is so obliged to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not
      have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure
      she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I
      have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always curtseys and
      asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her here
      to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock of the door the
      right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an excellent servant;
      and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about
      her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes over to see his daughter,
      you know, she will be hearing of us. He will be able to tell her how we
      all are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and
      hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through the
      evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The backgammon-table
      was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it
      unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not
      only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly
      connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He lived
      about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,
      and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their
      mutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after some
      days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in
      Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse
      for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him
      good; and his many inquiries after &ldquo;poor Isabella&rdquo; and her children were
      answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse gratefully
      observed, &ldquo;It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late
      hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I
      must draw back from your great fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not catch
      cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here.
      It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I
      wanted them to put off the wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye&mdash;I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of
      what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my
      congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you
      all behave? Who cried most?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say
      'poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it
      comes to the question of dependence or independence!&mdash;At any rate, it
      must be better to have only one to please than two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially when <i>one</i> of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome
      creature!&rdquo; said Emma playfully. &ldquo;That is what you have in your head, I
      know&mdash;and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Woodhouse, with a
      sigh. &ldquo;I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean <i>you</i>, or suppose Mr.
      Knightley to mean <i>you</i>. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only
      myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know&mdash;in a
      joke&mdash;it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in
      Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and though
      this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it would be
      so much less so to her father, that she would not have him really suspect
      such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emma knows I never flatter her,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley, &ldquo;but I meant no
      reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to
      please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be a
      gainer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Emma, willing to let it pass&mdash;&ldquo;you want to hear about
      the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved
      charmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not a
      tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we were
      going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Emma bears every thing so well,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;But, Mr.
      Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am
      sure she <i>will</i> miss her more than she thinks for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. &ldquo;It is
      impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Knightley. &ldquo;We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could
      suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's
      advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's time
      of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to
      be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself
      to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad
      to have her so happily married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;and a very
      considerable one&mdash;that I made the match myself. I made the match, you
      know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the
      right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may
      comfort me for any thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, &ldquo;Ah! my
      dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever
      you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for
      other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such
      success, you know!&mdash;Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry
      again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who
      seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied
      either in his business in town or among his friends here, always
      acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful&mdash;Mr. Weston need not
      spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.
      Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a
      promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the uncle
      not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject,
      but I believed none of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since the day&mdash;about four years ago&mdash;that Miss Taylor and
      I met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he
      darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from
      Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match
      from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance,
      dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand what you mean by 'success,'&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley.
      &ldquo;Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately
      spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring
      about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But if,
      which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only
      your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it would
      be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and
      saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk
      of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky
      guess; and <i>that</i> is all that can be said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?&mdash;I
      pity you.&mdash;I thought you cleverer&mdash;for, depend upon it a lucky
      guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to
      my poor word 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so
      entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures; but
      I think there may be a third&mdash;a something between the do-nothing and
      the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given many
      little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have
      come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield enough to
      comprehend that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,
      unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their own
      concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to
      them, by interference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,&rdquo; rejoined Mr.
      Woodhouse, understanding but in part. &ldquo;But, my dear, pray do not make any
      more matches; they are silly things, and break up one's family circle
      grievously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.
      Elton, papa,&mdash;I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody
      in Highbury who deserves him&mdash;and he has been here a whole year, and
      has fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have
      him single any longer&mdash;and I thought when he was joining their hands
      to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind
      office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only
      way I have of doing him a service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young
      man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him any
      attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. That will
      be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to
      meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley,
      laughing, &ldquo;and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better
      thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish
      and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a
      man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,
      which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility
      and property. He had received a good education, but, on succeeding early
      in life to a small independence, had become indisposed for any of the more
      homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an
      active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of
      his county, then embodied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his
      military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire
      family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized,
      except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were full
      of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her
      fortune&mdash;though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate&mdash;was
      not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite
      mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off with due
      decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much
      happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a
      husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due
      to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him; but
      though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had
      resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but not
      enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable
      anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home. They lived beyond
      their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe: she did
      not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once to be the wife of
      Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills, as
      making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of the
      bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, he was
      rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain. From the
      expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy had, with the
      additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother's, been
      the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having
      no children of their own, nor any other young creature of equal kindred to
      care for, offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after
      her decease. Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be
      supposed to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,
      the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills, and
      he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to improve as
      he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and
      engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in
      London, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which
      brought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,
      where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation
      and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his
      life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time, realised an easy
      competence&mdash;enough to secure the purchase of a little estate
      adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for&mdash;enough to marry a
      woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the
      wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes;
      but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it had not
      shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase
      Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to; but he had
      gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were accomplished.
      He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained his wife; and was
      beginning a new period of existence, with every probability of greater
      happiness than in any yet passed through. He had never been an unhappy
      man; his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;
      but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly
      amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof of its
      being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen, to excite gratitude
      than to feel it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own; for
      as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle's
      heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name
      of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely, therefore, that he
      should ever want his father's assistance. His father had no apprehension
      of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely;
      but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice could be
      strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed, so deservedly
      dear. He saw his son every year in London, and was proud of him; and his
      fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort
      of pride in him too. He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the
      place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively
      curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little
      returned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit his
      father had been often talked of but never achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a most
      proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not a
      dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with
      Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Now
      was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope
      strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother
      on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included
      some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received. &ldquo;I suppose
      you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to
      Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed. Mr.
      Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he says he
      never saw such a handsome letter in his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course, formed
      a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was
      an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most welcome addition
      to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage
      had already secured. She felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she had
      lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where
      the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship
      for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without
      pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui,
      from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble
      character; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have
      been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped would
      bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations.
      And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from
      Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr.
      Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching
      season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.
      Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction&mdash;her more
      than satisfaction&mdash;her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so
      apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by
      surprize at his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor,' when they
      left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her
      go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of
      her own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle
      sigh, and saying, &ldquo;Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no recovering Miss Taylor&mdash;nor much likelihood of ceasing
      to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.
      The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by
      being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which had
      been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach could bear
      nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be different from
      himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body;
      and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any
      wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to
      prevent any body's eating it. He had been at the pains of consulting Mr.
      Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry was an intelligent,
      gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr.
      Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, he could not but acknowledge
      (though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination) that
      wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many&mdash;perhaps with most
      people, unless taken moderately. With such an opinion, in confirmation of
      his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly
      married pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his
      benevolent nerves till it was all gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen
      with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.
      Woodhouse would never believe it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to
      have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from
      his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,
      his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own little
      circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much intercourse with
      any families beyond that circle; his horror of late hours, and large
      dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would
      visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him, Highbury, including
      Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining,
      the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such. Not unfrequently,
      through Emma's persuasion, he had some of the chosen and the best to dine
      with him: but evening parties were what he preferred; and, unless he
      fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an
      evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by
      Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of
      exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies
      and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles of his lovely
      daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were
      Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at the
      service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and carried
      home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James
      or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it would have been a
      grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old lady,
      almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her single
      daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the regard and
      respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward circumstances, can
      excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a
      woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married. Miss Bates stood in the
      very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour;
      and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself, or
      frighten those who might hate her into outward respect. She had never
      boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her youth had passed without
      distinction, and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing
      mother, and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible.
      And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman whom no one named without
      good-will. It was her own universal good-will and contented temper which
      worked such wonders. She loved every body, was interested in every body's
      happiness, quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most
      fortunate creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent
      mother, and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted
      for nothing. The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented
      and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of
      felicity to herself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which
      exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless
      gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School&mdash;not of a seminary, or an
      establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined
      nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new
      principles and new systems&mdash;and where young ladies for enormous pay
      might be screwed out of health and into vanity&mdash;but a real, honest,
      old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of
      accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be
      sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little
      education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard's
      school was in high repute&mdash;and very deservedly; for Highbury was
      reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden,
      gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great
      deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own
      hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked
      after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who had
      worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the
      occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr.
      Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat
      parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose a
      few sixpences by his fireside.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to
      collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake, in the power; though,
      as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of
      Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and
      very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the
      quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so
      spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the
      present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most
      respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most
      welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew
      very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her
      beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no longer
      dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed
      her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebody had lately
      raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder. This
      was all that was generally known of her history. She had no visible
      friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned
      from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at
      school there with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort which
      Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a fine
      bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great
      sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased
      with her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's
      conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging&mdash;not
      inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk&mdash;and yet so far from
      pushing, shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly
      grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by
      the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been
      used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.
      Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural
      graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its
      connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her.
      The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort of
      people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of the name of Martin,
      whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm of Mr.
      Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell&mdash;very creditably,
      she believed&mdash;she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them&mdash;but
      they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates of
      a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite
      perfect. <i>She</i> would notice her; she would improve her; she would
      detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her into good society;
      she would form her opinions and her manners. It would be an interesting,
      and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her own situation
      in life, her leisure, and powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and
      listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the
      evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which
      always closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and
      watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the
      fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of
      a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every
      thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted
      with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help
      and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency
      which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples
      of their guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse's feelings were in sad warfare. He
      loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his
      youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him
      rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would
      have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health made
      him grieve that they would eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could,
      with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain
      himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to
      say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg
      boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg
      better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body
      else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see&mdash;one
      of our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a <i>little</i>
      bit of tart&mdash;a <i>very</i> little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You
      need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the
      custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to <i>half</i> a glass of wine? A <i>small</i>
      half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma allowed her father to talk&mdash;but supplied her visitors in a much
      more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular
      pleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was quite
      equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in
      Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as
      pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with highly
      gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which Miss
      Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken hands with
      her at last!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick and
      decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and
      telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so
      did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had
      very early foreseen how useful she might find her. In that respect Mrs.
      Weston's loss had been important. Her father never went beyond the
      shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long
      walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage
      her exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once alone to
      Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one
      whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable addition
      to her privileges. But in every respect, as she saw more of her, she
      approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful
      disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be guided
      by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was very
      amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of appreciating
      what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want of taste,
      though strength of understanding must not be expected. Altogether she was
      quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the young friend she
      wanted&mdash;exactly the something which her home required. Such a friend
      as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could never be granted.
      Two such she did not want. It was quite a different sort of thing, a
      sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard
      which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet would be loved as one
      to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done;
      for Harriet every thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were
      the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell every thing
      in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma was obliged to
      fancy what she liked&mdash;but she could never believe that in the same
      situation <i>she</i> should not have discovered the truth. Harriet had no
      penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs.
      Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the
      school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation&mdash;and
      but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have
      been the whole. But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal; she had
      spent two very happy months with them, and now loved to talk of the
      pleasures of her visit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the
      place. Emma encouraged her talkativeness&mdash;amused by such a picture of
      another set of beings, and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could
      speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin's having &ldquo;<i>two</i>
      parlours, two very good parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as
      Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived
      five-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of
      them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow
      indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it, it should be
      called <i>her</i> cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house in
      their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink tea:&mdash;a
      very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause;
      but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose. She
      had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter, a son
      and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared that the Mr.
      Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always mentioned with
      approbation for his great good-nature in doing something or other, was a
      single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin, no wife in the case; she
      did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and
      kindness, and that, if she were not taken care of, she might be required
      to sink herself forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and
      meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin, and
      there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to speak of
      the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games; and
      dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and obliging. He
      had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts,
      because she had said how fond she was of them, and in every thing else he
      was so very obliging. He had his shepherd's son into the parlour one night
      on purpose to sing to her. She was very fond of singing. He could sing a
      little himself. She believed he was very clever, and understood every
      thing. He had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been
      bid more for his wool than any body in the country. She believed every
      body spoke well of him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs.
      Martin had told her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that
      it was impossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was
      sure, whenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she <i>wanted</i>
      him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, Mrs. Martin!&rdquo; thought Emma. &ldquo;You know what you are about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs.
      Goddard a beautiful goose&mdash;the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever
      seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three
      teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of his
      own business? He does not read?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&mdash;that is, no&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I believe he has
      read a good deal&mdash;but not what you would think any thing of. He reads
      the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the
      window seats&mdash;but he reads all <i>them</i> to himself. But sometimes
      of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out
      of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the
      Vicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The
      Children of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I mentioned
      them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next question was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! not handsome&mdash;not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at
      first, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know, after
      a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now and then,
      and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston. He has
      passed you very often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having any
      idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot, is the
      very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are precisely
      the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do. A degree or
      two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me; I might hope to
      be useful to their families in some way or other. But a farmer can need
      none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice
      as in every other he is below it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him;
      but he knows you very well indeed&mdash;I mean by sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,
      indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine
      his age to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the 23rd
      just a fortnight and a day's difference&mdash;which is very odd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is
      perfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as they
      are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably
      repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young
      woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very
      desirable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not
      born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely
      to make&mdash;cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money
      he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family
      property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so
      forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time,
      it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no
      indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks of
      taking a boy another year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does marry;&mdash;I
      mean, as to being acquainted with his wife&mdash;for though his sisters,
      from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected to, it does
      not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice. The
      misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your
      associates. There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman's daughter,
      and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your
      own power, or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in
      degrading you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield, and
      you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any body
      can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would
      have you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent even
      of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanently well
      connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd
      acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still be
      in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn in by
      your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife, who will
      probably be some mere farmer's daughter, without education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body
      but what had had some education&mdash;and been very well brought up.
      However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours&mdash;and I am
      sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always
      have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should
      be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me.
      But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better
      not visit her, if I can help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no
      alarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer, but
      she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no serious
      difficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the Donwell
      road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at her, looked
      with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was not sorry to
      have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few yards forward, while
      they talked together, soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with
      Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a
      sensible young man, but his person had no other advantage; and when he
      came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the
      ground he had gained in Harriet's inclination. Harriet was not insensible
      of manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness with
      admiration as well as wonder. Mr. Martin looked as if he did not know what
      manner was.
    </p>
    <p>
      They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be
      kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,
      and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to
      compose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only think of our happening to meet him!&mdash;How very odd! It was quite
      a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not
      think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls most
      days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet. He was so
      busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes
      again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss
      Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think of him? Do you
      think him so very plain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very plain, undoubtedly&mdash;remarkably plain:&mdash;but that is
      nothing compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to
      expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be
      so very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a
      degree or two nearer gentility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Harriet, in a mortified voice, &ldquo;he is not so genteel as
      real gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been
      repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you must
      yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At Hartfield, you
      have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. I should be
      surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in company with Mr. Martin
      again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature&mdash;and
      rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable
      before. Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure
      you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner, and the
      uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air and
      way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough. But
      Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare
      Mr. Martin with <i>him</i>. You might not see one in a hundred with <i>gentleman</i>
      so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the only gentleman
      you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton?
      Compare Mr. Martin with either of <i>them</i>. Compare their manner of
      carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent. You must
      see the difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&mdash;there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an
      old man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person grows,
      Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not be bad;
      the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or
      awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later age.
      Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr. Weston's time
      of life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no saying, indeed,&rdquo; replied Harriet rather solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,
      vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of nothing
      but profit and loss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the
      circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended. He
      was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else&mdash;which
      is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to do with books?
      And I have no doubt that he <i>will</i> thrive, and be a very rich man in
      time&mdash;and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb <i>us</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder he did not remember the book&rdquo;&mdash;was all Harriet's answer,
      and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be
      safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her
      next beginning was,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr.
      Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They might be more
      safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness, almost a
      bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in <i>him</i>, because
      there is so much good-humour with it&mdash;but that would not do to be
      copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commanding sort
      of manner, though it suits <i>him</i> very well; his figure, and look, and
      situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set about
      copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think a young
      man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model. Mr.
      Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He seems to me to
      be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know whether he has any
      design of ingratiating himself with either of us, Harriet, by additional
      softness, but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to
      be. If he means any thing, it must be to please you. Did not I tell you
      what he said of you the other day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr.
      Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and
      said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young
      farmer out of Harriet's head. She thought it would be an excellent match;
      and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her to have
      much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body else must
      think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any body should
      have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had entered her brain
      during the very first evening of Harriet's coming to Hartfield. The longer
      she considered it, the greater was her sense of its expediency. Mr.
      Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself, and
      without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family that could
      fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet. He had a comfortable home
      for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income; for though the
      vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known to have some independent
      property; and she thought very highly of him as a good-humoured,
      well-meaning, respectable young man, without any deficiency of useful
      understanding or knowledge of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful
      girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was
      foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be little
      doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual
      weight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a young
      man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned very
      handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her, there
      being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:&mdash;but
      the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin's riding about the
      country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's
      admiration.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley,
      &ldquo;of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a
      bad thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?&mdash;why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they will neither of them do the other any good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with a
      new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have been
      seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently we
      feel!&mdash;Not think they will do each other any good! This will
      certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.
      Knightley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing
      Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he thinks
      exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only yesterday, and
      agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a girl
      in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow
      you to be a fair judge in this case. You are so much used to live alone,
      that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be
      a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own
      sex, after being used to it all her life. I can imagine your objection to
      Harriet Smith. She is not the superior young woman which Emma's friend
      ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better
      informed, it will be an inducement to her to read more herself. They will
      read together. She means it, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old. I
      have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books
      that she meant to read regularly through&mdash;and very good lists they
      were&mdash;very well chosen, and very neatly arranged&mdash;sometimes
      alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up
      when only fourteen&mdash;I remember thinking it did her judgment so much
      credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made
      out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of
      steady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiring
      industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding.
      Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet
      Smith will do nothing.&mdash;You never could persuade her to read half so
      much as you wished.&mdash;You know you could not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, &ldquo;that I thought so <i>then</i>;&mdash;but
      since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting to do any thing
      I wished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as <i>that</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;said
      Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. &ldquo;But I,&rdquo; he
      soon added, &ldquo;who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must still
      see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her
      family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able to answer
      questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was always quick and
      assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since she was twelve, Emma
      has been mistress of the house and of you all. In her mother she lost the
      only person able to cope with her. She inherits her mother's talents, and
      must have been under subjection to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on <i>your</i>
      recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted another
      situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any
      body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, smiling. &ldquo;You are better placed <i>here</i>; very fit for
      a wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself to
      be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might not
      give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise;
      but you were receiving a very good education from <i>her</i>, on the very
      material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing as you
      were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should
      certainly have named Miss Taylor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such
      a man as Mr. Weston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that
      with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We will
      not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of
      comfort, or his son may plague him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not <i>that</i>.&mdash;It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not
      foretell vexation from that quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma's
      genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the young
      man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.&mdash;But
      Harriet Smith&mdash;I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her
      the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows
      nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a
      flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned. Her
      ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any thing to
      learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority?
      And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that <i>she</i> cannot gain by
      the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the
      other places she belongs to. She will grow just refined enough to be
      uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed
      her home. I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any strength of
      mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the
      varieties of her situation in life.&mdash;They only give a little polish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more
      anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance. How
      well she looked last night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very
      well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect
      beauty than Emma altogether&mdash;face and figure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom seen
      a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial old
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such an eye!&mdash;the true hazle eye&mdash;and so brilliant! regular
      features, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full
      health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!
      There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her
      glance. One hears sometimes of a child being 'the picture of health;' now,
      Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up
      health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not a fault to find with her person,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I think her all
      you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise, that I do
      not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome she is, she
      appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way. Mrs.
      Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my
      dread of its doing them both harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing
      them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, she is an excellent
      creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a
      truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be trusted; she will
      never lead any one really wrong; she will make no lasting blunder; where
      Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and I
      will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella.
      John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection, and
      Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not quite frightened
      enough about the children. I am sure of having their opinions with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind; but
      excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself, you
      know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's mother
      might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible
      good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made a matter of much
      discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any little
      inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be expected
      that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly approves
      the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a source of
      pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to give advice,
      that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of
      office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;I am much obliged to you for it. It is very good
      advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found;
      for it shall be attended to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about
      her sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will not raise any outcry. I will keep my
      ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella
      does not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;
      perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one
      feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston gently, &ldquo;very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just
      nothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she
      cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love
      with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some doubt
      of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts to
      attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution
      at present,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston, &ldquo;as can well be; and while she is so happy
      at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would
      be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account. I do not
      recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the
      state, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and
      Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes at
      Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not desirable to have them
      suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards
      made to &ldquo;What does Weston think of the weather; shall we have rain?&rdquo;
       convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a proper
      direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good
      purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.
      Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners; and
      as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration
      by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of creating as much
      liking on Harriet's side, as there could be any occasion for. She was
      quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of falling in
      love, if not in love already. She had no scruple with regard to him. He
      talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could not suppose
      any thing wanting which a little time would not add. His perception of the
      striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since her introduction at
      Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing
      attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have given Miss Smith all that she required,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you have made
      her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she came to you,
      but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are infinitely superior
      to what she received from nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted
      drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the natural
      grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have done very
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were admissible to contradict a lady,&rdquo; said the gallant Mr. Elton&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have taught
      her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded
      decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition
      more truly amiable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it.&rdquo; And it was spoken with a sort of sighing
      animation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased
      another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to
      have Harriet's picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?&rdquo; said she: &ldquo;did you ever
      sit for your picture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say, with
      a very interesting naivete,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dear, no, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would give
      any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself. You do not
      know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great passion for
      taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and was thought to
      have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or another, I gave it
      up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to
      me. It would be such a delight to have her picture!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me entreat you,&rdquo; cried Mr. Elton; &ldquo;it would indeed be a delight! Let
      me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour
      of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could you suppose me
      ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and
      flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her
      drawing-room, at Randalls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, good man!&mdash;thought Emma&mdash;but what has all that to do with
      taking likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don't pretend to be in
      raptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet's face. &ldquo;Well, if you
      give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I
      can do. Harriet's features are very delicate, which makes a likeness
      difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the
      lines about the mouth which one ought to catch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so&mdash;The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth&mdash;I
      have not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do
      it, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks so
      little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of answering me?
      How completely it meant, 'why should my picture be drawn?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still I
      cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made; and
      she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest
      pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work directly, and
      therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at
      portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might
      decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many beginnings were
      displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and
      water-colours had been all tried in turn. She had always wanted to do
      every thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music than
      many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to.
      She played and sang;&mdash;and drew in almost every style; but steadiness
      had always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the degree of
      excellence which she would have been glad to command, and ought not to
      have failed of. She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an
      artist or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived,
      or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it
      deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was merit in every drawing&mdash;in the least finished, perhaps the
      most; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there
      been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions
      would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A likeness pleases
      every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No great variety of faces for you,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;I had only my own family
      to study from. There is my father&mdash;another of my father&mdash;but the
      idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only
      take him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston
      again, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest
      friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her. There is my
      sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!&mdash;and the face
      not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have
      sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children
      that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my attempts at three of
      those four children;&mdash;there they are, Henry and John and Bella, from
      one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of them might do for any
      one of the rest. She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not
      refuse; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand
      still you know; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them,
      beyond the air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any
      of mama's children ever were. Here is my sketch of the fourth, who was a
      baby. I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it is as strong a
      likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see. He had nestled down his
      head most conveniently. That's very like. I am rather proud of little
      George. The corner of the sofa is very good. Then here is my last,&rdquo;&mdash;unclosing
      a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size, whole-length&mdash;&ldquo;my last
      and my best&mdash;my brother, Mr. John Knightley.&mdash;This did not want
      much of being finished, when I put it away in a pet, and vowed I would
      never take another likeness. I could not help being provoked; for after
      all my pains, and when I had really made a very good likeness of it&mdash;(Mrs.
      Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it <i>very</i> like)&mdash;only
      too handsome&mdash;too flattering&mdash;but that was a fault on the right
      side&rdquo;&mdash;after all this, came poor dear Isabella's cold approbation of&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
      it was a little like&mdash;but to be sure it did not do him justice. We
      had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all. It was
      made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I could bear; and
      so I never would finish it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable
      likeness, to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square;&mdash;and, as I
      said, I did then forswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet's
      sake, or rather for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the
      case <i>at</i> <i>present</i>, I will break my resolution now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was
      repeating, &ldquo;No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as you
      observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,&rdquo; with so interesting a
      consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better
      leave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the
      declaration must wait a little longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be a
      whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and was
      destined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable station
      over the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not
      keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of
      youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no
      doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every
      touch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and
      gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to it,
      and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her to
      employ him in reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness indeed!
      It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen the
      irksomeness of Miss Smith's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.
      She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less
      would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready at the
      smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress, and
      be charmed.&mdash;There was no being displeased with such an encourager,
      for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was
      possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance
      were unexceptionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough pleased
      with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. There was no want of
      likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant to
      throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more height,
      and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its being in
      every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its destined place
      with credit to them both&mdash;a standing memorial of the beauty of one,
      the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with as many other
      agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promising attachment was likely
      to add.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,
      entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the
      party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,
      took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the
      picture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased, but
      Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every
      criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted,&rdquo;&mdash;observed
      Mrs. Weston to him&mdash;not in the least suspecting that she was
      addressing a lover.&mdash;&ldquo;The expression of the eye is most correct, but
      Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of her
      face that she has them not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;I cannot agree with you. It appears to me
      a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a likeness
      in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made her too tall, Emma,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider, she
      is sitting down&mdash;which naturally presents a different&mdash;which in
      short gives exactly the idea&mdash;and the proportions must be preserved,
      you know. Proportions, fore-shortening.&mdash;Oh no! it gives one exactly
      the idea of such a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very pretty,&rdquo; said Mr. Woodhouse. &ldquo;So prettily done! Just as your
      drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so well as
      you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems to be
      sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her shoulders&mdash;and
      it makes one think she must catch cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.
      Look at the tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, sir, may say any thing,&rdquo; cried Mr. Elton, &ldquo;but I must confess that I
      regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of doors;
      and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any other situation
      would have been much less in character. The naivete of Miss Smith's
      manners&mdash;and altogether&mdash;Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot keep
      my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few
      difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the
      order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste
      could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,
      must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse could
      not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of
      December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton, than it was
      removed. His gallantry was always on the alert. &ldquo;Might he be trusted with
      the commission, what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it! he
      could ride to London at any time. It was impossible to say how much he
      should be gratified by being employed on such an errand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was too good!&mdash;she could not endure the thought!&mdash;she would
      not give him such a troublesome office for the world,&rdquo;&mdash;brought on
      the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,&mdash;and a very few
      minutes settled the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give the
      directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety
      without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of not being
      incommoded enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a precious deposit!&rdquo; said he with a tender sigh, as he received it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man is almost too gallant to be in love,&rdquo; thought Emma. &ldquo;I should
      say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being
      in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet exactly; it
      will be an 'Exactly so,' as he says himself; but he does sigh and
      languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a
      principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second. But it is his
      gratitude on Harriet's account.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion for
      Emma's services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield, as
      usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to return
      again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked of, and
      with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something extraordinary to have
      happened which she was longing to tell. Half a minute brought it all out.
      She had heard, as soon as she got back to Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin
      had been there an hour before, and finding she was not at home, nor
      particularly expected, had left a little parcel for her from one of his
      sisters, and gone away; and on opening this parcel, she had actually
      found, besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a
      letter to herself; and this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and
      contained a direct proposal of marriage. &ldquo;Who could have thought it? She
      was so surprized she did not know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of
      marriage; and a very good letter, at least she thought so. And he wrote as
      if he really loved her very much&mdash;but she did not know&mdash;and so,
      she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should
      do.&mdash;&rdquo; Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and
      so doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the young man is determined not to lose any
      thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you read the letter?&rdquo; cried Harriet. &ldquo;Pray do. I'd rather you
      would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The style
      of the letter was much above her expectation. There were not merely no
      grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a
      gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and the
      sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer. It was
      short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety,
      even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it, while Harriet stood
      anxiously watching for her opinion, with a &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; and was at last
      forced to add, &ldquo;Is it a good letter? or is it too short?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, a very good letter,&rdquo; replied Emma rather slowly&mdash;&ldquo;so
      good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his
      sisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom I
      saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if left
      quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman; no,
      certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a woman.
      No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural talent for&mdash;thinks
      strongly and clearly&mdash;and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts
      naturally find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes, I understand the
      sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point, not
      coarse. A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,) than I had
      expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the still waiting Harriet;&mdash;&ldquo;well&mdash;and&mdash;and
      what shall I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this
      letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course&mdash;and
      speedily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express
      yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your not being
      intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be unequivocal;
      no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the
      pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will present themselves
      unbidden to <i>your</i> mind, I am persuaded. You need not be prompted to
      write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I ought to refuse him then,&rdquo; said Harriet, looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any
      doubt as to that? I thought&mdash;but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have
      been under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you
      feel in doubt as to the <i>purport</i> of your answer. I had imagined you
      were consulting me only as to the wording of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not; that is, I do not mean&mdash;What shall I do? What would
      you advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do with
      it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no notion that he liked me so very much,&rdquo; said Harriet,
      contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her
      silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter
      might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman <i>doubts</i>
      as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to
      refuse him. If she can hesitate as to 'Yes,' she ought to say 'No'
      directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful
      feelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and older
      than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I want to
      influence you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to&mdash;but if you would
      just advise me what I had best do&mdash;No, no, I do not mean that&mdash;As
      you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up&mdash;One should not be
      hesitating&mdash;It is a very serious thing.&mdash;It will be safer to say
      'No,' perhaps.&mdash;Do you think I had better say 'No?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for the world,&rdquo; said Emma, smiling graciously, &ldquo;would I advise you
      either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you
      prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most
      agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you hesitate?
      You blush, Harriet.&mdash;Does any body else occur to you at this moment
      under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive yourself; do not
      be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this moment whom are you
      thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The symptoms were favourable.&mdash;Instead of answering, Harriet turned
      away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter
      was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without
      regard. Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong
      hopes. At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as well
      as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almost
      made up my mind&mdash;to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just what
      you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself,
      but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in
      approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have grieved
      me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the consequence of your
      marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest degree wavering, I
      said nothing about it, because I would not influence; but it would have
      been the loss of a friend to me. I could not have visited Mrs. Robert
      Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of you for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her
      forcibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not have visited me!&rdquo; she cried, looking aghast. &ldquo;No, to be
      sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have
      been too dreadful!&mdash;What an escape!&mdash;Dear Miss Woodhouse, I
      would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for
      any thing in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it
      must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society. I
      must have given you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&mdash;How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me
      never to come to Hartfield any more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear affectionate creature!&mdash;<i>You</i> banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!&mdash;<i>You</i>
      confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I
      wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must have
      a pretty good opinion of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think he is conceited either, in general,&rdquo; said Harriet, her
      conscience opposing such censure; &ldquo;at least, he is very good natured, and
      I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard for&mdash;but
      that is quite a different thing from&mdash;and you know, though he may
      like me, it does not follow that I should&mdash;and certainly I must
      confess that since my visiting here I have seen people&mdash;and if one
      comes to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,
      <i>one</i> is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think
      Mr. Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and
      his being so much attached to me&mdash;and his writing such a letter&mdash;but
      as to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be parted.
      A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or because he
      is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no;&mdash;and it is but a short letter too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a &ldquo;very true;
      and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish manner which
      might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that her husband
      could write a good letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always
      happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him. But
      how shall I do? What shall I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advised
      its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of her
      assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance
      being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence. The
      looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had such a softening
      tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few
      decisive expressions; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of
      making him unhappy, and thought so much of what his mother and sisters
      would think and say, and was so anxious that they should not fancy her
      ungrateful, that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at
      that moment, he would have been accepted after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business was
      finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but Emma
      could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by
      speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of
      Mr. Elton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,&rdquo; was said in rather a
      sorrowful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You are
      a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but
      at Hartfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some time afterwards it was, &ldquo;I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much
      surprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would&mdash;for
      Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a
      linen-draper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of
      a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity
      as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear valuable in her
      eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she is quite in the
      dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the
      tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only
      people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that people
      should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering; but
      still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards the rejected Mr.
      Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now he has got my letter,&rdquo; said she softly. &ldquo;I wonder what they are all
      doing&mdash;whether his sisters know&mdash;if he is unhappy, they will be
      unhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully
      employed,&rdquo; cried Emma. &ldquo;At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing your
      picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful is the
      original, and after being asked for it five or six times, allowing them to
      hear your name, your own dear name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My picture!&mdash;But he has left my picture in Bond-street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he so!&mdash;Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little
      modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till
      just before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this
      evening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family, it
      introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those pleasantest
      feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm prepossession. How
      cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all
      are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been
      spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a
      bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every
      respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible
      just at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two
      to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that she should return to
      Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.
      Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his
      mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and was
      induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his own
      civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr. Knightley, who had
      nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his short, decided answers,
      an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not
      consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's advice and go
      out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had better
      take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony, Mr.
      Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to
      entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my
      three turns&mdash;my winter walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot do better, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a
      very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you
      have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think the
      sooner <i>you</i> go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the
      garden door for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being
      immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more
      chat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more
      voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot rate her beauty as you do,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but she is a pretty little
      creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition. Her
      character depends upon those she is with; but in good hands she will turn
      out a valuable woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you
      that you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl's
      giggle; she really does you credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been
      of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they
      may. <i>You</i> do not often overpower me with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she intended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Highbury gossips!&mdash;Tiresome wretches!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said nothing.
      He presently added, with a smile,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I
      have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something
      to her advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! how so? of what sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very serious sort, I assure you;&rdquo; still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very serious! I can think of but one thing&mdash;Who is in love with her?
      Who makes you their confidant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint. Mr.
      Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew Mr. Elton
      looked up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have reason to think,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that Harriet Smith will soon have
      an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:&mdash;Robert
      Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have
      done his business. He is desperately in love and means to marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very obliging,&rdquo; said Emma; &ldquo;but is he sure that Harriet means to
      marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to the
      Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows I have
      a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe, considers me
      as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether I thought it would
      be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I thought her too young:
      in short, whether I approved his choice altogether; having some
      apprehension perhaps of her being considered (especially since <i>your</i>
      making so much of her) as in a line of society above him. I was very much
      pleased with all that he said. I never hear better sense from any one than
      Robert Martin. He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and
      very well judging. He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans,
      and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage. He is an
      excellent young man, both as son and brother. I had no hesitation in
      advising him to marry. He proved to me that he could afford it; and that
      being the case, I was convinced he could not do better. I praised the fair
      lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy. If he had never
      esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought highly of me then; and,
      I dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man
      ever had. This happened the night before last. Now, as we may fairly
      suppose, he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady,
      and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely
      that he should be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a
      visitor, without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Mr. Knightley,&rdquo; said Emma, who had been smiling to herself through
      a great part of this speech, &ldquo;how do you know that Mr. Martin did not
      speak yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied he, surprized, &ldquo;I do not absolutely know it; but it
      may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will tell you something, in return for what you have
      told me. He did speak yesterday&mdash;that is, he wrote, and was refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.
      Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he stood
      up, in tall indignation, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the
      foolish girl about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! to be sure,&rdquo; cried Emma, &ldquo;it is always incomprehensible to a man that
      a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always imagines a
      woman to be ready for any body who asks her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the meaning
      of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is so; but I
      hope you are mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw her answer!&mdash;nothing could be clearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw her answer!&mdash;you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your
      doing. You persuaded her to refuse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not feel
      that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man, but I
      cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprized indeed
      that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he does seem
      to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever got over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Harriet's equal!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and with
      calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, &ldquo;No, he is not her equal
      indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation. Emma,
      your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are Harriet Smith's
      claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion higher than
      Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with
      probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable
      relations. She is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school. She is
      not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. She has been taught
      nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing
      herself. At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit,
      is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and
      she is good tempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the
      match was on his account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad
      connexion for him. I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might
      do much better; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he
      could not do worse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was
      willing to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of
      disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright
      and turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her
      side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be
      a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even <i>your</i>
      satisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you would
      not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake of her being
      settled so well. I remember saying to myself, 'Even Emma, with all her
      partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any
      such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all his
      merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend!
      Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I
      could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you should think
      it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you mine are very
      different. I must think your statement by no means fair. You are not just
      to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated very differently by others as
      well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is
      undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.&mdash;The sphere in which
      she moves is much above his.&mdash;It would be a degradation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a
      respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may be
      called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay for the
      offence of others, by being held below the level of those with whom she is
      brought up.&mdash;There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a
      gentleman&mdash;and a gentleman of fortune.&mdash;Her allowance is very
      liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.&mdash;That
      she is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me; that she associates
      with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, will deny.&mdash;She is
      superior to Mr. Robert Martin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever might be her parents,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley, &ldquo;whoever may have had
      the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of their plan
      to introduce her into what you would call good society. After receiving a
      very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard's hands to shift as
      she can;&mdash;to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard's line, to have Mrs.
      Goddard's acquaintance. Her friends evidently thought this good enough for
      her; and it <i>was</i> good enough. She desired nothing better herself.
      Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her
      own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She was as happy as possible with the
      Martins in the summer. She had no sense of superiority then. If she has it
      now, you have given it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma.
      Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far, if he had not felt
      persuaded of her not being disinclined to him. I know him well. He has too
      much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish
      passion. And as to conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know.
      Depend upon it he had encouragement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this
      assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are
      unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not so contemptible
      as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she has better sense
      than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her understanding
      spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, and supposing her
      to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you,
      that in the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial
      recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful
      girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred; and
      till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of
      beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall in love with
      well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such
      loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought after,
      of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be
      nice. Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim, comprehending,
      as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble
      opinion of herself, and a great readiness to be pleased with other people.
      I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such
      beauty, and such temper, the highest claims a woman could possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost
      enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply it
      as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; cried she playfully. &ldquo;I know <i>that</i> is the feeling of
      you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man
      delights in&mdash;what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his
      judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to
      marry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just
      entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at because
      she does not accept the first offer she receives? No&mdash;pray let her
      have time to look about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley
      presently, &ldquo;though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive
      that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her up
      with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that,
      in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her.
      Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing so
      easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high. Miss Harriet
      Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a
      very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want
      silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves
      with a girl of such obscurity&mdash;and most prudent men would be afraid
      of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the
      mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin,
      and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her
      to expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing
      less than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be a
      parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest of her life&mdash;or, at
      least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,)
      till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writing-master's
      son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there can
      be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more angry.
      But as to my <i>letting</i> her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible; she
      has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any second
      application. She must abide by the evil of having refused him, whatever it
      may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I
      might not influence her a little; but I assure you there was very little
      for me or for any body to do. His appearance is so much against him, and
      his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is
      not now. I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior, she
      might tolerate him. He was the brother of her friends, and he took pains
      to please her; and altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have
      been his great assistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find
      him disagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows now what
      gentlemen are; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any
      chance with Harriet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!&rdquo; cried Mr. Knightley.&mdash;&ldquo;Robert
      Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend them;
      and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was
      really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She did
      not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better judge of
      such a point of female right and refinement than he could be; but yet she
      had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general, which made her
      dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him sitting just
      opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable. Some minutes passed
      in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt on Emma's side to talk
      of the weather, but he made no answer. He was thinking. The result of his
      thoughts appeared at last in these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert Martin has no great loss&mdash;if he can but think so; and I hope
      it will not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known
      to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it is
      fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;&mdash;and as
      a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it
      will be all labour in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man, and
      a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make an
      imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any body.
      Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is as well
      acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet's. He knows
      that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite wherever he
      goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments, when
      there are only men present, I am convinced that he does not mean to throw
      himself away. I have heard him speak with great animation of a large
      family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all
      twenty thousand pounds apiece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you,&rdquo; said Emma, laughing again. &ldquo;If I had set
      my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have been very kind to
      open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself. I have
      done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to equal my own doings
      at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning to you,&rdquo;&mdash;said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He
      was very much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was
      mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he had
      given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair,
      was provoking him exceedingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more
      indistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his. She did not always
      feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that her
      opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He walked
      off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She was not so
      materially cast down, however, but that a little time and the return of
      Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet's staying away so long
      was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility of the young man's
      coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting with Harriet and
      pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread of such a failure
      after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and
      in very good spirits, and without having any such reason to give for her
      long absence, she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind,
      and convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would, she
      had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings would not
      justify.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered
      that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither
      with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of
      Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on such a
      question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger, she was
      able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be
      true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly might have heard Mr.
      Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton
      might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money
      matters; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them;
      but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a
      strong passion at war with all interested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no
      such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw
      too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a
      reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable,
      becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr.
      Elton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not to
      think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been telling
      her something, which she repeated immediately with great delight. Mr.
      Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child, and Miss Nash had
      seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was coming back yesterday
      from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and found to his great surprize,
      that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to London, and not meaning to
      return till the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had
      been never known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him
      about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player, to
      absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey
      only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on,
      and had said in a <i>very</i> <i>particular</i> way indeed, that he was
      going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the
      world; and something about a very enviable commission, and being the
      bearer of something exceedingly precious. Mr. Perry could not quite
      understand him, but he was very sure there must be a <i>lady</i> in the
      case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only looked very conscious and
      smiling, and rode off in great spirits. Miss Nash had told her all this,
      and had talked a great deal more about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so
      very significantly at her, &ldquo;that she did not pretend to understand what
      his business might be, but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton
      could prefer, she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for,
      beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with
      herself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before
      he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave looks shewed
      that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not repent. On the
      contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and
      endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr. Elton's
      return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room, he
      got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just
      as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they were visibly forming
      themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort
      of mind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin's being
      no otherwise remembered, than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton,
      of the utmost advantage to the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal of useful
      reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few first
      chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much easier to
      chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work
      at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or
      exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary pursuit which engaged
      Harriet at present, the only mental provision she was making for the
      evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of
      every sort that she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed
      paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are not
      uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, had written out at
      least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it from
      her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many more. Emma
      assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very
      pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in
      form as well as quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls,
      and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in. &ldquo;So
      many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young&mdash;he
      wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.&rdquo; And
      it always ended in &ldquo;Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, did not
      at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had desired
      Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much, something, he
      thought, might come from that quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of Highbury in
      general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one whose
      assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really good
      enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she had the
      pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections; and
      at the same time, as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that
      nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex
      should pass his lips. They owed to him their two or three politest
      puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled, and
      rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    My first doth affliction denote,
      Which my second is destin'd to feel
    And my whole is the best antidote
      That affliction to soften and heal.&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some
      pages ago already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;that
      is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his
      life. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse&rdquo;&mdash;he
      stopt a moment&mdash;&ldquo;or Miss Smith could inspire him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He called
      for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing,
      as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed to a young
      lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his manner, Emma was
      immediately convinced must be his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Being my
      friend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,
      but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could understand.
      There was deep consciousness about him, and he found it easier to meet her
      eye than her friend's. He was gone the next moment:&mdash;after another
      moment's pause,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards Harriet&mdash;&ldquo;it
      is for you. Take your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never loth
      to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        To Miss&mdash;

          CHARADE.

    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,
      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.
    Another view of man, my second brings,
      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!

    But ah! united, what reverse we have!
      Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown;
    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,
      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.

      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,
      May its approval beam in that soft eye!
</pre>
    <p>
      She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through
      again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then
      passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself, while
      Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and
      dulness, &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse
      charades. <i>Courtship</i>&mdash;a very good hint. I give you credit for
      it. This is feeling your way. This is saying very plainly&mdash;'Pray,
      Miss Smith, give me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade
      and my intentions in the same glance.'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      May its approval beam in that soft eye!
</pre>
    <p>
      Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye&mdash;of all epithets,
      the justest that could be given.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.
</pre>
    <p>
      Humph&mdash;Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much
      in love, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the
      benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life
      you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade
      indeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations, which
      were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the eagerness of
      Harriet's wondering questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?&mdash;what can it be? I have not an idea&mdash;I
      cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find it
      out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is it
      kingdom? I wonder who the friend was&mdash;and who could be the young
      lady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.
</pre>
    <p>
      Can it be Neptune?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!
</pre>
    <p>
      Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one
      syllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!
      Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking of?
      Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon
      a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Miss &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, read Miss Smith.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,
      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.
</pre>
    <p>
      That is <i>court</i>.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Another view of man, my second brings;
      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!
</pre>
    <p>
      That is <i>ship</i>;&mdash;plain as it can be.&mdash;Now for the cream.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    But ah! united, (<i>courtship</i>, you know,) what reverse we have!
      Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown.
    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,
      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.
</pre>
    <p>
      A very proper compliment!&mdash;and then follows the application, which I
      think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending.
      Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of its being written
      for you and to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read the
      concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not speak.
      But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel. Emma spoke
      for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions. You
      are his object&mdash;and you will soon receive the completest proof of it.
      I thought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now, it
      is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my wishes on
      the subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet, just so long
      have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened. I
      could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most
      desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility have really
      so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my dear
      Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may well
      feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing but good.
      It will give you every thing that you want&mdash;consideration,
      independence, a proper home&mdash;it will fix you in the centre of all
      your real friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy
      for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in
      either of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Miss Woodhouse!&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;Dear Miss Woodhouse,&rdquo; was all that
      Harriet, with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when
      they did arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently
      clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just
      as she ought. Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you say is always right,&rdquo; cried Harriet, &ldquo;and therefore I
      suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not
      have imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton, who
      might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about <i>him</i>. He is
      so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses&mdash;'To Miss &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.'
      Dear me, how clever!&mdash;Could it really be meant for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a
      certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to the
      play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by matter-of-fact
      prose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure, a
      month ago, I had no more idea myself!&mdash;The strangest things do take
      place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted&mdash;they do indeed&mdash;and
      really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so
      evidently, so palpably desirable&mdash;what courts the pre-arrangement of
      other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form. You
      and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one another
      by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying will be
      equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a something in the
      air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction, and sends
      it into the very channel where it ought to flow.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      The course of true love never did run smooth&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that
      passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,&mdash;me, of all people,
      who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very
      handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to, quite
      like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body says he
      need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it; that he has
      more invitations than there are days in the week. And so excellent in the
      Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from
      since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back to the first time I
      saw him! How little did I think!&mdash;The two Abbots and I ran into the
      front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by, and
      Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through herself;
      however, she called me back presently, and let me look too, which was very
      good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he looked! He was arm-in-arm
      with Mr. Cole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an alliance which, whoever&mdash;whatever your friends may be,
      must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and
      we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to
      see you <i>happily</i> married, here is a man whose amiable character
      gives every assurance of it;&mdash;if they wish to have you settled in the
      same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it
      will be accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the
      common phrase, be <i>well</i> married, here is the comfortable fortune,
      the respectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You understand
      every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other. This
      charade!&mdash;If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have made any
      thing like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as long again as almost all we have had before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such things
      in general cannot be too short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory
      comparisons were rising in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one thing,&rdquo; said she, presently&mdash;her cheeks in a glow&mdash;&ldquo;to
      have very good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there
      is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you
      must, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's
      prose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such sweet lines!&rdquo; continued Harriet&mdash;&ldquo;these two last!&mdash;But how
      shall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?&mdash;Oh!
      Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare say,
      and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will pass
      between us, and you shall not be committed.&mdash;Your soft eyes shall
      chuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful
      charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not
      write it into your book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but those two lines are&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;The best of all. Granted;&mdash;for private enjoyment; and for
      private enjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you
      know, because you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does
      its meaning change. But take it away, and all <i>appropriation</i> ceases,
      and a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend
      upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better than
      his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or
      neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can be no
      possible reflection on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so as
      to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of
      love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Emma; &ldquo;a most natural feeling; and the longer it
      lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you
      will not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him so
      much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any thing
      that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry
      towards us all!&mdash;You must let me read it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet looked grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.&mdash;You
      will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too
      quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning
      which may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute
      of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not have left
      the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards
      you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has encouragement
      enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over this charade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no&mdash;I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the
      recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of &ldquo;Well, my dears, how does your
      book go on?&mdash;Have you got any thing fresh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A piece
      of paper was found on the table this morning&mdash;(dropt, we suppose, by
      a fairy)&mdash;containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied
      it in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and
      distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every part
      as she proceeded&mdash;and he was very much pleased, and, as she had
      foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Very true.
      'Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can
      easily guess what fairy brought it.&mdash;Nobody could have written so
      prettily, but you, Emma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma only nodded, and smiled.&mdash;After a little thinking, and a very
      tender sigh, he added,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother was
      so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can remember
      nothing;&mdash;not even that particular riddle which you have heard me
      mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are several.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,
      Kindled a flame I yet deplore,
    The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,
    Though of his near approach afraid,
      So fatal to my suit before.
</pre>
    <p>
      And that is all that I can recollect of it&mdash;but it is very clever all
      the way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the
      Elegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, very true.&mdash;I wish I could recollect more of it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.
</pre>
    <p>
      The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being
      christened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here
      next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her&mdash;and
      what room there will be for the children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes&mdash;she will have her own room, of course; the room she always
      has;&mdash;and there is the nursery for the children,&mdash;just as usual,
      you know. Why should there be any change?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, my dear&mdash;but it is so long since she was here!&mdash;not
      since last Easter, and then only for a few days.&mdash;Mr. John
      Knightley's being a lawyer is very inconvenient.&mdash;Poor Isabella!&mdash;she
      is sadly taken away from us all!&mdash;and how sorry she will be when she
      comes, not to see Miss Taylor here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will not be surprized, papa, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I first
      heard she was going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear, if there is time.&mdash;But&mdash;(in a very depressed
      tone)&mdash;she is coming for only one week. There will not be time for
      any thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer&mdash;but it seems a case
      of necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we
      ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time they
      can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be taken out
      for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas&mdash;though
      you know it is longer since they were with him, than with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be
      anywhere but at Hartfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on his brother,
      or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat musing a little
      while, and then said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon,
      though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to stay longer
      with us. She and the children might stay very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! papa&mdash;that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I
      do not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse
      could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by
      the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband, she immediately led
      to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother
      and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the children. We
      are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder which she will
      think the handsomest, Henry or John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be to
      come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the eldest,
      he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second, is named
      after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that the eldest
      was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I thought very
      pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They are all
      remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will come and
      stand by my chair, and say, 'Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?'
      and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives were only made
      for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with them very often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He appears rough to you,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;because you are so very gentle
      yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not
      think him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if they
      misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an
      affectionate father&mdash;certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate
      father. The children are all fond of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a
      very frightful way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such
      enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their
      taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I cannot understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot
      understand the pleasures of the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in
      preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero of this
      inimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could
      receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in his
      the consciousness of having made a push&mdash;of having thrown a die; and
      she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible
      reason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made up
      in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest degree
      necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give way; but
      otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with
      him&mdash;had made such a point of it, that he had promised him
      conditionally to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on
      their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged&mdash;she
      re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the
      paper from the table, she returned it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us; thank
      you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have ventured to
      write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend will not take it amiss
      I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked rather
      doubtingly&mdash;rather confused; said something about &ldquo;honour,&rdquo;&mdash;glanced
      at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, took
      it up, and examined it very attentively. With the view of passing off an
      awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must not
      be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman's approbation
      while he writes with such gallantry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no hesitation in saying,&rdquo; replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating a
      good deal while he spoke; &ldquo;I have no hesitation in saying&mdash;at least
      if my friend feels at all as <i>I</i> do&mdash;I have not the smallest
      doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as <i>I</i> see it,
      (looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he would
      consider it as the proudest moment of his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think it
      too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a sort
      of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh. She
      ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and the sublime of
      pleasure to Harriet's share.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to
      prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the
      morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who
      lived a little way out of Highbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane leading
      at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street of the
      place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of Mr. Elton.
      A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then, about a
      quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and not very
      good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had no
      advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the present
      proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility of the two
      friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes.&mdash;Emma's
      remark was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these days.&rdquo;&mdash;Harriet's
      was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a sweet house!&mdash;How very beautiful!&mdash;There are the
      yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not often walk this way <i>now</i>,&rdquo; said Emma, as they proceeded,
      &ldquo;but <i>then</i> there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get
      intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of
      this part of Highbury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage,
      and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors
      and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr.
      Elton's seeing ready wit in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we could contrive it,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but I cannot think of any
      tolerable pretence for going in;&mdash;no servant that I want to inquire
      about of his housekeeper&mdash;no message from my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of some
      minutes, Harriet thus began again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or going
      to be married! so charming as you are!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma laughed, and replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry; I
      must find other people charming&mdash;one other person at least. And I am
      not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little
      intention of ever marrying at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;so you say; but I cannot believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be
      tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the
      question: and I do <i>not</i> wish to see any such person. I would rather
      not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry,
      I must expect to repent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&mdash;it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall in
      love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been in
      love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.
      And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation
      as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do
      not want: I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their
      husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect to
      be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always right in any
      man's eyes as I am in my father's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I
      thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly&mdash;so satisfied&mdash;so
      smiling&mdash;so prosing&mdash;so undistinguishing and unfastidious&mdash;and
      so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry
      to-morrow. But between <i>us</i>, I am convinced there never can be any
      likeness, except in being unmarried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty
      only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single
      woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old
      maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of good
      fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and pleasant as any
      body else. And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour
      and common sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow
      income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper. Those who
      can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, and generally very
      inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross. This does not apply,
      however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit
      me; but, in general, she is very much to the taste of every body, though
      single and though poor. Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind: I
      really believe, if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very
      likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a
      great charm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you
      grow old?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great
      many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more in
      want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman's usual
      occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now;
      or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read more; if I
      give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for objects of
      interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the great point of
      inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in
      <i>not</i> marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the children of a
      sister I love so much, to care about. There will be enough of them, in all
      probability, to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can
      need. There will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my
      attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas of
      comfort better than what is warmer and blinder. My nephews and nieces!&mdash;I
      shall often have a niece with me.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have seen her a
      hundred times&mdash;but are you acquainted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to
      Highbury. By the bye, <i>that</i> is almost enough to put one out of
      conceit with a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore
      people half so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about
      Jane Fairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter
      from her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go round
      and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a
      stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears of
      nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me
      to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were
      superseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor
      were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her
      counsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,
      could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic
      expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had
      done so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and
      always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In the
      present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she came to
      visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or
      advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as
      made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make
      every thing else appear!&mdash;I feel now as if I could think of nothing
      but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how
      soon it may all vanish from my mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said Harriet. &ldquo;Poor creatures! one can think of nothing
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,&rdquo; said Emma,
      as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended the
      narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them into
      the lane again. &ldquo;I do not think it will,&rdquo; stopping to look once more at
      all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still greater
      within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dear, no,&rdquo; said her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was
      passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma
      time only to say farther,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good
      thoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has
      produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that is
      truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can for
      them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet could just answer, &ldquo;Oh! dear, yes,&rdquo; before the gentleman joined
      them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the first
      subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit he would
      now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done
      and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,&rdquo; thought Emma; &ldquo;to
      meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of love on
      each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration. It
      must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon
      afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one
      side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had not
      been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits of dependence
      and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short, they would
      both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately stopped, under
      pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half-boot,
      and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath, begged them to
      have the goodness to walk on, and she would follow in half a minute. They
      did as they were desired; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have
      done with her boot, she had the comfort of farther delay in her power,
      being overtaken by a child from the cottage, setting out, according to
      orders, with her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the
      side of this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural
      thing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been
      acting just then without design; and by this means the others were still
      able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her. She gained
      on them, however, involuntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs
      rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it, from their being
      evidently in a conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking
      with animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,
      having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw back a
      little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged to join
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail; and
      Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only
      giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at his
      friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese,
      the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and all the
      dessert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This would soon have led to something better, of course,&rdquo; was her
      consoling reflection; &ldquo;any thing interests between those who love; and any
      thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I could but
      have kept longer away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage
      pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the
      house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot, and
      fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off short,
      and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged to entreat
      them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so
      as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part of my lace is gone,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I do not know how I am to
      contrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I hope
      I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stop at
      your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string, or
      any thing just to keep my boot on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could
      exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and
      endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they were
      taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind
      it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between
      them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her
      assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged to leave the
      door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should
      close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by
      engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it
      practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room. For
      ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It could be protracted no
      longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and make her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most
      favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of having
      schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to the point.
      He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told Harriet that he
      had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other little
      gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cautious, very cautious,&rdquo; thought Emma; &ldquo;he advances inch by inch, and
      will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her
      ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been the
      occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading them
      forward to the great event.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma's power to
      superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her
      sister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation, and
      then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest; and
      during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected&mdash;she
      did not herself expect&mdash;that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous
      assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They might advance
      rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether
      they would or no. She hardly wished to have more leisure for them. There
      are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will do for
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent
      from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest.
      Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been divided
      between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of this autumn
      had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was therefore many
      months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry
      connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to
      get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently
      was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too
      short visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little of
      the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the
      party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless; the sixteen
      miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their
      five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids, all reaching
      Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be
      talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of,
      produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under
      any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this; but the ways
      of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John
      Knightley, that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate
      enjoyment of her little ones, and for their having instantly all the
      liberty and attendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and
      playing, which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay,
      the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either in
      themselves or in any restless attendance on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet
      manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt up
      in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly attached
      to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a warmer love
      might have seemed impossible. She could never see a fault in any of them.
      She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness; and with
      this resemblance of her father, she inherited also much of his
      constitution; was delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her
      children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr.
      Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry. They were alike
      too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard for
      every old acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man; rising
      in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private character; but
      with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing; and
      capable of being sometimes out of humour. He was not an ill-tempered man,
      not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his
      temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping
      wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be
      increased. The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his. He had all
      the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted, and he could
      sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong in
      him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella,
      which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have passed over more
      had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only
      those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without praise and without
      blindness; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made
      her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he
      sometimes fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her
      father. There he had not always the patience that could have been wished.
      Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him
      to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did
      not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great regard for his
      father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it
      was too often for Emma's charity, especially as there was all the pain of
      apprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. The
      beginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest
      feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away
      in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long seated and composed when
      Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his
      daughter's attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been
      there last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;poor Miss Taylor&mdash;It is a grievous
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, sir,&rdquo; cried she with ready sympathy, &ldquo;how you must miss her! And
      dear Emma, too!&mdash;What a dreadful loss to you both!&mdash;I have been
      so grieved for you.&mdash;I could not imagine how you could possibly do
      without her.&mdash;It is a sad change indeed.&mdash;But I hope she is
      pretty well, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well, my dear&mdash;I hope&mdash;pretty well.&mdash;I do not know
      but that the place agrees with her tolerably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts
      of the air of Randalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no&mdash;none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life&mdash;never
      looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much to the honour of both,&rdquo; was the handsome reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?&rdquo; asked Isabella in the
      plaintive tone which just suited her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.&mdash;&ldquo;Not near so often, my dear, as I could
      wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they
      married. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,
      have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both, either
      at Randalls or here&mdash;and as you may suppose, Isabella, most
      frequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston is
      really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you
      will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body must be aware
      that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured
      that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to
      the extent we ourselves anticipated&mdash;which is the exact truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as it should be,&rdquo; said Mr. John Knightley, &ldquo;and just as I hoped it
      was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not be
      doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I
      have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change
      being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have
      Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to be sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Woodhouse&mdash;&ldquo;yes, certainly&mdash;I cannot
      deny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often&mdash;but
      then&mdash;she is always obliged to go away again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.&mdash;You
      quite forget poor Mr. Weston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, indeed,&rdquo; said John Knightley pleasantly, &ldquo;that Mr. Weston has
      some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the
      poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims of
      the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for Isabella, she
      has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr.
      Westons aside as much as she can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, my love,&rdquo; cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.&mdash;
      &ldquo;Are you talking about me?&mdash;I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be,
      a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for the
      misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss
      Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting
      Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does
      not deserve. I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever
      existed. Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his equal for
      temper. I shall never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very
      windy day last Easter&mdash;and ever since his particular kindness last
      September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night, on
      purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have
      been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in
      existence.&mdash;If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the young man?&rdquo; said John Knightley. &ldquo;Has he been here on this
      occasion&mdash;or has he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not been here yet,&rdquo; replied Emma. &ldquo;There was a strong expectation
      of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in nothing; and I have
      not heard him mentioned lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;He
      wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very
      proper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very
      well done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one cannot
      tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three-and-twenty!&mdash;is he indeed?&mdash;Well, I could not have
      thought it&mdash;and he was but two years old when he lost his poor
      mother! Well, time does fly indeed!&mdash;and my memory is very bad.
      However, it was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs.
      Weston a great deal of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth,
      and dated Sept. 28th&mdash;and began, 'My dear Madam,' but I forget how it
      went on; and it was signed 'F. C. Weston Churchill.'&mdash;I remember that
      perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very pleasing and proper of him!&rdquo; cried the good-hearted Mrs. John
      Knightley. &ldquo;I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But how
      sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is
      something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his parents and
      natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with him.
      To give up one's child! I really never could think well of any body who
      proposed such a thing to any body else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,&rdquo; observed Mr. John
      Knightley coolly. &ldquo;But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt what
      you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is rather an easy,
      cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he takes things as
      he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I
      suspect, much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is,
      upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his
      neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any thing
      that home affords.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and had
      half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. She would
      keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and
      valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to
      himself, whence resulted her brother's disposition to look down on the
      common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was important.&mdash;It
      had a high claim to forbearance.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley was to dine with them&mdash;rather against the inclination
      of Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him in
      Isabella's first day. Emma's sense of right however had decided it; and
      besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had
      particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement
      between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was time to
      make up. Making-up indeed would not do. <i>She</i> certainly had not been
      in the wrong, and <i>he</i> would never own that he had. Concession must
      be out of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had
      ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of
      friendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the children
      with her&mdash;the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months old,
      who was now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be
      danced about in her aunt's arms. It did assist; for though he began with
      grave looks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of them all in
      the usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with all the
      unceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends again; and
      the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then a little
      sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.
      As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with
      regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women,
      and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with
      them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might always think
      alike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure&mdash;our discordancies must always arise from my being in the
      wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, smiling&mdash;&ldquo;and reason good. I was sixteen years old
      when you were born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A material difference then,&rdquo; she replied&mdash;&ldquo;and no doubt you were
      much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the
      lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal
      nearer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a good deal <i>nearer</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we
      think differently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and by
      not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma,
      let us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little Emma,
      that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old
      grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; she cried&mdash;&ldquo;very true. Little Emma, grow up a better
      woman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.
      Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good
      intentions went, we were <i>both</i> right, and I must say that no effects
      on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know that
      Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man cannot be more so,&rdquo; was his short, full answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;Indeed I am very sorry.&mdash;Come, shake hands with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John Knightley
      made his appearance, and &ldquo;How d'ye do, George?&rdquo; and &ldquo;John, how are you?&rdquo;
       succeeded in the true English style, burying under a calmness that seemed
      all but indifference, the real attachment which would have led either of
      them, if requisite, to do every thing for the good of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards
      entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and the
      little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his daughter;
      on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally distinct, or
      very rarely mixing&mdash;and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally of
      those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative, and
      who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had generally some
      point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some curious anecdote to
      give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm at Donwell, he had
      to tell what every field was to bear next year, and to give all such local
      information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home
      it had equally been the longest part of his life, and whose attachments
      were strong. The plan of a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a
      tree, and the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring
      corn, was entered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his
      cooler manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him
      any thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of
      eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a
      full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor dear Isabella,&rdquo; said he, fondly taking her hand, and
      interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her five
      children&mdash;&ldquo;How long it is, how terribly long since you were here! And
      how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early, my
      dear&mdash;and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.&mdash;You
      and I will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we
      all have a little gruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both the
      Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;&mdash;and
      two basins only were ordered. After a little more discourse in praise of
      gruel, with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every
      body, he proceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South
      End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir&mdash;or we should not
      have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for
      the weakness in little Bella's throat,&mdash;both sea air and bathing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good;
      and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though perhaps I
      never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use to any body.
      I am sure it almost killed me once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, &ldquo;I must
      beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;&mdash;I
      who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear
      Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet; and
      he never forgets you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! good Mr. Perry&mdash;how is he, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he has
      not time to take care of himself&mdash;he tells me he has not time to take
      care of himself&mdash;which is very sad&mdash;but he is always wanted all
      round the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere.
      But then there is not so clever a man any where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow? I
      have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He will
      be so pleased to see my little ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask him
      about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes, you had
      better let him look at little Bella's throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any
      uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to
      her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.
      Wingfield's, which we have been applying at times ever since August.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use to
      her&mdash;and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have
      spoken to&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;I have
      not heard one inquiry after them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the good Bateses&mdash;I am quite ashamed of myself&mdash;but you
      mention them in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old
      Mrs. Bates&mdash;I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.&mdash;They
      are always so pleased to see my children.&mdash;And that excellent Miss
      Bates!&mdash;such thorough worthy people!&mdash;How are they, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad
      cold about a month ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this
      autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or
      heavy&mdash;except when it has been quite an influenza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you
      mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy as
      he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it
      altogether a sickly season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it <i>very</i> sickly
      except&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a
      sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a
      dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!&mdash;and the
      air so bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed&mdash;<i>we</i> are not at all in a bad air. Our part of
      London is very superior to most others!&mdash;You must not confound us
      with London in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square
      is very different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should
      be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;&mdash;there is
      hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: but <i>we</i>
      are so remarkably airy!&mdash;Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of
      Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it&mdash;but
      after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different
      creatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I think
      you are any of you looking well at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those
      little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free
      from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were rather
      pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a little more
      tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of coming. I hope
      you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I assure you Mr.
      Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever sent us off
      altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that you do not think
      Mr. Knightley looking ill,&rdquo; turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety
      towards her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley
      very far from looking well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, sir?&mdash;Did you speak to me?&rdquo; cried Mr. John
      Knightley, hearing his own name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking
      well&mdash;but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could
      have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before
      you left home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Isabella,&rdquo;&mdash;exclaimed he hastily&mdash;&ldquo;pray do not concern
      yourself about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself
      and the children, and let me look as I chuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,&rdquo;
       cried Emma, &ldquo;about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailiff
      from Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will not
      the old prejudice be too strong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced to
      give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing worse
      to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane Fairfax,
      though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that moment very
      happy to assist in praising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!&rdquo; said Mrs. John Knightley.&mdash;&ldquo;It is
      so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment
      accidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old
      grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always
      regret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot be more at
      Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.
      Campbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a
      delightful companion for Emma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty
      kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a better
      companion than Harriet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am most happy to hear it&mdash;but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so
      very accomplished and superior!&mdash;and exactly Emma's age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar
      moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not
      close without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied a
      great deal to be said&mdash;much praise and many comments&mdash;undoubting
      decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe
      Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerably;&mdash;but,
      unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter had to instance, the
      most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in her own cook at South
      End, a young woman hired for the time, who never had been able to
      understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not
      too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered it, she had never been
      able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a dangerous opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with
      tender concern.&mdash;The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, &ldquo;Ah! there
      is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It does not
      bear talking of.&rdquo; And for a little while she hoped he would not talk of
      it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the
      relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes,
      however, he began with,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,
      instead of coming here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you be sorry, sir?&mdash;I assure you, it did the children
      a great deal of good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been to
      South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to hear
      you had fixed upon South End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite a
      mistake, sir.&mdash;We all had our health perfectly well there, never
      found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is
      entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may be
      depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air, and his
      own brother and family have been there repeatedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.&mdash;Perry
      was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the
      sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by
      what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from the
      sea&mdash;a quarter of a mile off&mdash;very comfortable. You should have
      consulted Perry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;&mdash;only consider how
      great it would have been.&mdash;An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of
      forty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else should
      be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to chuse between
      forty miles and an hundred.&mdash;Better not move at all, better stay in
      London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air. This is
      just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very ill-judged measure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had reached
      such a point as this, she could not wonder at her brother-in-law's
      breaking out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Perry,&rdquo; said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, &ldquo;would do as
      well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it any
      business of his, to wonder at what I do?&mdash;at my taking my family to
      one part of the coast or another?&mdash;I may be allowed, I hope, the use
      of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.&mdash;I want his directions no more
      than his drugs.&rdquo; He paused&mdash;and growing cooler in a moment, added,
      with only sarcastic dryness, &ldquo;If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a
      wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no
      greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as
      willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition&mdash;&ldquo;very
      true. That's a consideration indeed.&mdash;But John, as to what I was
      telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more
      to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot
      conceive any difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the
      means of inconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind
      exactly the present line of the path.... The only way of proving it,
      however, will be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey
      to-morrow morning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall
      give me your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend
      Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been attributing
      many of his own feelings and expressions;&mdash;but the soothing
      attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the
      immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the other,
      prevented any renewal of it.

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John
      Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning
      among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over what
      she had done every evening with her father and sister. She had nothing to
      wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. It was a
      delightful visit;&mdash;perfect, in being much too short.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their
      mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,
      there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no
      denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;&mdash;even Mr. Woodhouse
      was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of
      the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he
      could, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses were actually at
      Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on that
      head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long to
      convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the
      only persons invited to meet them;&mdash;the hours were to be early, as
      well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination being
      consulted in every thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that
      Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent by
      Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with a
      cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard,
      Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma called on her the
      next day, and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls. She
      was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard was full of care
      and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill
      and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful
      engagement, though she could not speak of her loss without many tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard's
      unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr.
      Elton's would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at last
      tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a most
      comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had not
      advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she was met by Mr.
      Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly
      together in conversation about the invalid&mdash;of whom he, on the rumour
      of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he might carry
      some report of her to Hartfield&mdash;they were overtaken by Mr. John
      Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest
      boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country
      run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice
      pudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and proceeded
      together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's complaint;&mdash;&ldquo;a
      throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her, a quick,
      low pulse, &amp;c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that
      Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often alarmed her
      with them.&rdquo; Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as he exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sore-throat!&mdash;I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid
      infectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of
      yourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.
      Why does not Perry see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this
      excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience and
      care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she
      could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist than
      not, she added soon afterwards&mdash;as if quite another subject,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so cold, so very cold&mdash;and looks and feels so very much like
      snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I should
      really try not to go out to-day&mdash;and dissuade my father from
      venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the
      cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great a
      disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr. Elton, in
      your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me a little
      hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and what
      fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than common
      prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;
      which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind
      care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her's, he
      had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;&mdash;but Emma,
      too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him
      impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied with
      his muttering acknowledgment of its being &ldquo;very cold, certainly very
      cold,&rdquo; and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls,
      and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour
      of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do quite right,&rdquo; said she;&mdash;&ldquo;we will make your apologies to Mr.
      and Mrs. Weston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly
      offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's only
      objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt
      satisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had his
      broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment; never had
      his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when he next
      looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she to herself, &ldquo;this is most strange!&mdash;After I had got
      him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill
      behind!&mdash;Most strange indeed!&mdash;But there is, I believe, in many
      men, especially single men, such an inclination&mdash;such a passion for
      dining out&mdash;a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their
      pleasures, their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that
      any thing gives way to it&mdash;and this must be the case with Mr. Elton;
      a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in
      love with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine
      out wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see ready
      wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him the
      justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner
      of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while assuring her
      that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her fair friend, the
      last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again, when
      he hoped to be able to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled
      himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his
      favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began
      with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.
      Elton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With men
      he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to please, every
      feature works.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,&rdquo; replied Emma; &ldquo;but where there is a
      wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great deal.
      Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he will have the
      advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect good-temper
      and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, &ldquo;he seems to
      have a great deal of good-will towards you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; she replied with a smile of astonishment, &ldquo;are you imagining me to
      be Mr. Elton's object?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never occurred
      to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Elton in love with me!&mdash;What an idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is so
      or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your manners
      to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better look about
      you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I are
      very good friends, and nothing more;&rdquo; and she walked on, amusing herself
      in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial
      knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high
      pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very well
      pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and in want
      of counsel. He said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in
      spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of shrinking
      from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter
      in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the weather than
      either of the others; too full of the wonder of his own going, and the
      pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold, and too
      well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was severe; and by the time
      the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their
      way down, and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to
      want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The
      preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of his
      children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least, which Mr.
      John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated nothing in the
      visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the whole of their
      drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks
      people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as this, for
      the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most agreeable
      fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest absurdity&mdash;Actually
      snowing at this moment!&mdash;The folly of not allowing people to be
      comfortable at home&mdash;and the folly of people's not staying
      comfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an
      evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we
      should deem it;&mdash;and here are we, probably with rather thinner
      clothing than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in
      defiance of the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to
      his view or his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under
      shelter that he can;&mdash;here are we setting forward to spend five dull
      hours in another man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not
      said and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.
      Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;&mdash;four horses
      and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering
      creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt
      he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the &ldquo;Very true, my love,&rdquo;
       which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion; but
      she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all. She
      could not be complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome; her heroism reached
      only to silence. She allowed him to talk, and arranged the glasses, and
      wrapped herself up, without opening her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. Elton,
      spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma thought with
      pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all obligation and
      cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed, that she
      began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from
      what had reached her. She had sent while dressing, and the answer had
      been, &ldquo;Much the same&mdash;not better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>My</i> report from Mrs. Goddard's,&rdquo; said she presently, &ldquo;was not so
      pleasant as I had hoped&mdash;'Not better' was <i>my</i> answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of sentiment
      as he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no&mdash;I am grieved to find&mdash;I was on the point of telling you
      that when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing
      before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better, by
      no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned&mdash;I had
      flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew
      had been given her in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma smiled and answered&mdash;&ldquo;My visit was of use to the nervous part of
      her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it is
      a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you probably
      heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I imagined&mdash;that is&mdash;I did not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow morning
      will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is impossible not to
      feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadful!&mdash;Exactly so, indeed.&mdash;She will be missed every
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable;
      but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay when only half
      a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things, and in a voice of
      the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an excellent device,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the use of a sheepskin for
      carriages. How very comfortable they make it;&mdash;impossible to feel
      cold with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have
      rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced and
      guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way
      unpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very
      cold afternoon&mdash;but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.&mdash;Ha!
      snows a little I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John Knightley, &ldquo;and I think we shall have a good deal of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christmas weather,&rdquo; observed Mr. Elton. &ldquo;Quite seasonable; and extremely
      fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday, and
      prevent this day's party, which it might very possibly have done, for Mr.
      Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the
      ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite the season indeed
      for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites their friends about
      them, and people think little of even the worst weather. I was snowed up
      at a friend's house once for a week. Nothing could be pleasanter. I went
      for only one night, and could not get away till that very day se'nnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but
      said only, coolly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much
      astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemed
      quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are sure of excellent fires,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;and every thing in the
      greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;&mdash;Mrs. Weston
      indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so
      hospitable, and so fond of society;&mdash;it will be a small party, but
      where small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of
      any. Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten
      comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances,
      fall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me,
      (turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your
      approbation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large
      parties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir&mdash;I never dine
      with any body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had
      been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will be
      paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great enjoyment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My first enjoyment,&rdquo; replied John Knightley, as they passed through the
      sweep-gate, &ldquo;will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked
      into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;&mdash;Mr. Elton must compose his joyous
      looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr. Elton must
      smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the place.&mdash;Emma
      only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as happy as she
      was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons. Mr. Weston was a
      great favourite, and there was not a creature in the world to whom she
      spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she
      related with such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being
      always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs,
      arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself. She
      could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively
      concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication of all those
      little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends, was
      one of the first gratifications of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not afford,
      which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the very
      sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was grateful to
      Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton's
      oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that was
      enjoyable to the utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through before
      her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the
      history of it, besides all the history of his own and Isabella's coming,
      and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just got to the end of his
      satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter, when the others
      appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost wholly engrossed by her
      attentions to him, was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry
      to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her.
      The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards
      Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but was
      continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and
      solicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting
      him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal
      suggestion of &ldquo;Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be possible
      for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to
      me?&mdash;Absurd and insufferable!&rdquo;&mdash;Yet he would be so anxious for
      her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and so
      delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her drawings
      with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a
      would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her good
      manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's, in the
      hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil; but
      it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst the others,
      in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense, which she
      particularly wished to listen to. She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston
      was giving some information about his son; she heard the words &ldquo;my son,&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; and &ldquo;my son,&rdquo; repeated several times over; and, from a few
      other half-syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early
      visit from his son; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was
      so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been
      awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never marrying,
      there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill, which
      always interested her. She had frequently thought&mdash;especially since
      his father's marriage with Miss Taylor&mdash;that if she <i>were</i> to
      marry, he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition.
      He seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her.
      She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them
      must think of. That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it, she was very
      strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him, or by any
      body else, to give up a situation which she believed more replete with
      good than any she could change it for, she had a great curiosity to see
      him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to
      a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being
      coupled in their friends' imaginations.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;
      but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very cross&mdash;and
      of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without
      bringing forward the same information again, or the substance of it, from
      the open-hearted Mr. Weston.&mdash;So it proved;&mdash;for when happily
      released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at dinner, he made use
      of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality, the very first
      leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to her,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to see
      two more here,&mdash;your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my son&mdash;and
      then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not hear me
      telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting Frank. I had
      a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us within a
      fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to
      his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party
      quite complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been wanting to come to us,&rdquo; continued Mr. Weston, &ldquo;ever since
      September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his own
      time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between
      ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices. But
      now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so
      anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off. She
      does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not know the
      parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is&mdash;(but this is quite
      between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room.
      There are secrets in all families, you know)&mdash;The case is, that a
      party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and
      that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. If they are not put
      off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it is a family that a
      certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike
      to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three
      years, they always are put off when it comes to the point. I have not the
      smallest doubt of the issue. I am as confident of seeing Frank here before
      the middle of January, as I am of being here myself: but your good friend
      there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries
      herself, and has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot
      calculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,&rdquo; replied
      Emma; &ldquo;but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he will
      come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been
      at the place in my life.&mdash;She is an odd woman!&mdash;But I never
      allow myself to speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe her
      to be very fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond
      of any body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her
      way&mdash;allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every
      thing to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to
      him, that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say
      it to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in
      general; and the devil of a temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,
      very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy&mdash;yet
      observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.&mdash;
      Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be
      secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of:
      &ldquo;for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as Mr.
      Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr. Weston,
      I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.
      Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Emma!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, &ldquo;what is the certainty of
      caprice?&rdquo; Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending before&mdash;&ldquo;You
      must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means so sure of
      seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father thinks. It
      depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her
      temper. To you&mdash;to my two daughters&mdash;I may venture on the truth.
      Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman; and
      his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,&rdquo; replied Isabella:
      &ldquo;and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest
      compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must be
      dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but it must
      be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she never had any children!
      Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have
      heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve
      which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed, would
      scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her,
      excepting those views on the young man, of which her own imagination had
      already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at present there was
      nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon followed them into the
      drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner, was a confinement that he
      could not endure. Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and
      gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means
      certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant, whenever
      it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even if
      this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that some
      excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine any
      reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the
      Churchills' to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They are jealous
      even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no dependence on
      his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to come,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;If he could stay only a couple of days, he
      ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having it in
      his power to do as much as that. A young <i>woman</i>, if she fall into
      bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she wants to
      be with; but one cannot comprehend a young <i>man</i>'s being under such
      restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if he likes
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before one
      decides upon what he can do,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Weston. &ldquo;One ought to use the
      same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one individual of
      any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must not be judged by
      general rules: <i>she</i> is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives
      way to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite. Now,
      according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, that
      while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she
      owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards <i>him</i>,
      she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes nothing
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand a
      bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way. I
      have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it may
      be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand <i>when</i> it will
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma listened, and then coolly said, &ldquo;I shall not be satisfied, unless he
      comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have a great deal of influence on some points,&rdquo; continued Mrs.
      Weston, &ldquo;and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is
      beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of
      his coming away from them to visit us.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea he
      was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three companions
      could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour, before
      the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty and convivial, and no
      friend to early separations of any sort; but at last the drawing-room
      party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in very good spirits, was
      one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on
      a sofa. He joined them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation,
      seated himself between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the
      expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late
      improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his
      making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most
      friendly smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend&mdash;her
      fair, lovely, amiable friend. &ldquo;Did she know?&mdash;had she heard any thing
      about her, since their being at Randalls?&mdash;he felt much anxiety&mdash;he
      must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.&rdquo;
       And in this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much
      attending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror
      of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he
      were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than on
      Harriet's&mdash;more anxious that she should escape the infection, than
      that there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great
      earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber
      again, for the present&mdash;to entreat her to <i>promise</i> <i>him</i>
      not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his
      opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back
      into its proper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme
      solicitude about her. She was vexed. It did appear&mdash;there was no
      concealing it&mdash;exactly like the pretence of being in love with her,
      instead of Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and
      abominable! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to
      Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance, &ldquo;Would not she give him her
      support?&mdash;would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss
      Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss
      Smith's disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied without a
      promise&mdash;would not she give him her influence in procuring it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So scrupulous for others,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and yet so careless for
      herself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and yet
      will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat
      herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?&mdash;Judge between us. Have not I
      some right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an
      address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of
      first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked and
      offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose.
      She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she thought must
      restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a seat by
      her sister, and giving her all her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did
      another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room
      from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information of
      the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast, with a
      strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir.
      Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through
      a storm of snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else had
      something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized, and
      had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston and Emma
      tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son-in-law,
      who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admired your resolution very much, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in venturing out in
      such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon. Every
      body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit; and I dare
      say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two's snow can hardly
      make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is blown over
      in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand. I
      dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he had
      known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it should
      make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his hurrying away.
      As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede
      their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid they would find no
      difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable, that he might be able
      to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost good-will was sure that
      accommodation might be found for every body, calling on his wife to agree
      with him, that with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged,
      which she hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there being but
      two spare rooms in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done, my dear Emma?&mdash;what is to be done?&rdquo; was Mr.
      Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time. To
      her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her
      representation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of their
      having so many friends about them, revived him a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being
      blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full in
      her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for
      adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was eager
      to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls,
      while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible
      accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better order the carriage directly, my love,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I dare
      say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if we do
      come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at all
      afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my shoes,
      you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that
      gives me cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most
      extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing does
      give you cold. Walk home!&mdash;you are prettily shod for walking home, I
      dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.
      Weston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could not
      so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away; and they
      were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had left the room
      immediately after his brother's first report of the snow, came back again,
      and told them that he had been out of doors to examine, and could answer
      for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home,
      whenever they liked it, either now or an hour hence. He had gone beyond
      the sweep&mdash;some way along the Highbury road&mdash;the snow was
      nowhere above half an inch deep&mdash;in many places hardly enough to
      whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but the
      clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its being soon
      over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there
      being nothing to apprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were
      scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, who was
      immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution
      allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to
      admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls. He was
      satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home, but no
      assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay; and while the
      others were variously urging and recommending, Mr. Knightley and Emma
      settled it in a few brief sentences: thus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready, if the others are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I ring the bell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes more,
      and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own
      house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and
      happiness when this visit of hardship were over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such
      occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr.
      Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of
      alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the
      discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. &ldquo;He was
      afraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella
      would not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind. He
      did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together as
      they could;&rdquo; and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very slow
      and wait for the other carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he did
      not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally; so that
      Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr.
      Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them, and that they were
      to have a tete-a-tete drive. It would not have been the awkwardness of a
      moment, it would have been rather a pleasure, previous to the suspicions
      of this very day; she could have talked to him of Harriet, and the
      three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but one. But now, she would
      rather it had not happened. She believed he had been drinking too much of
      Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he would want to be talking
      nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was
      immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the
      weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had they
      passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she found her
      subject cut up&mdash;her hand seized&mdash;her attention demanded, and Mr.
      Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the
      precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well
      known, hoping&mdash;fearing&mdash;adoring&mdash;ready to die if she
      refused him; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and
      unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some
      effect, and in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as
      soon as possible. It really was so. Without scruple&mdash;without apology&mdash;without
      much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing
      himself <i>her</i> lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go
      on, and say it all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her
      resolve to restrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this
      folly must be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong
      only to the passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and
      the playful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she
      replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to <i>me</i>! you forget
      yourself&mdash;you take me for my friend&mdash;any message to Miss Smith I
      shall be happy to deliver; but no more of this to <i>me</i>, if you
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Smith!&mdash;message to Miss Smith!&mdash;What could she possibly
      mean!&rdquo;&mdash;And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such
      boastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with
      quickness,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account for
      it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak either to
      me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough to say no
      more, and I will endeavour to forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at
      all to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and
      having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and
      slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,&mdash;but
      acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,&mdash;he
      resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a
      favourable answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his inconstancy
      and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself too
      clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express.
      After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last month, to Miss
      Smith&mdash;such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing&mdash;to
      be addressing me in this manner&mdash;this is an unsteadiness of
      character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me, sir, I
      am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such professions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; cried Mr. Elton, &ldquo;what can be the meaning of this?&mdash;Miss
      Smith!&mdash;I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my
      existence&mdash;never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never
      cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has
      fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very sorry&mdash;extremely
      sorry&mdash;But, Miss Smith, indeed!&mdash;Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who can
      think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my honour,
      there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of you. I
      protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else. Every
      thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has been with the
      sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot really,
      seriously, doubt it. No!&mdash;(in an accent meant to be insinuating)&mdash;I
      am sure you have seen and understood me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this&mdash;which
      of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely
      overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence
      being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he tried
      to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence.
      It confesses that you have long understood me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; cried Emma, &ldquo;it confesses no such thing. So far from having
      long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect to
      your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you
      should have been giving way to any feelings&mdash;Nothing could be farther
      from my wishes&mdash;your attachment to my friend Harriet&mdash;your
      pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have
      been very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were
      not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you
      judged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you
      have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?&mdash;that
      you have never thought seriously of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, madam,&rdquo; cried he, affronted in his turn: &ldquo;never, I assure you. <i>I</i>
      think seriously of Miss Smith!&mdash;Miss Smith is a very good sort of
      girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her
      extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object to&mdash;Every
      body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think, quite so much
      at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance, as to be
      addressing myself to Miss Smith!&mdash;No, madam, my visits to Hartfield
      have been for yourself only; and the encouragement I received&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Encouragement!&mdash;I give you encouragement!&mdash;Sir, you have been
      entirely mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of
      my friend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common
      acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake ends
      where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might have
      been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware, probably,
      any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you are so
      sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I trust,
      will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite
      supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually deep
      mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer, for the
      fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If there had not
      been so much anger, there would have been desperate awkwardness; but their
      straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of
      embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage
      Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves, all at once, at the door
      of his house; and he was out before another syllable passed.&mdash;Emma
      then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night. The compliment was
      just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of
      spirits, she was then conveyed to Hartfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who had
      been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane&mdash;turning
      a corner which he could never bear to think of&mdash;and in strange hands&mdash;a
      mere common coachman&mdash;no James; and there it seemed as if her return
      only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr. John Knightley,
      ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and attention; and so
      particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father, as to seem&mdash;if
      not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel&mdash;perfectly sensible
      of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the day was concluding in peace
      and comfort to all their little party, except herself.&mdash;But her mind
      had never been in such perturbation; and it needed a very strong effort to
      appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed
      her the relief of quiet reflection.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think
      and be miserable.&mdash;It was a wretched business indeed!&mdash;Such an
      overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!&mdash;Such a
      development of every thing most unwelcome!&mdash;Such a blow for Harriet!&mdash;that
      was the worst of all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of
      some sort or other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light;
      and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken&mdash;more
      in error&mdash;more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was,
      could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne
      any thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me&mdash;but poor
      Harriet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How she could have been so deceived!&mdash;He protested that he had never
      thought seriously of Harriet&mdash;never! She looked back as well as she
      could; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she supposed,
      and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must have been
      unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so misled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture!&mdash;How eager he had been about the picture!&mdash;and the
      charade!&mdash;and an hundred other circumstances;&mdash;how clearly they
      had seemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its &ldquo;ready
      wit&rdquo;&mdash;but then the &ldquo;soft eyes&rdquo;&mdash;in fact it suited neither; it
      was a jumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such
      thick-headed nonsense?
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to
      herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere
      error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others that
      he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the gentleness
      of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but, till this very
      day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but
      grateful respect to her as Harriet's friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject,
      for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying that those
      brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley had once said
      to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, the conviction he had
      professed that Mr. Elton would never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to
      think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn
      than any she had reached herself. It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr.
      Elton was proving himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she
      had meant and believed him; proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his
      own claims, and little concerned about the feelings of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay his
      addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his
      proposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment, and
      was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the
      arrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was
      perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be
      cared for. There had been no real affection either in his language or
      manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could
      hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less
      allied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him. He only
      wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse of
      Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so easily
      obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with
      twenty, or with ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      But&mdash;that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as
      aware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry
      him!&mdash;should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!&mdash;look
      down upon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below
      him, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no
      presumption in addressing her!&mdash;It was most provoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her
      inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of such
      equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that in
      fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must know that
      the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield, the
      younger branch of a very ancient family&mdash;and that the Eltons were
      nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable,
      being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all the
      rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources, was such
      as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself, in every other
      kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the
      consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not
      two years ago, to make his way as he could, without any alliances but in
      trade, or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his
      civility.&mdash;But he had fancied her in love with him; that evidently
      must have been his dependence; and after raving a little about the seeming
      incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head, Emma was obliged in
      common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so
      complaisant and obliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing
      her real motive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation
      and delicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided
      favourite. If <i>she</i> had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had
      little right to wonder that <i>he</i>, with self-interest to blind him,
      should have mistaken hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was
      wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It
      was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought to
      be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite concerned
      and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here have I,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;actually talked poor Harriet into being very
      much attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for me;
      and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had not
      assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I used
      to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to
      accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done of me;
      but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and chance. I
      was introducing her into good company, and giving her the opportunity of
      pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have attempted more. But
      now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time. I have been but half a
      friend to her; and if she were <i>not</i> to feel this disappointment so
      very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at
      all desirable for her;&mdash;William Coxe&mdash;Oh! no, I could not endure
      William Coxe&mdash;a pert young lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a more
      serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be, and
      must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet, and all
      that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of future
      meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the
      acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding
      eclat, were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time
      longer, and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the
      conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under temporary
      gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of
      spirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy, and
      of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep
      the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of softened
      pain and brighter hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to
      bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to depend
      on getting tolerably out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love
      with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint
      him&mdash;that Harriet's nature should not be of that superior sort in
      which the feelings are most acute and retentive&mdash;and that there could
      be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except the three
      principals, and especially for her father's being given a moment's
      uneasiness about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow
      on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome that
      might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she could
      not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter
      attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving
      unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered with snow, and
      the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw, which is of
      all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in
      rain or snow, and every evening setting in to freeze, she was for many
      days a most honourable prisoner. No intercourse with Harriet possible but
      by note; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and
      no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's absenting himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though
      she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or
      other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his
      being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir out; and to hear him
      say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely from them,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These days of confinement would have been, but for her private
      perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited her
      brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his
      companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his ill-humour
      at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his
      stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and obliging, and speaking
      pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes of cheerfulness, and all
      the present comfort of delay, there was still such an evil hanging over
      her in the hour of explanation with Harriet, as made it impossible for
      Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. The
      weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.
      Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind
      with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party set off, and
      return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella;&mdash;which
      poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doated on, full of their
      merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently busy, might have been
      a model of right feminine happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr.
      Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with Mr.
      Elton's best compliments, &ldquo;that he was proposing to leave Highbury the
      following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance with the
      pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few weeks,
      and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from various
      circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal leave of Mr.
      Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful
      sense&mdash;and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be happy to attend
      to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was most agreeably surprized.&mdash;Mr. Elton's absence just at this
      time was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contriving it,
      though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was
      announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a
      civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded. She had
      not even a share in his opening compliments.&mdash;Her name was not
      mentioned;&mdash;and there was so striking a change in all this, and such
      an ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments,
      as she thought, at first, could not escape her father's suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did, however.&mdash;Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of
      so sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely
      to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language. It was a
      very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and
      conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse talked
      over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all
      her usual promptitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She had reason to
      believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that she
      should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other
      complaint before the gentleman's return. She went to Mrs. Goddard's
      accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary penance of
      communication; and a severe one it was.&mdash;She had to destroy all the
      hopes which she had been so industriously feeding&mdash;to appear in the
      ungracious character of the one preferred&mdash;and acknowledge herself
      grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all her
      observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last six
      weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The confession completely renewed her first shame&mdash;and the sight of
      Harriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity with
      herself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet bore the intelligence very well&mdash;blaming nobody&mdash;and in
      every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly
      opinion of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that
      moment to her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost; and
      all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on Harriet's
      side, not her own. Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to
      complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too
      great a distinction.&mdash;She never could have deserved him&mdash;and
      nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have
      thought it possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tears fell abundantly&mdash;but her grief was so truly artless, that
      no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes&mdash;and
      she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and
      understanding&mdash;really for the time convinced that Harriet was the
      superior creature of the two&mdash;and that to resemble her would be more
      for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence
      could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and
      ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of
      being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of her
      life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father's claims, was to
      promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her own affection in
      some better method than by match-making. She got her to Hartfield, and
      shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and amuse her,
      and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she
      could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general,
      and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in
      particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet's age, and
      with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be made
      towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, as to
      allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance,
      without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence of
      any body equal to him in person or goodness&mdash;and did, in truth, prove
      herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it
      appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an inclination
      of that sort <i>unrequited</i>, that she could not comprehend its
      continuing very long in equal force.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and
      indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not
      imagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the
      recollection of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for
      each, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or of
      effecting any material change of society. They must encounter each other,
      and make the best of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs.
      Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great
      girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have
      any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent
      truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be found if
      anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of cure, there
      could be no true peace for herself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs.
      Weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For
      the present, he could not be spared, to his &ldquo;very great mortification and
      regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at
      no distant period.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed&mdash;much more disappointed, in
      fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man had
      been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever expecting
      more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by any
      proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure, and
      begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry;
      but then he began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three months
      later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather;
      and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably longer
      with them than if he had come sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a more
      apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and
      delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer,
      suffered a great deal more herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr.
      Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls. The
      acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted, rather, to be
      quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she
      should appear, in general, like her usual self, she took care to express
      as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr. and
      Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturally belong to their
      friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite as
      much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather more,) at
      the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then proceeded to
      say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of such an addition
      to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody
      new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the sight of him would have
      made; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again, found herself
      directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great
      amusement, perceived that she was taking the other side of the question
      from her real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Churchills are very likely in fault,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley, coolly;
      &ldquo;but I dare say he might come if he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come; but
      his uncle and aunt will not spare him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a point
      of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose
      him such an unnatural creature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that
      he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very little for
      any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who have always set
      him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural than one could
      wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud, luxurious, and
      selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too. If Frank Churchill
      had wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it between September
      and January. A man at his age&mdash;what is he?&mdash;three or
      four-and-twenty&mdash;cannot be without the means of doing as much as
      that. It is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your own
      master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the
      difficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers to
      manage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty should
      not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want money&mdash;he
      cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so much of
      both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the
      kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or other. A little
      while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can leave the
      Churchills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sometimes he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever there
      is any temptation of pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate
      knowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior of
      a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family
      may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill's
      temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do. He may,
      at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and
      that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and
      resolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention to his
      father. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he
      wished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at
      once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill&mdash;'Every sacrifice of
      mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience;
      but I must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by my
      failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. I shall,
      therefore, set off to-morrow.'&mdash;If he would say so to her at once, in
      the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no opposition made to
      his going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Emma, laughing; &ldquo;but perhaps there might be some made to his
      coming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to
      use!&mdash;Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But
      you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite
      to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the
      uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for him!&mdash;Standing
      up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as loud as he could!&mdash;How
      can you imagine such conduct practicable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it. He
      would feel himself in the right; and the declaration&mdash;made, of
      course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner&mdash;would do
      him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the people
      he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do.
      Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that they could trust
      him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father, would do rightly
      by them; for they know, as well as he does, as well as all the world must
      know, that he ought to pay this visit to his father; and while meanly
      exerting their power to delay it, are in their hearts not thinking the
      better of him for submitting to their whims. Respect for right conduct is
      felt by every body. If he would act in this sort of manner, on principle,
      consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend to his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but where
      little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they have a knack
      of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones. I can
      imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were to be transported
      and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's situation, you would be
      able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him; and it
      might have a very good effect. The Churchills might not have a word to say
      in return; but then, you would have no habits of early obedience and long
      observance to break through. To him who has, it might not be so easy to
      burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set all their claims on
      his gratitude and regard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what
      would be right, as you can have, without being so equal, under particular
      circumstances, to act up to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal
      exertion, it could not be an equal conviction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to
      understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly
      opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first
      occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will
      of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of
      following his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for the
      fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he ought to
      have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their
      authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to
      make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there would have
      been no difficulty now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall never agree about him,&rdquo; cried Emma; &ldquo;but that is nothing
      extraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man: I
      feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly, though
      in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding, complying,
      mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's perfection. I dare
      say he has; and though it may cut him off from some advantages, it will
      secure him many others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of
      leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely
      expert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine
      flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade
      himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of
      preserving peace at home and preventing his father's having any right to
      complain. His letters disgust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a
      woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother's place,
      but without a mother's affection to blind her. It is on her account that
      attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly feel the
      omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he would have come
      I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he did or no. Can you
      think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations? Do you
      suppose she does not often say all this to herself? No, Emma, your amiable
      young man can be amiable only in French, not in English. He may be very
      'amiable,' have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he can have
      no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people: nothing really
      amiable about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem determined to think ill of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&mdash;not at all,&rdquo; replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; &ldquo;I do
      not want to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his
      merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely
      personal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth, plausible
      manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure at
      Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and
      agreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the
      bargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a <i>sensation</i> his
      coming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the parishes
      of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest&mdash;one object of curiosity;
      it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak of nobody
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him conversable,
      I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a chattering
      coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of
      every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally
      agreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;
      and so on to every body, having that general information on all subjects
      which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead, just as
      propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each; that is my
      idea of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley warmly, &ldquo;is, that if he turn out any thing
      like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What! at
      three-and-twenty to be the king of his company&mdash;the great man&mdash;the
      practised politician, who is to read every body's character, and make
      every body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to be
      dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like fools
      compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could not endure
      such a puppy when it came to the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say no more about him,&rdquo; cried Emma, &ldquo;you turn every thing to evil.
      We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no chance of
      agreeing till he is really here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love for
      Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately talk
      of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should be angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a
      different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of
      mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the
      high opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge, she had
      never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit
      of another.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma's
      opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could not
      think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more; and she was
      therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;&mdash;but
      it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded, and after speaking
      some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, and receiving no other
      answer than a very plaintive&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!&rdquo; she
      found something else must be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates. She
      determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was always
      sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be
      called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed
      ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in that respect, and
      as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart, as
      to her deficiency&mdash;but none were equal to counteract the persuasion
      of its being very disagreeable,&mdash;a waste of time&mdash;tiresome women&mdash;and
      all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and
      third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and therefore
      she seldom went near them. But now she made the sudden resolution of not
      passing their door without going in&mdash;observing, as she proposed it to
      Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were just now quite
      safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied the
      drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment, which
      was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and even
      gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her knitting was
      seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up her place to Miss
      Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter, almost ready to
      overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit, solicitude
      for their shoes, anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse's health, cheerful
      communications about her mother's, and sweet-cake from the beaufet&mdash;&ldquo;Mrs.
      Cole had just been there, just called in for ten minutes, and had been so
      good as to sit an hour with them, and <i>she</i> had taken a piece of cake
      and been so kind as to say she liked it very much; and, therefore, she
      hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a
      piece too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.
      There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton
      since his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the letter
      over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much he was
      engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he went, and how
      full the Master of the Ceremonies' ball had been; and she went through it
      very well, with all the interest and all the commendation that could be
      requisite, and always putting forward to prevent Harriet's being obliged
      to say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant,
      having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by any
      troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and
      Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She had not been prepared to
      have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was actually hurried off by
      Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles, to
      usher in a letter from her niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes&mdash;Mr. Elton, I understand&mdash;certainly as to dancing&mdash;Mrs.
      Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was&mdash;Mrs. Cole
      was so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as
      she came in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great a
      favourite there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to
      shew her kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as
      any body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, 'I
      know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time
      for writing;' and when I immediately said, 'But indeed we have, we had a
      letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more
      surprized. 'Have you, upon your honour?' said she; 'well, that is quite
      unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I hope
      she is well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. You are so kind!&rdquo; replied the happily deceived aunt, while
      eagerly hunting for the letter.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! here it is. I was sure it could
      not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without being
      aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very lately
      that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it to Mrs.
      Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my mother, for it
      is such a pleasure to her&mdash;a letter from Jane&mdash;that she can
      never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it
      is, only just under my huswife&mdash;and since you are so kind as to wish
      to hear what she says;&mdash;but, first of all, I really must, in justice
      to Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letter&mdash;only two pages
      you see&mdash;hardly two&mdash;and in general she fills the whole paper
      and crosses half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.
      She often says, when the letter is first opened, 'Well, Hetty, now I think
      you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'&mdash;don't you,
      ma'am?&mdash;And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make it
      out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her&mdash;every word of it&mdash;I
      am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word. And,
      indeed, though my mother's eyes are not so good as they were, she can see
      amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is such a
      blessing! My mother's are really very good indeed. Jane often says, when
      she is here, 'I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to
      see as you do&mdash;and so much fine work as you have done too!&mdash;I
      only wish my eyes may last me as well.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath; and
      Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax's
      handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are extremely kind,&rdquo; replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; &ldquo;you who
      are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure there is
      nobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse's.
      My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know. Ma'am,&rdquo; addressing
      her, &ldquo;do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane's
      handwriting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated
      twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She was
      pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very
      rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had almost
      resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss
      Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother's deafness is very trifling you see&mdash;just nothing at all.
      By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,
      she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very
      remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me. Jane
      speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at all deafer
      than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my mother's
      time of life&mdash;and it really is full two years, you know, since she
      was here. We never were so long without seeing her before, and as I was
      telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&mdash;that must be a very great pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so surprized;
      and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she will be as
      happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see her. Yes,
      Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel Campbell will be
      wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So very good of them to
      send her the whole way! But they always do, you know. Oh yes, Friday or
      Saturday next. That is what she writes about. That is the reason of her
      writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should
      not have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my
      hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been for
      this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My mother
      is so delighted!&mdash;for she is to be three months with us at least.
      Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the pleasure
      of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells are going to
      Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and
      see her directly. They had not intended to go over till the summer, but
      she is so impatient to see them again&mdash;for till she married, last
      October, she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make
      it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say, but
      however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her
      mother&mdash;or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but we
      shall see presently in Jane's letter&mdash;wrote in Mr. Dixon's name as
      well as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would give
      them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country seat,
      Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great deal of its
      beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean&mdash;I do not know that she ever heard
      about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know, that he
      should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses&mdash;and
      as Jane used to be very often walking out with them&mdash;for Colonel and
      Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter's not walking out
      often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them; of course
      she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home
      in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some
      drawings of the place, views that he had taken himself. He is a most
      amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane was quite longing to go to
      Ireland, from his account of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma's brain
      with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not going to
      Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther discovery,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to
      come to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship
      between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be
      excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been
      rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a
      distance from us, for months together&mdash;not able to come if any thing
      was to happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want
      her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs.
      Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing than
      their <i>joint</i> invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr.
      Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is a most
      charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth,
      when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden
      whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have been
      dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not,
      with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit&mdash; (I can
      never think of it without trembling!)&mdash;But ever since we had the
      history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish of seeing
      Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel
      and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should
      recommend; and indeed they particularly <i>wish</i> her to try her native
      air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs. Dixon
      must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no
      remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be compared
      with Miss Fairfax.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things&mdash;but certainly not.
      There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was absolutely
      plain&mdash;but extremely elegant and amiable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November,
      (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since. A long
      time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never mentioned it
      before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so considerate!&mdash;But
      however, she is so far from well, that her kind friends the Campbells
      think she had better come home, and try an air that always agrees with
      her; and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will
      entirely cure her&mdash;and it is certainly a great deal better that she
      should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is unwell. Nobody could nurse
      her, as we should do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells
      leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following&mdash;as you will
      find from Jane's letter. So sudden!&mdash;You may guess, dear Miss
      Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the
      drawback of her illness&mdash;but I am afraid we must expect to see her
      grown thin, and looking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing
      happened to me, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane's
      letters through to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother,
      you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane
      desired me to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual
      caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than
      I burst out, quite frightened, with 'Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'&mdash;which
      my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed at.
      However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied
      at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does not think
      much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my guard. If
      Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The expense shall
      not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I
      dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could
      not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and family to maintain,
      and is not to be giving away his time. Well, now I have just given you a
      hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure
      she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid we must be running away,&rdquo; said Emma, glancing at Harriet, and
      beginning to rise&mdash;&ldquo;My father will be expecting us. I had no
      intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes,
      when I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not pass
      the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so pleasantly
      detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She regained the
      street&mdash;happy in this, that though much had been forced on her
      against her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane
      Fairfax's letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the &mdash;&mdash;regiment of infantry,
      and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and
      interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance
      of him dying in action abroad&mdash;of his widow sinking under consumption
      and grief soon afterwards&mdash;and this girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      By birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on losing
      her mother, she became the property, the charge, the consolation, the
      foundling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every probability
      of her being permanently fixed there; of her being taught only what very
      limited means could command, and growing up with no advantages of
      connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what nature had given her in
      a pleasing person, good understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning
      relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to
      her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded
      Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and
      farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe
      camp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claims which he
      did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the death of
      poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing in his power.
      When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice of her. He was
      a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about Jane's age: and
      Jane became their guest, paying them long visits and growing a favourite
      with all; and before she was nine years old, his daughter's great fondness
      for her, and his own wish of being a real friend, united to produce an
      offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her
      education. It was accepted; and from that period Jane had belonged to
      Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them entirely, only visiting
      her grandmother from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the very
      few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence
      impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell's
      power; for though his income, by pay and appointments, was handsome, his
      fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter's; but, by giving her an
      education, he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence
      hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Jane Fairfax's history. She had fallen into good hands, known
      nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent
      education. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people,
      her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and
      culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in London, every lighter
      talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate
      masters. Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that
      friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far as such
      an early age can be qualified for the care of children, fully competent to
      the office of instruction herself; but she was too much beloved to be
      parted with. Neither father nor mother could promote, and the daughter
      could not endure it. The evil day was put off. It was easy to decide that
      she was still too young; and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another
      daughter, in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a
      judicious mixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the
      future, the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind
      her that all this might soon be over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in
      particular, was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of
      Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements. That nature
      had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman, nor could
      her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents. They continued
      together with unabated regard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell,
      who by that chance, that luck which so often defies anticipation in
      matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to
      what is superior, engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich
      and agreeable, almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly
      and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.
    </p>
    <p>
      This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be yet
      attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of
      duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed
      on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the
      period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she had resolved at
      one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from all the
      pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peace and hope,
      to penance and mortification for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a
      resolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no exertions
      would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and for their own
      comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this would be
      selfishness:&mdash;what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps they
      began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the
      temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of
      ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still, however, affection
      was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the
      wretched moment. She had never been quite well since the time of their
      daughter's marriage; and till she should have completely recovered her
      usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far
      from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed,
      under the most favourable circumstances, to require something more than
      human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her
      aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not
      told. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury;
      to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with those kind
      relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells, whatever might
      be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or treble, gave the
      arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a
      few months spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health, than
      on any thing else. Certain it was that she was to come; and that Highbury,
      instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised
      it&mdash;Mr. Frank Churchill&mdash;must put up for the present with Jane
      Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two years' absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma was sorry;&mdash;to have to pay civilities to a person she did not
      like through three long months!&mdash;to be always doing more than she
      wished, and less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might
      be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was
      because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she
      wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly
      refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which her
      conscience could not quite acquit her. But &ldquo;she could never get acquainted
      with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and
      reserve&mdash;such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not&mdash;and
      then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!&mdash;and she was made such a
      fuss with by every body!&mdash;and it had been always imagined that they
      were to be so intimate&mdash;because their ages were the same, every body
      had supposed they must be so fond of each other.&rdquo; These were her reasons&mdash;she
      had no better.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dislike so little just&mdash;every imputed fault was so magnified
      by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any
      considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and now,
      when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years' interval,
      she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners, which
      for those two whole years she had been depreciating. Jane Fairfax was very
      elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself the highest value for
      elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as almost every body would
      think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her figure particularly
      graceful; her size a most becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a
      slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of
      the two. Emma could not but feel all this; and then, her face&mdash;her
      features&mdash;there was more beauty in them altogether than she had
      remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty. Her eyes,
      a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied
      their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at, as
      wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller
      bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was the reigning
      character, and as such, she must, in honour, by all her principles, admire
      it:&mdash;elegance, which, whether of person or of mind, she saw so little
      in Highbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction, and merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with
      twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering
      justice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When
      she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;
      when she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she was
      going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible to
      feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every
      well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly
      probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so
      naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more pitiable
      or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on. Emma was very
      willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon's actions from his
      wife, or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at
      first. If it were love, it might be simple, single, successless love on
      her side alone. She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad
      poison, while a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the
      best, the purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit to
      Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his
      connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings, as
      made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury afforded no
      young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she could wish to
      scheme about for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were charming feelings&mdash;but not lasting. Before she had
      committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane
      Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors,
      than saying to Mr. Knightley, &ldquo;She certainly is handsome; she is better
      than handsome!&rdquo; Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her
      grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual
      state. Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome as ever;
      more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration
      of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how
      little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of
      mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new
      workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again. They
      had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which
      necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air of
      greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior
      performance. She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so cold, so
      cautious! There was no getting at her real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of
      politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing. She was disgustingly,
      was suspiciously reserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved on
      the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed bent on
      giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her own value for
      his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It was all
      general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished.
      It did her no service however. Her caution was thrown away. Emma saw its
      artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There probably <i>was</i>
      something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had
      been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only to
      Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchill
      had been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a
      little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma
      procure as to what he truly was. &ldquo;Was he handsome?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;She believed he
      was reckoned a very fine young man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Was he agreeable?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He was
      generally thought so.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did he appear a sensible young man; a young man of
      information?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;At a watering-place, or in a common London
      acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were all
      that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than they
      had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his manners
      pleasing.&rdquo; Emma could not forgive her.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emma could not forgive her;&mdash;but as neither provocation nor
      resentment were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and
      had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was
      expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with Mr.
      Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might have
      done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough to be
      very intelligible to Emma. He had been used to think her unjust to Jane,
      and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very pleasant evening,&rdquo; he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been
      talked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers
      swept away;&mdash;&ldquo;particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us
      some very good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than
      sitting at one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young
      women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure
      Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing
      undone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument at
      her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy you approved,&rdquo; said Emma, smiling; &ldquo;but I hope I am not often
      deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; said her father instantly; &ldquo;<i>that</i> I am sure you are
      not. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any thing,
      you are too attentive. The muffin last night&mdash;if it had been handed
      round once, I think it would have been enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; &ldquo;you are not often
      deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I think
      you understand me, therefore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An arch look expressed&mdash;&ldquo;I understand you well enough;&rdquo; but she said
      only, &ldquo;Miss Fairfax is reserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always told you she was&mdash;a little; but you will soon overcome all
      that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its
      foundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be honoured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think her diffident. I do not see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Emma,&rdquo; said he, moving from his chair into one close by her, &ldquo;you
      are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and
      amused to think how little information I obtained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am disappointed,&rdquo; was his only answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope every body had a pleasant evening,&rdquo; said Mr. Woodhouse, in his
      quiet way. &ldquo;I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I moved
      back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me. Miss
      Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though she
      speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates
      too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a
      very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved
      young lady indeed. She must have found the evening agreeable, Mr.
      Knightley, because she had Emma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the present,
      said, and with a sincerity which no one could question&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from. I
      am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to
      express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose thoughts
      were on the Bates's, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a
      great pity indeed! and I have often wished&mdash;but it is so little one
      can venture to do&mdash;small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon&mdash;Now
      we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg;
      it is very small and delicate&mdash;Hartfield pork is not like any other
      pork&mdash;but still it is pork&mdash;and, my dear Emma, unless one could
      be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried,
      without the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear
      roast pork&mdash;I think we had better send the leg&mdash;do not you think
      so, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.
      There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and
      the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but
      that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it is
      not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle boils
      ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a little
      carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emma,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley presently, &ldquo;I have a piece of news for you. You
      like news&mdash;and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will
      interest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?&mdash;why do you smile so?&mdash;where
      did you hear it?&mdash;at Randalls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had time only to say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,&rdquo; when the door was
      thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Full of
      thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest. Mr.
      Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that not another
      syllable of communication could rest with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse&mdash;I
      come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! You are
      too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so
      completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a little
      blush, at the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is my news:&mdash;I thought it would interest you,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what
      had passed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where could <i>you</i> hear it?&rdquo; cried Miss Bates. &ldquo;Where could you
      possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I
      received Mrs. Cole's note&mdash;no, it cannot be more than five&mdash;or
      at least ten&mdash;for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to
      come out&mdash;I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork&mdash;Jane
      was standing in the passage&mdash;were not you, Jane?&mdash;for my mother
      was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I
      would go down and see, and Jane said, 'Shall I go down instead? for I
      think you have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'&mdash;'Oh!
      my dear,' said I&mdash;well, and just then came the note. A Miss Hawkins&mdash;that's
      all I know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley, how could you
      possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it,
      she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had just read
      Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! that is quite&mdash;I suppose there never was a piece of news more
      generally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My
      mother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousand
      thanks, and says you really quite oppress her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We consider our Hartfield pork,&rdquo; replied Mr. Woodhouse&mdash;&ldquo;indeed it
      certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I cannot
      have a greater pleasure than&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to us.
      If ever there were people who, without having great wealth themselves, had
      every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us. We may well say that
      'our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.' Well, Mr. Knightley, and so you
      actually saw the letter; well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was short&mdash;merely to announce&mdash;but cheerful, exulting, of
      course.&rdquo;&mdash; Here was a sly glance at Emma. &ldquo;He had been so fortunate
      as to&mdash;I forget the precise words&mdash;one has no business to
      remember them. The information was, as you state, that he was going to be
      married to a Miss Hawkins. By his style, I should imagine it just
      settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Elton going to be married!&rdquo; said Emma, as soon as she could speak.
      &ldquo;He will have every body's wishes for his happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very young to settle,&rdquo; was Mr. Woodhouse's observation. &ldquo;He had
      better not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as he was. We were
      always glad to see him at Hartfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!&rdquo; said Miss Bates, joyfully;
      &ldquo;my mother is so pleased!&mdash;she says she cannot bear to have the poor
      old Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed. Jane, you
      have never seen Mr. Elton!&mdash;no wonder that you have such a curiosity
      to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to
      occupy her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I have never seen Mr. Elton,&rdquo; she replied, starting on this
      appeal; &ldquo;is he&mdash;is he a tall man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who shall answer that question?&rdquo; cried Emma. &ldquo;My father would say 'yes,'
      Mr. Knightley 'no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium.
      When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax, you will understand
      that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury, both in person
      and mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best young man&mdash;But,
      my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he was precisely the
      height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,&mdash;I dare say, an excellent young
      woman. His extreme attention to my mother&mdash;wanting her to sit in the
      vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my mother is a little
      deaf, you know&mdash;it is not much, but she does not hear quite quick.
      Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He fancied bathing might
      be good for it&mdash;the warm bath&mdash;but she says it did him no
      lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel. And Mr.
      Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him. It is such a
      happiness when good people get together&mdash;and they always do. Now,
      here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such
      very good people; and the Perrys&mdash;I suppose there never was a happier
      or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,&rdquo; turning to Mr.
      Woodhouse, &ldquo;I think there are few places with such society as Highbury. I
      always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.&mdash;My dear sir, if
      there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is pork&mdash;a
      roast loin of pork&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted
      with her,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;nothing I suppose can be known. One feels that it
      cannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings, Emma
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are silent, Miss Fairfax&mdash;but I hope you mean to take an
      interest in this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of
      late on these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss
      Campbell's account&mdash;we shall not excuse your being indifferent about
      Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I have seen Mr. Elton,&rdquo; replied Jane, &ldquo;I dare say I shall be
      interested&mdash;but I believe it requires <i>that</i> with me. And as it
      is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little
      worn off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,&rdquo;
       said Miss Bates, &ldquo;four weeks yesterday.&mdash;A Miss Hawkins!&mdash;Well,
      I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts; not
      that I ever&mdash;Mrs. Cole once whispered to me&mdash;but I immediately
      said, 'No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man&mdash;but'&mdash;In short,
      I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries. I do
      not pretend to it. What is before me, I see. At the same time, nobody
      could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired&mdash;Miss Woodhouse lets me
      chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not offend for the
      world. How does Miss Smith do? She seems quite recovered now. Have you
      heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately? Oh! those dear little children.
      Jane, do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley. I mean
      in person&mdash;tall, and with that sort of look&mdash;and not very
      talkative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand. One
      takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is not,
      strictly speaking, handsome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handsome! Oh! no&mdash;far from it&mdash;certainly plain. I told you he
      was plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain, and
      that you yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard, I
      always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the general
      opinion, when I called him plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather does
      not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my dear
      Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a most
      agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's; but
      I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home directly&mdash;I
      would not have you out in a shower!&mdash;We think she is the better for
      Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not attempt calling on
      Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares for any thing but <i>boiled</i>
      pork: when we dress the leg it will be another thing. Good morning to you,
      my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is coming too. Well, that is so very!&mdash;I
      am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to give her your arm.&mdash;Mr.
      Elton, and Miss Hawkins!&mdash;Good morning to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while he
      lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry&mdash;and to
      marry strangers too&mdash;and the other half she could give to her own
      view of the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece
      of news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but she
      was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it&mdash;and all that she could
      hope was, by giving the first information herself, to save her from
      hearing it abruptly from others. It was now about the time that she was
      likely to call. If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!&mdash;and upon
      its beginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would
      be detaining her at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would
      undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,
      when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which hurrying
      thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the &ldquo;Oh! Miss Woodhouse,
      what do you think has happened!&rdquo; which instantly burst forth, had all the
      evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow was given, Emma felt
      that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening; and
      Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had to tell. &ldquo;She had set
      out from Mrs. Goddard's half an hour ago&mdash;she had been afraid it
      would rain&mdash;she had been afraid it would pour down every moment&mdash;but
      she thought she might get to Hartfield first&mdash;she had hurried on as
      fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the house where a young
      woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just step in and
      see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment
      there, soon after she came out it began to rain, and she did not know what
      to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as she could, and took shelter at
      Ford's.&rdquo;&mdash;Ford's was the principal woollen-draper, linen-draper, and
      haberdasher's shop united; the shop first in size and fashion in the
      place.&mdash;&ldquo;And so, there she had set, without an idea of any thing in
      the world, full ten minutes, perhaps&mdash;when, all of a sudden, who
      should come in&mdash;to be sure it was so very odd!&mdash;but they always
      dealt at Ford's&mdash;who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her
      brother!&mdash;Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I thought I should have
      fainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting near the door&mdash;Elizabeth
      saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the umbrella. I am sure
      she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took no notice; and they
      both went to quite the farther end of the shop; and I kept sitting near
      the door!&mdash;Oh! dear; I was so miserable! I am sure I must have been
      as white as my gown. I could not go away you know, because of the rain;
      but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there.&mdash;Oh! dear,
      Miss Woodhouse&mdash;well, at last, I fancy, he looked round and saw me;
      for instead of going on with her buyings, they began whispering to one
      another. I am sure they were talking of me; and I could not help thinking
      that he was persuading her to speak to me&mdash;(do you think he was, Miss
      Woodhouse?)&mdash;for presently she came forward&mdash;came quite up to
      me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands, if I would.
      She did not do any of it in the same way that she used; I could see she
      was altered; but, however, she seemed to <i>try</i> to be very friendly,
      and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no more what I
      said&mdash;I was in such a tremble!&mdash;I remember she said she was
      sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear, Miss
      Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning to
      hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting
      away&mdash;and then&mdash;only think!&mdash;I found he was coming up
      towards me too&mdash;slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what
      to do; and so he came and spoke, and I answered&mdash;and I stood for a
      minute, feeling dreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took
      courage, and said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I
      had not got three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say,
      if I was going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr.
      Cole's stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain.
      Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I said, I was
      very much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and then he went
      back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables&mdash;I believe I did&mdash;but
      I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I
      would rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know, there
      was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so
      kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and make me
      comfortable again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in her
      power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughly
      comfortable herself. The young man's conduct, and his sister's, seemed the
      result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harriet
      described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection
      and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believed them to be
      well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this make in
      the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed by it. Of course,
      he must be sorry to lose her&mdash;they must be all sorry. Ambition, as
      well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all have hoped to
      rise by Harriet's acquaintance: and besides, what was the value of
      Harriet's description?&mdash;So easily pleased&mdash;so little discerning;&mdash;what
      signified her praise?
    </p>
    <p>
      She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering
      all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt
      on,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be distressing, for the moment,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but you seem to have
      behaved extremely well; and it is over&mdash;and may never&mdash;can
      never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet said, &ldquo;very true,&rdquo; and she &ldquo;would not think about it;&rdquo; but still
      she talked of it&mdash;still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma, at
      last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to hurry on
      the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender caution; hardly
      knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at
      such a state of mind in poor Harriet&mdash;such a conclusion of Mr.
      Elton's importance with her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did not feel
      the first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an hour
      before, its interest soon increased; and before their first conversation
      was over, she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity,
      wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins,
      which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her
      fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It had
      been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining any
      influence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get at
      her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either the
      courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the
      brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's; and a twelvemonth
      might pass without their being thrown together again, with any necessity,
      or even any power of speech.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting
      situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of
      being kindly spoken of.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first mentioned in
      Highbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to have every
      recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant, highly
      accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to
      triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame of her merits,
      there was very little more for him to do, than to tell her Christian name,
      and say whose music she principally played.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected and
      mortified&mdash;disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of
      what appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right
      lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. He had
      gone away deeply offended&mdash;he came back engaged to another&mdash;and
      to another as superior, of course, to the first, as under such
      circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He came back gay
      and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse, and
      defying Miss Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages of
      perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune, of
      so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of some dignity,
      as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had not thrown
      himself away&mdash;he had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts; and
      he had gained her with such delightful rapidity&mdash;the first hour of
      introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice; the
      history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress of the
      affair was so glorious&mdash;the steps so quick, from the accidental
      rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's, and the party at Mrs. Brown's&mdash;smiles
      and blushes rising in importance&mdash;with consciousness and agitation
      richly scattered&mdash;the lady had been so easily impressed&mdash;so
      sweetly disposed&mdash;had in short, to use a most intelligible phrase,
      been so very ready to have him, that vanity and prudence were equally
      contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had caught both substance and shadow&mdash;both fortune and affection,
      and was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and his
      own concerns&mdash;expecting to be congratulated&mdash;ready to be laughed
      at&mdash;and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young
      ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more
      cautiously gallant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to
      please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and when
      he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which a
      certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict, that when he
      next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just enough
      to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her the impression of
      his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension, now spread
      over his air. She was, in fact, beginning very much to wonder that she had
      ever thought him pleasing at all; and his sight was so inseparably
      connected with some very disagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral
      light, as a penance, a lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to her
      own mind, she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him
      again. She wished him very well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare
      twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly
      be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be prevented&mdash;many
      awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A <i>Mrs.</i> <i>Elton</i> would be an
      excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without
      remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civility again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was good enough
      for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury&mdash;handsome
      enough&mdash;to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side. As to connexion,
      there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all his own vaunted
      claims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On that article, truth
      seemed attainable. <i>What</i> she was, must be uncertain; but <i>who</i>
      she was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not
      appear that she was at all Harriet's superior. She brought no name, no blood,
      no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a
      Bristol&mdash;merchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole of
      the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it was not
      unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate
      also. Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol
      was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though the father and mother
      had died some years ago, an uncle remained&mdash;in the law line&mdash;nothing
      more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him, than that he was in the
      law line; and with him the daughter had lived. Emma guessed him to be the
      drudge of some attorney, and too stupid to rise. And all the grandeur of
      the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was <i>very</i> <i>well</i>
      <i>married</i>, to a gentleman in a <i>great</i> <i>way</i>, near Bristol,
      who kept two carriages! That was the wind-up of the history; that was the
      glory of Miss Hawkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had talked
      her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out of it.
      The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet's mind was
      not to be talked away. He might be superseded by another; he certainly
      would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin would have
      been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cure her. Harriet was
      one of those, who, having once begun, would be always in love. And now,
      poor girl! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton.
      She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other. Emma saw him
      only once; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure <i>just</i>
      to meet with him, or <i>just</i> to miss him, <i>just</i> to hear his
      voice, or see his shoulder, <i>just</i> to have something occur to
      preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and
      conjecture. She was, moreover, perpetually hearing about him; for,
      excepting when at Hartfield, she was always among those who saw no fault
      in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his
      concerns; and every report, therefore, every guess&mdash;all that had
      already occurred, all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs,
      comprehending income, servants, and furniture, was continually in
      agitation around her. Her regard was receiving strength by invariable
      praise of him, and her regrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by
      ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness, and continual
      observation of, how much he seemed attached!&mdash;his air as he walked by
      the house&mdash;the very sitting of his hat, being all in proof of how
      much he was in love!
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her friend,
      or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet's mind, Emma would
      have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated,
      sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the
      other. Mr. Elton's engagement had been the cure of the agitation of
      meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that
      engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin's calling at
      Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards. Harriet had not been at home; but a
      note had been prepared and left for her, written in the very style to
      touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a great deal of kindness; and
      till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much occupied by it,
      continually pondering over what could be done in return, and wishing to do
      more than she dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, in person, had driven away
      all such cares. While he staid, the Martins were forgotten; and on the
      very morning of his setting off for Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of
      the distress it occasioned, judged it best for her to return Elizabeth
      Martin's visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      How that visit was to be acknowledged&mdash;what would be necessary&mdash;and
      what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.
      Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would be
      ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the
      acquaintance&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than Harriet's
      returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding, should
      convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance. She meant to
      take her in the carriage, leave her at the Abbey Mill, while she drove a
      little farther, and call for her again so soon, as to allow no time for
      insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past, and give the
      most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it
      which her own heart could not approve&mdash;something of ingratitude,
      merely glossed over&mdash;it must be done, or what would become of
      Harriet?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Small heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her friend
      called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led her to the very
      spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to <i>The Rev. Philip Elton,
      White-Hart, Bath</i>, was to be seen under the operation of being lifted
      into the butcher's cart, which was to convey it to where the coaches past;
      and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk and the direction, was
      consequently a blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be put
      down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between
      espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which had
      given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to revive a
      little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed her to be
      looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determined her not
      to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour. She went on
      herself, to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married,
      and settled in Donwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again; and
      Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and
      unattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarily down the gravel
      walk&mdash;a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with her
      seemingly with ceremonious civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She was feeling
      too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the
      sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating. She had seen only
      Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her doubtingly, if not
      coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost
      all the time&mdash;till just at last, when Mrs. Martin's saying, all of a
      sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more
      interesting subject, and a warmer manner. In that very room she had been
      measured last September, with her two friends. There were the pencilled
      marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window. <i>He</i> had done
      it. They all seemed to remember the day, the hour, the party, the occasion&mdash;to
      feel the same consciousness, the same regrets&mdash;to be ready to return
      to the same good understanding; and they were just growing again like
      themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must suspect, as ready as the best of them
      to be cordial and happy,) when the carriage reappeared, and all was over.
      The style of the visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be
      decisive. Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had
      thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!&mdash;Emma could not but
      picture it all, and feel how justly they might resent, how naturally
      Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business. She would have given a great
      deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins in a higher rank of
      life. They were so deserving, that a <i>little</i> higher should have been
      enough: but as it was, how could she have done otherwise?&mdash;Impossible!&mdash;She
      could not repent. They must be separated; but there was a great deal of
      pain in the process&mdash;so much to herself at this time, that she soon
      felt the necessity of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by
      way of Randalls to procure it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and
      the Martins. The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither
      &ldquo;master nor mistress was at home;&rdquo; they had both been out some time; the
      man believed they were gone to Hartfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is too bad,&rdquo; cried Emma, as they turned away. &ldquo;And now we shall just
      miss them; too provoking!&mdash;I do not know when I have been so
      disappointed.&rdquo; And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her murmurs,
      or to reason them away; probably a little of both&mdash;such being the
      commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the carriage
      stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were
      standing to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight of them,
      and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound&mdash;for Mr. Weston
      immediately accosted her with,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d'ye do?&mdash;how d'ye do?&mdash;We have been sitting with your
      father&mdash;glad to see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow&mdash;I had a
      letter this morning&mdash;we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a
      certainty&mdash;he is at Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole
      fortnight; I knew it would be so. If he had come at Christmas he could not
      have staid three days; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now
      we are going to have just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled
      weather. We shall enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly
      as we could wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the influence
      of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all was by the words
      and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but not less to the
      purpose. To know that <i>she</i> thought his coming certain was enough to
      make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy. It
      was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits. The worn-out past
      was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half
      a moment's thought, she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which
      allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command,
      as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she listened, and
      smiled, and congratulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,&rdquo; said he, at the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had better move on, Mr. Weston,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we are detaining the
      girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, I am ready;&rdquo;&mdash;and turning again to Emma, &ldquo;but you must
      not be expecting such a <i>very</i> fine young man; you have only had <i>my</i>
      account you know; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:&rdquo;&mdash;though
      his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different
      conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a manner
      that appropriated nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock,&rdquo; was Mrs.
      Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four o'clock!&mdash;depend upon it he will be here by three,&rdquo; was Mr.
      Weston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting. Emma's
      spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a different
      air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before. When she
      looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least must soon be coming
      out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw something like a look
      of spring, a tender smile even there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?&rdquo;&mdash;was
      a question, however, which did not augur much.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma
      was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's faithful
      pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o'clock, that she
      was to think of her at four.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, dear anxious friend,&rdquo;&mdash;said she, in mental soliloquy, while
      walking downstairs from her own room, &ldquo;always overcareful for every body's
      comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets, going
      again and again into his room, to be sure that all is right.&rdquo; The clock
      struck twelve as she passed through the hall. &ldquo;'Tis twelve; I shall not
      forget to think of you four hours hence; and by this time to-morrow,
      perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the possibility of their
      all calling here. I am sure they will bring him soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father&mdash;Mr.
      Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a few minutes, and Mr.
      Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank's being a day before
      his time, and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome
      and congratulations, when she appeared, to have her share of surprize,
      introduction, and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually
      before her&mdash;he was presented to her, and she did not think too much
      had been said in his praise; he was a <i>very</i> good looking young man;
      height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his countenance had a
      great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father's; he looked quick
      and sensible. She felt immediately that she should like him; and there was
      a well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her
      that he came intending to be acquainted with her, and that acquainted they
      soon must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with the
      eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel earlier,
      later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you yesterday,&rdquo; cried Mr. Weston with exultation, &ldquo;I told you all
      that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what I used to
      do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help getting on
      faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in upon one's
      friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal more than any
      little exertion it needs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,&rdquo; said the young man,
      &ldquo;though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far; but in
      coming <i>home</i> I felt I might do any thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word <i>home</i> made his father look on him with fresh complacency.
      Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the
      conviction was strengthened by what followed. He was very much pleased
      with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly
      allow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to
      Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself to
      have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one's
      <i>own</i> country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That he
      should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed
      suspiciously through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it
      was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner had no air of study
      or exaggeration. He did really look and speak as if in a state of no
      common enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance.
      On his side were the inquiries,&mdash;&ldquo;Was she a horsewoman?&mdash;Pleasant
      rides?&mdash;Pleasant walks?&mdash;Had they a large neighbourhood?&mdash;Highbury,
      perhaps, afforded society enough?&mdash;There were several very pretty
      houses in and about it.&mdash;Balls&mdash;had they balls?&mdash;Was it a
      musical society?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance
      proportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while their
      two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his
      mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so much
      warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his
      father, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an additional proof
      of his knowing how to please&mdash;and of his certainly thinking it worth
      while to try to please her. He did not advance a word of praise beyond
      what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly
      he could know very little of the matter. He understood what would be
      welcome; he could be sure of little else. &ldquo;His father's marriage,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it; and
      the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever
      considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits,
      without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was
      to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's
      character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if resolved
      to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object, he
      wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but I confess
      that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a very
      tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that I was
      to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,&rdquo; said
      Emma; &ldquo;were you to guess her to be <i>eighteen</i>, I should listen with
      pleasure; but <i>she</i> would be ready to quarrel with you for using such
      words. Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I should know better,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;no, depend upon it, (with a
      gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I
      might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from
      their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her mind,
      had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be considered as
      marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must see more of him to
      understand his ways; at present she only felt they were agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His quick
      eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy
      expression; and even, when he might have determined not to look, she was
      confident that he was often listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the
      entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion, was
      a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from approving
      matrimony than from foreseeing it.&mdash;Though always objecting to every
      marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from the
      apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two
      persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were
      proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He could now,
      without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a glance
      forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to all his
      natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank
      Churchill's accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils of
      sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed anxiety
      to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold&mdash;which, however,
      he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.&mdash;&ldquo;He must be
      going. He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many
      errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any body else.&rdquo;
       His son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity of
      paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore may as
      well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour
      of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near Highbury; a family
      of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding
      the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name&mdash;I
      should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any family of that name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure we do,&rdquo; cried his father; &ldquo;Mrs. Bates&mdash;we passed her
      house&mdash;I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted
      with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl
      she is. Call upon her, by all means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no necessity for my calling this morning,&rdquo; said the young man;
      &ldquo;another day would do as well; but there was that degree of acquaintance
      at Weymouth which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done
      cannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank; any
      want of attention to her <i>here</i> should be carefully avoided. You saw
      her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she mixed
      with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enough
      to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The son looked convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,&rdquo; said Emma; &ldquo;she is a very
      elegant young woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He agreed to it, but with so quiet a &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; as inclined her almost to
      doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of
      elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought only
      ordinarily gifted with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,&rdquo; said she,
      &ldquo;I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her and hear
      her&mdash;no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has an
      aunt who never holds her tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?&rdquo; said Mr.
      Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; &ldquo;then give me
      leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady.
      She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very worthy
      people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely glad to see
      you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown, quite
      on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses; you
      might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk, unless you keep
      on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the
      street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could, and
      his father gave his hearty support by calling out, &ldquo;My good friend, this
      is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it, and
      as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there from the Crown in a hop, step, and
      jump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a
      graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma remained
      very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could now
      engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day, with full
      confidence in their comfort.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with Mrs.
      Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He had
      been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till her
      usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk,
      immediately fixed on Highbury.&mdash;&ldquo;He did not doubt there being very
      pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always
      chuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury,
      would be his constant attraction.&rdquo;&mdash;Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood
      for Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with
      him. They walked thither directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for half
      a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew nothing of
      their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her, therefore, to
      perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in arm. She was
      wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in company with Mrs.
      Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend. If he
      were deficient there, nothing should make amends for it. But on seeing
      them together, she became perfectly satisfied. It was not merely in fine
      words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be
      more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her&mdash;nothing could
      more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing
      her affection. And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable
      judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning. They were
      all three walking about together for an hour or two&mdash;first round the
      shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury. He was delighted
      with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear;
      and when their going farther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be
      made acquainted with the whole village, and found matter of commendation
      and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He
      begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and
      which had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting that
      an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest of her
      cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in some points
      of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they shewed,
      altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must be very
      like a merit to those he was with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it
      could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting
      himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a parade of
      insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him
      justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though
      the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses were
      kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on
      the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any
      interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of the
      large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for a
      ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly
      populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;&mdash;but
      such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for
      which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among
      the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately
      interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of
      passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed
      windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities, and
      lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no fault in
      the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No, it was long
      enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the very number for
      comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through
      the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of
      the room?&mdash;She who could do any thing in Highbury! The want of proper
      families in the place, and the conviction that none beyond the place and
      its immediate environs could be tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he
      was not satisfied. He could not be persuaded that so many good-looking
      houses as he saw around him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a
      meeting; and even when particulars were given and families described, he
      was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture
      would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty in
      every body's returning into their proper place the next morning. He argued
      like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized
      to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the
      habits of the Churchills. He seemed to have all the life and spirit,
      cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing of
      the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps,
      scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too
      much on inelegance of mind. He could be no judge, however, of the evil he
      was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; and being
      now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma recollected his
      intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had paid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, oh! yes&rdquo;&mdash;he replied; &ldquo;I was just going to mention it. A very
      successful visit:&mdash;I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much
      obliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken me
      quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I was
      only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes would
      have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and I had
      told my father I should certainly be at home before him&mdash;but there
      was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found,
      when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I had been
      actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour. The good
      lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill, very ill&mdash;that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look
      ill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it? Ladies
      can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale, as
      almost always to give the appearance of ill health.&mdash;A most
      deplorable want of complexion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax's
      complexion. &ldquo;It was certainly never brilliant, but she would not allow it
      to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and delicacy in
      her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face.&rdquo; He
      listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he had heard many
      people say the same&mdash;but yet he must confess, that to him nothing
      could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health. Where features
      were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where
      they were good, the effect was&mdash;fortunately he need not attempt to
      describe what the effect was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;there is no disputing about taste.&mdash;At least you
      admire her except her complexion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head and laughed.&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and
      her complexion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their
      lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he says, six
      days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's. If it be not
      inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove myself to belong
      to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must buy something at
      Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.&mdash;I dare say they sell
      gloves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will be
      adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because you
      were Mr. Weston's son&mdash;but lay out half a guinea at Ford's, and your
      popularity will stand upon your own virtues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of &ldquo;Men's Beavers&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;York Tan&rdquo; were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he said&mdash;&ldquo;But
      I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me, you were
      saying something at the very moment of this burst of my <i>amor</i> <i>patriae</i>.
      Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame
      would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party
      at Weymouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a very
      unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide on the degree of
      acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.&mdash;I
      shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. But her
      account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very
      reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any body,
      that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I, indeed?&mdash;Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so
      well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a little
      in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set. Colonel
      Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,
      warm-hearted woman. I like them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she is
      destined to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;(rather hesitatingly)&mdash;I believe I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston smiling;
      &ldquo;remember that I am here.&mdash;Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to
      say when you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life. I will move a
      little farther off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly do forget to think of <i>her</i>,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;as having ever
      been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, &ldquo;Did you
      ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?&rdquo; said Frank Churchill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever hear her!&rdquo; repeated Emma. &ldquo;You forget how much she belongs to
      Highbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.
      She plays charmingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so, do you?&mdash;I wanted the opinion of some one who could
      really judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with considerable
      taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.&mdash;I am excessively
      fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any
      body's performance.&mdash;I have been used to hear her's admired; and I
      remember one proof of her being thought to play well:&mdash;a man, a very
      musical man, and in love with another woman&mdash;engaged to her&mdash;on
      the point of marriage&mdash;would yet never ask that other woman to sit
      down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down instead&mdash;never
      seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other. That, I thought, in
      a man of known musical talent, was some proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proof indeed!&rdquo; said Emma, highly amused.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Dixon is very
      musical, is he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from
      you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a
      very strong proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal
      stronger than, if <i>I</i> had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all
      agreeable to me. I could not excuse a man's having more music than love&mdash;more
      ear than eye&mdash;a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my
      feelings. How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was her very particular friend, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor comfort!&rdquo; said Emma, laughing. &ldquo;One would rather have a stranger
      preferred than one's very particular friend&mdash;with a stranger it might
      not recur again&mdash;but the misery of having a very particular friend
      always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!&mdash;Poor
      Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she
      really did not seem to feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better&mdash;or so much the worse:&mdash;I do not know which.
      But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her&mdash;quickness of
      friendship, or dulness of feeling&mdash;there was one person, I think, who
      must have felt it: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper
      and dangerous distinction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that&mdash;I do not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's sensations
      from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human being, I
      guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by
      Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all&mdash;&rdquo;
       he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, &ldquo;however, it is
      impossible for me to say on what terms they really were&mdash;how it might
      all be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness
      outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a
      better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct herself
      in critical situations, than I can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and
      women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,&mdash;that
      we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends. But
      we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a little, perhaps, from
      that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl
      so idolized and so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and
      grandmother, and all their set. And then, her reserve&mdash;I never could
      attach myself to any one so completely reserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Oftentimes very
      convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve, but
      no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction may
      be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an agreeable
      companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of conquering any
      body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is
      quite out of the question. I have no reason to think ill of her&mdash;not
      the least&mdash;except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of
      word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is
      apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and
      thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,
      that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He was
      not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in some of
      his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better than
      she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate&mdash;his feelings
      warmer. She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr.
      Elton's house, which, as well as the church, he would go and look at, and
      would not join them in finding much fault with. No, he could not believe
      it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having. If
      it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could not think any man
      to be pitied for having that house. There must be ample room in it for
      every real comfort. The man must be a blockhead who wanted more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about.
      Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many
      advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could be no
      judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one. But Emma, in
      her own mind, determined that he <i>did</i> know what he was talking
      about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in
      life, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might not be aware of the
      inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or a
      bad butler's pantry, but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe
      could not make him happy, and that whenever he were attached, he would
      willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the
      following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to have
      his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast, and
      he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner, but
      with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut. There
      was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such
      an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she
      could not approve. It did not accord with the rationality of plan, the
      moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she
      had believed herself to discern in him yesterday. Vanity, extravagance,
      love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be doing something,
      good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs.
      Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he
      became liable to all these charges. His father only called him a coxcomb,
      and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it,
      was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and
      making no other comment than that &ldquo;all young people would have their
      little whims.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit hitherto
      had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston was very ready to
      say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself&mdash;how much
      she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He appeared to have a very
      open temper&mdash;certainly a very cheerful and lively one; she could
      observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great deal decidedly right; he
      spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond of talking of him&mdash;said
      he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself; and
      though there was no being attached to the aunt, he acknowledged her
      kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to speak of her with
      respect. This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate
      fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy of
      the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him; the honour,
      if not of being really in love with her, of being at least very near it,
      and saved only by her own indifference&mdash;(for still her resolution
      held of never marrying)&mdash;the honour, in short, of being marked out
      for her by all their joint acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must have
      some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely&mdash;thought
      her very beautiful and very charming; and with so much to be said for him
      altogether, she found she must not judge him harshly. As Mrs. Weston
      observed, &ldquo;all young people would have their little whims.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so leniently
      disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of Donwell and
      Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little
      excesses of such a handsome young man&mdash;one who smiled so often and
      bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened,
      from its power of censure, by bows or smiles&mdash;Mr. Knightley. The
      circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was silent; but
      Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself, over a
      newspaper he held in his hand, &ldquo;Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I
      took him for.&rdquo; She had half a mind to resent; but an instant's observation
      convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings,
      and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs.
      Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune.
      Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma want their
      advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice
      they gave.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the occurrence:&mdash;The Coles had been settled some years in
      Highbury, and were very good sort of people&mdash;friendly, liberal, and
      unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade,
      and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the country, they
      had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little company,
      and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had brought them a
      considerable increase of means&mdash;the house in town had yielded greater
      profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them. With their wealth,
      their views increased; their want of a larger house, their inclination for
      more company. They added to their house, to their number of servants, to
      their expenses of every sort; and by this time were, in fortune and style
      of living, second only to the family at Hartfield. Their love of society,
      and their new dining-room, prepared every body for their keeping
      dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the single men, had
      already taken place. The regular and best families Emma could hardly
      suppose they would presume to invite&mdash;neither Donwell, nor Hartfield,
      nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt <i>her</i> to go, if they did; and she
      regretted that her father's known habits would be giving her refusal less
      meaning than she could wish. The Coles were very respectable in their way,
      but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms
      on which the superior families would visit them. This lesson, she very
      much feared, they would receive only from herself; she had little hope of
      Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks
      before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her very
      differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation,
      and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs. Weston's accounting
      for it with &ldquo;I suppose they will not take the liberty with you; they know
      you do not dine out,&rdquo; was not quite sufficient. She felt that she should
      like to have had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the
      party to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those whose society
      was dearest to her, occurred again and again, she did not know that she
      might not have been tempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in the
      evening, and the Bateses. They had been speaking of it as they walked
      about Highbury the day before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly
      lamented her absence. Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a
      question of his. The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation
      on her spirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing
      the omission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at
      Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first
      remark, on reading it, was that &ldquo;of course it must be declined,&rdquo; she so
      very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their
      advice for her going was most prompt and successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely without
      inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so properly&mdash;there
      was so much real attention in the manner of it&mdash;so much consideration
      for her father. &ldquo;They would have solicited the honour earlier, but had
      been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from London, which they hoped
      might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air, and therefore induce him
      the more readily to give them the honour of his company.&rdquo; Upon the whole,
      she was very persuadable; and it being briefly settled among themselves
      how it might be done without neglecting his comfort&mdash;how certainly
      Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing him
      company&mdash;Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his
      daughter's going out to dinner on a day now near at hand, and spending the
      whole evening away from him. As for <i>his</i> going, Emma did not wish
      him to think it possible, the hours would be too late, and the party too
      numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not fond of dinner-visiting,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;I never was. No more is
      Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should
      have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come in one
      afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us&mdash;take us in their
      afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and
      yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening. The dews of a
      summer evening are what I would not expose any body to. However, as they
      are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you will
      both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her, I cannot wish
      to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought, neither damp, nor
      cold, nor windy.&rdquo; Then turning to Mrs. Weston, with a look of gentle
      reproach&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not married, you would have
      staid at home with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; cried Mr. Weston, &ldquo;as I took Miss Taylor away, it is
      incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.
      Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the idea of any thing to be done in a <i>moment</i>, was increasing,
      not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better how to
      allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as
      usual. &ldquo;He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great regard for
      Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her. James could
      take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer written to Mrs.
      Cole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will say
      that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must decline
      their obliging invitation; beginning with my <i>compliments</i>, of
      course. But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to
      be done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be
      wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have never
      been there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have no
      doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get there, you
      must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again; and you
      had better name an early hour. You will not like staying late. You will
      get very tired when tea is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many
      people talking at once. You will not like the noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear sir,&rdquo; cried Mr. Weston, &ldquo;if Emma comes away early, it will
      be breaking up the party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no great harm if it does,&rdquo; said Mr. Woodhouse. &ldquo;The sooner every
      party breaks up, the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma's going away
      directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured people,
      and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel that any
      body's hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss Woodhouse's doing it
      would be more thought of than any other person's in the room. You would
      not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly,
      good sort of people as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these
      <i>ten</i> years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you
      for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain.
      I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never
      touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but he is
      bilious&mdash;Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means of
      giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure,
      rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a
      little longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You
      will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no
      scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am only
      afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not being
      exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, you know; but
      when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself,
      instead of going to bed at your usual time&mdash;and the idea of that
      would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that, if
      she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if
      hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should sit
      up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were
      safe in the house, as usual.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's dinner
      waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious
      for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any imperfection
      which could be concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very
      good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done.
      He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any confusion of
      face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his spirits. He was
      quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him, Emma thus
      moralised to herself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things do
      cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way.
      Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.&mdash;It
      depends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he is <i>not</i>
      a trifling, silly young man. If he were, he would have done this
      differently. He would either have gloried in the achievement, or been
      ashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb,
      or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.&mdash;No, I
      am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for a
      longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by
      inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing how
      soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air; and of
      fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were now seeing
      them together for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.
      Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.
      Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than
      his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs. Goddard
      being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left the house,
      was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner; and
      while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress, to make the
      two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping them to large slices of
      cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his care
      of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal.&mdash;She
      had provided a plentiful dinner for them; she wished she could know that
      they had been allowed to eat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased to see
      that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses, having
      little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and independence,
      was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as he could, and not use his
      carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey. She had an
      opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart, for
      he stopped to hand her out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is coming as you should do,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;like a gentleman.&mdash;I am
      quite glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thanked her, observing, &ldquo;How lucky that we should arrive at the same
      moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether you
      would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.&mdash;You
      might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of consciousness
      or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them.
      You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but with you it is a
      sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I always observe it
      whenever I meet you under those circumstances. <i>Now</i> you have nothing
      to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed. You are not
      striving to look taller than any body else. <i>Now</i> I shall really be
      very happy to walk into the same room with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsensical girl!&rdquo; was his reply, but not at all in anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with
      Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which could not but
      please, and given all the consequence she could wish for. When the Westons
      arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of admiration were for
      her, from both husband and wife; the son approached her with a cheerful
      eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found
      him seated by her&mdash;and, as she firmly believed, not without some
      dexterity on his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper
      unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of naming
      among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family, the
      lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the evening,
      with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already, at dinner,
      they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general; and,
      while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could fairly surrender
      all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour. The first remote
      sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane
      Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was
      expected to be very interesting. She listened, and found it well worth
      listening to. That very dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing
      supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates, and
      as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a
      pianoforte&mdash;a very elegant looking instrument&mdash;not a grand, but
      a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story, the end
      of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and
      congratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates's, was, that
      this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood's the day before, to the great
      astonishment of both aunt and niece&mdash;entirely unexpected; that at
      first, by Miss Bates's account, Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite
      bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it&mdash;but now, they
      were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;&mdash;of
      course it must be from Colonel Campbell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can suppose nothing else,&rdquo; added Mrs. Cole, &ldquo;and I was only surprized
      that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems, had a letter
      from them very lately, and not a word was said about it. She knows their
      ways best; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their
      not meaning to make the present. They might chuse to surprize her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the subject
      was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell, and equally
      rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were enough ready to
      speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still listen to Mrs. Cole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me
      more satisfaction!&mdash;It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax,
      who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite
      a shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine
      instruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves a
      slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I
      really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the
      drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little
      girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it;
      and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not any
      thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old spinet
      in the world, to amuse herself with.&mdash;I was saying this to Mr. Cole
      but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so particularly
      fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase,
      hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally
      to put it to a better use than we can; and that really is the reason why
      the instrument was bought&mdash;or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed
      of it.&mdash;We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed
      with to try it this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing more
      was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's, turned to Frank
      Churchill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you smile?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, why do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&mdash;I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being so
      rich and so liberal.&mdash;It is a handsome present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather wonder that it was never made before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument&mdash;which
      must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs.
      Bates's house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may <i>say</i> what you chuse&mdash;but your countenance testifies
      that your <i>thoughts</i> on this subject are very much like mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for
      acuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably
      suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what
      there is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She must
      know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and
      perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young
      woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I told
      you that your suspicions would guide mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend <i>Mr</i>. Dixon in
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dixon.&mdash;Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be
      the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day,
      you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had
      entertained before.&mdash;I do not mean to reflect upon the good
      intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help
      suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had
      the misfortune to fall in love with <i>her</i>, or that he became
      conscious of a little attachment on her side. One might guess twenty
      things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a
      particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with
      the Campbells to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation
      and penance; there it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of
      trying her native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.&mdash;In the
      summer it might have passed; but what can any body's native air do for
      them in the months of January, February, and March? Good fires and
      carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate
      health, and I dare say in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my
      suspicions, though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I
      honestly tell you what they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon's
      preference of her music to her friend's, I can answer for being very
      decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?&mdash;A water
      party; and by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did. I was there&mdash;one of the party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you really?&mdash;Well!&mdash;But you observed nothing of course,
      for it seems to be a new idea to you.&mdash;If I had been there, I think I
      should have made some discoveries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that
      Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught
      her.&mdash;It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent shock
      and alarm was very great and much more durable&mdash;indeed I believe it
      was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again&mdash;yet that
      was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be
      observable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made
      discoveries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share in the
      awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and obliged to
      be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the table was again
      safely covered, when every corner dish was placed exactly right, and
      occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know a
      little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall soon
      hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must
      conclude it to come from the Campbells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is not
      from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She would
      not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not have convinced
      you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a
      principal in the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings carry
      my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed you
      satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as paternal
      kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world. But when you
      mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that it should be the
      tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see it in no other light
      than as an offering of love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction seemed
      real; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other subjects took
      their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert succeeded,
      the children came in, and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate
      of conversation; a few clever things said, a few downright silly, but by
      much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other&mdash;nothing
      worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other ladies,
      in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree of her own
      particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her dignity and
      grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless
      manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful,
      unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of
      pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection. There she
      sat&mdash;and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately
      shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and seeing others
      nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say nothing, was
      enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax did look and
      move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change
      feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the mortification of
      having loved&mdash;yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain&mdash;by
      the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by
      the husband of her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.
      She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the
      secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair, and
      therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the subject was
      almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of consciousness with
      which congratulations were received, the blush of guilt which accompanied
      the name of &ldquo;my excellent friend Colonel Campbell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested by the
      circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in
      dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone,
      touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little
      about it as possible, which she plainly read in the fair heroine's
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the
      early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and the handsomest; and
      after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece, made
      his way directly to the opposite side of the circle, where sat Miss
      Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her, would not sit at all.
      Emma divined what every body present must be thinking. She was his object,
      and every body must perceive it. She introduced him to her friend, Miss
      Smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard what each thought of
      the other. &ldquo;He had never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with her
      naivete.&rdquo; And she, &ldquo;Only to be sure it was paying him too great a
      compliment, but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr.
      Elton.&rdquo; Emma restrained her indignation, and only turned from her in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first
      glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech. He
      told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room&mdash;hated
      sitting long&mdash;was always the first to move when he could&mdash;that
      his father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over
      parish business&mdash;that as long as he had staid, however, it had been
      pleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike,
      sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether&mdash;thought
      it so abundant in agreeable families&mdash;that Emma began to feel she had
      been used to despise the place rather too much. She questioned him as to
      the society in Yorkshire&mdash;the extent of the neighbourhood about
      Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his answers that, as far
      as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little going on, that their
      visitings were among a range of great families, none very near; and that
      even when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even chance
      that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going; that they
      made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, though he had his
      separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, without considerable
      address <i>at</i> <i>times</i>, that he could get away, or introduce an
      acquaintance for a night.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at its
      best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home
      than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. He did not
      boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded his aunt
      where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing and noticing it, he
      owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) he could <i>with</i>
      <i>time</i> persuade her to any thing. One of those points on which his
      influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wanted very much to go abroad&mdash;had
      been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel&mdash;but she would not
      hear of it. This had happened the year before. <i>Now</i>, he said, he was
      beginning to have no longer the same wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be good
      behaviour to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made a most wretched discovery,&rdquo; said he, after a short pause.&mdash;
      &ldquo;I have been here a week to-morrow&mdash;half my time. I never knew days
      fly so fast. A week to-morrow!&mdash;And I have hardly begun to enjoy
      myself. But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!&mdash;I hate
      the recollection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out of
      so few, in having your hair cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;that is no subject of regret at all. I have no
      pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be
      seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself
      obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole. When
      Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as before,
      she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax,
      who was sitting exactly opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started. &ldquo;Thank you for rousing me,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I believe I have been
      very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way&mdash;so
      very odd a way&mdash;that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never saw any
      thing so outree!&mdash;Those curls!&mdash;This must be a fancy of her own.
      I see nobody else looking like her!&mdash;I must go and ask her whether it
      is an Irish fashion. Shall I?&mdash;Yes, I will&mdash;I declare I will&mdash;and
      you shall see how she takes it;&mdash;whether she colours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss
      Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady, as he
      had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in front of
      Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the luxury of a large party,&rdquo; said she:&mdash;&ldquo;one can get near
      every body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk to
      you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like yourself,
      and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how Miss Bates
      and her niece came here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&mdash;They were invited, were not they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes&mdash;but how they were conveyed hither?&mdash;the manner of
      their coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true.&mdash;Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad
      it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and
      cold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw her
      appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and would
      therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could not bear
      the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room, and I could
      get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may guess how readily
      he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I made my way directly
      to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be at her service
      before it took us home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable
      at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure.
      'Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'&mdash;but with many, many
      thanks&mdash;'there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's
      carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.' I was quite
      surprized;&mdash;very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such a
      very kind attention&mdash;and so thoughtful an attention!&mdash;the sort
      of thing that so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing his
      usual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their
      accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect he would not have
      had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was only as an excuse for
      assisting them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Emma&mdash;&ldquo;nothing more likely. I know no man more
      likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing&mdash;to do any thing
      really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a
      gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane
      Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;&mdash;and
      for an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on
      more than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day&mdash;for we
      arrived together; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word
      that could betray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston, smiling, &ldquo;you give him credit for more simple,
      disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while Miss Bates
      was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never been able
      to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more probable it appears.
      In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax. See
      the consequence of keeping you company!&mdash;What do you say to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!&rdquo; exclaimed Emma. &ldquo;Dear Mrs. Weston, how
      could you think of such a thing?&mdash;Mr. Knightley!&mdash;Mr. Knightley
      must not marry!&mdash;You would not have little Henry cut out from
      Donwell?&mdash;Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all
      consent to Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not at all
      likely. I am amazed that you should think of such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not want
      the match&mdash;I do not want to injure dear little Henry&mdash;but the
      idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really
      wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's account, a boy
      of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.&mdash;Mr.
      Knightley marry!&mdash;No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot
      adopt it now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the imprudence of such a match!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than
      what you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would be
      quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for the
      Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax&mdash;and is always glad to
      shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making. You
      do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!&mdash;Oh! no, no;&mdash;every
      feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not have him do so mad a
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imprudent, if you please&mdash;but not mad. Excepting inequality of
      fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing
      unsuitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the least
      idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?&mdash;He is
      as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and his
      library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of his
      brother's children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up his
      time or his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves
      Jane Fairfax&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am
      sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston, laughing, &ldquo;perhaps the greatest good he could do
      them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a very
      shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss Bates
      belonging to him?&mdash;To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking him
      all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?&mdash;'So very kind
      and obliging!&mdash;But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!'
      And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother's old petticoat.
      'Not that it was such a very old petticoat either&mdash;for still it would
      last a great while&mdash;and, indeed, she must thankfully say that their
      petticoats were all very strong.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my conscience.
      And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by
      Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She might talk on; and if
      he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and drown
      her voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a bad connexion
      for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think he does. I have heard him
      speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The interest he
      takes in her&mdash;his anxiety about her health&mdash;his concern that she
      should have no happier prospect! I have heard him express himself so
      warmly on those points!&mdash;Such an admirer of her performance on the
      pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him say that he could listen to
      her for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me&mdash;this
      pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody&mdash;though we have all
      been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells, may it
      not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help suspecting him. I think he is
      just the person to do it, even without being in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not
      think it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley does
      nothing mysteriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener
      than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of
      things, occur to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told her
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very strong
      notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly silent when
      Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have many
      a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment&mdash;I
      believe nothing of the pianoforte&mdash;and proof only shall convince me
      that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather
      gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most
      used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them
      that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;&mdash;and at the
      same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them
      the honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her
      conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing nothing, except that he
      had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his very
      pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to
      lead, she gave a very proper compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than
      she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the
      little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany her own
      voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize&mdash;a
      second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Her pardon was
      duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual followed. He
      was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of
      music; which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing of the matter,
      and had no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sang together once more;
      and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax, whose performance,
      both vocal and instrumental, she never could attempt to conceal from
      herself, was infinitely superior to her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the
      numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again. They
      had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the sight
      of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half Emma's
      mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs.
      Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave
      only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr. Knightley's marrying
      did not in the least subside. She could see nothing but evil in it. It
      would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently to
      Isabella. A real injury to the children&mdash;a most mortifying change,
      and material loss to them all;&mdash;a very great deduction from her
      father's daily comfort&mdash;and, as to herself, she could not at all
      endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs. Knightley for
      them all to give way to!&mdash;No&mdash;Mr. Knightley must never marry.
      Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They
      talked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly very
      warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have struck her.
      As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his kindness in
      conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in the spirit of
      cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate only his
      disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I often feel concern,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that I dare not make our carriage more
      useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish; but you
      know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-to for
      such a purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,&rdquo; he replied;&mdash;&ldquo;but
      you must often wish it, I am sure.&rdquo; And he smiled with such seeming
      pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This present from the Campbells,&rdquo; said she&mdash;&ldquo;this pianoforte is very
      kindly given.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.&mdash;&ldquo;But
      they would have done better had they given her notice of it. Surprizes are
      foolish things. The pleasure is not enhanced, and the inconvenience is
      often considerable. I should have expected better judgment in Colonel
      Campbell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had
      had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were entirely free
      from peculiar attachment&mdash;whether there were no actual preference&mdash;remained
      a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane's second song, her voice
      grew thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud&mdash;&ldquo;you
      have sung quite enough for one evening&mdash;now be quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another song, however, was soon begged for. &ldquo;One more;&mdash;they would
      not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.&rdquo;
       And Frank Churchill was heard to say, &ldquo;I think you could manage this
      without effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the
      song falls on the second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley grew angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow,&rdquo; said he, indignantly, &ldquo;thinks of nothing but shewing off
      his own voice. This must not be.&rdquo; And touching Miss Bates, who at that
      moment passed near&mdash;&ldquo;Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing
      herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to be
      grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing.
      Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse and Miss
      Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within five
      minutes) the proposal of dancing&mdash;originating nobody exactly knew
      where&mdash;was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every
      thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs. Weston,
      capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible
      waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to
      Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off, Emma
      found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and
      her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr. Knightley. This would
      be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If he were to be very alert in
      engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur something. There was no
      immediate appearance. No; he was talking to Mrs. Cole&mdash;he was looking
      on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else, and he was still talking
      to Mrs. Cole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and she
      led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than five
      couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it
      very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a partner. They
      were a couple worth looking at.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was growing
      late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her mother's account.
      After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again, they were
      obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, and have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is as well,&rdquo; said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma to her
      carriage. &ldquo;I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing would
      not have agreed with me, after yours.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit
      afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she
      might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must be
      amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She must have delighted the
      Coles&mdash;worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!&mdash;And left a
      name behind her that would not soon die away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two
      points on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had not
      transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of
      Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it
      had been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his submission
      to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration, which made it
      difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and there
      she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the
      inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily grieve
      over the idleness of her childhood&mdash;and sat down and practised
      vigorously an hour and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's praise
      could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her's, than
      a lamp is like sunshine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dear&mdash;I think you play the best of the two. I think you play
      quite as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every
      body last night said how well you played.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The
      truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised, but
      Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or
      that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole
      said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal
      about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any
      taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.&mdash;There is
      no understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you
      know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to
      teach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any
      great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as they always do&mdash;very vulgar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told me something,&rdquo; said Harriet rather hesitatingly; &ldquo;but it is
      nothing of any consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its
      producing Mr. Elton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told me&mdash;that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay to
      dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not know
      what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there
      again next summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her at
      dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely.&mdash;I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar
      girls in Highbury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet had business at Ford's.&mdash;Emma thought it most prudent to go
      with her. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in
      her present state, would be dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always very
      long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins and
      changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.&mdash;Much could
      not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;&mdash;Mr.
      Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the
      office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a
      stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she
      could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with
      his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full
      basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling
      children round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she
      knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough
      still to stand at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing
      nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons
      appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into Highbury;&mdash;to
      Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the first place at
      Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford's; and
      had all but knocked, when Emma caught their eye.&mdash;Immediately they
      crossed the road and came forward to her; and the agreeableness of
      yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present
      meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the
      Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my companion tells me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that I absolutely promised Miss
      Bates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it
      myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I am
      going now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,&rdquo; said
      Frank Churchill, &ldquo;to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield&mdash;if
      you are going home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps&mdash;I may be equally in
      the way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt
      always sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to death;
      and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same. What am I to
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here on no business of my own,&rdquo; said Emma; &ldquo;I am only waiting for my
      friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home. But
      you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;if you advise it.&mdash;But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell
      should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an
      indifferent tone&mdash;what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.
      Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would be
      palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the world at
      a civil falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe any such thing,&rdquo; replied Emma.&mdash;&ldquo;I am persuaded
      that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but
      there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite
      otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do come with me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston, &ldquo;if it be not very disagreeable to
      you. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards. We
      will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It will
      be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,
      returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched them in, and
      then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,&mdash;trying, with all the
      force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it
      was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be it ever so
      beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. At last it was all
      settled, even to the destination of the parcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Ford.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;yes,
      to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield. No, you shall
      send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to
      see it.&mdash;And I could take the pattern gown home any day. But I shall
      want the ribbon directly&mdash;so it had better go to Hartfield&mdash;at
      least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two
      parcels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No trouble in the world, ma'am,&rdquo; said the obliging Mrs. Ford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you
      please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's&mdash;I do not know&mdash;No,
      I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and
      take it home with me at night. What do you advise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield, if
      you please, Mrs. Ford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, that will be much best,&rdquo; said Harriet, quite satisfied, &ldquo;I should
      not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Voices approached the shop&mdash;or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs.
      Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Woodhouse,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;I am just run across to
      entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while, and
      give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How do you
      do, Miss Smith?&mdash;Very well I thank you.&mdash;And I begged Mrs.
      Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well; and
      Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?&mdash;I am so glad
      to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.&mdash;Oh!
      then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me
      just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so very
      happy to see her&mdash;and now we are such a nice party, she cannot
      refuse.&mdash;'Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, 'Miss Woodhouse's
      opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'&mdash;But, said I, I
      shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.&mdash;'Oh,'
      said he, 'wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;'&mdash;For,
      would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging
      manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.&mdash;The
      rivet came out, you know, this morning.&mdash;So very obliging!&mdash;For
      my mother had no use of her spectacles&mdash;could not put them on. And,
      by the bye, every body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should
      indeed. Jane said so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first
      thing I did, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one
      thing, then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty
      came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I,
      Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your
      mistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis
      sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the
      Wallises, always&mdash;I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can
      be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing
      but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value of
      our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know? Only three
      of us.&mdash;besides dear Jane at present&mdash;and she really eats
      nothing&mdash;makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite
      frightened if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she
      eats&mdash;so I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off.
      But about the middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she
      likes so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for
      I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to
      meet him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before&mdash;I have so
      often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the
      only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We have
      apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent
      apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these
      ladies will oblige us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma would be &ldquo;very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &amp;c.,&rdquo; and they did at
      last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before. I
      hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane came
      back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well&mdash;only a
      little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was I talking of?&rdquo; said she, beginning again when they were all in
      the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.&mdash;Oh! my mother's
      spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! 'Oh!' said he, 'I do
      think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind excessively.'&mdash;Which
      you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must say that, much as I
      had heard of him before and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds
      any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly. He seems
      every thing the fondest parent could.... 'Oh!' said he, 'I can fasten the
      rivet. I like a job of that sort excessively.' I never shall forget his
      manner. And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet, and hoped
      our friends would be so very obliging as to take some, 'Oh!' said he
      directly, 'there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these
      are the finest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you
      know, was so very.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment.
      Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full
      justice&mdash;only we do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr.
      Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times&mdash;but Miss
      Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it. The apples themselves are
      the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell&mdash;some
      of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; and
      certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his
      trees&mdash;I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was
      always famous in her younger days. But I was really quite shocked the
      other day&mdash;for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating
      these apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them,
      and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. 'I am sure
      you must be,' said he, 'and I will send you another supply; for I have a
      great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me keep a larger
      quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more, before they get
      good for nothing.' So I begged he would not&mdash;for really as to ours
      being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left&mdash;it
      was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I
      could not at all bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he
      had been already; and Jane said the same. And when he was gone, she almost
      quarrelled with me&mdash;No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had
      a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the
      apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had a
      great many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could.
      However, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large
      basket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was
      very much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said
      every thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old
      acquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I found
      afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of <i>that</i>
      sort his master had; he had brought them all&mdash;and now his master had
      not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it himself, he
      was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William, you
      know, thinks more of his master's profit than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges,
      he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent away. She could not
      bear that her master should not be able to have another apple-tart this
      spring. He told Patty this, but bid her not mind it, and be sure not to
      say any thing to us about it, for Mrs. Hodges <i>would</i> be cross
      sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who
      ate the remainder. And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked
      indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the
      world! He would be so very.... I wanted to keep it from Jane's knowledge;
      but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was aware.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors walked
      upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to, pursued only
      by the sounds of her desultory good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take
      care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase&mdash;rather darker
      and narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss
      Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss Smith,
      the step at the turning.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was
      tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,
      slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near her,
      most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax, standing
      with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy
      countenance on seeing Emma again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a pleasure,&rdquo; said he, in rather a low voice, &ldquo;coming at least ten
      minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be useful;
      tell me if you think I shall succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston, &ldquo;have not you finished it yet? you would not
      earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been working uninterruptedly,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I have been
      assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily, it
      was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see we have
      been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to be persuaded
      to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently
      employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to make
      her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to
      sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately ready, Emma
      did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had not yet
      possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she must
      reason herself into the power of performance; and Emma could not but pity
      such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve never to
      expose them to her neighbour again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the
      powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs. Weston
      had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined her in all
      her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper discrimination, was
      pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,&rdquo; said Frank Churchill, with a
      smile at Emma, &ldquo;the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of
      Colonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper notes
      I am sure is exactly what he and <i>all</i> <i>that</i> <i>party</i> would
      particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his
      friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not you
      think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had been
      speaking to her at the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not fair,&rdquo; said Emma, in a whisper; &ldquo;mine was a random guess. Do
      not distress her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little doubt
      and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this
      occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and wonder
      which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's coming to hand.
      Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward
      just at this time?&mdash;Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an
      immediate commission from him, or that he may have sent only a general
      direction, an order indefinite as to time, to depend upon contingencies
      and conveniences?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,&rdquo; said she, in a voice of
      forced calmness, &ldquo;I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must be
      all conjecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conjecture&mdash;aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one
      conjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this
      rivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard at
      work, if one talks at all;&mdash;your real workmen, I suppose, hold their
      tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word&mdash;Miss
      Fairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have the
      pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles, healed for
      the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a little
      from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss Fairfax, who
      was still sitting at it, to play something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are very kind,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it will be one of the waltzes we danced
      last night;&mdash;let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them as I
      did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we danced
      no longer; but I would have given worlds&mdash;all the worlds one ever has
      to give&mdash;for another half-hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She played.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What felicity it is to hear a tune again which <i>has</i> made one happy!&mdash;If
      I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played something
      else. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning to
      Emma, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?&mdash;Cramer.&mdash;And
      here are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might
      expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of Colonel
      Campbell, was not it?&mdash;He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here.
      I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to have been
      so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing incomplete.
      True affection only could have prompted it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused; and
      when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a
      smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness, there
      had been a smile of secret delight, she had less scruple in the amusement,
      and much less compunction with respect to her.&mdash;This amiable,
      upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.&mdash;Emma
      took the opportunity of whispering,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak too plain. She must understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least
      ashamed of my meaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now a
      key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she does wrong,
      she ought to feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not entirely without it, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see much sign of it. She is playing <i>Robin</i> <i>Adair</i> at
      this moment&mdash;<i>his</i> favourite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr.
      Knightley on horse-back not far off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Knightley I declare!&mdash;I must speak to him if possible, just to
      thank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;
      but I can go into my mother's room you know. I dare say he will come in
      when he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet so!&mdash;Our
      little room so honoured!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the
      casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, and every
      syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, as
      if it had passed within the same apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d' ye do?&mdash;how d'ye do?&mdash;Very well, I thank you. So obliged
      to you for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just
      ready for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in
      his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is your niece, Miss Bates?&mdash;I want to inquire after you all, but
      particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?&mdash;I hope she caught no
      cold last night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear
      her in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave
      Emma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her head in steady
      scepticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So obliged to you!&mdash;so very much obliged to you for the carriage,&rdquo;
       resumed Miss Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cut her short with,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dear, Kingston&mdash;are you?&mdash;Mrs. Cole was saying the other
      day she wanted something from Kingston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for <i>you</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?&mdash;Miss
      Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte.
      Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, in a deliberating manner, &ldquo;for five minutes, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!&mdash;Quite
      delightful; so many friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on to
      Kingston as fast as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the
      pianoforte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am so sorry!&mdash;Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party
      last night; how extremely pleasant.&mdash;Did you ever see such dancing?&mdash;Was
      not it delightful?&mdash;Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never
      saw any thing equal to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss
      Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes. And
      (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be
      mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs. Weston is
      the very best country-dance player, without exception, in England. Now, if
      your friends have any gratitude, they will say something pretty loud about
      you and me in return; but I cannot stay to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence&mdash;so
      shocked!&mdash;Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had a
      great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked! Mrs.
      Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You should
      not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never can bear
      to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it would have
      been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to the room,) I
      have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop. He is going to
      Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was
      open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must have
      heard every thing to be sure. 'Can I do any thing for you at Kingston?'
      said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must you be going?&mdash;You
      seem but just come&mdash;so very obliging of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted
      long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to be
      gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could allow
      themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates,
      before they set off for Randalls.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been
      known of young people passing many, many months successively, without
      being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue either
      to body or mind;&mdash;but when a beginning is made&mdash;when the
      felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt&mdash;it
      must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;
      and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to
      spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young people in
      schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first idea; and his the greatest
      zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties,
      and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance. But still she
      had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank
      Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced&mdash;for doing that in which she need
      not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax&mdash;and even for simple
      dancing itself, without any of the wicked aids of vanity&mdash;to assist
      him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made
      to hold&mdash;and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour, in
      the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of
      their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's
      should be finished there&mdash;that the same party should be collected,
      and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr.
      Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston most
      willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance; and the
      interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who there
      would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every
      couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss
      Coxes five,&rdquo; had been repeated many times over. &ldquo;And there will be the two
      Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley. Yes,
      that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and Miss
      Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five couple
      there will be plenty of room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But soon it came to be on one side,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will there be good room for five couple?&mdash;I really do not think
      there will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On another,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand
      up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it. It will
      not do to <i>invite</i> five couple. It can be allowable only as the
      thought of the moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somebody said that <i>Miss</i> Gilbert was expected at her brother's, and
      must be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed <i>Mrs</i>. Gilbert
      would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word was put
      in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one family of
      cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintance who
      could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couple would be
      at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner
      they could be disposed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. &ldquo;Might not they
      use both rooms, and dance across the passage?&rdquo; It seemed the best scheme;
      and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better. Emma
      said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper;
      and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of health. It made
      him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not
      bear it for Emma!&mdash;Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful
      cold. So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you
      would be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do
      not let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very
      thoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the
      thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping
      them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the draught. I do not
      mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not quite the thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of it,
      and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now
      closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only in
      the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on Frank
      Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before had
      been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured to be
      made out quite enough for ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were too magnificent,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We allowed unnecessary room. Ten
      couple may stand here very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma demurred. &ldquo;It would be a crowd&mdash;a sad crowd; and what could be
      worse than dancing without space to turn in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; he gravely replied; &ldquo;it was very bad.&rdquo; But still he went on
      measuring, and still he ended with,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful to
      be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be
      dancing in a crowd&mdash;and a crowd in a little room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no denying it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I agree with you exactly. A crowd
      in a little room&mdash;Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving pictures
      in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!&mdash;Still, however, having
      proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It would be a
      disappointment to my father&mdash;and altogether&mdash;I do not know that&mdash;I
      am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self-willed,
      and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with
      her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest. Had she intended
      ever to <i>marry</i> him, it might have been worth while to pause and
      consider, and try to understand the value of his preference, and the
      character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance,
      he was quite amiable enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered the
      room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the
      scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Woodhouse,&rdquo; he almost immediately began, &ldquo;your inclination for
      dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors of my
      father's little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:&mdash;a
      thought of my father's, which waits only your approbation to be acted
      upon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of
      this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown
      Inn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Crown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,
      my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there. Better
      accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful welcome than
      at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it,
      provided you are satisfied. This is what we all feel. Oh! you were
      perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the Randalls rooms, would have
      been insufferable!&mdash;Dreadful!&mdash;I felt how right you were the
      whole time, but was too anxious for securing <i>any</i> <i>thing</i> to
      like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?&mdash;You consent&mdash;I hope
      you consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs. Weston
      do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for myself,
      shall be most happy&mdash;It seems the only improvement that could be.
      Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully
      comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were
      necessary to make it acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he thought it very far from an improvement&mdash;a very bad plan&mdash;much
      worse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;
      never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they had
      better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the Crown in
      his life&mdash;did not know the people who kept it by sight.&mdash;Oh! no&mdash;a
      very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to observe, sir,&rdquo; said Frank Churchill, &ldquo;that one of the
      great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of
      any body's catching cold&mdash;so much less danger at the Crown than at
      Randalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody
      else could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, &ldquo;you are very much mistaken if
      you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is extremely
      concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how the room at
      the Crown can be safer for you than your father's house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no
      occasion to open the windows at all&mdash;not once the whole evening; and
      it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon
      heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the windows!&mdash;but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of
      opening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never
      heard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!&mdash;I am sure, neither
      your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! sir&mdash;but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a
      window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I have
      often known it done myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you indeed, sir?&mdash;Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But
      I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,
      this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it over&mdash;but
      these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One cannot
      resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging
      as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what can be
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; interrupted Emma, &ldquo;there will be plenty of time for talking every
      thing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at the
      Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will be so
      near their own stable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever
      complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could be
      sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired&mdash;but is Mrs. Stokes to be
      trusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be
      under Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, papa!&mdash;Now you must be satisfied&mdash;Our own dear Mrs.
      Weston, who is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry
      said, so many years ago, when I had the measles? 'If <i>Miss</i> <i>Taylor</i>
      undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.' How
      often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor
      little Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have
      been very bad, but for Perry's great attention. He came four times a day
      for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort&mdash;which
      was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hope
      whenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she will send for
      Perry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,&rdquo; said Frank
      Churchill, &ldquo;examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there and
      came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you might be
      persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was desired to
      say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to them, if you could
      allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing satisfactorily without
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,
      engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people set
      off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs. Weston;
      delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and very happy
      in their different way; she, in some little distress; and he, finding
      every thing perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emma,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places
      you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and
      forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you are too particular,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;What does all that
      signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as clean as
      Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our club-nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, &ldquo;Men never know when
      things are dirty or not;&rdquo; and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to
      himself, &ldquo;Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain. It
      regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom's being built, suppers
      had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was the only
      addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted as a
      card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their
      four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable supper?
      Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose; but it
      was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward passage must be gone
      through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs. Weston was afraid of
      draughts for the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the
      gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &amp;c.,
      set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion.
      A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was pronounced an
      infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs. Weston must not
      speak of it again. She then took another line of expediency, and looking
      into the doubtful room, observed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think it <i>is</i> so very small. We shall not be many, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through
      the passage, was calling out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a
      mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston, &ldquo;one could know which arrangement our guests
      in general would like best. To do what would be most generally pleasing
      must be our object&mdash;if one could but tell what that would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very true,&rdquo; cried Frank, &ldquo;very true. You want your neighbours'
      opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief of
      them&mdash;the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call
      upon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.&mdash;And I do not know
      whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the
      rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger council.
      Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;if you please,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, &ldquo;if you
      think she will be of any use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;She
      will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. She will
      not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in consulting Miss
      Bates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing
      Miss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it his
      decided approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, do, Frank.&mdash;Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter
      at once. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a
      properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss
      Bates. We are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of how
      to be happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both sir! Can the old lady?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a great
      blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect. Undoubtedly
      if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.&rdquo; And away he ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,
      and her elegant niece,&mdash;Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman and
      a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of it
      much less than she had supposed before&mdash;indeed very trifling; and
      here ended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation at
      least, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and
      chair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left as
      mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.
      Stokes.&mdash;Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already
      written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,
      which could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must. As a
      counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer
      character,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general and
      minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another
      half-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms,
      some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the future.
      The party did not break up without Emma's being positively secured for the
      two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing
      Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, &ldquo;He has asked her, my dear. That's right.
      I knew he would!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely
      satisfactory to Emma&mdash;its being fixed for a day within the granted
      term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston's
      confidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills
      might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight. But
      this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take their time,
      nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on, and
      for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty&mdash;at
      the risk&mdash;in her opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His wish
      of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed. All
      was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitude generally
      makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of her ball, began to adopt
      as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's provoking indifference about it.
      Either because he did not dance himself, or because the plan had been
      formed without his being consulted, he seemed resolved that it should not
      interest him, determined against its exciting any present curiosity, or
      affording him any future amusement. To her voluntary communications Emma
      could get no more approving reply, than,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble
      for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say against it,
      but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.&mdash;Oh! yes, I must be
      there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I can; but I
      would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins's week's account;
      much rather, I confess.&mdash;Pleasure in seeing dancing!&mdash;not I,
      indeed&mdash;I never look at it&mdash;I do not know who does.&mdash;Fine
      dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward. Those who are
      standing by are usually thinking of something very different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was not
      in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent, or so
      indignant; he was not guided by <i>her</i> feelings in reprobating the
      ball, for <i>she</i> enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree.
      It made her animated&mdash;open hearted&mdash;she voluntarily said;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball. What a
      disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with <i>very</i>
      great pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred
      the society of William Larkins. No!&mdash;she was more and more convinced
      that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There was a great
      deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side&mdash;but no
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two
      days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of
      every thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew's
      instant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell&mdash;far too unwell to do
      without him; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband)
      when writing to her nephew two days before, though from her usual
      unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of
      herself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle, and
      must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs.
      Weston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gone
      within a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt, to
      lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred but for
      her own convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston added, &ldquo;that he could only allow himself time to hurry to
      Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom he
      could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be expected
      at Hartfield very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast. When once it had
      been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The loss
      of the ball&mdash;the loss of the young man&mdash;and all that the young
      man might be feeling!&mdash;It was too wretched!&mdash;Such a delightful
      evening as it would have been!&mdash;Every body so happy! and she and her
      partner the happiest!&mdash;&ldquo;I said it would be so,&rdquo; was the only
      consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father's feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally of Mrs.
      Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and as for
      the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but they would
      all be safer at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if this
      reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total want of
      spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going away almost
      too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. He sat really
      lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing himself, it
      was only to say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will come again,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;This will not be your only visit to
      Randalls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;(shaking his head)&mdash;the uncertainty of when I may be able
      to return!&mdash;I shall try for it with a zeal!&mdash;It will be the
      object of all my thoughts and cares!&mdash;and if my uncle and aunt go to
      town this spring&mdash;but I am afraid&mdash;they did not stir last spring&mdash;I
      am afraid it is a custom gone for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our poor ball must be quite given up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that ball!&mdash;why did we wait for any thing?&mdash;why not seize
      the pleasure at once?&mdash;How often is happiness destroyed by
      preparation, foolish preparation!&mdash;You told us it would be so.&mdash;Oh!
      Miss Woodhouse, why are you always so right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much rather
      have been merry than wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends on
      it. Do not forget your engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma looked graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a fortnight as it has been!&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;every day more precious
      and more delightful than the day before!&mdash;every day making me less
      fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at Highbury!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you do us such ample justice now,&rdquo; said Emma, laughing, &ldquo;I will
      venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first? Do
      not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure you
      did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in coming,
      if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma was
      convinced that it had been so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you must be off this very morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I
      must be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will bring
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss
      Bates? How unlucky! Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mind might have
      strengthened yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I <i>have</i> called there; passing the door, I thought it
      better. It was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was
      detained by Miss Bates's being absent. She was out; and I felt it
      impossible not to wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that
      one <i>must</i> laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was
      better to pay my visit, then&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;perhaps, Miss Woodhouse&mdash;I think you can hardly
      be quite without suspicion&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knew what
      to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious,
      which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in the hope
      of putting it by, she calmly said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit, then&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting on
      what she had said, and trying to understand the manner. She heard him
      sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had <i>cause</i> to sigh. He
      could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments passed,
      and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to
      Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.&mdash;He was
      more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might
      have ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhouse soon
      followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr. Weston,
      always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of
      procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that
      was doubtful, said, &ldquo;It was time to go;&rdquo; and the young man, though he
      might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall hear about you all,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;that is my chief consolation. I
      shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged Mrs.
      Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise it. Oh!
      the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really interested in
      the absent!&mdash;she will tell me every thing. In her letters I shall be
      at dear Highbury again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; closed the
      speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had been the
      notice&mdash;short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so sorry to
      part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence
      as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his
      arrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the
      last two weeks&mdash;indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of
      seeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his
      attentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happy
      fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course
      of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he had <i>almost</i>
      told her that he loved her. What strength, or what constancy of affection
      he might be subject to, was another point; but at present she could not
      doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of
      herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that
      she <i>must</i> be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous
      determination against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly must,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;This sensation of listlessness, weariness,
      stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself, this feeling
      of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!&mdash; I must be
      in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not&mdash;for
      a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always good to others. I shall
      have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not for Frank Churchill; but
      Mr. Knightley will be happy. He may spend the evening with his dear
      William Larkins now if he likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not say
      that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would have
      contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that he was
      sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable kindness
      added,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out
      of luck; you are very much out of luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest
      regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure was
      odious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from headache
      to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball taken place,
      she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was charity to
      impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill-health.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideas only
      varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good deal; and
      afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill
      talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr. and
      Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him, and quite impatient for a
      letter, that she might know how he was, how were his spirits, how was his
      aunt, and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring.
      But, on the other hand, she could not admit herself to be unhappy, nor,
      after the first morning, to be less disposed for employment than usual;
      she was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could yet
      imagine him to have faults; and farther, though thinking of him so much,
      and, as she sat drawing or working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for
      the progress and close of their attachment, fancying interesting
      dialogues, and inventing elegant letters; the conclusion of every
      imaginary declaration on his side was that she <i>refused</i> <i>him</i>.
      Their affection was always to subside into friendship. Every thing tender
      and charming was to mark their parting; but still they were to part. When
      she became sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much
      in love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to
      quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must
      produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not find myself making any use of the word <i>sacrifice</i>,&rdquo; said
      she.&mdash;&ldquo;In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is
      there any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is not
      really necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will not
      persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love. I
      should be sorry to be more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He</i> is undoubtedly very much in love&mdash;every thing denotes it&mdash;very
      much in love indeed!&mdash;and when he comes again, if his affection
      continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.&mdash;It would be
      most inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not
      that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if
      he had believed me at all to share his feelings, he would not have been so
      wretched. Could he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and language
      at parting would have been different.&mdash;Still, however, I must be on
      my guard. This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it
      now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look upon him to
      be quite the sort of man&mdash;I do not altogether build upon his
      steadiness or constancy.&mdash;His feelings are warm, but I can imagine
      them rather changeable.&mdash;Every consideration of the subject, in
      short, makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.&mdash;I
      shall do very well again after a little while&mdash;and then, it will be a
      good thing over; for they say every body is in love once in their lives,
      and I shall have been let off easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and
      she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at
      first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had
      undervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving the
      particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the
      affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and
      describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed
      attractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of
      apology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.
      Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast between
      the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough
      touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have
      been said but for the restraints of propriety.&mdash;The charm of her own
      name was not wanting. <i>Miss</i> <i>Woodhouse</i> appeared more than
      once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a
      compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and in the
      very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by any such
      broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of her
      influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed.
      Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words&mdash;&ldquo;I
      had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss Woodhouse's
      beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus to her.&rdquo; This,
      Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was remembered only
      from being <i>her</i> friend. His information and prospects as to Enscombe
      were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill
      was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a
      time for coming to Randalls again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material
      part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned to
      Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she could
      still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without her. Her
      intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew more
      interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and
      happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words which clothed it,
      the &ldquo;beautiful little friend,&rdquo; suggested to her the idea of Harriet's
      succeeding her in his affections. Was it impossible?&mdash;No.&mdash;Harriet
      undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding; but he had been
      very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity
      of her manner; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion
      were in her favour.&mdash;For Harriet, it would be advantageous and
      delightful indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not dwell upon it,&rdquo; said she.&mdash;&ldquo;I must not think of it. I
      know the danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things have
      happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it will
      be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested
      friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, though it
      might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter
      was at hand. As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton's
      engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interest had
      entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill's
      disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the most irresistible
      form.&mdash;His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among them again;
      Mr. Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over the first
      letter from Enscombe before &ldquo;Mr. Elton and his bride&rdquo; was in every body's
      mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick at the sound. She
      had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and Harriet's mind,
      she had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength. With Mr.
      Weston's ball in view at least, there had been a great deal of
      insensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she had not
      attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual
      approach&mdash;new carriage, bell-ringing, and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings
      and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give. Emma felt
      that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet had a right to all
      her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy work to be for ever
      convincing without producing any effect, for ever agreed to, without being
      able to make their opinions the same. Harriet listened submissively, and
      said &ldquo;it was very true&mdash;it was just as Miss Woodhouse described&mdash;it
      was not worth while to think about them&mdash;and she would not think
      about them any longer&rdquo; but no change of subject could avail, and the next
      half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before. At
      last Emma attacked her on another ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton's
      marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make <i>me</i>. You
      could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into. It was
      all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure you.&mdash;Deceived
      myself, I did very miserably deceive you&mdash;and it will be a painful
      reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager
      exclamation. Emma continued,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk
      less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I would
      wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my
      comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is your
      duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of
      others, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity.
      These are the motives which I have been pressing on you. They are very
      important&mdash;and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to
      act upon them. My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.
      I want you to save yourself from greater pain. Perhaps I may sometimes
      have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due&mdash;or rather what
      would be kind by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea of
      wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really
      loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence of
      grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to what
      was right and support her in it very tolerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life&mdash;Want
      gratitude to you!&mdash;Nobody is equal to you!&mdash;I care for nobody as
      I do for you!&mdash;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and
      manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well,
      nor valued her affection so highly before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,&rdquo; said she afterwards to
      herself. &ldquo;There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and tenderness of
      heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the clearness of
      head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will. It is tenderness of
      heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved&mdash;which gives
      Isabella all her popularity.&mdash;I have it not&mdash;but I know how to
      prize and respect it.&mdash;Harriet is my superior in all the charm and
      all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!&mdash;I would not change you for
      the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing. Oh!
      the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!&mdash;Harriet is worth a hundred such&mdash;And
      for a wife&mdash;a sensible man's wife&mdash;it is invaluable. I mention
      no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be
      interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and it
      must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to settle
      whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or not pretty
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make
      her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a
      point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of the business might be
      gone through as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to
      which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to lace
      up her boot, without <i>recollecting</i>. A thousand vexatious thoughts
      would recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was not
      to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but she
      behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The visit was of
      course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind
      to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an
      opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the
      nothing-meaning terms of being &ldquo;elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault,
      but she suspected that there was no elegance;&mdash;ease, but not
      elegance.&mdash; She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a
      bride, there was too much ease. Her person was rather good; her face not
      unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were
      elegant. Emma thought at least it would turn out so.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear&mdash;but no, she would not
      permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was an
      awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man had
      need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman was better
      off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the privilege of
      bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to depend on; and
      when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in
      the same room at once with the woman he had just married, the woman he had
      wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she
      must allow him to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much
      affectedly, and as little really easy as could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Woodhouse,&rdquo; said Harriet, when they had quitted the house, and
      after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; &ldquo;Well, Miss Woodhouse,
      (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?&mdash;Is not she very
      charming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes&mdash;very&mdash;a very pleasing young woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no&mdash;there is nothing to surprize one at all.&mdash;A pretty
      fortune; and she came in his way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; returned Harriet, sighing again, &ldquo;I dare say she was very
      much attached to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman who
      loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this the
      best offer she was likely to have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Harriet earnestly, &ldquo;and well she might, nobody could ever have
      a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss
      Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just as
      superior as ever;&mdash;but being married, you know, it is quite a
      different thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can
      sit and admire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not
      thrown himself away, is such a comfort!&mdash;She does seem a charming
      young woman, just what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her
      'Augusta.' How delightful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see
      more and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be at Hartfield,
      and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter of
      an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and could composedly attend
      to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was
      a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and thinking much of
      her own importance; that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with
      manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all
      her notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living;
      that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her society would certainly
      do Mr. Elton no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself,
      she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it
      might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of her
      own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the
      alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, &ldquo;My brother Mr.
      Suckling's seat;&rdquo;&mdash;a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The
      grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was
      modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the
      size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or imagine.
      &ldquo;Very like Maple Grove indeed!&mdash;She was quite struck by the likeness!&mdash;That
      room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her
      sister's favourite room.&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Elton was appealed to.&mdash;&ldquo;Was not
      it astonishingly like?&mdash;She could really almost fancy herself at
      Maple Grove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the staircase&mdash;You know, as I came in, I observed how very like
      the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really
      could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very
      delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to
      as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a little
      sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body who sees it
      is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home. Whenever you
      are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very
      delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left
      behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient for
      Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house&mdash;the
      grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like. The
      laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand very
      much in the same way&mdash;just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse of a
      fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in mind!
      My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People who have
      extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same
      style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea that people
      who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive
      grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to attack an error so
      double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you
      have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you know.
      Surry is the garden of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many counties,
      I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as Surry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I fancy not,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile. &ldquo;I
      never heard any county but Surry called so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer
      at farthest,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Elton; &ldquo;and that will be our time for
      exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare
      say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four
      perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of <i>our</i> carriage,
      we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well. They
      would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season of the year.
      Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their bringing
      the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable. When people come
      into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one
      naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is
      extremely fond of exploring. We explored to King's-Weston twice last
      summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the
      barouche-landau. You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss
      Woodhouse, every summer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very
      striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we
      are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home
      than engage in schemes of pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can be
      more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple
      Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to Bristol, 'I
      really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely must go
      in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without
      a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will, would never
      stir beyond the park paling.' Many a time has she said so; and yet I am no
      advocate for entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary, when people shut
      themselves up entirely from society, it is a very bad thing; and that it
      is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree, without
      living in it either too much or too little. I perfectly understand your
      situation, however, Miss Woodhouse&mdash;(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse),
      Your father's state of health must be a great drawback. Why does not he
      try Bath?&mdash;Indeed he should. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure
      you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any
      benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,
      does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the
      waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath
      life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,
      that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits, which,
      I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its recommendations
      to <i>you</i>, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them. The
      advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood. It would
      be a charming introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and
      I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place. A
      line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my
      particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided with
      when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions, and would be
      the very person for you to go into public with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea of her
      being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an <i>introduction</i>&mdash;of
      her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs. Elton's&mdash;probably
      some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help of a boarder, just made a
      shift to live!&mdash;The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk
      indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have
      given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; &ldquo;but their going to Bath was
      quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that the
      place might suit her better than her father.&rdquo; And then, to prevent farther
      outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these occasions, a
      lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long known that
      you are a superior performer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior
      performer!&mdash;very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial
      a quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of music&mdash;passionately
      fond;&mdash;and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as
      to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is <i>mediocre</i> to the
      last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully. I assure
      you it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me, to
      hear what a musical society I am got into. I absolutely cannot do without
      music. It is a necessary of life to me; and having always been used to a
      very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been
      a most serious sacrifice. I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was
      speaking of my future home, and expressing his fears lest the retirement
      of it should be disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too&mdash;knowing
      what I had been accustomed to&mdash;of course he was not wholly without
      apprehension. When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that
      <i>the</i> <i>world</i> I could give up&mdash;parties, balls, plays&mdash;for
      I had no fear of retirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself,
      the world was not necessary to <i>me</i>. I could do very well without it.
      To those who had no resources it was a different thing; but my resources
      made me quite independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been
      used to, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly
      equal to any sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been
      accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two
      carriages were not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious
      apartments. 'But,' said I, 'to be quite honest, I do not think I can live
      without something of a musical society. I condition for nothing else; but
      without music, life would be a blank to me.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot suppose,&rdquo; said Emma, smiling, &ldquo;that Mr. Elton would hesitate to
      assure you of there being a <i>very</i> musical society in Highbury; and I
      hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be
      pardoned, in consideration of the motive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to find
      myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts
      together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a musical
      club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours. Will not it
      be a good plan? If <i>we</i> exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long
      in want of allies. Something of that nature would be particularly
      desirable for <i>me</i>, as an inducement to keep me in practice; for
      married women, you know&mdash;there is a sad story against them, in
      general. They are but too apt to give up music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, who are so extremely fond of it&mdash;there can be no danger,
      surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance, I
      tremble. Selina has entirely given up music&mdash;never touches the
      instrument&mdash;though she played sweetly. And the same may be said of
      Mrs. Jeffereys&mdash;Clara Partridge, that was&mdash;and of the two
      Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can
      enumerate. Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be
      quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a
      married woman has many things to call her attention. I believe I was half
      an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But every thing of that kind,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;will soon be in so regular a
      train&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Elton, laughing, &ldquo;we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing
      more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton chose another
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been calling at Randalls,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and found them both at
      home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely. Mr.
      Weston seems an excellent creature&mdash;quite a first-rate favourite with
      me already, I assure you. And <i>she</i> appears so truly good&mdash;there
      is something so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one
      directly. She was your governess, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly
      waited for the affirmative before she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very
      lady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Weston's manners,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;were always particularly good. Their
      propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest model for
      any young woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who do you think came in while we were there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance&mdash;and
      how could she possibly guess?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knightley!&rdquo; continued Mrs. Elton; &ldquo;Knightley himself!&mdash;Was not it
      lucky?&mdash;for, not being within when he called the other day, I had
      never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr.
      E.'s, I had a great curiosity. 'My friend Knightley' had been so often
      mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my caro
      sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend.
      Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much. Decidedly, I
      think, a very gentleman-like man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could
      breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insufferable woman!&rdquo; was her immediate exclamation. &ldquo;Worse than I had
      supposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!&mdash;I could not have
      believed it. Knightley!&mdash;never seen him in her life before, and call
      him Knightley!&mdash;and discover that he is a gentleman! A little
      upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her <i>caro</i> <i>sposo</i>,
      and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred
      finery. Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt
      whether he will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I
      could not have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite to
      form a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.
      Weston!&mdash;Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a
      gentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyond my
      hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank
      Churchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted he would
      be! Ah! there I am&mdash;thinking of him directly. Always the first person
      to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes as
      regularly into my mind!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her father
      had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure, and was
      ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; he deliberately began, &ldquo;considering we never saw her
      before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she was
      very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little
      quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe I am
      nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and poor
      Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved young
      lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think he had
      better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not having
      been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I said
      that I hoped I <i>should</i> in the course of the summer. But I ought to
      have gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it shews
      what a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: but a young lady&mdash;a bride&mdash;I ought to have paid my
      respects to her if possible. It was being very deficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why
      should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a <i>bride</i>? It ought
      to be no recommendation to <i>you</i>. It is encouraging people to marry
      if you make so much of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always
      wish to pay every proper attention to a lady&mdash;and a bride,
      especially, is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to <i>her</i>.
      A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others
      be who they may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what is.
      And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such
      vanity-baits for poor young ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere common
      politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any encouragement
      to people to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand <i>her</i>.
      Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences, and long, very long, did they
      occupy her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill
      opinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. Such as
      Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared
      whenever they met again,&mdash;self-important, presuming, familiar,
      ignorant, and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a little
      accomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself coming
      with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country
      neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in
      society as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently from
      his wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He had the air
      of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury, as
      not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her new
      acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging,
      following the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it for granted
      that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed
      herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton's praise passed from
      one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who
      readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of
      her being &ldquo;very pleasant and very elegantly dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first.
      Her feelings altered towards Emma.&mdash;Offended, probably, by the little
      encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew back in
      her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and though the
      effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was necessarily
      increasing Emma's dislike. Her manners, too&mdash;and Mr. Elton's, were
      unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and negligent. Emma hoped
      it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but the sensations which could prompt
      such behaviour sunk them both very much.&mdash;It was not to be doubted
      that poor Harriet's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve,
      and her own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable to
      her and the most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been given also.
      She was, of course, the object of their joint dislike.&mdash;When they had
      nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss
      Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to
      her, found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not
      merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to
      recommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied
      with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration&mdash;but without
      solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and
      befriend her.&mdash;Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about
      the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's
      knight-errantry on the subject.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.&mdash;I quite rave
      about Jane Fairfax.&mdash;A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and
      ladylike&mdash;and with such talents!&mdash;I assure you I think she has
      very extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays
      extremely well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point.
      Oh! she is absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth&mdash;but,
      upon my word, I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.&mdash;And her situation
      is so calculated to affect one!&mdash;Miss Woodhouse, we must exert
      ourselves and endeavour to do something for her. We must bring her
      forward. Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.&mdash;I
      dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        'Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
          'And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'
</pre>
    <p>
      We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot think there is any danger of it,&rdquo; was Emma's calm answer&mdash;&ldquo;and
      when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation and
      understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I have
      no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such
      obscurity, so thrown away.&mdash;Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed
      with the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it. I
      am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she feels
      the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I must confess it
      is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for timidity&mdash;and I
      am sure one does not often meet with it.&mdash;But in those who are at all
      inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure you, Jane Fairfax is
      a very delightful character, and interests me more than I can express.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You appear to feel a great deal&mdash;but I am not aware how you or any
      of Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known her
      longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act.
      You and I need not be afraid. If <i>we</i> set the example, many will
      follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. <i>We</i>
      have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and <i>we</i> live in a style
      which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least
      inconvenient.&mdash;I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to
      send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked <i>more</i>
      than Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of thing.
      It is not likely that I <i>should</i>, considering what I have been used
      to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the other
      way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple Grove
      will probably be my model more than it ought to be&mdash;for we do not at
      all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.&mdash;However, my
      resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.&mdash;I shall certainly
      have her very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall
      have musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly on
      the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very extensive,
      that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.&mdash;I
      shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my brother and sister
      when they come to us. I am sure they will like her extremely; and when she
      gets a little acquainted with them, her fears will completely wear off,
      for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly
      conciliating.&mdash;I shall have her very often indeed while they are with
      me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the
      barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Jane Fairfax!&rdquo;&mdash;thought Emma.&mdash;&ldquo;You have not deserved
      this. You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a
      punishment beyond what you can have merited!&mdash;The kindness and
      protection of Mrs. Elton!&mdash;'Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.' Heavens!
      Let me not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!&mdash;But
      upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that
      woman's tongue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma had not to listen to such paradings again&mdash;to any so exclusively
      addressed to herself&mdash;so disgustingly decorated with a &ldquo;dear Miss
      Woodhouse.&rdquo; The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared, and
      she was left in peace&mdash;neither forced to be the very particular
      friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very active
      patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general way,
      in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked on with some amusement.&mdash;Miss Bates's gratitude for Mrs.
      Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity
      and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies&mdash;the most amiable,
      affable, delightful woman&mdash;just as accomplished and condescending as
      Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma's only surprize was that Jane
      Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she
      seemed to do. She heard of her walking with the Eltons, sitting with the
      Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons! This was astonishing!&mdash;She
      could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss
      Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to
      offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a riddle, quite a riddle!&rdquo; said she.&mdash;&ldquo;To chuse to remain
      here month after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse
      the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of her
      conversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have
      always loved her with such real, generous affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells were
      gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had promised their
      daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh invitations had
      arrived for her to join them there. According to Miss Bates&mdash;it all
      came from her&mdash;Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly. Would Jane but
      go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends contrived&mdash;no
      travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had declined it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing this
      invitation,&rdquo; was Emma's conclusion. &ldquo;She must be under some sort of
      penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is great
      fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.&mdash;She is <i>not</i>
      to be with the <i>Dixons</i>. The decree is issued by somebody. But why
      must she consent to be with the Eltons?&mdash;Here is quite a separate
      puzzle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before the
      few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this apology
      for Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my
      dear Emma&mdash;but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a
      good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We
      must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for
      what she goes to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Mrs. Weston,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley warmly, &ldquo;Miss Fairfax is
      as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton. Could she
      have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen her. But
      (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions from Mrs.
      Elton, which nobody else pays her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she was
      herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presently replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, would rather
      disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton's invitations I should have
      imagined any thing but inviting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not wonder,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston, &ldquo;if Miss Fairfax were to have
      been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagerness in
      accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may very likely
      have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of
      intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in spite of the very
      natural wish of a little change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few minutes
      silence, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another thing must be taken into consideration too&mdash;Mrs. Elton does
      not talk <i>to</i> Miss Fairfax as she speaks <i>of</i> her. We all know
      the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest
      spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common
      civility in our personal intercourse with each other&mdash;a something
      more early implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that
      we may have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently.
      And besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be sure
      that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and
      manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect
      which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell
      in Mrs. Elton's way before&mdash;and no degree of vanity can prevent her
      acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if not in
      consciousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,&rdquo; said Emma. Little Henry was
      in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute
      what else to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;any body may know how highly I think of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon
      stopping&mdash;it was better, however, to know the worst at once&mdash;she
      hurried on&mdash;&ldquo;And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how
      highly it is. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some
      day or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather
      gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or some other
      cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! are you there?&mdash;But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave
      me a hint of it six weeks ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped.&mdash;Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not
      herself know what to think. In a moment he went on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare say,
      would not have me if I were to ask her&mdash;and I am very sure I shall
      never ask her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased enough
      to exclaim,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful&mdash;and in a manner
      which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making, for
      me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just now, meant
      nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without any idea of a
      serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the smallest wish for
      your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not come in and sit
      with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, &ldquo;No,
      Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me
      by surprize.&mdash;I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure
      you.&rdquo; And soon afterwards, &ldquo;Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman&mdash;but
      not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has not the open
      temper which a man would wish for in a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she,
      &ldquo;and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken; he
      asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or
      wittier than his neighbours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and
      wittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles&mdash;what
      she calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough in
      familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley&mdash;what can she do for Mr.
      Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her
      civilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs
      most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting
      away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax's
      mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's acknowledging
      herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any
      restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding. I cannot imagine
      that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise,
      encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be continually
      detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring her a permanent
      situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which
      are to take place in the barouche-landau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane Fairfax has feeling,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley&mdash;&ldquo;I do not accuse her
      of want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong&mdash;and her
      temper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control; but
      it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than she used
      to be&mdash;And I love an open temper. No&mdash;till Cole alluded to my
      supposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax and
      conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always&mdash;but with no
      thought beyond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Weston,&rdquo; said Emma triumphantly when he left them, &ldquo;what do
      you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the
      idea of <i>not</i> being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it
      were to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was
      disposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties and
      evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed in
      so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to
      have a disengaged day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see how it is,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I see what a life I am to lead among you.
      Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite the
      fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very formidable.
      From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a disengaged day!&mdash;A
      woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have been at a loss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made evening-parties
      perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for
      dinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at the
      poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury
      card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a good
      deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon shew them
      how every thing ought to be arranged. In the course of the spring she must
      return their civilities by one very superior party&mdash;in which her
      card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken
      packs in the true style&mdash;and more waiters engaged for the evening
      than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the
      refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at
      Hartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she should
      be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful
      resentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it for ten
      minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the usual
      stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself, with the
      usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the Eltons, it
      must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of course&mdash;and
      it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to
      make the eighth:&mdash;but this invitation was not given with equal
      satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by
      Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it. &ldquo;She would rather not be in
      his company more than she could help. She was not yet quite able to see
      him and his charming happy wife together, without feeling uncomfortable.
      If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she would rather stay at home.&rdquo;
       It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had she deemed it possible
      enough for wishing. She was delighted with the fortitude of her little
      friend&mdash;for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in
      company and stay at home; and she could now invite the very person whom
      she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.&mdash; Since her last
      conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she was more
      conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been.&mdash;Mr.
      Knightley's words dwelt with her. He had said that Jane Fairfax received
      attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very true,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;at least as far as relates to me, which
      was all that was meant&mdash;and it is very shameful.&mdash;Of the same
      age&mdash;and always knowing her&mdash;I ought to have been more her
      friend.&mdash;She will never like me now. I have neglected her too long.
      But I will shew her greater attention than I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and all happy.&mdash;The
      preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet over. A
      circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest little Knightleys
      were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the
      spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and staying one whole
      day at Hartfield&mdash;which one day would be the very day of this party.&mdash;His
      professional engagements did not allow of his being put off, but both
      father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so. Mr. Woodhouse
      considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves
      could bear&mdash;and here would be a ninth&mdash;and Emma apprehended that
      it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even
      to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party.
    </p>
    <p>
      She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by
      representing that though he certainly would make them nine, yet he always
      said so little, that the increase of noise would be very immaterial. She
      thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to have him with his
      grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John
      Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must
      be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in the evening,
      but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease; and the
      seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic
      composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the chief of even
      Emma's vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John Knightley
      seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable. Instead
      of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner, he
      was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton, as elegant as lace and pearls
      could make her, he looked at in silence&mdash;wanting only to observe
      enough for Isabella's information&mdash;but Miss Fairfax was an old
      acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talk to her. He had met her
      before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys,
      when it had been just beginning to rain. It was natural to have some civil
      hopes on the subject, and he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am sure
      you must have been wet.&mdash;We scarcely got home in time. I hope you
      turned directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went only to the post-office,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and reached home before the
      rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters when I am
      here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A walk before
      breakfast does me good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards
      from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry and
      John had seen more drops than they could count long before. The
      post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you have
      lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth going
      through the rain for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little blush, and then this answer,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every
      dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older
      should make me indifferent about letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indifferent! Oh! no&mdash;I never conceived you could become indifferent.
      Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very positive
      curse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often thought them the worst of the two,&rdquo; replied he coolly.
      &ldquo;Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well&mdash;I
      am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I
      can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than to
      me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the
      difference, it is not age, but situation. You have every body dearest to
      you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again; and therefore till I
      have outlived all my affections, a post-office, I think, must always have
      power to draw me out, in worse weather than to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,&rdquo;
       said John Knightley, &ldquo;I meant to imply the change of situation which time
      usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time will generally
      lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle&mdash;but
      that is not the change I had in view for you. As an old friend, you will
      allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years hence you may have as many
      concentrated objects as I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant &ldquo;thank
      you&rdquo; seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear in
      the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her attention was now
      claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on such
      occasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his particular
      compliments to the ladies, was ending with her&mdash;and with all his
      mildest urbanity, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning in
      the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.&mdash;Young ladies
      are delicate plants. They should take care of their health and their
      complexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind
      solicitude about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.&mdash;I
      hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very old
      friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You do us a
      great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I are both highly
      sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing
      you at Hartfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had
      done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her
      remonstrances now opened upon Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jane, what is this I hear?&mdash;Going to the post-office in the
      rain!&mdash;This must not be, I assure you.&mdash;You sad girl, how could
      you do such a thing?&mdash;It is a sign I was not there to take care of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do not tell <i>me</i>. You really are a very sad girl, and do not
      know how to take care of yourself.&mdash;To the post-office indeed! Mrs.
      Weston, did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our
      authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My advice,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, &ldquo;I certainly do
      feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.&mdash;Liable
      as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly
      careful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think
      requires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even half a
      day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your cough again.
      Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are much too
      reasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! she <i>shall</i> <i>not</i> do such a thing again,&rdquo; eagerly rejoined
      Mrs. Elton. &ldquo;We will not allow her to do such a thing again:&rdquo;&mdash;and
      nodding significantly&mdash;&ldquo;there must be some arrangement made, there
      must indeed. I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every
      morning (one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too
      and bring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and
      from <i>us</i> I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to
      accept such an accommodation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are extremely kind,&rdquo; said Jane; &ldquo;but I cannot give up my early walk.
      I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk somewhere,
      and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have scarcely ever
      had a bad morning before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is
      (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing
      without the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston, you
      and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter myself,
      my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I meet with
      no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Jane earnestly, &ldquo;I cannot by any means consent to such
      an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the errand
      were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am not
      here, by my grandmama's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!&mdash;And it is a kindness
      to employ our men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of
      answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The post-office is a wonderful establishment!&rdquo; said she.&mdash;&ldquo;The
      regularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do, and
      all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certainly very well regulated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that a
      letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom,
      is even carried wrong&mdash;and not one in a million, I suppose, actually
      lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad hands too,
      that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clerks grow expert from habit.&mdash;They must begin with some
      quickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any
      farther explanation,&rdquo; continued he, smiling, &ldquo;they are paid for it. That
      is the key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual
      observations made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard it asserted,&rdquo; said John Knightley, &ldquo;that the same sort of
      handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master teaches,
      it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine the likeness
      must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have very little
      teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand they can get.
      Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I have not always
      known their writing apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his brother hesitatingly, &ldquo;there is a likeness. I know what
      you mean&mdash;but Emma's hand is the strongest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,&rdquo; said Mr. Woodhouse; &ldquo;and
      always did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston&rdquo;&mdash;with half a sigh and half
      a smile at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw any gentleman's handwriting&rdquo;&mdash;Emma began, looking also
      at Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending
      to some one else&mdash;and the pause gave her time to reflect, &ldquo;Now, how
      am I going to introduce him?&mdash;Am I unequal to speaking his name at
      once before all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout
      phrase?&mdash;Your Yorkshire friend&mdash;your correspondent in Yorkshire;&mdash;that
      would be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.&mdash;No, I can pronounce
      his name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better and better.&mdash;Now
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Frank Churchill
      writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not admire it,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley. &ldquo;It is too small&mdash;wants
      strength. It is like a woman's writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him against the
      base aspersion. &ldquo;No, it by no means wanted strength&mdash;it was not a
      large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston any
      letter about her to produce?&rdquo; No, she had heard from him very lately, but
      having answered the letter, had put it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we were in the other room,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;if I had my writing-desk, I am
      sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his.&mdash;Do not you
      remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He chose to say he was employed&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince
      Mr. Knightley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Knightley dryly, &ldquo;writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will, of
      course, put forth his best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was on table.&mdash;Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, was
      ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be
      allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma. She
      had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet
      walk of this morning had produced any. She suspected that it <i>had</i>;
      that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full
      expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had not been
      in vain. She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual&mdash;a
      glow both of complexion and spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the
      expense of the Irish mails;&mdash;it was at her tongue's end&mdash;but she
      abstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt
      Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of the
      room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the
      beauty and grace of each.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found it
      hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;&mdash;with
      so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross
      Jane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be
      almost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton left
      them no choice. If Jane repressed her for a little time, she soon began
      again; and though much that passed between them was in a half-whisper,
      especially on Mrs. Elton's side, there was no avoiding a knowledge of
      their principal subjects: The post-office&mdash;catching cold&mdash;fetching
      letters&mdash;and friendship, were long under discussion; and to them
      succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane&mdash;inquiries
      whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and
      professions of Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is April come!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I get quite anxious about you. June will
      soon be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have never fixed on June or any other month&mdash;merely looked
      forward to the summer in general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have you really heard of nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the
      difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I not aware!&rdquo; said Jane, shaking her head; &ldquo;dear Mrs. Elton, who can have
      thought of it as I have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know how
      many candidates there always are for the <i>first</i> situations. I saw a
      vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of Mr.
      Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every body
      was anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first circle.
      Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable! Of all
      houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see
      you in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,&rdquo; said
      Jane. &ldquo;I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want it;&mdash;afterwards
      I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would not wish you to
      take the trouble of making any inquiries at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me trouble;
      but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be more
      interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day
      or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out for any
      thing eligible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her;
      till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June, or
      say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before us.
      Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you deserve, and
      your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence, is not
      obtained at a moment's notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring
      directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry
      myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am
      quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long
      unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon
      produce something&mdash;Offices for the sale&mdash;not quite of human
      flesh&mdash;but of human intellect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the
      slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the
      abolition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,&rdquo; replied Jane;
      &ldquo;governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely
      different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to
      the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But I only
      mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by applying to
      them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something that would do!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Elton. &ldquo;Aye, <i>that</i> may suit
      your humble ideas of yourself;&mdash;I know what a modest creature you
      are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any
      thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family not
      moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent; it
      would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I think,
      would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison. A
      gentleman's family is all that I should condition for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall be
      a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my
      side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the first
      circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own
      terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family as much as
      you chose;&mdash;that is&mdash;I do not know&mdash;if you knew the harp,
      you might do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;&mdash;yes,
      I really believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what you
      chose;&mdash;and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and
      comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a
      situation together,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;they are pretty sure to be equal;
      however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at
      present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am obliged
      to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to
      be done till the summer. For two or three months longer I shall remain
      where I am, and as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am quite serious too, I assure you,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Elton gaily, &ldquo;in
      resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to watch
      also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr.
      Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of object, and
      Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!&mdash;Only think of his
      gallantry in coming away before the other men!&mdash;what a dear creature
      he is;&mdash;I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that
      quaint, old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern
      ease; modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I
      wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you
      I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I am
      rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you like it?&mdash;Selina's
      choice&mdash;handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is not
      over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being
      over-trimmed&mdash;quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments
      now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like a
      bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress
      is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the minority, I
      believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,&mdash;show and
      finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a trimming as
      this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will look well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr.
      Weston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a late dinner,
      and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He had been too much
      expected by the best judges, for surprize&mdash;but there was great joy.
      Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been
      sorry to see him before. John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.&mdash;That
      a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of
      business in London, should set off again, and walk half a mile to another
      man's house, for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of
      finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers, was
      a circumstance to strike him deeply. A man who had been in motion since
      eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been still, who had been
      long talking, and might have been silent, who had been in more than one
      crowd, and might have been alone!&mdash;Such a man, to quit the
      tranquillity and independence of his own fireside, and on the evening of a
      cold sleety April day rush out again into the world!&mdash;Could he by a
      touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife, there would have
      been a motive; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up
      the party. John Knightley looked at him with amazement, then shrugged his
      shoulders, and said, &ldquo;I could not have believed it even of <i>him</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was
      exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being
      principal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was making
      himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the inquiries of
      his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of all her careful
      directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread abroad what
      public news he had heard, was proceeding to a family communication, which,
      though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he had not the smallest doubt
      of being highly interesting to every body in the room. He gave her a
      letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way,
      and had taken the liberty of opening it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it, read it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it will give you pleasure; only a few lines&mdash;will
      not take you long; read it to Emma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking to
      them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible to
      every body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say to
      it?&mdash;I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?&mdash;Anne,
      my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?&mdash;In
      town next week, you see&mdash;at the latest, I dare say; for <i>she</i> is
      as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most
      likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, all
      nothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us
      again, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come, and
      he will be half his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted. Well,
      pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read it all?
      Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some other time,
      but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the circumstance to the
      others in a common way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looks and
      words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she was happy,
      and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warm and open;
      but Emma could not speak so fluently. <i>She</i> was a little occupied in
      weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her
      agitation, which she rather thought was considerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative to
      want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say, and
      soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial
      communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he might not
      have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly delighted.
      They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made
      happy;&mdash;from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she
      was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have been
      too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and
      her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Weston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her
      by such a hope, smiled most graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,&rdquo; he continued&mdash;&ldquo;and
      know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sure Mr.
      Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great
      pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very obliging.&mdash;Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.&mdash;
      He is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a
      letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my
      son's hand, presumed to open it&mdash;though it was not directed to me&mdash;it
      was to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. I
      hardly ever get a letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr. Weston&mdash;(laughing
      affectedly) I must protest against that.&mdash;A most dangerous precedent
      indeed!&mdash;I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.&mdash;Upon
      my word, if this is what I am to expect, we married women must begin to
      exert ourselves!&mdash;Oh! Mr. Weston, I could not have believed it of
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs. Elton.&mdash;This
      letter tells us&mdash;it is a short letter&mdash;written in a hurry,
      merely to give us notice&mdash;it tells us that they are all coming up to
      town directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account&mdash;she has not been well the
      whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her&mdash;so they are all
      to move southward without loss of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&mdash;from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a
      considerable journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than from
      Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people of
      large fortune?&mdash;You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.
      Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me&mdash;but
      twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with
      four horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evil of the distance from Enscombe,&rdquo; said Mr. Weston, &ldquo;is, that Mrs.
      Churchill, <i>as</i> <i>we</i> <i>understand</i>, has not been able to
      leave the sofa for a week together. In Frank's last letter she complained,
      he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having
      both his arm and his uncle's! This, you know, speaks a great degree of
      weakness&mdash;but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means
      to sleep only two nights on the road.&mdash;So Frank writes word.
      Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs.
      Elton. You must grant me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my own
      sex. I do indeed. I give you notice&mdash;You will find me a formidable
      antagonist on that point. I always stand up for women&mdash;and I assure
      you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you
      would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's making incredible exertions to avoid
      it. Selina says it is quite horror to her&mdash;and I believe I have
      caught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets; an
      excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady
      ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure you.
      Do not run away with such an idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough a
      fine lady as any body ever beheld.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly. It
      was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was <i>not</i>
      a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it;&mdash;and
      she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr. Weston went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect&mdash;but
      this is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, and therefore
      I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health now; but <i>that</i>
      indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I would not say so to
      every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill's
      illness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?&mdash;To Bath, or
      to Clifton?&rdquo; &ldquo;She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for
      her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has now
      been a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she
      begins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very
      retired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye&mdash;like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired
      from the road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it!
      You seem shut out from every thing&mdash;in the most complete retirement.&mdash;And
      Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy
      that sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough in
      herself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman cannot
      have too many resources&mdash;and I feel very thankful that I have so many
      myself as to be quite independent of society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank was here in February for a fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I remember to have heard. He will find an <i>addition</i> to the
      society of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call
      myself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of there being
      such a creature in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr. Weston,
      with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible.
      Not heard of you!&mdash;I believe Mrs. Weston's letters lately have been
      full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had done his duty and could return to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Frank left us,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;it was quite uncertain when we might
      see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome. It has been
      completely unexpected. That is, <i>I</i> always had a strong persuasion he
      would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn up&mdash;but
      nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding.
      'How could he contrive to come? And how could it be supposed that his
      uncle and aunt would spare him again?' and so forth&mdash;I always felt
      that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see. I have
      observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if things are going
      untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say to a
      certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, because
      things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity which
      suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that he was
      sure at this rate it would be <i>May</i> before Hymen's saffron robe would
      be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy
      ideas and give him cheerfuller views! The carriage&mdash;we had
      disappointments about the carriage;&mdash;one morning, I remember, he came
      to me quite in despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly
      seized the opportunity of going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is
      ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than
      Enscombe&mdash;in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable
      prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring&mdash;precisely
      the season of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at
      the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and
      never too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the best of
      it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there
      always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we
      intended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I do
      not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of
      constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow,
      and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than having him
      actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the state of mind
      which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be pleased with my
      son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally thought a fine
      young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston's partiality for him
      is very great, and, as you may suppose, most gratifying to me. She thinks
      nobody equal to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion
      will be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr.
      Frank Churchill.&mdash;At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am
      one of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means
      implicitly guided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son, so
      I shall judge of him.&mdash;I am no flatterer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weston was musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said he presently, &ldquo;I have not been severe upon poor Mrs.
      Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but there
      are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak
      of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant, Mrs.
      Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have met
      with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid to her.
      She was the instigator. Frank's mother would never have been slighted as
      she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing to
      his wife's: his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that
      would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome;
      but her pride is arrogance and insolence! And what inclines one less to
      bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood. She was nobody when he
      married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being
      turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd them all in high and
      mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite a
      horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people
      of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an
      annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves!
      Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them directly. People
      of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and encumbered with many
      low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on
      a footing with the old established families. A year and a half is the very
      utmost that they can have lived at West Hall; and how they got their
      fortune nobody knows. They came from Birmingham, which is not a place to
      promise much, you know, Mr. Weston. One has not great hopes from
      Birmingham. I always say there is something direful in the sound: but
      nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things
      I assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently think
      themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one
      of their nearest neighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who
      has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it
      before him&mdash;I believe, at least&mdash;I am almost sure that old Mr.
      Suckling had completed the purchase before his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having said
      all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse
      to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers, and Emma
      doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed little
      disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which nobody had
      inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would
      have made her prefer being silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to leave
      them early the next day; and he soon began with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys;
      but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down at full length
      there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise than her's, and
      probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to recommend being
      comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather hope to satisfy you both,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;for I shall do all in my
      power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and happiness
      must preclude false indulgence and physic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very likely. You think so, do not you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father&mdash;or
      even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue
      to increase as much as they have done lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Increase!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a great
      difference in your way of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Difference! No indeed I am not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than
      you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for only one
      day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!&mdash;When did it happen
      before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing, and you
      mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella brought an
      account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown.
      The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is
      very great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his brother quickly, &ldquo;it is Randalls that does it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less
      influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma, that
      Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I only beg
      you to send them home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Mr. Knightley, &ldquo;that need not be the consequence. Let them be
      sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; exclaimed Emma, &ldquo;you amuse me! I should like to know how
      many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the
      party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend
      to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine&mdash;what have they
      been? Dining once with the Coles&mdash;and having a ball talked of, which
      never took place. I can understand you&mdash;(nodding at Mr. John
      Knightley)&mdash;your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends
      at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning
      to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from
      Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I
      cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt
      Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much better
      with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where she
      is absent one&mdash;and who, when he is at home, is either reading to
      himself or settling his accounts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without
      difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature
      of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She was soon
      convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive
      or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment had really subsided
      into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;&mdash;but if he, who
      had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two, were to
      be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away, it
      would be very distressing. If a separation of two months should not have
      cooled him, there were dangers and evils before her:&mdash;caution for him
      and for herself would be necessary. She did not mean to have her own
      affections entangled again, and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any
      encouragement of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.
      That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance!
      and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something decisive. She
      felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis, an event,
      a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,
      before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's
      feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been
      imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards. He rode down for a
      couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came from Randalls
      immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all her quick
      observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced, and how she
      must act. They met with the utmost friendliness. There could be no doubt
      of his great pleasure in seeing her. But she had an almost instant doubt
      of his caring for her as he had done, of his feeling the same tenderness
      in the same degree. She watched him well. It was a clear thing he was less
      in love than he had been. Absence, with the conviction probably of her
      indifference, had produced this very natural and very desirable effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed
      delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and he
      was not without agitation. It was not in his calmness that she read his
      comparative difference. He was not calm; his spirits were evidently
      fluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively as he was, it seemed a
      liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what decided her belief on
      the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an hour, and hurrying away
      to make other calls in Highbury. &ldquo;He had seen a group of old acquaintance
      in the street as he passed&mdash;he had not stopped, he would not stop for
      more than a word&mdash;but he had the vanity to think they would be
      disappointed if he did not call, and much as he wished to stay longer at
      Hartfield, he must hurry off.&rdquo; She had no doubt as to his being less in
      love&mdash;but neither his agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed
      like a perfect cure; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a
      dread of her returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting
      himself with her long.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days. He
      was often hoping, intending to come&mdash;but was always prevented. His
      aunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account at
      Randall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was to
      be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been of no service
      to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she was really ill was
      very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it, at Randalls. Though
      much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he looked back, that she was
      in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago. He did not
      believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not
      remove, or at least that she might not have many years of existence before
      her; but he could not be prevailed on, by all his father's doubts, to say
      that her complaints were merely imaginary, or that she was as strong as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She could not
      endure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation and
      suffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to Randalls
      communicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to
      Richmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an
      eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A
      ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit
      expected from the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,
      and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months
      before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends&mdash;for the
      house was taken for May and June. She was told that now he wrote with the
      greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he could
      even wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He was
      considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. She hoped
      it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted. It
      was the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be
      really having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to a
      young man?&mdash;An hour's ride. He would be always coming over. The
      difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the
      whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteen miles&mdash;nay,
      eighteen&mdash;it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street&mdash;was a
      serious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be spent in
      coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him in London; he
      might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy
      intercourse. Better than nearer!
    </p>
    <p>
      One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,&mdash;the
      ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before, but it had been soon
      acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now, however, it was absolutely
      to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon after the Churchills
      had removed to Richmond, a few lines from Frank, to say that his aunt felt
      already much better for the change, and that he had no doubt of being able
      to join them for twenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name
      as early a day as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood
      between the young people of Highbury and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him.
      May was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to
      spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely
      hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any
      thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached, the
      day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank
      Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls before
      dinner, and every thing was safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room at the
      Crown was to witness it;&mdash;but it would be better than a common
      meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties
      for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves, for the
      purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms
      before any other persons came, that she could not refuse him, and must
      therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company. She was to
      convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls
      party just sufficiently before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not
      say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.
      They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should
      be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another
      carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great
      surprize. &ldquo;So unreasonably early!&rdquo; she was going to exclaim; but she
      presently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like
      herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and they
      were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been
      entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness, on the
      same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected
      together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston
      depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had
      so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first distinction in
      the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but a little less of
      open-heartedness would have made him a higher character.&mdash;General
      benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man what he ought to be.&mdash;She
      could fancy such a man. The whole party walked about, and looked, and
      praised again; and then, having nothing else to do, formed a sort of
      half-circle round the fire, to observe in their various modes, till other
      subjects were started, that, though <i>May</i>, a fire in the evening was
      still very pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of privy
      councillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates's door to
      offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be brought
      by the Eltons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,
      which shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to the
      door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,&mdash;impatient to
      begin, or afraid of being always near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Elton was spoken of. &ldquo;I think she must be here soon,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
      have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her. It
      cannot be long, I think, before she comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back,
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen
      either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!&rdquo; said Mr. Weston, looking about. &ldquo;We
      thought you were to bring them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma
      longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how he
      was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of
      graciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion, by
      giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the carriage returned.&mdash;Somebody talked of rain.&mdash;&ldquo;I
      will see that there are umbrellas, sir,&rdquo; said Frank to his father: &ldquo;Miss
      Bates must not be forgotten:&rdquo; and away he went. Mr. Weston was following;
      but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion of his son; and
      so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself, though by no means
      moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you I
      should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely
      pleased with him.&mdash;You may believe me. I never compliment. I think
      him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like
      and approve&mdash;so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or
      puppyism. You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies&mdash;quite a
      horror of them. They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr.
      Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to
      say very cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with
      them much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; but when
      she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies just
      arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. &ldquo;I have no doubt of its being our
      carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so
      extremely expeditious!&mdash;I believe we drive faster than any body.&mdash;What
      a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!&mdash;I understand
      you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite
      unnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care of <i>them</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into
      the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.
      Weston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be understood
      by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every body's words,
      were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in
      talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her
      being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door opened she was
      heard,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So very obliging of you!&mdash;No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do
      not care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares&mdash;Well!&mdash;(as
      soon as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!&mdash;This
      is admirable!&mdash;Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting.
      Could not have imagined it.&mdash;So well lighted up!&mdash;Jane, Jane,
      look!&mdash;did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really
      have had Aladdin's lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room
      again. I saw her as I came in; she was standing in the entrance. 'Oh! Mrs.
      Stokes,' said I&mdash;but I had not time for more.&rdquo; She was now met by
      Mrs. Weston.&mdash;&ldquo;Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite
      well. Very happy to hear it. So afraid you might have a headache!&mdash;seeing
      you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have.
      Delighted to hear it indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for
      the carriage!&mdash;excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep
      the horses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.&mdash;Oh! and I am sure
      our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most
      kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.&mdash;But two such offers
      in one day!&mdash;Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, 'Upon
      my word, ma'am&mdash;.' Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to
      Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her take her shawl&mdash;for the evenings are not
      warm&mdash;her large new shawl&mdash; Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.&mdash;So
      kind of her to think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know&mdash;Mr.
      Dixon's choice. There were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated
      about some time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane,
      are you sure you did not wet your feet?&mdash;It was but a drop or two,
      but I am so afraid:&mdash;but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely&mdash;and
      there was a mat to step upon&mdash;I shall never forget his extreme
      politeness.&mdash;Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my mother's
      spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never came out again.
      My mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not she, Jane?&mdash;Do
      not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?&mdash;Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.&mdash;Dear
      Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?&mdash;Very well I thank you, quite well.
      This is meeting quite in fairy-land!&mdash;Such a transformation!&mdash;Must
      not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma most complacently)&mdash;that would be
      rude&mdash;but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse, you do look&mdash;how do you
      like Jane's hair?&mdash;You are a judge.&mdash;She did it all herself.
      Quite wonderful how she does her hair!&mdash;No hairdresser from London I
      think could.&mdash;Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare&mdash;and Mrs. Hughes. Must go
      and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.&mdash;How do you do? How do
      you do?&mdash;Very well, I thank you. This is delightful, is not it?&mdash;Where's
      dear Mr. Richard?&mdash;Oh! there he is. Don't disturb him. Much better
      employed talking to the young ladies. How do you do, Mr. Richard?&mdash;I
      saw you the other day as you rode through the town&mdash;Mrs. Otway, I
      protest!&mdash;and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.&mdash;Such
      a host of friends!&mdash;and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!&mdash;How do you
      do? How do you all do?&mdash;Quite well, I am much obliged to you. Never
      better.&mdash;Don't I hear another carriage?&mdash;Who can this be?&mdash;very
      likely the worthy Coles.&mdash;Upon my word, this is charming to be
      standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!&mdash;I am quite
      roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me&mdash;never take coffee.&mdash;A
      little tea if you please, sir, by and bye,&mdash;no hurry&mdash;Oh! here
      it comes. Every thing so good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss Bates
      was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs.
      Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind her.&mdash;He
      was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she could not determine.
      After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look, compliments
      very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be
      complimented herself&mdash;and it was, &ldquo;How do you like my gown?&mdash;How
      do you like my trimming?&mdash;How has Wright done my hair?&rdquo;&mdash;with
      many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness. Mrs.
      Elton then said, &ldquo;Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do&mdash;but
      upon such an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon me,
      and in compliment to the Westons&mdash;who I have no doubt are giving this
      ball chiefly to do me honour&mdash;I would not wish to be inferior to
      others. And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.&mdash;So Frank
      Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.&mdash;We shall see if our
      styles suit.&mdash;A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill. I like
      him very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not but
      imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear more;&mdash;and
      the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till another suspension
      brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly forward.&mdash;Mr. Elton had
      just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?&mdash;I
      was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient
      for tidings of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane!&rdquo;&mdash;repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and
      displeasure.&mdash;&ldquo;That is easy&mdash;but Miss Fairfax does not
      disapprove it, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like Mrs. Elton?&rdquo; said Emma in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are ungrateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ungrateful!&mdash;What do you mean?&rdquo; Then changing from a frown to a
      smile&mdash;&ldquo;No, do not tell me&mdash;I do not want to know what you mean.&mdash;Where
      is my father?&mdash;When are we to begin dancing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked
      off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and Mrs.
      Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be laid
      before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton must be
      asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which interfered with
      all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.&mdash;Emma heard the sad
      truth with fortitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?&rdquo; said Mr. Weston.
      &ldquo;She will think Frank ought to ask her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted
      himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect
      approbation of&mdash;and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting <i>him</i>
      to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to
      persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.&mdash;Mr. Weston and
      Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed.
      Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she had always
      considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was almost enough to make
      her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this
      time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to begin
      with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston might
      be his son's superior.&mdash;In spite of this little rub, however, Emma
      was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the
      set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual
      festivity before her.&mdash;She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not
      dancing than by any thing else.&mdash;There he was, among the standers-by,
      where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,&mdash;not classing
      himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who were
      pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made
      up,&mdash;so young as he looked!&mdash;He could not have appeared to
      greater advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had placed himself. His
      tall, firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders
      of the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes;
      and, excepting her own partner, there was not one among the whole row of
      young men who could be compared with him.&mdash;He moved a few steps
      nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a
      manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he but take
      the trouble.&mdash;Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile;
      but in general he was looking grave. She wished he could love a ballroom
      better, and could like Frank Churchill better.&mdash;He seemed often
      observing her. She must not flatter herself that he thought of her
      dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feel
      afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.
      They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That Frank
      Churchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant attentions
      of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed happy; and the
      praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom bestowed till after a
      ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the
      existence of this. Of very important, very recordable events, it was not
      more productive than such meetings usually are. There was one, however,
      which Emma thought something of.&mdash;The two last dances before supper
      were begun, and Harriet had no partner;&mdash;the only young lady sitting
      down;&mdash;and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how
      there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!&mdash;But Emma's wonder
      lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would
      not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided: she was sure
      he would not&mdash;and she was expecting him every moment to escape into
      the card-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room where
      the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front of
      them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of maintaining it. He
      did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or speaking to
      those who were close to her.&mdash;Emma saw it. She was not yet dancing;
      she was working her way up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to
      look around, and by only turning her head a little she saw it all. When
      she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and
      she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near,
      that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place
      between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife, who was
      standing immediately above her, was not only listening also, but even
      encouraging him by significant glances.&mdash;The kind-hearted, gentle
      Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say, &ldquo;Do not you dance, Mr.
      Elton?&rdquo; to which his prompt reply was, &ldquo;Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you
      will dance with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&mdash;oh! no&mdash;I would get you a better partner than myself. I am
      no dancer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall have great pleasure,
      I am sure&mdash;for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married
      man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great
      pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady disengaged
      whom I should be very glad to see dancing&mdash;Miss Smith.&rdquo; &ldquo;Miss Smith!&mdash;oh!&mdash;I
      had not observed.&mdash;You are extremely obliging&mdash;and if I were not
      an old married man.&mdash;But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston. You
      will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your
      command&mdash;but my dancing days are over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and
      mortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton! the
      amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.&mdash;She looked round for a moment;
      he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging
      himself for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between
      him and his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her face
      might be as hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment a happier sight caught her;&mdash;Mr. Knightley leading
      Harriet to the set!&mdash;Never had she been more surprized, seldom more
      delighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude, both
      for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though too
      distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could catch
      his eye again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;
      and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for the
      cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment and very
      high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced. It was
      not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever, flew farther down
      the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very
      foolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though
      growing very like her;&mdash;<i>she</i> spoke some of her feelings, by
      observing audibly to her partner,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!&mdash;Very
      good-natured, I declare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from
      that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table and
      taking up her spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?&mdash;Here is your tippet. Mrs.
      Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there will
      be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done&mdash;One
      door nailed up&mdash;Quantities of matting&mdash;My dear Jane, indeed you
      must. Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!&mdash;so
      gratified! Excellent dancing indeed!&mdash;Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I
      said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody
      missed me.&mdash;I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.
      Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a
      vast deal of chat, and backgammon.&mdash;Tea was made downstairs, biscuits
      and baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of
      her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused,
      and who were your partners. 'Oh!' said I, 'I shall not forestall Jane; I
      left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you all
      about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton, I do not know
      who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' My dear sir, you are too
      obliging.&mdash;Is there nobody you would not rather?&mdash;I am not
      helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and me on
      the other!&mdash;Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is
      going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!&mdash;Beautiful lace!&mdash;Now
      we all follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!&mdash;Well,
      here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps.
      Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very
      odd! I was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any
      thing equal to the comfort and style&mdash;Candles everywhere.&mdash;I was
      telling you of your grandmama, Jane,&mdash;There was a little
      disappointment.&mdash;The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their
      way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some
      asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the
      asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing
      grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus&mdash;so she was
      rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body,
      for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very
      much concerned!&mdash;Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could
      not have supposed any thing!&mdash;Such elegance and profusion!&mdash;I
      have seen nothing like it since&mdash;Well, where shall we sit? where
      shall we sit? Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a draught. Where <i>I</i>
      sit is of no consequence. Oh! do you recommend this side?&mdash;Well, I am
      sure, Mr. Churchill&mdash;only it seems too good&mdash;but just as you
      please. What you direct in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how
      shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me!
      I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I cannot
      help beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;
      but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited him
      irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in his reprobation
      of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs.
      Elton's looks also received the due share of censure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Emma, why is it that
      they are your enemies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added, &ldquo;<i>She</i>
      ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may be.&mdash;To
      that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that you did
      want him to marry Harriet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied Emma, &ldquo;and they cannot forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he
      only said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you trust me with such flatterers?&mdash;Does my vain spirit ever
      tell me I am wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.&mdash;If one leads you
      wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There is a
      littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not: and I was
      fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was through a series
      of strange blunders!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice
      to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for
      himself.&mdash;Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs.
      Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl&mdash;infinitely
      to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs.
      Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was extremely gratified.&mdash;They were interrupted by the bustle of
      Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?&mdash;Come
      Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy! Every body is
      asleep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;whenever I am wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom are you going to dance with?&rdquo; asked Mr. Knightley.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated a moment, and then replied, &ldquo;With you, if you will ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; said he, offering his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are not
      really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother and sister! no, indeed.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable
      pleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which she
      walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.&mdash;She was extremely
      glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons,
      and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike; and
      his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was peculiarly
      gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few minutes had
      threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the occasion of some
      of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward to another happy
      result&mdash;the cure of Harriet's infatuation.&mdash;From Harriet's
      manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom,
      she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened, and
      she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior creature she
      had believed him. The fever was over, and Emma could harbour little fear
      of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy. She depended on
      the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of
      pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.&mdash;Harriet rational,
      Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not wanting to
      quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her that he
      could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he was
      to be at home by the middle of the day. She did not regret it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all
      to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for
      the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa, when
      the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom she had
      never less expected to see together&mdash;Frank Churchill, with Harriet
      leaning on his arm&mdash;actually Harriet!&mdash;A moment sufficed to
      convince her that something extraordinary had happened. Harriet looked
      white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.&mdash;The iron gates
      and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;&mdash;they were all
      three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair
      fainted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,
      and surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the
      suspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted with
      the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs. Goddard's,
      who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and taken a road,
      the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough for safety, had
      led them into alarm.&mdash;About half a mile beyond Highbury, making a
      sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became for a
      considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had advanced
      some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before
      them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies. A
      child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton,
      excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet to
      follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top, and
      made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury. But poor Harriet
      could not follow. She had suffered very much from cramp after dancing, and
      her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made
      her absolutely powerless&mdash;and in this state, and exceedingly
      terrified, she had been obliged to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more
      courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could not
      be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children,
      headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and impertinent in
      look, though not absolutely in word.&mdash;More and more frightened, she
      immediately promised them money, and taking out her purse, gave them a
      shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to use her ill.&mdash;She
      was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was moving away&mdash;but
      her terror and her purse were too tempting, and she was followed, or
      rather surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and
      conditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his
      leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at
      this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced him to
      walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road, a mile or
      two beyond Highbury&mdash;and happening to have borrowed a pair of
      scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to restore
      them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a few
      minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on foot,
      was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The terror which
      the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion.
      He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet eagerly clinging to
      him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength enough to reach
      Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome. It was his idea to
      bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the amount of the whole story,&mdash;of his communication and of
      Harriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.&mdash;He
      dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him
      not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her
      safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people in
      the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the grateful
      blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such an adventure as this,&mdash;a fine young man and a lovely young woman
      thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain
      ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at
      least. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician
      have seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance together, and
      heard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been at
      work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?&mdash;How much
      more must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and
      foresight!&mdash;especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her
      mind had already made.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever occurred
      before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory; no rencontre,
      no alarm of the kind;&mdash;and now it had happened to the very person,
      and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing to pass by
      to rescue her!&mdash;It certainly was very extraordinary!&mdash;And
      knowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at this period,
      it struck her the more. He was wishing to get the better of his attachment
      to herself, she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton. It seemed as
      if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences. It was
      not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each
      to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him, while
      Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror, her
      naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a
      sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's own
      account had been given, he had expressed his indignation at the abominable
      folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing was to take its
      natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted. She would not stir
      a step, nor drop a hint. No, she had had enough of interference. There
      could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive scheme. It was no more than a
      wish. Beyond it she would on no account proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what
      had passed,&mdash;aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but
      she soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hour it
      was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to engage those who
      talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in the
      place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last night's ball
      seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as
      Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without their promising
      never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some comfort to him that
      many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his neighbours knew
      that he loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss Smith, were coming in
      during the rest of the day; and he had the pleasure of returning for
      answer, that they were all very indifferent&mdash;which, though not
      exactly true, for she was perfectly well, and Harriet not much otherwise,
      Emma would not interfere with. She had an unhappy state of health in
      general for the child of such a man, for she hardly knew what
      indisposition was; and if he did not invent illnesses for her, she could
      make no figure in a message.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took
      themselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have walked
      again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history dwindled
      soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews:&mdash;in
      her imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and John were still
      asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies, and still
      tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular
      from the original recital.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one
      morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down
      and hesitating, thus began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Woodhouse&mdash;if you are at leisure&mdash;I have something that I
      should like to tell you&mdash;a sort of confession to make&mdash;and then,
      you know, it will be over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a
      seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her, quite as much as her
      words, for something more than ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;to have no
      reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered
      creature in <i>one</i> <i>respect</i>, it is very fit that you should have
      the satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is
      necessary&mdash;I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done,
      and I dare say you understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;I hope I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I could so long a time be fancying myself!...&rdquo; cried Harriet, warmly.
      &ldquo;It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now.&mdash;I
      do not care whether I meet him or not&mdash;except that of the two I had
      rather not see him&mdash;and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid
      him&mdash;but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire her
      nor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, and all
      that, but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable&mdash;I shall
      never forget her look the other night!&mdash;However, I assure you, Miss
      Woodhouse, I wish her no evil.&mdash;No, let them be ever so happy
      together, it will not give me another moment's pang: and to convince you
      that I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy&mdash;what I
      ought to have destroyed long ago&mdash;what I ought never to have kept&mdash;I
      know that very well (blushing as she spoke).&mdash;However, now I will
      destroy it all&mdash;and it is my particular wish to do it in your
      presence, that you may see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what
      this parcel holds?&rdquo; said she, with a conscious look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least in the world.&mdash;Did he ever give you any thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued
      very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words <i>Most</i> <i>precious</i>
      <i>treasures</i> on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited. Harriet
      unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within abundance
      of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which Harriet
      opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but, excepting the
      cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Harriet, &ldquo;you <i>must</i> recollect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed I do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what
      passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last times
      we ever met in it!&mdash;It was but a very few days before I had my sore
      throat&mdash;just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came&mdash;I think
      the very evening.&mdash;Do not you remember his cutting his finger with
      your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?&mdash;But, as you
      had none about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I
      took mine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and
      he cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before
      he gave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help
      making a treasure of it&mdash;so I put it by never to be used, and looked
      at it now and then as a great treat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest Harriet!&rdquo; cried Emma, putting her hand before her face, and
      jumping up, &ldquo;you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear. Remember
      it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this relic&mdash;I
      knew nothing of that till this moment&mdash;but the cutting the finger,
      and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none about me!&mdash;Oh!
      my sins, my sins!&mdash;And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!&mdash;One
      of my senseless tricks!&mdash;I deserve to be under a continual blush all
      the rest of my life.&mdash;Well&mdash;(sitting down again)&mdash;go on&mdash;what
      else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected it,
      you did it so naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!&rdquo;
       said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between
      wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself, &ldquo;Lord bless me!
      when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of
      court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I never was
      equal to this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, &ldquo;here is something
      still more valuable, I mean that <i>has</i> <i>been</i> more valuable,
      because this is what did really once belong to him, which the
      court-plaister never did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of an
      old pencil,&mdash;the part without any lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was really his,&rdquo; said Harriet.&mdash;&ldquo;Do not you remember one
      morning?&mdash;no, I dare say you do not. But one morning&mdash;I forget
      exactly the day&mdash;but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before
      <i>that</i> <i>evening</i>, he wanted to make a memorandum in his
      pocket-book; it was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him
      something about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but
      when he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it
      all away, and it would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left
      upon the table as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon
      as I dared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do remember it,&rdquo; cried Emma; &ldquo;I perfectly remember it.&mdash;Talking
      about spruce-beer.&mdash;Oh! yes&mdash;Mr. Knightley and I both saying we
      liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I
      perfectly remember it.&mdash;Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here,
      was not he? I have an idea he was standing just here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.&mdash;It is very odd, but I cannot
      recollect.&mdash;Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where
      I am now.&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say&mdash;except
      that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to
      see me do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring
      up these things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, simpleton as I was!&mdash;but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish
      I could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you
      know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was&mdash;but
      had not resolution enough to part with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?&mdash;I have
      not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might
      be useful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be happier to burn it,&rdquo; replied Harriet. &ldquo;It has a disagreeable
      look to me. I must get rid of every thing.&mdash;There it goes, and there
      is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when,&rdquo; thought Emma, &ldquo;will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already
      made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had <i>told</i> no
      fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.&mdash;About a fortnight
      after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite
      undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the
      information she received more valuable. She merely said, in the course of
      some trivial chat, &ldquo;Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise you
      to do so and so&rdquo;&mdash;and thought no more of it, till after a minute's
      silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, &ldquo;I shall never
      marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a moment's
      debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never marry!&mdash;This is a new resolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one that I shall never change, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After another short hesitation, &ldquo;I hope it does not proceed from&mdash;I
      hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Elton indeed!&rdquo; cried Harriet indignantly.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! no&rdquo;&mdash;and
      Emma could just catch the words, &ldquo;so superior to Mr. Elton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed no
      farther?&mdash;should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?&mdash;Perhaps
      Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she were
      totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too
      much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, such an
      open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly
      resolved.&mdash;She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at
      once, all that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing was always best.
      She had previously determined how far she would proceed, on any
      application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the
      judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.&mdash;She was
      decided, and thus spoke&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your
      resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from an
      idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your
      superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose&mdash;
      Indeed I am not so mad.&mdash;But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at
      a distance&mdash;and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest
      of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so
      proper, in me especially.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you
      was enough to warm your heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!&mdash;The very
      recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time&mdash;when I saw him
      coming&mdash;his noble look&mdash;and my wretchedness before. Such a
      change! In one moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect
      happiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.&mdash;Yes,
      honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.&mdash;But that it
      will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not advise
      you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage for its being
      returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be wisest in you to
      check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not let them carry you
      far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Be observant of him. Let
      his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I give you this caution
      now, because I shall never speak to you again on the subject. I am
      determined against all interference. Henceforward I know nothing of the
      matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were very wrong before; we will
      be cautious now.&mdash;He is your superior, no doubt, and there do seem
      objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but yet, Harriet, more
      wonderful things have taken place, there have been matches of greater
      disparity. But take care of yourself. I would not have you too sanguine;
      though, however it may end, be assured your raising your thoughts to <i>him</i>,
      is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was very
      decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend. Its
      tendency would be to raise and refine her mind&mdash;and it must be saving
      her from the danger of degradation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon
      Hartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The
      Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use to
      be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her
      grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again
      delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was likely to
      remain there full two months longer, provided at least she were able to
      defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in her service, and save herself from being
      hurried into a delightful situation against her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly
      taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike him
      more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of
      Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable. Every thing declared
      it; his own attentions, his father's hints, his mother-in-law's guarded
      silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and
      indiscretion, told the same story. But while so many were devoting him to
      Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to
      suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. He could not
      understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them&mdash;he
      thought so at least&mdash;symptoms of admiration on his side, which,
      having once observed, he could not persuade himself to think entirely void
      of meaning, however he might wish to escape any of Emma's errors of
      imagination. <i>She</i> was not present when the suspicion first arose. He
      was dining with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he had
      seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from the
      admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. When he was again
      in their company, he could not help remembering what he had seen; nor
      could he avoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper and his fire
      at twilight,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myself creating what I saw,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private
      liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill and Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend his
      evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he joined them;
      and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like themselves,
      judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the weather threatened
      rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates and her niece, who had
      accidentally met. They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma,
      who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her
      father, pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him. The Randalls
      party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech from Miss
      Bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it possible to accept
      dear Miss Woodhouse's most obliging invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback.
      The gentlemen spoke of his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye,&rdquo; said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, &ldquo;what became
      of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, &ldquo;I did not know that he ever had
      any such plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what was
      certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was extremely
      happy about it. It was owing to <i>her</i> persuasion, as she thought his
      being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You must remember
      it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never! really, never!&mdash;Bless me! how could it be?&mdash;Then I must
      have dreamt it&mdash;but I was completely persuaded&mdash;Miss Smith, you
      walk as if you were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&mdash;What is this?&rdquo; cried Mr. Weston, &ldquo;about Perry and a
      carriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad he can
      afford it. You had it from himself, had you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied his son, laughing, &ldquo;I seem to have had it from nobody.&mdash;Very
      odd!&mdash;I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's having mentioned it in
      one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all these particulars&mdash;but
      as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before, of course it must
      have been a dream. I am a great dreamer. I dream of every body at Highbury
      when I am away&mdash;and when I have gone through my particular friends,
      then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is odd though,&rdquo; observed his father, &ldquo;that you should have had such a
      regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you
      should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's setting up his carriage! and
      his wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health&mdash;just
      what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little
      premature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream! And
      at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream
      certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent.
      Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to prepare
      her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr. Weston's
      hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to own the truth,&rdquo; cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain to
      be heard the last two minutes, &ldquo;if I must speak on this subject, there is
      no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have&mdash;I do not mean to say
      that he did not dream it&mdash;I am sure I have sometimes the oddest
      dreams in the world&mdash;but if I am questioned about it, I must
      acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry
      herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as
      ourselves&mdash;but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only
      thought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should
      have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning
      because she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don't you remember
      grandmama's telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we had been
      walking to&mdash;very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls.
      Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother&mdash;indeed I do not
      know who is not&mdash;and she had mentioned it to her in confidence; she
      had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go
      beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that I
      know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having
      never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I
      am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then
      I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not like Jane; I
      wish I were. I will answer for it <i>she</i> never betrayed the least
      thing in the world. Where is she?&mdash;Oh! just behind. Perfectly
      remember Mrs. Perry's coming.&mdash;Extraordinary dream, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded Miss
      Bates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face, where he thought
      he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had involuntarily turned
      to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy with her shawl. Mr.
      Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let
      her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of
      catching her eye&mdash;he seemed watching her intently&mdash;in vain,
      however, if it were so&mdash;Jane passed between them into the hall, and
      looked at neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be
      borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the
      large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, and
      which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her
      father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on which two of his
      daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea passed pleasantly, and
      nobody seemed in a hurry to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Woodhouse,&rdquo; said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind
      him, which he could reach as he sat, &ldquo;have your nephews taken away their
      alphabets&mdash;their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is it?
      This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather as
      winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters one morning.
      I want to puzzle you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was
      quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much
      disposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words
      for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The quietness
      of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had often
      been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had
      occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting,
      with tender melancholy, over the departure of the &ldquo;poor little boys,&rdquo; or
      in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how
      beautifully Emma had written it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight
      glance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to Emma,
      Jane opposite to them&mdash;and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them
      all; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little
      apparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile
      pushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried
      from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of looking just
      across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word,
      and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work. She was
      sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help. The word was <i>blunder</i>;
      and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a blush on Jane's cheek
      which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible. Mr. Knightley connected
      it with the dream; but how it could all be, was beyond his comprehension.
      How the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain
      asleep! He feared there must be some decided involvement. Disingenuousness
      and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn. These letters were
      but the vehicle for gallantry and trick. It was a child's play, chosen to
      conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill's part.
    </p>
    <p>
      With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm
      and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a short
      word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and demure. He
      saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining,
      though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure;
      for she said, &ldquo;Nonsense! for shame!&rdquo; He heard Frank Churchill next say,
      with a glance towards Jane, &ldquo;I will give it to her&mdash;shall I?&rdquo;&mdash;and
      as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth. &ldquo;No, no, you
      must not; you shall not, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without
      feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed
      over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate
      civility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley's excessive curiosity to
      know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment for
      darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it to be <i>Dixon</i>.
      Jane Fairfax's perception seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was
      certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of
      those five letters so arranged. She was evidently displeased; looked up,
      and seeing herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived
      her, and saying only, &ldquo;I did not know that proper names were allowed,&rdquo;
       pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to
      be engaged by no other word that could be offered. Her face was averted
      from those who had made the attack, and turned towards her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, very true, my dear,&rdquo; cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken a
      word&mdash;&ldquo;I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to
      be going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking
      for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had
      preconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but
      so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr. Knightley
      thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her,
      and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was afterwards looking
      for her shawl&mdash;Frank Churchill was looking also&mdash;it was growing
      dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley
      could not tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of what he
      had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his observations,
      he must&mdash;yes, he certainly must, as a friend&mdash;an anxious friend&mdash;give
      Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see her in a situation
      of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was his duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Emma,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the
      poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw the
      word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the
      one, and so very distressing to the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true
      explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was
      really ashamed of having ever imparted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried in evident embarrassment, &ldquo;it all meant nothing; a mere
      joke among ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The joke,&rdquo; he replied gravely, &ldquo;seemed confined to you and Mr.
      Churchill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather busy
      herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in doubt. A
      variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference&mdash;fruitless
      interference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to
      declare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to her, to
      risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference, rather
      than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the remembrance of
      neglect in such a cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Emma,&rdquo; said he at last, with earnest kindness, &ldquo;do you think you
      perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and
      lady we have been speaking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.&mdash;Why
      do you make a doubt of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or
      that she admired him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never!&rdquo; she cried with a most open eagerness&mdash;&ldquo;Never, for the
      twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could it
      possibly come into your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them&mdash;certain
      expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can
      vouchsafe to let your imagination wander&mdash;but it will not do&mdash;very
      sorry to check you in your first essay&mdash;but indeed it will not do.
      There is no admiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances
      which have caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances&mdash;feelings
      rather of a totally different nature&mdash;it is impossible exactly to
      explain:&mdash;there is a good deal of nonsense in it&mdash;but the part
      which is capable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are
      as far from any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two
      beings in the world can be. That is, I <i>presume</i> it to be so on her
      side, and I can <i>answer</i> for its being so on his. I will answer for
      the gentleman's indifference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which
      silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would have prolonged
      the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions, every
      look described, and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly
      entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet hers. He found he could not
      be useful, and his feelings were too much irritated for talking. That he
      might not be irritated into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr.
      Woodhouse's tender habits required almost every evening throughout the
      year, he soon afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the
      coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.
      Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of
      hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such
      importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at
      present. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted
      to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings' coming had been
      united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill, whose health seemed
      every day to supply a different report, and the situation of Mrs. Weston,
      whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased
      by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours was by the
      approach of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal of
      pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must all wait,
      and every projected party be still only talked of. So she thought at
      first;&mdash;but a little consideration convinced her that every thing
      need not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the
      Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the autumn.
      It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was to be such
      a party had been long generally known: it had even given the idea of
      another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what every
      body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed to
      chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more of the chosen
      only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a quiet,
      unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and
      preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the
      Eltons and the Sucklings.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but
      feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr. Weston
      that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and sister had
      failed her, that the two parties should unite, and go together; and that
      as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she had
      no objection. Now, as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike
      of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was
      not worth bringing forward again:&mdash;it could not be done without a
      reproof to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found
      herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would
      have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would probably
      expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton's
      party! Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her outward
      submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections
      on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you approve of what I have done,&rdquo; said he very comfortably.
      &ldquo;But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without
      numbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its own
      amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not leave
      her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was
      growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to
      pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing
      into sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,
      before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured on,
      and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton's resources were
      inadequate to such an attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?&rdquo; she cried.&mdash;&ldquo;And such
      weather for exploring!&mdash;These delays and disappointments are quite
      odious. What are we to do?&mdash;The year will wear away at this rate, and
      nothing done. Before this time last year I assure you we had had a
      delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better explore to Donwell,&rdquo; replied Mr. Knightley. &ldquo;That may be
      done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are ripening
      fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,
      for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the &ldquo;Oh! I should like it
      of all things,&rdquo; was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was famous
      for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation: but no
      plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt the lady,
      who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again and again to
      come&mdash;much oftener than he doubted&mdash;and was extremely gratified
      by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment as she chose
      to consider it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend upon me,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I certainly will come. Name your day,
      and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot name a day,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;till I have spoken to some others whom I
      would wish to meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.&mdash;I am Lady
      Patroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will bring Elton,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;but I will not trouble you to
      give any other invitations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider&mdash;you need not be
      afraid of delegating power to <i>me</i>. I am no young lady on her
      preferment. Married women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my
      party. Leave it all to me. I will invite your guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo;&mdash;he calmly replied,&mdash;&ldquo;there is but one married woman in
      the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to
      Donwell, and that one is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Mrs. Weston, I suppose,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;Mrs. Knightley;&mdash;and till she is in being, I will manage
      such matters myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are an odd creature!&rdquo; she cried, satisfied to have no one
      preferred to herself.&mdash;&ldquo;You are a humourist, and may say what you
      like. Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me&mdash;Jane and
      her aunt.&mdash;The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to
      meeting the Hartfield family. Don't scruple. I know you are attached to
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss
      Bates in my way home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:&mdash;but as you like. It
      is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I
      shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging on
      my arm. Here,&mdash;probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be
      more simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be no
      form or parade&mdash;a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about your
      gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under trees;&mdash;and
      whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out of doors&mdash;a
      table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural and simple as
      possible. Is not that your idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the
      table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of
      gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is best
      observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating strawberries
      in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;as you please; only don't have a great set out. And, by the
      bye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?&mdash;Pray
      be sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to
      inspect anything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is
      extremely clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and would
      spurn any body's assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys,
      Jane, Miss Bates, and me&mdash;and my caro sposo walking by. I really must
      talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life I conceive it to
      be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so many resources, it
      is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;&mdash;and very long
      walks, you know&mdash;in summer there is dust, and in winter there is
      dirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane is
      never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however, if
      you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole's. I would wish every thing to be
      as much to your taste as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend. Under
      that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the warmest
      heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.&mdash;Yes, believe
      me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of
      this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to please me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He
      wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party; and
      he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would
      inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the specious
      pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at Donwell, be
      tempted away to his misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for
      his easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for two
      years. &ldquo;Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go very
      well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked
      about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the
      middle of the day. He should like to see the old house again exceedingly,
      and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other of his
      neighbours.&mdash;He could not see any objection at all to his, and
      Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning. He thought it
      very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them&mdash;very kind and
      sensible&mdash;much cleverer than dining out.&mdash;He was not fond of
      dining out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence. The
      invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like
      Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to
      themselves.&mdash;Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of
      pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to
      join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could
      have been dispensed with.&mdash;Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that
      he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in
      writing, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to Box
      Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was settled
      for one day, and Box Hill for the next,&mdash;the weather appearing
      exactly right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was safely
      conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of this
      al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey,
      especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was happily
      placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what had been
      achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not to heat
      themselves.&mdash;Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose
      to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when all the others
      were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and sympathiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she was
      satisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him, and look
      around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular
      observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must
      ever be so interesting to her and all her family.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the
      present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed the
      respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,
      characteristic situation, low and sheltered&mdash;its ample gardens
      stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with
      all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight&mdash;and its
      abundance of timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor
      extravagance had rooted up.&mdash;The house was larger than Hartfield, and
      totally unlike it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular,
      with many comfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.&mdash;It was just
      what it ought to be, and it looked what it was&mdash;and Emma felt an
      increasing respect for it, as the residence of a family of such true
      gentility, untainted in blood and understanding.&mdash;Some faults of
      temper John Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself
      unexceptionably. She had given them neither men, nor names, nor places,
      that could raise a blush. These were pleasant feelings, and she walked
      about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did, and
      collect round the strawberry-beds.&mdash;The whole party were assembled,
      excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond;
      and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and
      her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or
      talking&mdash;strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or
      spoken of.&mdash;&ldquo;The best fruit in England&mdash;every body's favourite&mdash;always
      wholesome.&mdash;These the finest beds and finest sorts.&mdash;Delightful
      to gather for one's self&mdash;the only way of really enjoying them.&mdash;Morning
      decidedly the best time&mdash;never tired&mdash;every sort good&mdash;hautboy
      infinitely superior&mdash;no comparison&mdash;the others hardly eatable&mdash;hautboys
      very scarce&mdash;Chili preferred&mdash;white wood finest flavour of all&mdash;price
      of strawberries in London&mdash;abundance about Bristol&mdash;Maple Grove&mdash;cultivation&mdash;beds
      when to be renewed&mdash;gardeners thinking exactly different&mdash;no
      general rule&mdash;gardeners never to be put out of their way&mdash;delicious
      fruit&mdash;only too rich to be eaten much of&mdash;inferior to cherries&mdash;currants
      more refreshing&mdash;only objection to gathering strawberries the
      stooping&mdash;glaring sun&mdash;tired to death&mdash;could bear it no
      longer&mdash;must go and sit in the shade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such, for half an hour, was the conversation&mdash;interrupted only once
      by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to
      inquire if he were come&mdash;and she was a little uneasy.&mdash;She had
      some fears of his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged to
      overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.&mdash;A
      situation, a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had
      received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was not with
      Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and splendour
      it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an
      acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove. Delightful,
      charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thing&mdash;and
      Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.&mdash;On
      her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph&mdash;and she positively
      refused to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax continued to
      assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing, repeating
      the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.&mdash;Still Mrs.
      Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the
      morrow's post.&mdash;How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing to
      Emma.&mdash;She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly&mdash;and at last,
      with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.&mdash;&ldquo;Should
      not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens&mdash;all the
      gardens?&mdash;She wished to see the whole extent.&rdquo;&mdash;The pertinacity
      of her friend seemed more than she could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,
      dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly followed one
      another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes, which
      stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river, seemed
      the finish of the pleasure grounds.&mdash;It led to nothing; nothing but a
      view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed
      intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an approach to the
      house, which never had been there. Disputable, however, as might be the
      taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the
      view which closed it extremely pretty.&mdash;The considerable slope, at
      nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper
      form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of
      considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;&mdash;and at
      the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the Abbey
      Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close and
      handsome curve around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sweet view&mdash;sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,
      English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being
      oppressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and
      towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet
      distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and
      Harriet!&mdash;It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it.&mdash;There
      had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and turned
      from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant conversation.
      There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet
      in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it
      not. It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and
      beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom, and light
      column of smoke ascending.&mdash;She joined them at the wall, and found
      them more engaged in talking than in looking around. He was giving Harriet
      information as to modes of agriculture, etc. and Emma received a smile
      which seemed to say, &ldquo;These are my own concerns. I have a right to talk on
      such subjects, without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin.&rdquo;&mdash;She
      did not suspect him. It was too old a story.&mdash;Robert Martin had
      probably ceased to think of Harriet.&mdash;They took a few turns together
      along the walk.&mdash;The shade was most refreshing, and Emma found it the
      pleasantest part of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;&mdash;and
      they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come.
      Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain. His father would not own himself
      uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing
      that he would part with his black mare. He had expressed himself as to
      coming, with more than common certainty. &ldquo;His aunt was so much better,
      that he had not a doubt of getting over to them.&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Churchill's
      state, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such
      sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable
      dependence&mdash;and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to
      say, that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was
      prevented coming.&mdash;Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under
      consideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see
      what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far
      as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at any
      rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.&mdash;Mr.
      Woodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part of
      the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by him,
      stirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him, that Mrs.
      Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety
      which her spirits seemed to need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse's entertainment.
      Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals, shells, and every
      other family collection within his cabinets, had been prepared for his old
      friend, to while away the morning; and the kindness had perfectly
      answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused. Mrs. Weston had
      been shewing them all to him, and now he would shew them all to Emma;&mdash;fortunate
      in having no other resemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste
      for what he saw, for he was slow, constant, and methodical.&mdash;Before
      this second looking over was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for
      the sake of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and
      ground-plot of the house&mdash;and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax
      appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape.&mdash;Little
      expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but
      Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be so kind,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;when I am missed, as to say that I am
      gone home?&mdash;I am going this moment.&mdash;My aunt is not aware how
      late it is, nor how long we have been absent&mdash;but I am sure we shall
      be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.&mdash;I have said nothing
      about it to any body. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some
      are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I
      shall not be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say
      that I am gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, if you wish it;&mdash;but you are not going to walk to
      Highbury alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;what should hurt me?&mdash;I walk fast. I shall be at home in
      twenty minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my
      father's servant go with you.&mdash;Let me order the carriage. It can be
      round in five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you&mdash;but on no account.&mdash;I would rather walk.&mdash;And
      for <i>me</i> to be afraid of walking alone!&mdash;I, who may so soon have
      to guard others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, &ldquo;That can
      be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the
      carriage. The heat even would be danger.&mdash;You are fatigued already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo;&mdash;she answered&mdash;&ldquo;I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of
      fatigue&mdash;quick walking will refresh me.&mdash;Miss Woodhouse, we all
      know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are
      exhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me have
      my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering into her
      feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and watched her
      safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look was grateful&mdash;and
      her parting words, &ldquo;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of being sometimes
      alone!&rdquo;&mdash;seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and to describe
      somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her, even towards
      some of those who loved her best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!&rdquo; said Emma, as she turned back into
      the hall again. &ldquo;I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of
      their just horrors, the more I shall like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only
      accomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank Churchill
      entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she had forgotten to
      think of him&mdash;but she was very glad to see him. Mrs. Weston would be
      at ease. The black mare was blameless; <i>they</i> were right who had
      named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had been detained by a temporary
      increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which had lasted some hours&mdash;and
      he had quite given up every thought of coming, till very late;&mdash;and
      had he known how hot a ride he should have, and how late, with all his
      hurry, he must be, he believed he should not have come at all. The heat
      was excessive; he had never suffered any thing like it&mdash;almost wished
      he had staid at home&mdash;nothing killed him like heat&mdash;he could
      bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was intolerable&mdash;and he sat
      down, at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr.
      Woodhouse's fire, looking very deplorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,&rdquo; said Emma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be spared&mdash;but
      such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be going soon I
      suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met <i>one</i> as I came&mdash;Madness
      in such weather!&mdash;absolute madness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's state
      might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour.
      Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might be his
      constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure
      of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking some
      refreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining-room&mdash;and
      she humanely pointed out the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make him
      hotter.&rdquo; In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and
      muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all her
      attention to her father, saying in secret&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like a man who
      is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet's sweet easy temper will
      not mind it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came back
      all the better&mdash;grown quite cool&mdash;and, with good manners, like
      himself&mdash;able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in
      their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so
      late. He was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them;
      and, at last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking
      over views in Swisserland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I shall never
      be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my sketches,
      some time or other, to look at&mdash;or my tour to read&mdash;or my poem.
      I shall do something to expose myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be&mdash;but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go
      to Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave
      England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for her.
      I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I assure you
      I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I shall soon be
      abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I want a change. I
      am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy&mdash;I
      am sick of England&mdash;and would leave it to-morrow, if I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few
      hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do
      not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted in
      every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and
      eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice of
      cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly on a
      par with the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;&mdash;you will join us. It is not
      Swisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a
      change. You will stay, and go with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then pray stay at Richmond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of you
      all there without me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your own
      degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.
      With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others took
      it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and disturbance
      on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained. That it was time for
      every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short final
      arrangement for the next day's scheme, they parted. Frank Churchill's
      little inclination to exclude himself increased so much, that his last
      words to Emma were,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well;&mdash;if <i>you</i> wish me to stay and join the party, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond
      was to take him back before the following evening.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward
      circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in
      favour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating
      safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good
      time. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with the
      Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.
      Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there. Seven
      miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a
      burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount of the
      day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want
      of union, which could not be got over. They separated too much into
      parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss
      Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill. And Mr.
      Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemed at first
      an accidental division, but it never materially varied. Mr. and Mrs.
      Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable as they
      could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill, there
      seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties, too strong
      for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston,
      to remove.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank
      Churchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing&mdash;looked
      without seeing&mdash;admired without intelligence&mdash;listened without
      knowing what she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet
      should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,
      for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.
      Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her. To
      amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he cared for&mdash;and
      Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gay and easy
      too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the admission to be
      gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most animating period
      of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own estimation, meant
      nothing, though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had
      such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well
      describe. &ldquo;Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together
      excessively.&rdquo; They were laying themselves open to that very phrase&mdash;and
      to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland
      by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity;
      it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected. She
      laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him for his
      attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship, admiration, or
      playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning back her heart.
      She still intended him for her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much I am obliged to you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for telling me to come to-day!&mdash;If
      it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all the happiness of
      this party. I had quite determined to go away again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that you
      were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than you
      deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hotter to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are comfortable because you are under command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your command?&mdash;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,
      somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own
      management; but to-day you are got back again&mdash;and as I cannot be
      always with you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command
      rather than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a motive.
      You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always with me. You
      are always with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dating from three o'clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not
      begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three o'clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you
      first in February.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)&mdash;nobody
      speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense
      for the entertainment of seven silent people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say nothing of which I am ashamed,&rdquo; replied he, with lively impudence.
      &ldquo;I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill hear me if they
      can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking on the
      other. I saw you first in February.&rdquo; And then whispering&mdash;&ldquo;Our
      companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do to rouse them? Any
      nonsense will serve. They <i>shall</i> talk. Ladies and gentlemen, I am
      ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is, presides) to say, that
      she desires to know what you are all thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great deal;
      Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding; Mr.
      Knightley's answer was the most distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all
      thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, no&rdquo;&mdash;cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could&mdash;&ldquo;Upon
      no account in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt
      of just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking
      of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at
      Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a sort of thing,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, &ldquo;which <i>I</i>
      should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though,
      perhaps, as the <i>Chaperon</i> of the party&mdash;<i>I</i> never was in
      any circle&mdash;exploring parties&mdash;young ladies&mdash;married women&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed&mdash;quite unheard of&mdash;but
      some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every body knows
      what is due to <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not do,&rdquo; whispered Frank to Emma; &ldquo;they are most of them
      affronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;I
      am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of knowing
      exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires something very
      entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here are seven of you,
      besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very entertaining
      already,) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very
      clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated&mdash;or two things
      moderately clever&mdash;or three things very dull indeed, and she engages
      to laugh heartily at them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very well,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Bates, &ldquo;then I need not be uneasy. 'Three
      things very dull indeed.' That will just do for me, you know. I shall be
      sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth, shan't I?
      (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on every body's
      assent)&mdash;Do not you all think I shall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma could not resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me&mdash;but you will be
      limited as to number&mdash;only three at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not
      immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not
      anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;well&mdash;to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to
      Mr. Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very
      disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like your plan,&rdquo; cried Mr. Weston. &ldquo;Agreed, agreed. I will do my best.
      I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,&rdquo; answered his son;&mdash;&ldquo;but we shall
      be indulgent&mdash;especially to any one who leads the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr. Weston's
      shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt its being very clever myself,&rdquo; said Mr. Weston. &ldquo;It is too much a
      matter of fact, but here it is.&mdash;What two letters of the alphabet are
      there, that express perfection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What two letters!&mdash;express perfection! I am sure I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will never guess.&mdash;I
      will tell you.&mdash;M. and A.&mdash;Em-ma.&mdash;Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Understanding and gratification came together. It might be a very
      indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and
      enjoy in it&mdash;and so did Frank and Harriet.&mdash;It did not seem to
      touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and
      Mr. Knightley gravely said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston has
      done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body else.
      <i>Perfection</i> should not have come quite so soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,&rdquo; said Mrs. Elton; &ldquo;<i>I</i>
      really cannot attempt&mdash;I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I
      had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all
      pleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!&mdash;You know
      who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very well at
      Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of place, in
      my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer. Miss
      Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have witty things at
      every body's service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I have a great deal of
      vivacity in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to
      speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill.
      Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We have nothing clever to say&mdash;not
      one of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, pray pass <i>me</i>,&rdquo; added her husband, with a sort of
      sneering consciousness; &ldquo;<i>I</i> have nothing to say that can entertain
      Miss Woodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man&mdash;quite
      good for nothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.
      Come, Jane, take my other arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off. &ldquo;Happy
      couple!&rdquo; said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of hearing:&mdash;&ldquo;How
      well they suit one another!&mdash;Very lucky&mdash;marrying as they did,
      upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!&mdash;They only knew
      each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!&mdash;for as
      to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath, or any public
      place, can give&mdash;it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is
      only by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as they
      always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it is all
      guess and luck&mdash;and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has
      committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his
      life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own
      confederates, spoke now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such things do occur, undoubtedly.&rdquo;&mdash;She was stopped by a cough.
      Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were speaking,&rdquo; said he, gravely. She recovered her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances
      do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to be very
      frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise&mdash;but there is
      generally time to recover from it afterwards. I would be understood to
      mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters, (whose happiness
      must be always at the mercy of chance,) who will suffer an unfortunate
      acquaintance to be an inconvenience, an oppression for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon
      afterwards said, in a lively tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I
      marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning to
      Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?&mdash;I am sure I should like any
      body fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a smile
      at his father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt her,
      educate her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And make her like myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means, if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else. I
      shall go abroad for a couple of years&mdash;and when I return, I shall
      come to you for my wife. Remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every
      favourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described? Hazle
      eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished. He might
      even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment; who could say? Referring
      the education to her seemed to imply it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, ma'am,&rdquo; said Jane to her aunt, &ldquo;shall we join Mrs. Elton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was ready
      to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shall soon
      overtake her. There she is&mdash;no, that's somebody else. That's one of
      the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.&mdash;Well, I
      declare&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr. Weston,
      his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man's spirits now
      rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at last of
      flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about
      with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended to,
      in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her. The appearance
      of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a
      joyful sight; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart,
      and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have <i>her</i> carriage first, were
      gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close
      the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure. Such another
      scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people, she hoped never to be
      betrayed into again.
    </p>
    <p>
      While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. He
      looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a
      privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it. I
      cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you be so
      unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a
      woman of her character, age, and situation?&mdash;Emma, I had not thought
      it possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, how could I help saying what I did?&mdash;Nobody could have helped
      it. It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of it
      since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it&mdash;with what
      candour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your
      forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for ever
      receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be so
      irksome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Emma, &ldquo;I know there is not a better creature in the world: but
      you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most
      unfortunately blended in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are blended,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous, I
      could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the
      good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless absurdity
      to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of
      manner. Were she your equal in situation&mdash;but, Emma, consider how far
      this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk from the comforts
      she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must probably sink more. Her
      situation should secure your compassion. It was badly done, indeed! You,
      whom she had known from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period
      when her notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits,
      and the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble her&mdash;and before her
      niece, too&mdash;and before others, many of whom (certainly <i>some</i>,)
      would be entirely guided by <i>your</i> treatment of her.&mdash;This is
      not pleasant to you, Emma&mdash;and it is very far from pleasant to me;
      but I must, I will,&mdash;I will tell you truths while I can; satisfied
      with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and trusting
      that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was ready;
      and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He had
      misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and her
      tongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,
      mortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and, on
      entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome&mdash;then
      reproaching herself for having taken no leave, making no acknowledgment,
      parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out with voice and hand eager
      to shew a difference; but it was just too late. He had turned away, and
      the horses were in motion. She continued to look back, but in vain; and
      soon, with what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill,
      and every thing left far behind. She was vexed beyond what could have been
      expressed&mdash;almost beyond what she could conceal. Never had she felt
      so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her life. She was
      most forcibly struck. The truth of this representation there was no
      denying. She felt it at her heart. How could she have been so brutal, so
      cruel to Miss Bates! How could she have exposed herself to such ill
      opinion in any one she valued! And how suffer him to leave her without
      saying one word of gratitude, of concurrence, of common kindness!
    </p>
    <p>
      Time did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but to feel it
      more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessary to
      speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself, fagged,
      and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running down her
      cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble to check
      them, extraordinary as they were.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all the
      evening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she could
      not tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways, might
      be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was a morning more
      completely misspent, more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the
      time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than any she had ever
      passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her father, was felicity to
      it. <i>There</i>, indeed, lay real pleasure, for there she was giving up
      the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort; and feeling that,
      unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding
      esteem, she could not, in her general conduct, be open to any severe
      reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not without a heart. She hoped
      no one could have said to her, &ldquo;How could you be so unfeeling to your
      father?&mdash;I must, I will tell you truths while I can.&rdquo; Miss Bates
      should never again&mdash;no, never! If attention, in future, could do away
      the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had been often remiss, her
      conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact;
      scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more. In the warmth of true
      contrition, she would call upon her the very next morning, and it should
      be the beginning, on her side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that
      nothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, that she
      might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in while
      she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not be ashamed
      of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers. Her eyes
      were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.

    <p>
      &ldquo;The ladies were all at home.&rdquo; She had never rejoiced at the sound before,
      nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs, with any
      wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of deriving it,
      except in subsequent ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking. She
      heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the maid
      looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait a
      moment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed both
      escaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had a distinct glimpse of,
      looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she heard
      Miss Bates saying, &ldquo;Well, my dear, I shall <i>say</i> you are laid down
      upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did not
      quite understand what was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid Jane is not very well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I do not know; they <i>tell</i>
      me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently, Miss
      Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I am very
      little able&mdash;Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where you like? I am
      sure she will be here presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment's fear of Miss Bates
      keeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came&mdash;&ldquo;Very happy and
      obliged&rdquo;&mdash;but Emma's conscience told her that there was not the same
      cheerful volubility as before&mdash;less ease of look and manner. A very
      friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a
      return of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!&mdash;I suppose you have heard&mdash;and
      are come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in me&mdash;(twinkling
      away a tear or two)&mdash;but it will be very trying for us to part with
      her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful headache just
      now, writing all the morning:&mdash;such long letters, you know, to be
      written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. 'My dear,' said I, 'you will
      blind yourself'&mdash;for tears were in her eyes perpetually. One cannot
      wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great change; and though she is
      amazingly fortunate&mdash;such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman
      before ever met with on first going out&mdash;do not think us ungrateful,
      Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune&mdash;(again dispersing
      her tears)&mdash;but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache
      she has. When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel any blessing
      quite as it may deserve. She is as low as possible. To look at her, nobody
      would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a
      situation. You will excuse her not coming to you&mdash;she is not able&mdash;she
      is gone into her own room&mdash;I want her to lie down upon the bed. 'My
      dear,' said I, 'I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:' but, however,
      she is not; she is walking about the room. But, now that she has written
      her letters, she says she shall soon be well. She will be extremely sorry
      to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will excuse her. You
      were kept waiting at the door&mdash;I was quite ashamed&mdash;but somehow
      there was a little bustle&mdash;for it so happened that we had not heard
      the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not know any body was
      coming. 'It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I, 'depend upon it. Nobody else would
      come so early.' 'Well,' said she, 'it must be borne some time or other,
      and it may as well be now.' But then Patty came in, and said it was you.
      'Oh!' said I, 'it is Miss Woodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her.'&mdash;'I
      can see nobody,' said she; and up she got, and would go away; and that was
      what made us keep you waiting&mdash;and extremely sorry and ashamed we
      were. 'If you must go, my dear,' said I, 'you must, and I will say you are
      laid down upon the bed.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growing kinder
      towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure
      of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing but pity; and
      the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past,
      obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs.
      Cole or any other steady friend, when she might not bear to see herself.
      She spoke as she felt, with earnest regret and solicitude&mdash;sincerely
      wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be
      now actually determined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage
      and comfort as possible. &ldquo;It must be a severe trial to them all. She had
      understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell's return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So very kind!&rdquo; replied Miss Bates. &ldquo;But you are always kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no bearing such an &ldquo;always;&rdquo; and to break through her dreadful
      gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&mdash;may I ask?&mdash;is Miss Fairfax going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a Mrs. Smallridge&mdash;charming woman&mdash;most superior&mdash;to
      have the charge of her three little girls&mdash;delightful children.
      Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort; if we
      except, perhaps, Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's; but Mrs.
      Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:&mdash;lives
      only four miles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple
      Grove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She would
      not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, 'No;' for when Jane first
      heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morning we were at
      Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite decided against
      accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactly as you say,
      she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell's
      return, and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at
      present&mdash;and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over again&mdash;and I
      am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!&mdash;but that
      good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did.
      It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she
      did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she positively declared she
      would <i>not</i> write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her; she
      would wait&mdash;and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all settled
      that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not the least idea!&mdash;Jane
      took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that upon thinking over the
      advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation, she had come to the resolution
      of accepting it.&mdash;I did not know a word of it till it was all
      settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon
      the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. 'You <i>must</i>
      <i>all</i> spend your evening with us,' said she&mdash;'I positively must
      have you <i>all</i> come.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I
      thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him
      off, he did not;&mdash;but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and
      a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss
      Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed rather
      fagged after the morning's party. Even pleasure, you know, is fatiguing&mdash;and
      I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it.
      However, <i>I</i> shall always think it a very pleasant party, and feel
      extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been making
      up her mind the whole day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say she had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her
      friends&mdash;but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that
      is possible&mdash;I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing in the
      world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and Bragges,
      there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal and elegant,
      in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful
      woman!&mdash;A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove&mdash;and as to
      the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there are
      not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with such
      regard and kindness!&mdash;It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of
      pleasure.&mdash;And her salary!&mdash;I really cannot venture to name her
      salary to you, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums,
      would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like
      Jane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madam,&rdquo; cried Emma, &ldquo;if other children are at all like what I
      remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of what
      I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly earned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so noble in your ideas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it. Within a fortnight.
      Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does not know how to
      bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, and say, Come
      ma'am, do not let us think about it any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and Mrs.
      Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their
      return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a situation
      as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so astonished
      when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton, and when
      Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it! It was
      before tea&mdash;stay&mdash;no, it could not be before tea, because we
      were just going to cards&mdash;and yet it was before tea, because I
      remember thinking&mdash;Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something
      happened before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room
      before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, I
      have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven
      years; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the
      rheumatic gout in his joints&mdash;I must go and see him to-day; and so
      will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor John's son came to
      talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to do
      himself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing of
      that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help; and so,
      when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler had been telling
      him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to
      take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what happened before tea.
      It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this
      circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she
      could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill's
      going, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the
      accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of the
      servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond
      soon after the return of the party from Box Hill&mdash;which messenger,
      however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had
      sent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable
      account of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming back
      beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having
      resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse
      seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the
      Crown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy
      going a good pace, and driving very steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it
      caught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject which already
      engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's importance in the
      world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was every thing, the other
      nothing&mdash;and she sat musing on the difference of woman's destiny, and
      quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed, till roused by Miss Bates's
      saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become of
      that?&mdash;Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.&mdash;'You
      must go,' said she. 'You and I must part. You will have no business here.&mdash;Let
      it stay, however,' said she; 'give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell
      comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for me; he will
      help me out of all my difficulties.'&mdash;And to this day, I do believe,
      she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of
      all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,
      that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough;
      and, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the
      good wishes which she really felt, took leave.

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted; but
      on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr. Knightley
      and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting with her
      father.&mdash;Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner decidedly
      graver than usual, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare, and
      therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend a few
      days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say, besides
      the 'love,' which nobody carries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;rather&mdash;I have been thinking of it some little time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time,
      however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends again.
      While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going&mdash;her father began
      his inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?&mdash;And how did you find
      my worthy old friend and her daughter?&mdash;I dare say they must have
      been very much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on
      Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so
      attentive to them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile, and
      shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr. Knightley.&mdash;It
      seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour, as if
      his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that had passed of good in
      her feelings were at once caught and honoured.&mdash; He looked at her
      with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified&mdash;and in another
      moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common
      friendliness on his part.&mdash;He took her hand;&mdash;whether she had
      not herself made the first motion, she could not say&mdash;she might,
      perhaps, have rather offered it&mdash;but he took her hand, pressed it,
      and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips&mdash;when, from
      some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go.&mdash;Why he should feel such
      a scruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but done, she
      could not perceive.&mdash;He would have judged better, she thought, if he
      had not stopped.&mdash;The intention, however, was indubitable; and
      whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry, or
      however else it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.&mdash;It
      was with him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.&mdash;She could not
      but recall the attempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect
      amity.&mdash;He left them immediately afterwards&mdash;gone in a moment.
      He always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be
      undecided nor dilatory, but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his
      disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she
      had left her ten minutes earlier;&mdash;it would have been a great
      pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.&mdash;Neither
      would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she knew
      how much his visit would be enjoyed&mdash;but it might have happened at a
      better time&mdash;and to have had longer notice of it, would have been
      pleasanter.&mdash;They parted thorough friends, however; she could not be
      deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished
      gallantry;&mdash;it was all done to assure her that she had fully
      recovered his good opinion.&mdash;He had been sitting with them half an
      hour, she found. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the disagreeableness
      of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly; and going on
      horseback, which she knew would be all very bad; Emma communicated her
      news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the effect was justified; it
      supplied a very useful check,&mdash;interested, without disturbing him. He
      had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and
      could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been
      an unexpected blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably
      settled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say her
      acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry situation,
      and that her health will be taken good care of. It ought to be a first
      object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me. You know, my
      dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us. And
      I hope she will be better off in one respect, and not be induced to go
      away after it has been her home so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else
      into the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death
      of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particular reason to
      hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirty hours
      after his return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing
      foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a short
      struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of
      gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the
      surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where she
      would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops to
      folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be
      disagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.
      Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now
      spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fully
      justified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The
      event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of
      imaginary complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal: more
      than any body had ever supposed&mdash;and continual pain would try the
      temper. It was a sad event&mdash;a great shock&mdash;with all her faults,
      what would Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill's loss would be
      dreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.&rdquo;&mdash;Even Mr.
      Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, &ldquo;Ah! poor woman, who
      would have thought it!&rdquo; and resolved, that his mourning should be as
      handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her
      broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. How it
      would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It was also a
      very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs. Churchill, the
      grief of her husband&mdash;her mind glanced over them both with awe and
      compassion&mdash;and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank
      might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw in a
      moment all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would
      have nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was
      feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by
      his nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should
      form the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could
      feel no certainty of its being already formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.
      What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. Emma was
      gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character, and
      refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance. They
      spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual forbearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all that
      was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill was
      better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the departure
      of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a very old friend
      in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten
      years. At present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes
      for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose
      prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose engagements now
      allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her
      kindness&mdash;and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had
      scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person,
      whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom
      she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She
      wanted to be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and
      testify respect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to spend
      a day at Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation was
      refused, and by a verbal message. &ldquo;Miss Fairfax was not well enough to
      write;&rdquo; and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it
      appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though
      against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering under
      severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him doubt
      the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the time proposed.
      Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged&mdash;appetite quite
      gone&mdash;and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms, nothing
      touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing apprehension of
      the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought she had undertaken
      more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so herself, though she
      would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her present home, he could
      not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:&mdash;confined
      always to one room;&mdash;he could have wished it otherwise&mdash;and her
      good aunt, though his very old friend, he must acknowledge to be not the
      best companion for an invalid of that description. Her care and attention
      could not be questioned; they were, in fact, only too great. He very much
      feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them. Emma
      listened with the warmest concern; grieved for her more and more, and
      looked around eager to discover some way of being useful. To take her&mdash;be
      it only an hour or two&mdash;from her aunt, to give her change of air and
      scene, and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two, might do
      her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say, in the most
      feeling language she could command, that she would call for her in the
      carriage at any hour that Jane would name&mdash;mentioning that she had
      Mr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient.
      The answer was only in this short note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any
      exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was
      impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed
      indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best
      counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the
      answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates's, in
      the hope that Jane would be induced to join her&mdash;but it would not do;&mdash;Miss
      Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing with her most
      earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service&mdash;and
      every thing that message could do was tried&mdash;but all in vain. Miss
      Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quite unpersuadable;
      the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.&mdash;Emma wished
      she could have seen her, and tried her own powers; but, almost before she
      could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her
      niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in. &ldquo;Indeed, the truth was, that
      poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body&mdash;any body at all&mdash;Mrs.
      Elton, indeed, could not be denied&mdash;and Mrs. Cole had made such a
      point&mdash;and Mrs. Perry had said so much&mdash;but, except them, Jane
      would really see nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys, and
      the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could she
      feel any right of preference herself&mdash;she submitted, therefore, and
      only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece's appetite and diet,
      which she longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates was
      very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing:&mdash;Mr.
      Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could command (and
      never had any body such good neighbours) was distasteful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an examination
      of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily
      despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In half an hour the
      arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates, but &ldquo;dear
      Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back; it was a thing
      she could not take&mdash;and, moreover, she insisted on her saying, that
      she was not at all in want of any thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about
      the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of the very
      day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to any exercise, so
      peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage, she could have no
      doubt&mdash;putting every thing together&mdash;that Jane was resolved to
      receive no kindness from <i>her</i>. She was sorry, very sorry. Her heart
      was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort
      of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and inequality of
      powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for
      proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but she had the
      consolation of knowing that her intentions were good, and of being able to
      say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her
      attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen into her
      heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma was
      called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who &ldquo;could not stay five minutes, and
      wanted particularly to speak with her.&rdquo;&mdash;He met her at the
      parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his
      voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?&mdash;Do, if it be
      possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she unwell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not at all&mdash;only a little agitated. She would have ordered
      the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you <i>alone</i>, and that
      you know&mdash;(nodding towards her father)&mdash;Humph!&mdash;Can you
      come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what
      you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?&mdash;Is she really not
      ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon me&mdash;but ask no more questions. You will know it all in
      time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something
      really important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was
      well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her father,
      that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the
      house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo;&mdash;said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,&mdash;&ldquo;now
      Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo;&mdash;he gravely replied.&mdash;&ldquo;Don't ask me. I promised my
      wife to leave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can.
      Do not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break it to me,&rdquo; cried Emma, standing still with terror.&mdash;&ldquo;Good God!&mdash;Mr.
      Weston, tell me at once.&mdash;Something has happened in Brunswick Square.
      I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed you are mistaken.&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.&mdash;Consider how many of my dearest
      friends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?&mdash;I charge
      you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Emma.&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your word!&mdash;why not your honour!&mdash;why not say upon your honour,
      that it has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!&mdash;What can
      be to be <i>broke</i> to me, that does not relate to one of that family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honour,&rdquo; said he very seriously, &ldquo;it does not. It is not in the
      smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma's courage returned, and she walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wrong,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;in talking of its being <i>broke</i> to you.
      I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern you&mdash;it
      concerns only myself,&mdash;that is, we hope.&mdash;Humph!&mdash;In short,
      my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don't say
      that it is not a disagreeable business&mdash;but things might be much
      worse.&mdash;If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. She
      asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and that
      soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern&mdash;something
      just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the
      family,&mdash;something which the late event at Richmond had brought
      forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural children, perhaps&mdash;and
      poor Frank cut off!&mdash;This, though very undesirable, would be no
      matter of agony to her. It inspired little more than an animating
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that gentleman on horseback?&rdquo; said she, as they proceeded&mdash;speaking
      more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with any other view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&mdash;One of the Otways.&mdash;Not Frank;&mdash;it is not
      Frank, I assure you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by
      this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your son been with you, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes&mdash;did not you know?&mdash;Well, well, never mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded
      and demure,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.&mdash;&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo;
       said he, as they entered the room&mdash;&ldquo;I have brought her, and now I
      hope you will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use
      in delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.&rdquo;&mdash;And Emma
      distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      have been as good as my word. She has not the least idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,
      that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she
      eagerly said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I find,
      has occurred;&mdash;do let me know directly what it is. I have been
      walking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense. Do not
      let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your distress,
      whatever it may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you indeed no idea?&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice. &ldquo;Cannot
      you, my dear Emma&mdash;cannot you form a guess as to what you are to
      hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;&rdquo;
       (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) &ldquo;He has been
      here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is impossible
      to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a subject,&mdash;to
      announce an attachment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of
      Harriet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than an attachment, indeed,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Weston; &ldquo;an engagement&mdash;a
      positive engagement.&mdash;What will you say, Emma&mdash;what will any
      body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are
      engaged;&mdash;nay, that they have been long engaged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma even jumped with surprize;&mdash;and, horror-struck, exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane Fairfax!&mdash;Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well be amazed,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,
      and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover&mdash;
      &ldquo;You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a solemn
      engagement between them ever since October&mdash;formed at Weymouth, and
      kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but themselves&mdash;neither
      the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.&mdash;It is so wonderful, that
      though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almost incredible to
      myself. I can hardly believe it.&mdash;I thought I knew him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma scarcely heard what was said.&mdash;Her mind was divided between two
      ideas&mdash;her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and
      poor Harriet;&mdash;and for some time she could only exclaim, and require
      confirmation, repeated confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she at last, trying to recover herself; &ldquo;this is a
      circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at
      all comprehend it. What!&mdash;engaged to her all the winter&mdash;before
      either of them came to Highbury?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Engaged since October,&mdash;secretly engaged.&mdash;It has hurt me,
      Emma, very much. It has hurt his father equally. <i>Some</i> <i>part</i>
      of his conduct we cannot excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, &ldquo;I will not pretend <i>not</i>
      to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured
      that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are
      apprehensive of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as
      steady as her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my present
      perfect indifference,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I will farther tell you, that there
      was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I did like him,
      when I was very much disposed to be attached to him&mdash;nay, was
      attached&mdash;and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.
      Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past, for
      at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You may believe me,
      Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find
      utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good than
      any thing else in the world could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;On this
      point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you might be
      attached to each other&mdash;and we were persuaded that it was so.&mdash;
      Imagine what we have been feeling on your account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful
      wonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit <i>him</i>, Mrs.
      Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had
      he to come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners so
      <i>very</i> disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as he
      certainly did&mdash;to distinguish any one young woman with persevering
      attention, as he certainly did&mdash;while he really belonged to another?&mdash;How
      could he tell what mischief he might be doing?&mdash;How could he tell
      that he might not be making me in love with him?&mdash;very wrong, very
      wrong indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how could <i>she</i> bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness!
      to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,
      before her face, and not resent it.&mdash;That is a degree of placidity,
      which I can neither comprehend nor respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly. He
      had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a quarter of
      an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even
      of the time he could stay&mdash;but that there had been misunderstandings
      he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by
      them; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the
      impropriety of his conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston&mdash;it is too calm a censure. Much, much
      beyond impropriety!&mdash;It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk
      him in my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!&mdash;None of that
      upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that
      disdain of trick and littleness, which a man should display in every
      transaction of his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong in
      this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having many,
      very many, good qualities; and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Emma, not attending to her.&mdash;&ldquo;Mrs. Smallridge, too!
      Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by
      such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself&mdash;to suffer
      her even to think of such a measure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit him.
      It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him&mdash;or at
      least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.&mdash;Till yesterday,
      I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I do
      not know how, but by some letter or message&mdash;and it was the discovery
      of what she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined him
      to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on his
      kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of concealment
      that had been carrying on so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma began to listen better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to hear from him soon,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Weston. &ldquo;He told me at
      parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which seemed
      to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let us wait,
      therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It may make
      many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood.
      Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in a hurry to condemn him. Let us
      have patience. I must love him; and now that I am satisfied on one point,
      the one material point, I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out
      well, and ready to hope that it may. They must both have suffered a great
      deal under such a system of secresy and concealment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>His</i> sufferings,&rdquo; replied Emma dryly, &ldquo;do not appear to have done
      him much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most favourably for his nephew&mdash;gave his consent with scarcely a
      difficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family!
      While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been a
      hope, a chance, a possibility;&mdash;but scarcely are her remains at rest
      in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite
      to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when undue
      influence does not survive the grave!&mdash;He gave his consent with very
      little persuasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought Emma, &ldquo;he would have done as much for Harriet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this
      morning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some time&mdash;and
      then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle, to
      whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you, he
      could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.&mdash;He was very much
      agitated&mdash;very much, indeed&mdash;to a degree that made him appear
      quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.&mdash;In
      addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so very
      unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of&mdash;and there was
      every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such
      perfect secresy?&mdash;The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of
      the engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being in
      the world but their two selves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the
      idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a very
      abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of hypocrisy
      and deceit,&mdash;espionage, and treachery?&mdash;To come among us with
      professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to
      judge us all!&mdash;Here have we been, the whole winter and spring,
      completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and
      honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying
      round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were
      never meant for both to hear.&mdash;They must take the consequence, if
      they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite easy on that head,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Weston. &ldquo;I am very sure that
      I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might not have
      heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in luck.&mdash;Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you
      imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax,
      I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and as to
      speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,
      evidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invited him in;
      and, while he was coming round, added, &ldquo;Now, dearest Emma, let me intreat
      you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease, and
      incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the best of it&mdash;and,
      indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour. It is not a
      connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should
      we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I
      mean, that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of
      character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for&mdash;and
      still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this one great
      deviation from the strict rule of right. And how much may be said in her
      situation for even that error!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much, indeed!&rdquo; cried Emma feelingly. &ldquo;If a woman can ever be excused for
      thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax's.&mdash;Of
      such, one may almost say, that 'the world is not their's, nor the world's
      law.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,
      exclaiming,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a
      device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of
      guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half your
      property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of condolence,
      it turns out to be one of congratulation.&mdash;I congratulate you, Mr.
      Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of the most
      lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as
      right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits was
      immediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he shook her
      heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the subject in a
      manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the
      engagement no very bad thing. His companions suggested only what could
      palliate imprudence, or smooth objections; and by the time they had talked
      it all over together, and he had talked it all over again with Emma, in
      their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly reconciled, and not
      far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have
      done.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet, poor Harriet!&rdquo;&mdash;Those were the words; in them lay the
      tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted
      the real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved very
      ill by herself&mdash;very ill in many ways,&mdash;but it was not so much
      <i>his</i> behaviour as her <i>own</i>, which made her so angry with him.
      It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account, that
      gave the deepest hue to his offence.&mdash;Poor Harriet! to be a second
      time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken
      prophetically, when he once said, &ldquo;Emma, you have been no friend to
      Harriet Smith.&rdquo;&mdash;She was afraid she had done her nothing but
      disservice.&mdash;It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this
      instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of the
      mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never
      have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged her
      admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her
      a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged
      what she might have repressed. She might have prevented the indulgence and
      increase of such sentiments. Her influence would have been enough. And now
      she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.&mdash;She
      felt that she had been risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient
      grounds. Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she
      must not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five hundred
      chances to one against his ever caring for her.&mdash;&ldquo;But, with common
      sense,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I am afraid I have had little to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry
      with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.&mdash;As for Jane
      Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present
      solicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no
      longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health having,
      of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.&mdash;Her days of
      insignificance and evil were over.&mdash;She would soon be well, and
      happy, and prosperous.&mdash;Emma could now imagine why her own attentions
      had been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No doubt
      it had been from jealousy.&mdash;In Jane's eyes she had been a rival; and
      well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed.
      An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack, and
      arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She
      understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the
      injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that Jane
      Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert. But
      poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was little sympathy to
      be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful that this second
      disappointment would be more severe than the first. Considering the very
      superior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently
      stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it
      would.&mdash;She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon
      as possible. An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's parting
      words. &ldquo;For the present, the whole affair was to be completely a secret.
      Mr. Churchill had made a point of it, as a token of respect to the wife he
      had so very recently lost; and every body admitted it to be no more than
      due decorum.&rdquo;&mdash;Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted.
      It was her superior duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous,
      that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to
      perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself.
      The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her, she was
      now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart beat quick on hearing
      Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor Mrs. Weston felt
      when <i>she</i> was approaching Randalls. Could the event of the
      disclosure bear an equal resemblance!&mdash;But of that, unfortunately,
      there could be no chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Woodhouse!&rdquo; cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room&mdash;&ldquo;is
      not this the oddest news that ever was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news do you mean?&rdquo; replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or voice,
      whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!&mdash;you
      need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me himself.
      I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret; and,
      therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you, but he
      said you knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Mr. Weston tell you?&rdquo;&mdash;said Emma, still perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill
      are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one
      another this long while. How very odd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd, that
      Emma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared absolutely
      changed. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or disappointment, or
      peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at her, quite unable to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you any idea,&rdquo; cried Harriet, &ldquo;of his being in love with her?&mdash;You,
      perhaps, might.&mdash;You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every
      body's heart; but nobody else&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;I begin to doubt my having any such talent.
      Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached to
      another woman at the very time that I was&mdash;tacitly, if not openly&mdash;encouraging
      you to give way to your own feelings?&mdash;I never had the slightest
      suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank Churchill's having the
      least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very sure that if I had, I
      should have cautioned you accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. &ldquo;Why should you caution
      me?&mdash;You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,&rdquo; replied
      Emma, smiling; &ldquo;but you do not mean to deny that there was a time&mdash;and
      not very distant either&mdash;when you gave me reason to understand that
      you did care about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him!&mdash;never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake
      me?&rdquo; turning away distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet!&rdquo; cried Emma, after a moment's pause&mdash;&ldquo;What do you mean?&mdash;Good
      Heaven! what do you mean?&mdash;Mistake you!&mdash;Am I to suppose then?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not speak another word.&mdash;Her voice was lost; and she sat
      down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from her,
      did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was in a
      voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not have thought it possible,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;that you could have
      misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him&mdash;but considering
      how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should not have
      thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person. Mr.
      Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look at him in the
      company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr.
      Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And that you should have
      been so mistaken, is amazing!&mdash;I am sure, but for believing that you
      entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I should
      have considered it at first too great a presumption almost, to dare to
      think of him. At first, if you had not told me that more wonderful things
      had happened; that there had been matches of greater disparity (those were
      your very words);&mdash;I should not have dared to give way to&mdash;I
      should not have thought it possible&mdash;But if <i>you</i>, who had been
      always acquainted with him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet!&rdquo; cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely&mdash;&ldquo;Let us
      understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are
      you speaking of&mdash;Mr. Knightley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else&mdash;and so
      I thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; returned Emma, with forced calmness, &ldquo;for all that you then
      said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could almost
      assert that you had <i>named</i> Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the
      service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the
      gipsies, was spoken of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the
      occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that
      considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely natural:&mdash;and
      you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that
      service, and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him
      come forward to your rescue.&mdash;The impression of it is strong on my
      memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; cried Harriet, &ldquo;now I recollect what you mean; but I was
      thinking of something very different at the time. It was not the gipsies&mdash;it
      was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some elevation) I was
      thinking of a much more precious circumstance&mdash;of Mr. Knightley's
      coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me;
      and when there was no other partner in the room. That was the kind action;
      that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which
      made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon
      earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Emma, &ldquo;this has been a most unfortunate&mdash;most
      deplorable mistake!&mdash;What is to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At
      least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the
      other had been the person; and now&mdash;it <i>is</i> possible&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;that you should feel a
      great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must
      think one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But I
      hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing&mdash;that if&mdash;strange as it may
      appear&mdash;. But you know they were your own words, that <i>more</i>
      wonderful things had happened, matches of <i>greater</i> disparity had
      taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it
      seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before&mdash;and
      if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to&mdash;if Mr.
      Knightley should really&mdash;if <i>he</i> does not mind the disparity, I
      hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try
      to put difficulties in the way. But you are too good for that, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look at
      her in consternation, and hastily said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully&mdash;&ldquo;I must say that
      I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating, in
      a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient for
      making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers, once opening
      to suspicion, made rapid progress. She touched&mdash;she admitted&mdash;she
      acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse that Harriet should
      be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank Churchill? Why was the evil
      so dreadfully increased by Harriet's having some hope of a return? It
      darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must
      marry no one but herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same few
      minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her
      before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! How inconsiderate,
      how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been her conduct! What
      blindness, what madness, had led her on! It struck her with dreadful
      force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world. Some
      portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits&mdash;some
      concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice by Harriet&mdash;(there
      would be no need of <i>compassion</i> to the girl who believed herself
      loved by Mr. Knightley&mdash;but justice required that she should not be
      made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and
      endure farther with calmness, with even apparent kindness.&mdash;For her
      own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes
      should be enquired into; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the
      regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained&mdash;or
      to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her
      right.&mdash;Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion,
      she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the
      conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it, the
      wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.&mdash;Neither
      of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad to
      be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and such
      a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give the
      history of her hopes with great, though trembling delight.&mdash;Emma's
      tremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were better concealed than
      Harriet's, but they were not less. Her voice was not unsteady; but her
      mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self, such a
      burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexing
      emotions, must create.&mdash;She listened with much inward suffering, but
      with great outward patience, to Harriet's detail.&mdash;Methodical, or
      well arranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be; but
      it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the
      narration, a substance to sink her spirit&mdash;especially with the
      corroborating circumstances, which her own memory brought in favour of Mr.
      Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since
      those two decisive dances.&mdash;Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,
      found her much superior to his expectation. From that evening, or at least
      from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her to think of him, Harriet
      had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been
      used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her;
      a manner of kindness and sweetness!&mdash;Latterly she had been more and
      more aware of it. When they had been all walking together, he had so often
      come and walked by her, and talked so very delightfully!&mdash;He seemed
      to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it to have been very much the
      case. She had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.&mdash;Harriet
      repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him&mdash;and Emma
      felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his
      opinion of Harriet. He praised her for being without art or affectation,
      for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.&mdash;She knew that he saw
      such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt on them to her more than
      once.&mdash;Much that lived in Harriet's memory, many little particulars
      of the notice she had received from him, a look, a speech, a removal from
      one chair to another, a compliment implied, a preference inferred, had
      been unnoticed, because unsuspected, by Emma. Circumstances that might
      swell to half an hour's relation, and contained multiplied proofs to her
      who had seen them, had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them; but
      the two latest occurrences to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise
      to Harriet, were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.&mdash;The
      first, was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at
      Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he
      had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to
      himself&mdash;and at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way
      than he had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!&mdash;(Harriet
      could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking her,
      whether her affections were engaged.&mdash;But as soon as she (Miss
      Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he changed the subject, and began
      talking about farming:&mdash;The second, was his having sat talking with
      her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit, the very
      last morning of his being at Hartfield&mdash;though, when he first came
      in, he had said that he could not stay five minutes&mdash;and his having
      told her, during their conversation, that though he must go to London, it
      was very much against his inclination that he left home at all, which was
      much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to <i>her</i>. The
      superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one article
      marked, gave her severe pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a
      little reflection, venture the following question. &ldquo;Might he not?&mdash;Is
      not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of
      your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin&mdash;he might have
      Mr. Martin's interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Martin! No indeed!&mdash;There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I
      know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss
      Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never should have presumed to think of it at first,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but for
      you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour be the
      rule of mine&mdash;and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may
      deserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so
      very wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings,
      made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to enable her to say on
      reply,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the last
      man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his
      feeling for her more than he really does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory;
      and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at that moment
      would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her father's footsteps.
      He was coming through the hall. Harriet was too much agitated to encounter
      him. &ldquo;She could not compose herself&mdash; Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed&mdash;she
      had better go;&rdquo;&mdash;with most ready encouragement from her friend,
      therefore, she passed off through another door&mdash;and the moment she
      was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of Emma's feelings: &ldquo;Oh God! that
      I had never seen her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her
      thoughts.&mdash;She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had
      rushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a fresh
      surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her.&mdash;How
      to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had been thus
      practising on herself, and living under!&mdash;The blunders, the blindness
      of her own head and heart!&mdash;she sat still, she walked about, she
      tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery&mdash;in every place, every
      posture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been
      imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been
      imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was
      wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of
      wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first
      endeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her father's
      claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling declared
      him now to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?&mdash; When
      had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank Churchill had
      once, for a short period, occupied?&mdash;She looked back; she compared
      the two&mdash;compared them, as they had always stood in her estimation,
      from the time of the latter's becoming known to her&mdash;and as they must
      at any time have been compared by her, had it&mdash;oh! had it, by any
      blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.&mdash;She
      saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr.
      Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had not
      been infinitely the most dear. She saw, that in persuading herself, in
      fancying, in acting to the contrary, she had been entirely under a
      delusion, totally ignorant of her own heart&mdash;and, in short, that she
      had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all!
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was the
      knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which she reached;
      and without being long in reaching it.&mdash;She was most sorrowfully
      indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her&mdash;her
      affection for Mr. Knightley.&mdash;Every other part of her mind was
      disgusting.
    </p>
    <p>
      With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every
      body's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every
      body's destiny. She was proved to have been universally mistaken; and she
      had not quite done nothing&mdash;for she had done mischief. She had
      brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, on Mr.
      Knightley.&mdash;Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place,
      on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his
      attachment, she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of
      Harriet's;&mdash;and even were this not the case, he would never have
      known Harriet at all but for her folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!&mdash;It was a union to distance every
      wonder of the kind.&mdash;The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane
      Fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting
      no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or
      thought.&mdash;Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!&mdash;Such an elevation on
      her side! Such a debasement on his! It was horrible to Emma to think how
      it must sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the
      sneers, the merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification
      and disdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself.&mdash;Could
      it be?&mdash;No; it was impossible. And yet it was far, very far, from
      impossible.&mdash;Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate
      abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for one,
      perhaps too busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek him?&mdash;Was
      it new for any thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent,
      incongruous&mdash;or for chance and circumstance (as second causes) to
      direct the human fate?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where she
      ought, and where he had told her she ought!&mdash;Had she not, with a
      folly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying the
      unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in
      the line of life to which she ought to belong&mdash;all would have been
      safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to
      Mr. Knightley!&mdash;How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of
      such a man till actually assured of it!&mdash;But Harriet was less humble,
      had fewer scruples than formerly.&mdash;Her inferiority, whether of mind
      or situation, seemed little felt.&mdash;She had seemed more sensible of
      Mr. Elton's being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr.
      Knightley's.&mdash;Alas! was not that her own doing too? Who had been at
      pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?&mdash;Who
      but herself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,
      and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?&mdash;If
      Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known how
      much of her happiness depended on being <i>first</i> with Mr. Knightley,
      first in interest and affection.&mdash;Satisfied that it was so, and
      feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the
      dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had been.&mdash;Long,
      very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no female connexions
      of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared
      with hers, and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed
      Isabella. She had herself been first with him for many years past. She had
      not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse, slighting his
      advice, or even wilfully opposing him, insensible of half his merits, and
      quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and
      insolent estimate of her own&mdash;but still, from family attachment and
      habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he had loved her, and watched over
      her from a girl, with an endeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for her
      doing right, which no other creature had at all shared. In spite of all
      her faults, she knew she was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?&mdash;When
      the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here, presented
      themselves, she could not presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might
      think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately
      loved by Mr. Knightley. <i>She</i> could not. She could not flatter
      herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to <i>her</i>. She
      had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.&mdash;How shocked
      had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had
      he expressed himself to her on the subject!&mdash;Not too strongly for the
      offence&mdash;but far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer
      than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.&mdash;She had no hope,
      nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he could have that sort of
      affection for herself which was now in question; but there was a hope (at
      times a slight one, at times much stronger,) that Harriet might have
      deceived herself, and be overrating his regard for <i>her</i>.&mdash;Wish
      it she must, for his sake&mdash;be the consequence nothing to herself, but
      his remaining single all his life. Could she be secure of that, indeed, of
      his never marrying at all, she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.&mdash;Let
      him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same
      Mr. Knightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of
      their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace
      would be fully secured.&mdash;Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It
      would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what she
      felt for him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She would not
      marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she
      hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least be
      able to ascertain what the chances for it were.&mdash;She should see them
      henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had
      hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know how
      to admit that she could be blinded here.&mdash;He was expected back every
      day. The power of observation would be soon given&mdash;frightfully soon
      it appeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she
      resolved against seeing Harriet.&mdash;It would do neither of them good,
      it would do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.&mdash;She
      was resolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had
      no authority for opposing Harriet's confidence. To talk would be only to
      irritate.&mdash;She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to
      beg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to
      be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of <i>one</i>
      topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed
      to pass before they met again, except in the company of others&mdash;she
      objected only to a tete-a-tete&mdash;they might be able to act as if they
      had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.&mdash;Harriet submitted, and
      approved, and was grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's
      thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them, sleeping
      or waking, the last twenty-four hours&mdash;Mrs. Weston, who had been
      calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her way home,
      almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to relate all
      the particulars of so interesting an interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his share
      of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then induced
      Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with much more to
      say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour
      spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of awkward
      feelings, could have afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her friend
      related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of
      agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at
      present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and to
      defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr.
      Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known; as,
      considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid
      without leading to reports:&mdash;but Mr. Weston had thought differently;
      he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her
      family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or
      if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for &ldquo;such things,&rdquo; he
      observed, &ldquo;always got about.&rdquo; Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had
      very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short&mdash;and very
      great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She had
      hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn how
      deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt
      satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her daughter&mdash;who
      proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a gratifying, yet almost
      an affecting, scene. They were both so truly respectable in their
      happiness, so disinterested in every sensation; thought so much of Jane;
      so much of every body, and so little of themselves, that every kindly
      feeling was at work for them. Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a
      fair plea for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back
      and declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the
      course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome
      so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important
      subject. Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first
      reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always
      feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause;
      but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the
      present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston was
      convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her
      companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been,
      and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so many
      months,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Weston, &ldquo;she was energetic. This was one of her
      expressions. 'I will not say, that since I entered into the engagement I
      have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have never known
      the blessing of one tranquil hour:'&mdash;and the quivering lip, Emma,
      which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;She thinks herself wrong, then, for having
      consented to a private engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed to
      blame herself. 'The consequence,' said she, 'has been a state of perpetual
      suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the punishment that
      misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. Pain is no
      expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting contrary to all my
      sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken, and the
      kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me ought not to
      be.' 'Do not imagine, madam,' she continued, 'that I was taught wrong. Do
      not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends
      who brought me up. The error has been all my own; and I do assure you
      that, with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give, I
      shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; said Emma again. &ldquo;She loves him then excessively, I suppose.
      It must have been from attachment only, that she could be led to form the
      engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; returned Emma, sighing, &ldquo;that I must often have contributed
      to make her unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she probably had
      something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the misunderstandings
      which he had given us hints of before. One natural consequence of the evil
      she had involved herself in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was that of making her <i>unreasonable</i>.
      The consciousness of having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand
      inquietudes, and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must
      have been&mdash;that had been&mdash;hard for him to bear. 'I did not make
      the allowances,' said she, 'which I ought to have done, for his temper and
      spirits&mdash;his delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness of
      disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure, have
      been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.' She then
      began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you had shewn her during
      her illness; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected,
      desired me, whenever I had an opportunity, to thank you&mdash;I could not
      thank you too much&mdash;for every wish and every endeavour to do her
      good. She was sensible that you had never received any proper
      acknowledgment from herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did not know her to be happy now,&rdquo; said Emma, seriously, &ldquo;which, in
      spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she must
      be, I could not bear these thanks;&mdash;for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there
      were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss
      Fairfax!&mdash;Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this
      is all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting
      particulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is
      very good&mdash;I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune
      should be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thought
      well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved him
      very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with a
      great deal of reason, and at least equal affection&mdash;but she had too
      much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or
      to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended
      with, &ldquo;We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know, but
      I hope it will soon come,&rdquo; she was obliged to pause before she answered,
      and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could at all recollect
      what letter it was which they were so anxious for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you well, my Emma?&rdquo; was Mrs. Weston's parting question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me
      intelligence of the letter as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant
      reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her sense of past
      injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted not having sought a
      closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the envious feelings which
      had certainly been, in some measure, the cause. Had she followed Mr.
      Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax, which
      was every way her due; had she tried to know her better; had she done her
      part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead
      of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all probability, have been spared from
      every pain which pressed on her now.&mdash;Birth, abilities, and
      education, had been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be
      received with gratitude; and the other&mdash;what was she?&mdash;Supposing
      even that they had never become intimate friends; that she had never been
      admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matter&mdash;which
      was most probable&mdash;still, in knowing her as she ought, and as she
      might, she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an
      improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had not only so foolishly
      fashioned and harboured herself, but had so unpardonably imparted; an idea
      which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to
      the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by the levity or carelessness of Frank
      Churchill's. Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former, since her
      coming to Highbury, she was persuaded that she must herself have been the
      worst. She must have been a perpetual enemy. They never could have been
      all three together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a
      thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a
      mind that would bear no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield. The
      weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in, and
      nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was
      despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights
      the longer visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably
      comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side, and by
      exertions which had never cost her half so much before. It reminded her of
      their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs. Weston's
      wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and
      dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of
      Hartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be
      over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the
      approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no
      pleasures had been lost.&mdash;But her present forebodings she feared
      would experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now,
      was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled&mdash;that
      might not be even partially brightened. If all took place that might take
      place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be comparatively
      deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than
      herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it. They
      should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband also.&mdash;Frank
      Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss Fairfax, it was
      reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to Highbury. They would
      be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe. All that were good
      would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be
      added, what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their
      reach? Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!&mdash;No
      longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change his own home
      for their's!&mdash;How was it to be endured? And if he were to be lost to
      them for Harriet's sake; if he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding
      in Harriet's society all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen,
      the first, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the
      best blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness
      but the reflection never far distant from her mind, that it had been all
      her own work?
    </p>
    <p>
      When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from a
      start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few
      seconds&mdash;and the only source whence any thing like consolation or
      composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better conduct,
      and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the
      following and every future winter of her life to the past, it would yet
      find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and leave her less
      to regret when it were gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the
      same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at Hartfield&mdash;but
      in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a softer quarter; the
      clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was summer again. With all
      the eagerness which such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of
      doors as soon as possible. Never had the exquisite sight, smell, sensation
      of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm, been more
      attractive to her. She longed for the serenity they might gradually
      introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after dinner, with a
      disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time in hurrying into the
      shrubbery.&mdash;There, with spirits freshened, and thoughts a little
      relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she saw Mr. Knightley passing
      through the garden door, and coming towards her.&mdash;It was the first
      intimation of his being returned from London. She had been thinking of him
      the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.&mdash;There
      was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind. She must be collected
      and calm. In half a minute they were together. The &ldquo;How d'ye do's&rdquo; were
      quiet and constrained on each side. She asked after their mutual friends;
      they were all well.&mdash;When had he left them?&mdash;Only that morning.
      He must have had a wet ride.&mdash;Yes.&mdash;He meant to walk with her,
      she found. &ldquo;He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he was not
      wanted there, preferred being out of doors.&rdquo;&mdash;She thought he neither
      looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible cause for it,
      suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his
      plans to his brother, and was pained by the manner in which they had been
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking at
      her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give.
      And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to speak to her,
      of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for encouragement to
      begin.&mdash;She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the way to any
      such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could not bear this
      silence. With him it was most unnatural. She considered&mdash;resolved&mdash;and,
      trying to smile, began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather
      surprize you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I?&rdquo; said he quietly, and looking at her; &ldquo;of what nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the best nature in the world&mdash;a wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he
      replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it possible?&rdquo; cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards him;
      for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called at Mrs.
      Goddard's in his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and at
      the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more
      composure,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have
      had your suspicions.&mdash;I have not forgotten that you once tried to
      give me a caution.&mdash;I wish I had attended to it&mdash;but&mdash;(with
      a sinking voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to
      blindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of having
      excited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn within his,
      and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying, in a tone of
      great sensibility, speaking low,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.&mdash;Your own excellent
      sense&mdash;your exertions for your father's sake&mdash;I know you will
      not allow yourself&mdash;.&rdquo; Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a
      more broken and subdued accent, &ldquo;The feelings of the warmest friendship&mdash;Indignation&mdash;Abominable
      scoundrel!&rdquo;&mdash;And in a louder, steadier tone, he concluded with, &ldquo;He
      will soon be gone. They will soon be in Yorkshire. I am sorry for <i>her</i>.
      She deserves a better fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of
      pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind&mdash;but you are mistaken&mdash;and I must set you
      right.&mdash; I am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to
      what was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be
      ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things
      which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other
      reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emma!&rdquo; cried he, looking eagerly at her, &ldquo;are you, indeed?&rdquo;&mdash;but
      checking himself&mdash;&ldquo;No, no, I understand you&mdash;forgive me&mdash;I
      am pleased that you can say even so much.&mdash;He is no object of regret,
      indeed! and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the
      acknowledgment of more than your reason.&mdash;Fortunate that your
      affections were not farther entangled!&mdash;I could never, I confess,
      from your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt&mdash;I
      could only be certain that there was a preference&mdash;and a preference
      which I never believed him to deserve.&mdash;He is a disgrace to the name
      of man.&mdash;And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?&mdash;Jane,
      Jane, you will be a miserable creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Knightley,&rdquo; said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused&mdash;&ldquo;I
      am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your
      error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I have
      as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all
      attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be natural for a
      woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.&mdash;But I never have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he would not.
      She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency;
      but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his
      opinion. She went on, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have very little to say for my own conduct.&mdash;I was tempted by his
      attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.&mdash;An old story,
      probably&mdash;a common case&mdash;and no more than has happened to
      hundreds of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one
      who sets up as I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the
      temptation. He was the son of Mr. Weston&mdash;he was continually here&mdash;I
      always found him very pleasant&mdash;and, in short, for (with a sigh) let
      me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at
      last&mdash;my vanity was flattered, and I allowed his attentions.
      Latterly, however&mdash;for some time, indeed&mdash;I have had no idea of
      their meaning any thing.&mdash;I thought them a habit, a trick, nothing
      that called for seriousness on my side. He has imposed on me, but he has
      not injured me. I have never been attached to him. And now I can tolerably
      comprehend his behaviour. He never wished to attach me. It was merely a
      blind to conceal his real situation with another.&mdash;It was his object
      to blind all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually
      blinded than myself&mdash;except that I was <i>not</i> blinded&mdash;that
      it was my good fortune&mdash;that, in short, I was somehow or other safe
      from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had hoped for an answer here&mdash;for a few words to say that her
      conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as she
      could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual tone, he
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.&mdash;I can suppose,
      however, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him has been
      but trifling.&mdash;And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he may
      yet turn out well.&mdash;With such a woman he has a chance.&mdash;I have
      no motive for wishing him ill&mdash;and for her sake, whose happiness will
      be involved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of their being happy together,&rdquo; said Emma; &ldquo;I believe
      them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a most fortunate man!&rdquo; returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. &ldquo;So
      early in life&mdash;at three-and-twenty&mdash;a period when, if a man
      chuses a wife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn
      such a prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation,
      has before him!&mdash;Assured of the love of such a woman&mdash;the
      disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her
      disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,&mdash;equality of situation&mdash;I
      mean, as far as regards society, and all the habits and manners that are
      important; equality in every point but one&mdash;and that one, since the
      purity of her heart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his
      felicity, for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.&mdash;A
      man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes
      her from; and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of <i>her</i>
      regard, must, I think, be the happiest of mortals.&mdash;Frank Churchill
      is, indeed, the favourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for his good.&mdash;He
      meets with a young woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot
      even weary her by negligent treatment&mdash;and had he and all his family
      sought round the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have
      found her superior.&mdash;His aunt is in the way.&mdash;His aunt dies.&mdash;He
      has only to speak.&mdash;His friends are eager to promote his happiness.&mdash;He
      had used every body ill&mdash;and they are all delighted to forgive him.&mdash;He
      is a fortunate man indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as if you envied him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence of
      Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if possible.
      She made her plan; she would speak of something totally different&mdash;the
      children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for breath to begin,
      when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not ask me what is the point of envy.&mdash;You are determined,
      I see, to have no curiosity.&mdash;You are wise&mdash;but <i>I</i> cannot
      be wise. Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it
      unsaid the next moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it,&rdquo; she eagerly cried. &ldquo;Take a
      little time, consider, do not commit yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not another
      syllable followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide in her&mdash;perhaps
      to consult her;&mdash;cost her what it would, she would listen. She might
      assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give just praise
      to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own independence, relieve him
      from that state of indecision, which must be more intolerable than any
      alternative to such a mind as his.&mdash;They had reached the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going in, I suppose?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo;&mdash;replied Emma&mdash;quite confirmed by the depressed manner in
      which he still spoke&mdash;&ldquo;I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry
      is not gone.&rdquo; And, after proceeding a few steps, she added&mdash;&ldquo;I
      stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave
      you pain.&mdash;But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a
      friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in
      contemplation&mdash;as a friend, indeed, you may command me.&mdash;I will
      hear whatever you like. I will tell you exactly what I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a friend!&rdquo;&mdash;repeated Mr. Knightley.&mdash;&ldquo;Emma, that I fear is a
      word&mdash;No, I have no wish&mdash;Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?&mdash;I
      have gone too far already for concealment.&mdash;Emma, I accept your offer&mdash;Extraordinary
      as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as a friend.&mdash;Tell
      me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression of
      his eyes overpowered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest Emma,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for dearest you will always be, whatever the
      event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most beloved Emma&mdash;tell
      me at once. Say 'No,' if it is to be said.&rdquo;&mdash;She could really say
      nothing.&mdash;&ldquo;You are silent,&rdquo; he cried, with great animation;
      &ldquo;absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The
      dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most
      prominent feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot make speeches, Emma:&rdquo; he soon resumed; and in a tone of such
      sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing.&mdash;&ldquo;If
      I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what
      I am.&mdash;You hear nothing but truth from me.&mdash;I have blamed you,
      and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other woman in England would
      have borne it.&mdash;Bear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest
      Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner, perhaps, may have
      as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a very indifferent
      lover.&mdash;But you understand me.&mdash;Yes, you see, you understand my
      feelings&mdash;and will return them if you can. At present, I ask only to
      hear, once to hear your voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful
      velocity of thought, had been able&mdash;and yet without losing a word&mdash;to
      catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet's
      hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a
      delusion as any of her own&mdash;that Harriet was nothing; that she was
      every thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had
      been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and that her
      agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had been all
      received as discouragement from herself.&mdash;And not only was there time
      for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; there
      was time also to rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and to
      resolve that it need not, and should not.&mdash;It was all the service she
      could now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of
      sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his
      affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the
      two&mdash;or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at
      once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he could not
      marry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for Harriet, with pain and with
      contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that could
      be probable or reasonable, entered her brain. She had led her friend
      astray, and it would be a reproach to her for ever; but her judgment was
      as strong as her feelings, and as strong as it had ever been before, in
      reprobating any such alliance for him, as most unequal and degrading. Her
      way was clear, though not quite smooth.&mdash;She spoke then, on being so
      entreated.&mdash;What did she say?&mdash;Just what she ought, of course. A
      lady always does.&mdash;She said enough to shew there need not be despair&mdash;and
      to invite him to say more himself. He <i>had</i> despaired at one period;
      he had received such an injunction to caution and silence, as for the time
      crushed every hope;&mdash;she had begun by refusing to hear him.&mdash;The
      change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;&mdash;her proposal of taking
      another turn, her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end
      to, might be a little extraordinary!&mdash;She felt its inconsistency; but
      Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;
      seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little
      mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct is mistaken, the
      feelings are not, it may not be very material.&mdash;Mr. Knightley could
      not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed, or a heart
      more disposed to accept of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He had
      followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come, in
      his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's engagement, with no
      selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed him an
      opening, to soothe or to counsel her.&mdash;The rest had been the work of
      the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings. The
      delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill, of
      her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had given birth to the
      hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection himself;&mdash;but it had
      been no present hope&mdash;he had only, in the momentary conquest of
      eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did not forbid his
      attempt to attach her.&mdash;The superior hopes which gradually opened
      were so much the more enchanting.&mdash;The affection, which he had been
      asking to be allowed to create, if he could, was already his!&mdash;Within
      half an hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to
      something so like perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Her</i> change was equal.&mdash;This one half-hour had given to each
      the same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the
      same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.&mdash;On his side, there
      had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the
      expectation, of Frank Churchill.&mdash;He had been in love with Emma, and
      jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment
      having probably enlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of
      Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country.&mdash;The Box Hill
      party had decided him on going away. He would save himself from witnessing
      again such permitted, encouraged attentions.&mdash;He had gone to learn to
      be indifferent.&mdash;But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much
      domestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form
      in it; Isabella was too much like Emma&mdash;differing only in those
      striking inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy
      before him, for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.&mdash;He
      had stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day&mdash;till this very
      morning's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.&mdash;Then, with
      the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel,
      having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was
      there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that he could
      stay no longer. He had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up
      directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures,
      faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had found her agitated and low.&mdash;Frank Churchill was a villain.&mdash;
      He heard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill's
      character was not desperate.&mdash;She was his own Emma, by hand and word,
      when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought of Frank
      Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from
      what she had brought out!&mdash;she had then been only daring to hope for
      a little respite of suffering;&mdash;she was now in an exquisite flutter
      of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be
      greater when the flutter should have passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down to tea&mdash;the same party round the same table&mdash;how
      often it had been collected!&mdash;and how often had her eyes fallen on
      the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the
      western sun!&mdash;But never in such a state of spirits, never in any
      thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of
      her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the
      attentive daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the
      breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously
      hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.&mdash;Could he have seen
      the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the
      most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest
      perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either, he
      repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received
      from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment, totally
      unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued; but
      when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued&mdash;and
      in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax for such an
      evening, she found one or two such very serious points to consider, as
      made her feel, that even her happiness must have some alloy. Her father&mdash;and
      Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their
      separate claims; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was
      the question. With respect to her father, it was a question soon answered.
      She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short parley
      with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting
      her father.&mdash;She even wept over the idea of it, as a sin of thought.
      While he lived, it must be only an engagement; but she flattered herself,
      that if divested of the danger of drawing her away, it might become an
      increase of comfort to him.&mdash;How to do her best by Harriet, was of
      more difficult decision;&mdash;how to spare her from any unnecessary pain;
      how to make her any possible atonement; how to appear least her enemy?&mdash;On
      these subjects, her perplexity and distress were very great&mdash;and her
      mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and
      sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.&mdash;She could only resolve
      at last, that she would still avoid a meeting with her, and communicate
      all that need be told by letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable
      to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury, and&mdash;indulging
      in one scheme more&mdash;nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to
      get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square.&mdash;Isabella had been
      pleased with Harriet; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some
      amusement.&mdash;She did not think it in Harriet's nature to escape being
      benefited by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the
      children.&mdash;At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness
      in herself, from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present;
      an averting of the evil day, when they must all be together again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which left
      her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking up to
      Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half an hour
      stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him, literally and
      figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of
      the happiness of the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the
      slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was
      brought her from Randalls&mdash;a very thick letter;&mdash;she guessed
      what it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.&mdash;She
      was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no
      explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself&mdash;and as
      for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of
      it.&mdash;It must be waded through, however. She opened the packet; it was
      too surely so;&mdash;a note from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the
      letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the
      enclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have scarcely a
      doubt of its happy effect.&mdash;I think we shall never materially
      disagree about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long
      preface.&mdash;We are quite well.&mdash;This letter has been the cure of
      all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.&mdash;I did not
      quite like your looks on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and
      though you will never own being affected by weather, I think every body
      feels a north-east wind.&mdash;I felt for your dear father very much in
      the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort
      of hearing last night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.

MY DEAR MADAM,
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected;
      but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and indulgence.&mdash;You
      are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of even all your
      goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.&mdash;But I have been
      forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage rises while I
      write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble. I have
      already met with such success in two applications for pardon, that I may
      be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours, and of those among your
      friends who have had any ground of offence.&mdash;You must all endeavour
      to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at
      Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at
      all hazards. This was the fact. My right to place myself in a situation
      requiring such concealment, is another question. I shall not discuss it
      here. For my temptation to <i>think</i> it a right, I refer every caviller
      to a brick house, sashed windows below, and casements above, in Highbury.
      I dared not address her openly; my difficulties in the then state of
      Enscombe must be too well known to require definition; and I was fortunate
      enough to prevail, before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most
      upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret
      engagement.&mdash;Had she refused, I should have gone mad.&mdash;But you
      will be ready to say, what was your hope in doing this?&mdash;What did you
      look forward to?&mdash;To any thing, every thing&mdash;to time, chance,
      circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness,
      health and sickness. Every possibility of good was before me, and the
      first of blessings secured, in obtaining her promises of faith and
      correspondence. If you need farther explanation, I have the honour, my
      dear madam, of being your husband's son, and the advantage of inheriting a
      disposition to hope for good, which no inheritance of houses or lands can
      ever equal the value of.&mdash;See me, then, under these circumstances,
      arriving on my first visit to Randalls;&mdash;and here I am conscious of
      wrong, for that visit might have been sooner paid. You will look back and
      see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as <i>you</i>
      were the person slighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work
      on my father's compassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented
      myself from his house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you. My
      behaviour, during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did
      not, I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point. And now
      I come to the principal, the only important part of my conduct while
      belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires very
      solicitous explanation. With the greatest respect, and the warmest
      friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I
      ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.&mdash;A few words which
      dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some censure I
      acknowledge myself liable to.&mdash;My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse
      indicated, I believe, more than it ought.&mdash;In order to assist a
      concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than an
      allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately
      thrown.&mdash;I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object&mdash;but
      I am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been convinced
      of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any selfish views to
      go on.&mdash;Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave
      me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she was
      perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much my
      conviction as my wish.&mdash;She received my attentions with an easy,
      friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me. We seemed to
      understand each other. From our relative situation, those attentions were
      her due, and were felt to be so.&mdash;Whether Miss Woodhouse began really
      to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;&mdash;when
      I called to take leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment of
      confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not without suspicion;
      but I have no doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some
      degree.&mdash;She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must
      have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find, whenever the
      subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not take
      her wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it. I remember her
      telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her
      attentions to Miss Fairfax.&mdash;I hope this history of my conduct
      towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of
      what you saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against Emma
      Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and
      procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of
      that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly affection,
      as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.&mdash;Whatever
      strange things I said or did during that fortnight, you have now a key to.
      My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to get my body thither as
      often as might be, and with the least suspicion. If you remember any
      queernesses, set them all to the right account.&mdash;Of the pianoforte so
      much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that its being ordered
      was absolutely unknown to Miss F&mdash;, who would never have allowed me
      to send it, had any choice been given her.&mdash;The delicacy of her mind
      throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, is much beyond my power of
      doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly
      yourself.&mdash;No description can describe her. She must tell you herself
      what she is&mdash;yet not by word, for never was there a human creature
      who would so designedly suppress her own merit.&mdash;Since I began this
      letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.&mdash;She
      gives a good account of her own health; but as she never complains, I dare
      not depend. I want to have your opinion of her looks. I know you will soon
      call on her; she is living in dread of the visit. Perhaps it is paid
      already. Let me hear from you without delay; I am impatient for a thousand
      particulars. Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls, and in how
      bewildered, how mad a state: and I am not much better yet; still insane
      either from happiness or misery. When I think of the kindness and favour I
      have met with, of her excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity,
      I am mad with joy: but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned
      her, and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I
      could but see her again!&mdash;But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has
      been too good for me to encroach.&mdash;I must still add to this long
      letter. You have not heard all that you ought to hear. I could not give
      any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the
      unseasonableness with which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for
      though the event of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately
      opened to me the happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such
      early measures, but from the very particular circumstances, which left me
      not an hour to lose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty,
      and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and
      refinement.&mdash;But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had
      entered into with that woman&mdash;Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to
      leave off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.&mdash;I have been
      walking over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the
      rest of my letter what it ought to be.&mdash;It is, in fact, a most
      mortifying retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can admit,
      that my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly
      blameable. <i>She</i> disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.&mdash;My
      plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.&mdash;She was
      displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand
      occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even cold.
      But she was always right. If I had followed her judgment, and subdued my
      spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have escaped the
      greatest unhappiness I have ever known.&mdash;We quarrelled.&mdash; Do you
      remember the morning spent at Donwell?&mdash;<i>There</i> every little
      dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was late; I
      met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she
      would not suffer it. She absolutely refused to allow me, which I then
      thought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very
      natural and consistent degree of discretion. While I, to blind the world
      to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity
      to another woman, was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which
      might have made every previous caution useless?&mdash;Had we been met
      walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been
      suspected.&mdash;I was mad enough, however, to resent.&mdash;I doubted her
      affection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by
      such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such
      apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any
      woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words
      perfectly intelligible to me.&mdash;In short, my dear madam, it was a
      quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and I returned the same
      evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with you till the next
      morning, merely because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even
      then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time; but I
      was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away
      determined that she should make the first advances.&mdash;I shall always
      congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Had you
      witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have
      thought well of me again. Its effect upon her appears in the immediate
      resolution it produced: as soon as she found I was really gone from
      Randalls, she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the
      whole system of whose treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me
      with indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of
      forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself; but,
      otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it which that
      woman has known.&mdash;'Jane,' indeed!&mdash;You will observe that I have
      not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you. Think,
      then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons
      with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence of
      imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.&mdash;She
      closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the
      next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.&mdash;<i>She</i> <i>felt</i>
      <i>the</i> <i>engagement</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>a</i> <i>source</i> <i>of</i>
      <i>repentance</i> <i>and</i> <i>misery</i> <i>to</i> <i>each</i>: <i>she</i>
      <i>dissolved</i> <i>it</i>.&mdash;This letter reached me on the very
      morning of my poor aunt's death. I answered it within an hour; but from
      the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on me
      at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all the many other letters
      of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had
      written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without
      any uneasiness.&mdash;I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from
      her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and&mdash;may
      I add?&mdash;too cheerful in my views to be captious.&mdash;We removed to
      Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own
      letters all returned!&mdash;and a few lines at the same time by the post,
      stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her
      last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could not be
      misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every
      subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by
      a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not
      directly command hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I
      would forward them after that period to her at&mdash;: in short, the full
      direction to Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face. I knew
      the name, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had
      been doing. It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character
      which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained, as to any
      such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive of its anxious
      delicacy. For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me.&mdash;Imagine
      the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected my own blunder, I
      raved at the blunders of the post.&mdash;What was to be done?&mdash;One
      thing only.&mdash;I must speak to my uncle. Without his sanction I could
      not hope to be listened to again.&mdash;I spoke; circumstances were in my
      favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he was, earlier
      than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying; and could
      say at last, poor man! with a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as
      much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.&mdash;I felt that it
      would be of a different sort.&mdash;Are you disposed to pity me for what I
      must have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense while all
      was at stake?&mdash;No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw
      how ill I had made her. Do not pity me till I saw her wan, sick looks.&mdash;I
      reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my knowledge of their late
      breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone.&mdash;I
      was not disappointed; and at last I was not disappointed either in the
      object of my journey. A great deal of very reasonable, very just
      displeasure I had to persuade away. But it is done; we are reconciled,
      dearer, much dearer, than ever, and no moment's uneasiness can ever occur
      between us again. Now, my dear madam, I will release you; but I could not
      conclude before. A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you
      have ever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will
      dictate towards her.&mdash;If you think me in a way to be happier than I
      deserve, I am quite of your opinion.&mdash;Miss W. calls me the child of
      good fortune. I hope she is right.&mdash;In one respect, my good fortune
      is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself,

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings. She was obliged, in
      spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the
      justice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her own name, it
      was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting, and
      almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject could
      still maintain itself, by the natural return of her former regard for the
      writer, and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have
      for her at that moment. She never stopt till she had gone through the
      whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong,
      yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed&mdash;and he had
      suffered, and was very sorry&mdash;and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston,
      and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself, that
      there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, she must
      have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again, she
      desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing it to be
      communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so much
      to blame in his conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very glad to look it over,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but it seems long. I
      will take it home with me at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she must
      return it by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather be talking to you,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but as it seems a matter
      of justice, it shall be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began&mdash;stopping, however, almost directly to say, &ldquo;Had I been
      offered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law
      a few months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such
      indifference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a smile,
      observed, &ldquo;Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his way. One
      man's style must not be the rule of another's. We will not be severe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be natural for me,&rdquo; he added shortly afterwards, &ldquo;to speak my
      opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you. It
      will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I should wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He trifles here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as to the temptation. He knows he is wrong,
      and has nothing rational to urge.&mdash;Bad.&mdash;He ought not to have
      formed the engagement.&mdash;'His father's disposition:'&mdash;he is
      unjust, however, to his father. Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a
      blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston
      earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.&mdash;Very
      true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have not forgotten,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;how sure you were that he might
      have come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely&mdash;but
      you were perfectly right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:&mdash;but yet, I think&mdash;had
      <i>you</i> not been in the case&mdash;I should still have distrusted him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it
      aloud&mdash;all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the
      head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as
      the subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady
      reflection, thus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very bad&mdash;though it might have been worse.&mdash;Playing a most
      dangerous game. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.&mdash;No
      judge of his own manners by you.&mdash;Always deceived in fact by his own
      wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.&mdash;Fancying
      you to have fathomed his secret. Natural enough!&mdash;his own mind full
      of intrigue, that he should suspect it in others.&mdash;Mystery; Finesse&mdash;how
      they pervert the understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to
      prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings
      with each other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account,
      which she could not give any sincere explanation of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go on,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, &ldquo;the pianoforte! Ah! That was
      the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether the
      inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure. A boyish
      scheme, indeed!&mdash;I cannot comprehend a man's wishing to give a woman
      any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with; and
      he did know that she would have prevented the instrument's coming if she
      could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill's
      confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for
      more than a word in passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perfectly agree with you, sir,&rdquo;&mdash;was then his remark. &ldquo;You did
      behave very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.&rdquo; And having gone
      through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and
      his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of
      right, he made a fuller pause to say, &ldquo;This is very bad.&mdash;He had
      induced her to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme
      difficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his first object to
      prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.&mdash;She must have had much
      more to contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He
      should have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but
      hers were all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and remember that
      she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that
      she should have been in such a state of punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew
      uncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She was deeply
      ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read, however,
      steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and, excepting one
      momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain&mdash;no
      remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the
      Eltons,&rdquo; was his next observation.&mdash;&ldquo;His feelings are natural.&mdash;What!
      actually resolve to break with him entirely!&mdash;She felt the engagement
      to be a source of repentance and misery to each&mdash;she dissolved it.&mdash;What
      a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!&mdash;Well, he must be a
      most extraordinary&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, read on.&mdash;You will find how very much he suffers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he does,&rdquo; replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.
      &ldquo;'Smallridge!'&mdash;What does this mean? What is all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children&mdash;a
      dear friend of Mrs. Elton's&mdash;a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the
      bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read&mdash;not even of
      Mrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter the
      man writes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there <i>is</i> feeling here.&mdash;He does seem to have suffered
      in finding her ill.&mdash;Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond
      of her. 'Dearer, much dearer than ever.' I hope he may long continue to
      feel all the value of such a reconciliation.&mdash;He is a very liberal
      thanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.&mdash;'Happier than I
      deserve.' Come, he knows himself there. 'Miss Woodhouse calls me the child
      of good fortune.'&mdash;Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?&mdash;
      And a fine ending&mdash;and there is the letter. The child of good
      fortune! That was your name for him, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still
      you must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. I hope
      it does him some service with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of
      inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion in
      thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he is,
      beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it may be
      hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am very ready to
      believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers the steadiness
      and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me talk to you of
      something else. I have another person's interest at present so much at
      heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill. Ever since I
      left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on one
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English,
      such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with, how to
      be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the happiness of her
      father. Emma's answer was ready at the first word. &ldquo;While her dear father
      lived, any change of condition must be impossible for her. She could never
      quit him.&rdquo; Part only of this answer, however, was admitted. The
      impossibility of her quitting her father, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly
      as herself; but the inadmissibility of any other change, he could not
      agree to. He had been thinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had
      at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he
      had wanted to believe it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse
      would not suffer him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his
      persuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father's
      comfort, perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded. Mr.
      Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!&mdash;No, he felt that it ought not to be
      attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he
      trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable; it
      was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as her father's
      happiness&mdash;in other words, his life&mdash;required Hartfield to continue her
      home, it should be his likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing
      thoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such an
      alternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of all the
      affection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must be
      sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that in
      living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there would
      be much, very much, to be borne with. She promised to think of it, and
      advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no
      reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject. He had
      given it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration; he had
      been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his
      thoughts to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,&rdquo; cried Emma. &ldquo;I am sure
      William Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before you ask
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,
      moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good
      scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in
      which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never struck
      with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as
      heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she must
      of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she only gave
      herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in detecting
      the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane
      Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had wholly imputed to the
      amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield&mdash;the
      more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became. His evils seemed to
      lessen, her own advantages to increase, their mutual good to outweigh
      every drawback. Such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and
      cheerlessness before her!&mdash;Such a partner in all those duties and
      cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy!
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing of
      her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend, who
      must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family party
      which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere charitable
      caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be a loser in every way.
      Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own
      enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than
      otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel
      necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited
      punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is, supplanted;
      but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr. Knightley himself
      would be doing nothing to assist the cure;&mdash;not like Mr. Elton. Mr.
      Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly considerate for every
      body, would never deserve to be less worshipped than now; and it really
      was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she could be in love with more
      than <i>three</i> men in one year.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself
      to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by letter. How
      much worse, had they been obliged to meet!
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without
      reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there was
      a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her style, which
      increased the desirableness of their being separate.&mdash;It might be
      only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have
      been quite without resentment under such a stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and she was
      fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting
      to invention.&mdash;There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished, and
      had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was
      delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to
      her&mdash;and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she
      was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.&mdash;When it was thus
      settled on her sister's side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found
      her very persuadable.&mdash;Harriet was to go; she was invited for at
      least a fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.&mdash;It
      was all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick
      Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she could talk,
      and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense of
      injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her when
      remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much might at that
      moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings which she
      had led astray herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps an
      unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not think of
      her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must be
      averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in
      her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication before her,
      one which <i>she</i> only could be competent to make&mdash;the confession
      of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with it
      at present.&mdash;She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs.
      Weston were safe and well. No additional agitation should be thrown at
      this period among those she loved&mdash;and the evil should not act on
      herself by anticipation before the appointed time.&mdash;A fortnight, at
      least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more
      agitating, delight, should be hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an
      hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.&mdash;She
      ought to go&mdash;and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their
      present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be
      a <i>secret</i> satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of
      prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend
      to any thing Jane might communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went&mdash;she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not
      been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had
      been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all the
      worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.&mdash;The fear of being
      still unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home, to
      wait in the passage, and send up her name.&mdash;She heard Patty
      announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before
      made so happily intelligible.&mdash;No; she heard nothing but the instant
      reply of, &ldquo;Beg her to walk up;&rdquo;&mdash;and a moment afterwards she was met
      on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other
      reception of her were felt sufficient.&mdash;Emma had never seen her look
      so well, so lovely, so engaging. There was consciousness, animation, and
      warmth; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever
      have wanted.&mdash; She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a
      low, but very feeling tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is most kind, indeed!&mdash;Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me
      to express&mdash;I hope you will believe&mdash;Excuse me for being so
      entirely without words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the
      sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checked her, and
      made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory
      sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which
      accounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs. Elton
      elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body; and
      as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped the rencontre
      would do them no harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, and
      understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in
      Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what was
      still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the
      expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs.
      Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw her
      with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had
      apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the
      purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want
      opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already. I
      only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is not
      offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweet
      creature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.&mdash;But not a word
      more. Let us be discreet&mdash;quite on our good behaviour.&mdash;Hush!&mdash;You
      remember those lines&mdash;I forget the poem at this moment:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;For when a lady's in the case,
        &ldquo;You know all other things give place.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Now I say, my dear, in <i>our</i> case, for <i>lady</i>, read&mdash;&mdash;mum!
      a word to the wise.&mdash;I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I? But I
      want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.&mdash;<i>My</i>
      representation, you see, has quite appeased her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates's
      knitting, she added, in a half whisper,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mentioned no <i>names</i>, you will observe.&mdash;Oh! no; cautious as
      a minister of state. I managed it extremely well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every
      possible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony of
      the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is
      charmingly recovered?&mdash;Do not you think her cure does Perry the
      highest credit?&mdash;(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.)
      Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!&mdash;Oh!
      if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!&rdquo;&mdash;And when
      Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther, &ldquo;We do not say
      a word of any <i>assistance</i> that Perry might have; not a word of a
      certain young physician from Windsor.&mdash;Oh! no; Perry shall have all
      the credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,&rdquo; she
      shortly afterwards began, &ldquo;since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasant
      party. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not seem&mdash;that
      is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.&mdash;So it
      appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think it
      answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to our
      collecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine
      weather lasts?&mdash;It must be the same party, you know, quite the same
      party, not <i>one</i> exception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted
      by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed,
      from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.&mdash;It is
      impossible to say&mdash;Yes, indeed, I quite understand&mdash;dearest
      Jane's prospects&mdash;that is, I do not mean.&mdash;But she is charmingly
      recovered.&mdash;How is Mr. Woodhouse?&mdash;I am so glad.&mdash;Quite out
      of my power.&mdash;Such a happy little circle as you find us here.&mdash;Yes,
      indeed.&mdash;Charming young man!&mdash;that is&mdash;so very friendly; I
      mean good Mr. Perry!&mdash;such attention to Jane!&rdquo;&mdash;And from her
      great, her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for
      being there, Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment
      towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously
      overcome.&mdash;After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a
      guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that
      anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth is,
      that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join me here, and
      pay his respects to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?&mdash;That
      will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits,
      and Mr. Elton's time is so engaged.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.&mdash;He really is engaged from morning
      to night.&mdash;There is no end of people's coming to him, on some
      pretence or other.&mdash;The magistrates, and overseers, and
      churchwardens, are always wanting his opinion. They seem not able to do
      any thing without him.&mdash;'Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, 'rather
      you than I.&mdash;I do not know what would become of my crayons and my
      instrument, if I had half so many applicants.'&mdash;Bad enough as it is,
      for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.&mdash;I
      believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.&mdash;However, he is
      coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all.&rdquo; And
      putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma&mdash;&ldquo;A congratulatory
      visit, you know.&mdash;Oh! yes, quite indispensable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bates looked about her, so happily&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from
      Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.&mdash;Mr.
      E. is Knightley's right hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, &ldquo;Is Mr. Elton
      gone on foot to Donwell?&mdash;He will have a hot walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and Cole
      will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.&mdash;I
      fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have not you mistaken the day?&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;I am almost certain that the
      meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.&mdash;Mr. Knightley was at
      Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,&rdquo; was the abrupt answer, which
      denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.&mdash;&ldquo;I do
      believe,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;this is the most troublesome parish that ever
      was. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your parish there was small,&rdquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject
      talked of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard you
      speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge; the only
      school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you clever creature, that's very true. What a thinking brain you
      have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if we
      could be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would produce
      perfection.&mdash;Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that <i>some</i>
      people may not think <i>you</i> perfection already.&mdash;But hush!&mdash;not
      a word, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words, not
      to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw. The wish
      of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very evident,
      though it could not often proceed beyond a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of her
      sparkling vivacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an encumbrance
      to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!&mdash;But you knew
      what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I should not stir
      till my lord and master appeared.&mdash;Here have I been sitting this
      hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience&mdash;for
      who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away. His
      civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent object was
      to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and the walk he had
      had for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I got to Donwell,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Knightley could not be found. Very odd!
      very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and the
      message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Donwell!&rdquo; cried his wife.&mdash;&ldquo;My dear Mr. E., you have not been to
      Donwell!&mdash;You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the
      Crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley
      to-day on that very account.&mdash;Such a dreadful broiling morning!&mdash;I
      went over the fields too&mdash;(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,)
      which made it so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I
      assure you I am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for
      me. The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.&mdash;Very
      extraordinary!&mdash;And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps
      to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.&mdash;Miss
      Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!&mdash;Can you explain
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary, indeed,
      and that she had not a syllable to say for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot imagine,&rdquo; said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife
      ought to do,) &ldquo;I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of
      all people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to be
      forgotten!&mdash;My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am
      sure he must.&mdash;Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;&mdash;and
      his servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely
      to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed,
      extremely awkward and remiss.&mdash;I am sure I would not have such a
      creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration. And as
      for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.&mdash;She promised
      Wright a receipt, and never sent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met William Larkins,&rdquo; continued Mr. Elton, &ldquo;as I got near the house,
      and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not believe
      him.&mdash;William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what was
      come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get the
      speech of him. I have nothing to do with William's wants, but it really is
      of very great importance that <i>I</i> should see Knightley to-day; and it
      becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should
      have had this hot walk to no purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In all
      probability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr. Knightley
      might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr. Elton, if
      not towards William Larkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to
      attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her an
      opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you not
      been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to introduce a
      subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might have been
      strictly correct.&mdash;I feel that I should certainly have been
      impertinent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought
      infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual
      composure&mdash;&ldquo;there would have been no danger. The danger would have
      been of my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than by
      expressing an interest&mdash;. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more
      collectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very
      great misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of
      my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not disgusted
      to such a degree as to&mdash;I have not time for half that I could wish to
      say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself. I
      feel it so very due. But, unfortunately&mdash;in short, if your compassion
      does not stand my friend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,&rdquo; cried Emma warmly, and
      taking her hand. &ldquo;You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you
      might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted
      even&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.&mdash;So cold
      and artificial!&mdash;I had always a part to act.&mdash;It was a life of
      deceit!&mdash;I know that I must have disgusted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side. Let
      us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done quickest,
      and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you have pleasant
      accounts from Windsor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you&mdash;just
      as I begin to know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here
      till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,&rdquo; replied Emma, smiling&mdash;&ldquo;but,
      excuse me, it must be thought of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile was returned as Jane answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, (I am
      sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at
      Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of deep
      mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing more to
      wait for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you.&mdash;This is just what I wanted to be assured of.&mdash;Oh!
      if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!&mdash;Good-bye,
      good-bye.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the
      satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by
      knowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided in
      wishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was with any
      view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella's sons;
      but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother
      best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older&mdash;and
      even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence&mdash;to have his
      fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks and the
      fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston&mdash;no one
      could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would be quite a
      pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not have their
      powers in exercise again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,&rdquo; she continued&mdash;&ldquo;like
      La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis, in Madame de Genlis'
      Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own little Adelaide
      educated on a more perfect plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is,&rdquo; replied Mr. Knightley, &ldquo;she will indulge her even more than she
      did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It will be the
      only difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; cried Emma; &ldquo;at that rate, what will become of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing very bad.&mdash;The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable
      in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all my
      bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing all
      my happiness to <i>you</i>, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to
      be severe on them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma laughed, and replied: &ldquo;But I had the assistance of all your
      endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt whether
      my own sense would have corrected me without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&mdash;I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:&mdash;Miss
      Taylor gave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was
      quite as likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say,
      what right has he to lecture me?&mdash;and I am afraid very natural for
      you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I
      did you any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of
      the tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much without
      doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,
      have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you were of use to me,&rdquo; cried Emma. &ldquo;I was very often
      influenced rightly by you&mdash;oftener than I would own at the time. I am
      very sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be
      spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as
      you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is
      thirteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your
      saucy looks&mdash;'Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I
      may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'&mdash;something which, you knew, I did
      not approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings
      instead of one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an amiable creature I was!&mdash;No wonder you should hold my
      speeches in such affectionate remembrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mr. Knightley.'&mdash;You always called me, 'Mr. Knightley;' and, from
      habit, it has not so very formal a sound.&mdash;And yet it is formal. I
      want you to call me something else, but I do not know what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember once calling you 'George,' in one of my amiable fits, about
      ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as you
      made no objection, I never did it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And cannot you call me 'George' now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&mdash;I never can call you any thing but 'Mr. Knightley.' I
      will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by
      calling you Mr. K.&mdash;But I will promise,&rdquo; she added presently,
      laughing and blushing&mdash;&ldquo;I will promise to call you once by your
      Christian name. I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;&mdash;in
      the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important
      service which his better sense would have rendered her, to the advice
      which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies&mdash;her
      wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a subject.&mdash;She
      could not enter on it.&mdash;Harriet was very seldom mentioned between
      them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not being thought
      of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a
      suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship were declining.
      She was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances, they
      certainly should have corresponded more, and that her intelligence would
      not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on Isabella's letters. He
      might observe that it was so. The pain of being obliged to practise
      concealment towards him, was very little inferior to the pain of having
      made Harriet unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be
      expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits, which
      appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but,
      since that business had been over, she did not appear to find Harriet
      different from what she had known her before.&mdash;Isabella, to be sure,
      was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing
      with the children, it would not have escaped her. Emma's comforts and
      hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer;
      her fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John
      Knightley were to come down in August, and she was invited to remain till
      they could bring her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John does not even mention your friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley. &ldquo;Here is his
      answer, if you like to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. Emma
      accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to know
      what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that her
      friend was unmentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John enters like a brother into my happiness,&rdquo; continued Mr. Knightley,
      &ldquo;but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have, likewise,
      a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from making flourishes,
      that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise. But
      I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He writes like a sensible man,&rdquo; replied Emma, when she had read the
      letter. &ldquo;I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers the
      good fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not
      without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as you
      think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a different construction,
      I should not have believed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,&rdquo;
       interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile&mdash;&ldquo;much less, perhaps,
      than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emma, my dear Emma&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried with more thorough gaiety, &ldquo;if you fancy your brother does
      not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret, and
      hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much farther from doing <i>you</i>
      justice. He will think all the happiness, all the advantage, on your side
      of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish I may not sink into 'poor
      Emma' with him at once.&mdash;His tender compassion towards oppressed
      worth can go no farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as
      John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give, to be
      happy together. I am amused by one part of John's letter&mdash;did you
      notice it?&mdash;where he says, that my information did not take him
      wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something
      of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having some
      thoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectly unprepared
      for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my
      feelings. What has he been judging by?&mdash;I am not conscious of any
      difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this
      time for my marrying any more than at another.&mdash;But it was so, I
      suppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them
      the other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as
      usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, 'Uncle seems always
      tired now.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons'
      reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered
      to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view that her gentle
      reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to announce it
      at home, and then at Randalls.&mdash;But how to break it to her father at
      last!&mdash;She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr.
      Knightley's absence, or when it came to the point her heart would have
      failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at
      such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.&mdash;She was
      forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it a more
      decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself. She must
      not appear to think it a misfortune.&mdash;With all the spirits she could
      command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then, in a few
      words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be obtained&mdash;which,
      she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty, since it was a plan to
      promote the happiness of all&mdash;she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry;
      by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that
      person's company whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs.
      Weston, best in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor man!&mdash;it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried
      earnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of
      having always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be a
      great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella, and
      poor Miss Taylor.&mdash;But it would not do. Emma hung about him
      affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must not
      class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them from
      Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she was not going
      from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducing no change
      in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she was very
      sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley
      always at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.&mdash;Did he not
      love Mr. Knightley very much?&mdash;He would not deny that he did, she was
      sure.&mdash;Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr.
      Knightley?&mdash;Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his
      letters, who so glad to assist him?&mdash;Who so cheerful, so attentive,
      so attached to him?&mdash;Would not he like to have him always on the
      spot?&mdash;Yes. That was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there
      too often; he should be glad to see him every day;&mdash;but they did see
      him every day as it was.&mdash;Why could not they go on as they had done?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,
      the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.&mdash;To
      Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose fond
      praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon
      used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.&mdash;They had all
      the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest
      approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to consider
      the subject in the most serviceable light&mdash;first, as a settled, and,
      secondly, as a good one&mdash;well aware of the nearly equal importance of
      the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.&mdash;It was agreed upon,
      as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided
      assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings
      himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or
      other&mdash;in another year or two, perhaps&mdash;it might not be so very
      bad if the marriage did take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she said
      to him in favour of the event.&mdash;She had been extremely surprized,
      never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she saw
      in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in urging him
      to the utmost.&mdash;She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as to think
      he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect so proper,
      suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one respect, one point
      of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible, so singularly
      fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached
      herself to any other creature, and that she had herself been the stupidest
      of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it long ago.&mdash;How
      very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have
      renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr. Knightley could
      know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement
      desirable!&mdash;The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had
      been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, for a marriage
      between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield
      had been a continual impediment&mdash;less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than
      by herself&mdash;but even he had never been able to finish the subject
      better than by saying&mdash;&ldquo;Those matters will take care of themselves;
      the young people will find a way.&rdquo; But here there was nothing to be
      shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was all right, all
      open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the name. It was a union
      of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and without one real,
      rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections as
      these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing could
      increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon have
      outgrown its first set of caps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston had
      his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to familiarise
      the idea to his quickness of mind.&mdash;He saw the advantages of the
      match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but the
      wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he was not
      far from believing that he had always foreseen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to be a secret, I conclude,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;These matters are always a
      secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me be
      told when I may speak out.&mdash;I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that point.
      He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldest daughter?&mdash;he
      must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed, of course, to Mrs.
      Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately afterwards. It was no more
      than the principals were prepared for; they had calculated from the time
      of its being known at Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and
      were thinking of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family
      circle, with great sagacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him, and
      others might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommend their
      all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys;
      and another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet,
      upon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one
      habitation, the Vicarage.&mdash;There, the surprize was not softened by
      any satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his wife;
      he only hoped &ldquo;the young lady's pride would now be contented;&rdquo; and
      supposed &ldquo;she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could;&rdquo; and, on
      the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, &ldquo;Rather he than
      I!&rdquo;&mdash;But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.&mdash;&ldquo;Poor
      Knightley! poor fellow!&mdash;sad business for him.&rdquo;&mdash;She was
      extremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good
      qualities.&mdash;How could he be so taken in?&mdash;Did not think him at
      all in love&mdash;not in the least.&mdash;Poor Knightley!&mdash;There
      would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.&mdash;How happy he
      had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him! But that
      would be all over now.&mdash;Poor fellow!&mdash;No more exploring parties
      to Donwell made for <i>her</i>. Oh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to
      throw cold water on every thing.&mdash;Extremely disagreeable! But she was
      not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.&mdash;Shocking
      plan, living together. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple
      Grove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the
      first quarter.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Time passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would be
      arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one
      morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her, when
      Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After the
      first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began
      with,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good or bad?&rdquo; said she, quickly, looking up in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know which it ought to be called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! good I am sure.&mdash;I see it in your countenance. You are trying
      not to smile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said he, composing his features, &ldquo;I am very much afraid, my
      dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! but why so?&mdash;I can hardly imagine that any thing which
      pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one subject,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I hope but one, on which we do not
      think alike.&rdquo; He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on
      her face. &ldquo;Does nothing occur to you?&mdash;Do not you recollect?&mdash;Harriet
      Smith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something, though
      she knew not what.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard from her yourself this morning?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;You have, I
      believe, and know the whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are prepared for the worst, I see&mdash;and very bad it is. Harriet
      Smith marries Robert Martin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared&mdash;and her
      eyes, in eager gaze, said, &ldquo;No, this is impossible!&rdquo; but her lips were
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so, indeed,&rdquo; continued Mr. Knightley; &ldquo;I have it from Robert Martin
      himself. He left me not half an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.&mdash;I wish our opinions
      were the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one
      or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not
      talk much on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mistake me, you quite mistake me,&rdquo; she replied, exerting herself. &ldquo;It
      is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I cannot
      believe it. It seems an impossibility!&mdash;You cannot mean to say, that
      Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he has even
      proposed to her again&mdash;yet. You only mean, that he intends it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that he has done it,&rdquo; answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but
      determined decision, &ldquo;and been accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; she cried.&mdash;&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;&mdash;Then having recourse to her
      workbasket, in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the
      exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be
      expressing, she added, &ldquo;Well, now tell me every thing; make this
      intelligible to me. How, where, when?&mdash;Let me know it all. I never
      was more surprized&mdash;but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.&mdash;How&mdash;how
      has it been possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago,
      and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to
      John.&mdash;He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was
      asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's. They were
      going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party was to be our
      brother and sister, Henry, John&mdash;and Miss Smith. My friend Robert
      could not resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely
      amused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day&mdash;which
      he did&mdash;and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an
      opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in vain.&mdash;She
      made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is deserving. He came
      down by yesterday's coach, and was with me this morning immediately after
      breakfast, to report his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his
      own. This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when. Your
      friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.&mdash;She
      will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman's language can
      make interesting.&mdash;In our communications we deal only in the great.&mdash;However,
      I must say, that Robert Martin's heart seemed for <i>him</i>, and to <i>me</i>,
      very overflowing; and that he did mention, without its being much to the
      purpose, that on quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took charge of
      Mrs. John Knightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and
      Henry; and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss
      Smith rather uneasy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped.&mdash;Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak,
      she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.
      She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Her silence disturbed
      him; and after observing her a little while, he added,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you
      unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His
      situation is an evil&mdash;but you must consider it as what satisfies your
      friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as
      you know him more. His good sense and good principles would delight you.&mdash;As
      far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in better
      hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is saying a
      great deal I assure you, Emma.&mdash;You laugh at me about William
      Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not to
      smile too broadly&mdash;she did&mdash;cheerfully answering,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think
      Harriet is doing extremely well. <i>Her</i> connexions may be worse than
      <i>his</i>. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that
      they are. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You
      cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared I
      was!&mdash;for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined
      against him, much more, than she was before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know your friend best,&rdquo; replied Mr. Knightley; &ldquo;but I should
      say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be very,
      very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma could not help laughing as she answered, &ldquo;Upon my word, I believe you
      know her quite as well as I do.&mdash;But, Mr. Knightley, are you
      perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright <i>accepted</i> him.
      I could suppose she might in time&mdash;but can she already?&mdash;Did not
      you misunderstand him?&mdash;You were both talking of other things; of
      business, shows of cattle, or new drills&mdash;and might not you, in the
      confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?&mdash;It was not Harriet's
      hand that he was certain of&mdash;it was the dimensions of some famous
      ox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert
      Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and so strong
      was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet's side,
      so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis, &ldquo;No, I hope
      I know better than to think of Robert Martin,&rdquo; that she was really
      expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature. It could
      not be otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dare say this?&rdquo; cried Mr. Knightley. &ldquo;Do you dare to suppose me so
      great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?&mdash;What do
      you deserve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with any
      other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are you
      quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet
      now are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite sure,&rdquo; he replied, speaking very distinctly, &ldquo;that he told me
      she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing doubtful,
      in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be
      so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew of no one but
      Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or
      friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs.
      Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then, he said, he would endeavour
      to see her in the course of this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly satisfied,&rdquo; replied Emma, with the brightest smiles, &ldquo;and
      most sincerely wish them happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so&mdash;for at that time I was a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all
      Harriet's good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and for
      Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much in
      love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have often talked to
      her a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes, indeed, I have
      thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin's cause, which
      was never the case; but, from all my observations, I am convinced of her
      being an artless, amiable girl, with very good notions, very seriously
      good principles, and placing her happiness in the affections and utility
      of domestic life.&mdash;Much of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you
      for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; cried Emma, shaking her head.&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! poor Harriet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more
      praise than she deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her
      father. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in a state
      of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to be collected.
      She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till she had moved
      about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected, she could be fit
      for nothing rational.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put the
      horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she had,
      therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be
      imagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of
      Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for
      security.&mdash;What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy
      of him, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her
      own. Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her
      humility and circumspection in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions;
      and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst of
      them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the doleful
      disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart&mdash;such a Harriet!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there would be pleasure in her returning&mdash;Every thing would be a
      pleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the
      reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would soon
      be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her to
      practise, might soon be over. She could now look forward to giving him
      that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to
      welcome as a duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not
      always listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in
      speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being
      obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived.&mdash;Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:&mdash;but
      hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the
      thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through
      the blind, of two figures passing near the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston. &ldquo;I was just going to
      tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning. He
      stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day
      with us.&mdash;They are coming in, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to see him&mdash;but
      there was a degree of confusion&mdash;a number of embarrassing
      recollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a
      consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all sat
      down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that Emma
      began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had long felt, of
      seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with Jane, would yield
      its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and
      when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or
      animation&mdash;or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw
      near her and say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message in
      one of Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made you less willing to
      pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; cried Emma, most happy to begin, &ldquo;not in the least. I am
      particularly glad to see and shake hands with you&mdash;and to give you
      joy in person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with
      serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not she looking well?&rdquo; said he, turning his eyes towards Jane. &ldquo;Better
      than she ever used to do?&mdash;You see how my father and Mrs. Weston doat
      upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after
      mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of
      Dixon.&mdash;Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her
      hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never think of it,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;without extreme shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shame,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;is all mine, or ought to be. But is it possible
      that you had no suspicion?&mdash;I mean of late. Early, I know, you had
      none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had the smallest, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near&mdash;and I wish I had&mdash;it
      would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong things, they
      were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.&mdash;It would
      have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and
      told you every thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not now worth a regret,&rdquo; said Emma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some hope,&rdquo; resumed he, &ldquo;of my uncle's being persuaded to pay a
      visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When the Campbells
      are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I trust,
      till we may carry her northward.&mdash;But now, I am at such a distance
      from her&mdash;is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?&mdash;Till this morning, we
      have not once met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay
      thought, he cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! by the bye,&rdquo; then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the
      moment&mdash;&ldquo;I hope Mr. Knightley is well?&rdquo; He paused.&mdash;She coloured
      and laughed.&mdash;&ldquo;I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember
      my wish in your favour. Let me return your congratulations.&mdash;I assure
      you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.&mdash;He
      is a man whom I cannot presume to praise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but
      his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane,
      and his next words were,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see such a skin?&mdash;such smoothness! such delicacy!&mdash;and
      yet without being actually fair.&mdash;One cannot call her fair. It is a
      most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair&mdash;a most
      distinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.&mdash;Just colour
      enough for beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always admired her complexion,&rdquo; replied Emma, archly; &ldquo;but do not
      I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?&mdash;When
      we first began to talk of her.&mdash;Have you quite forgotten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no&mdash;what an impudent dog I was!&mdash;How could I dare&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not help
      saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you had
      very great amusement in tricking us all.&mdash;I am sure you had.&mdash;I
      am sure it was a consolation to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, no, no&mdash;how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the
      most miserable wretch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was a
      source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us all
      in.&mdash;Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the
      truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same
      situation. I think there is a little likeness between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not in our dispositions,&rdquo; she presently added, with a look of true
      sensibility, &ldquo;there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which bids
      fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; he answered, warmly. &ldquo;No, not true on your side. You can
      have no superior, but most true on mine.&mdash;She is a complete angel.
      Look at her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her
      throat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.&mdash;You
      will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that
      my uncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels. They are to be new set. I
      am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be
      beautiful in her dark hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very beautiful, indeed,&rdquo; replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that he
      gratefully burst out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent
      looks!&mdash;I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should
      certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account of
      a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the infant's
      appearing not quite well. She believed she had been foolish, but it had
      alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr.
      Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston had been almost as
      uneasy as herself.&mdash;In ten minutes, however, the child had been
      perfectly well again. This was her history; and particularly interesting
      it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her very much for thinking of
      sending for Perry, and only regretted that she had not done it. &ldquo;She
      should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest
      degree disordered, were it only for a moment. She could not be too soon
      alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps, that he had
      not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now, very well
      considering, it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank Churchill caught the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perry!&rdquo; said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss Fairfax's
      eye. &ldquo;My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr. Perry?&mdash;Has
      he been here this morning?&mdash;And how does he travel now?&mdash;Has he
      set up his carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the
      laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she too was really
      hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such an extraordinary dream of mine!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I can never think of it
      without laughing.&mdash;She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see
      it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do not
      you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter, which
      sent me the report, is passing under her eye&mdash;that the whole blunder
      is spread before her&mdash;that she can attend to nothing else, though
      pretending to listen to the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly
      remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet
      steady voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!&mdash;They <i>will</i>
      sometimes obtrude&mdash;but how you can court them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but Emma's
      feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving Randalls,
      and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she felt, that
      pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and really regarding him
      as she did with friendship, she had never been more sensible of Mr.
      Knightley's high superiority of character. The happiness of this most
      happy day, received its completion, in the animated contemplation of his
      worth which this comparison produced.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a
      momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her
      attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from
      unbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the
      recurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the party from
      London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with
      Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied&mdash;unaccountable as it
      was!&mdash;that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley, and
      was now forming all her views of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet was a little distressed&mdash;did look a little foolish at first:
      but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and
      self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the
      words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the fullest
      exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend's approbation,
      Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by meeting her with
      the most unqualified congratulations.&mdash;Harriet was most happy to give
      every particular of the evening at Astley's, and the dinner the next day;
      she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight. But what did such
      particulars explain?&mdash;The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge,
      that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to
      love her had been irresistible.&mdash;Beyond this, it must ever be
      unintelligible to Emma.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh
      reason for thinking so.&mdash;Harriet's parentage became known. She proved
      to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the
      comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to
      have always wished for concealment.&mdash;Such was the blood of gentility
      which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!&mdash;It was likely to
      be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a
      connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley&mdash;or for the
      Churchills&mdash;or even for Mr. Elton!&mdash;The stain of illegitimacy,
      unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was treated
      liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted with
      Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully acknowledged
      in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for
      her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet's happiness with any
      good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he offered, there would
      be the hope of more, of security, stability, and improvement. She would be
      placed in the midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than
      herself; retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.
      She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out.
      She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be the
      luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and persevering
      an affection in such a man;&mdash;or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield
      only to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins, was
      less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.&mdash;The
      intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change into
      a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and must
      be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw her
      hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as no
      remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them, could
      impair.&mdash;Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton,
      but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on
      herself.&mdash;Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged
      of the three, were the first to be married.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the
      comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.&mdash;The Mr. Churchills
      were also in town; and they were only waiting for November.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by Emma
      and Mr. Knightley.&mdash;They had determined that their marriage ought to
      be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to allow
      them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, which was the plan.&mdash;John
      and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in approving it. But Mr.
      Woodhouse&mdash;how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to consent?&mdash;he,
      who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event.
    </p>
    <p>
      When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were
      almost hopeless.&mdash;A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.&mdash;He
      began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it&mdash;a very
      promising step of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, he
      was not happy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter's
      courage failed. She could not bear to see him suffering, to know him
      fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding almost acquiesced
      in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were
      over, his distress would be soon over too, she hesitated&mdash;she could
      not proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden
      illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his
      nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.&mdash;Mrs.
      Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys&mdash;evidently
      by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in the neighbourhood also
      suffered.&mdash;Pilfering was <i>housebreaking</i> to Mr. Woodhouse's
      fears.&mdash;He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his son-in-law's
      protection, would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life.
      The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys,
      commanded his fullest dependence. While either of them protected him and
      his, Hartfield was safe.&mdash;But Mr. John Knightley must be in London
      again by the end of the first week in November.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,
      cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the
      moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day&mdash;and Mr. Elton was called
      on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to
      join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have no
      taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars detailed
      by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very inferior to her
      own.&mdash;&ldquo;Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a most pitiful
      business!&mdash;Selina would stare when she heard of it.&rdquo;&mdash;But, in
      spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence, the
      predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony,
      were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
