The first issue of a work of\r\nthis kind is, too, ever beset with difficulties, and the compiler was\r\nalways aware that, though under the circumstances of its production the\r\nbook was an undoubted success, it necessarily lacked many of the\r\nelements which would make that success lasting, and cause the \xe2\x80\x9cSlang\r\nDictionary\xe2\x80\x9d to be regarded as an authority and a work of reference not\r\nmerely among the uneducated, but among people of cultivated tastes and\r\ninquiring minds. For though the vulgar use of the word Slang applies to\r\nthose words only which are used by the dangerous classes and the lowest\r\ngrades of society, the term has in reality, and should have\xe2\x80\x94as every\r\none who has ever studied the subject knows\xe2\x80\x94a much wider significance.\r\nBearing this in mind, the original publisher of this Dictionary lost no\r\nopportunity of obtaining information of a useful kind, which could\r\nhardly find place in any other book of reference, with the intention of\r\neventually bringing out an entirely new edition, in which all former\r\nerrors should be corrected and all fresh meanings and new words find a\r\nplace. His intention always was to give those words which are familiar\r\nto all conversant with our colloquialisms and locutions, but which have\r\nhitherto been connected with an unwritten tongue, a local habitation,\r\nand to produce a book which, in its way, would be as useful to students\r\nof philology, as well as to lovers of human nature in all its phases,\r\nas any standard work in the English language. The squeamishness which\r\ntries to ignore the existence of slang fails signally, for not only in\r\nthe streets and the prisons, but at the bar, on the bench, in the\r\npulpit, and in the Houses of Parliament, does slang make itself heard,\r\nand, as the shortest and safest means to an end, understood too.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor, the original compiler, did not live to see his wish\r\nbecome an actual fact; and, failing him, it devolved upon me to\r\nundertake the task of revision and addition. How far this has been\r\naccomplished, the curious reader who is possessed of a copy of each\r\nedition can best judge for himself by comparing any couple of pages he\r\nmay select. Of my own share in the work I wish to say nothing, as I have\r\nmainly benefited by the labours of others; but I may say that, when I\r\nundertook the position of editor of what, with the smallest possible\r\nstretch of fancy, may now be called a new book, I had no idea that the\r\nalteration would be nearly so large or so manifest. However, as the work\r\nis now done, it will best speak for itself, and, as good wine needs no\r\nbush, I will leave it, in all hope of their tenderness, to those readers\r\nwho are best qualified to say how the task has been consummated.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is but fair for me to thank, as strongly as weak words\r\nwill permit, those gentlemen who have in various ways assisted me. To\r\ntwo of them, who are well known in the world of literature, and who have\r\nnot only aided me with advice, but have placed many new words and\r\netymologies at my service, I am under particular obligation. With this I\r\nbeg to subscribe myself, the reader\xe2\x80\x99s most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n        The Editor.\r\n\r\n    _December 20, 1873._\r\n\r\n    NOTE.\xe2\x80\x94The reader will bear in mind that this is a Dictionary of\r\n    _modern_ Slang,\xe2\x80\x94a list of colloquial words and phrases in _present_\r\n    use,\xe2\x80\x94whether of ancient or modern formation.

T. BUCKLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF CANT,\r\n\r\nOR THE\r\n\r\nSECRET LANGUAGE OF VAGABONDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCant and Slang are universal and world-wide. By their means is often\r\nsaid in a sentence what would otherwise take an hour to express. Nearly\r\nevery nation on the face of the globe, polite and barbarous, has its\r\ndivisions and subdivisions of various ranks of society. These are\r\nnecessarily of many kinds, stationary and wandering, civilized and\r\nuncivilized, respectable and disreputable,\xe2\x80\x94those who have fixed abodes\r\nand avail themselves of the refinements of civilization, and those who\r\ngo from place to place picking up a precarious livelihood by petty\r\nsales, begging, or theft. This peculiarity is to be observed amongst the\r\nheathen tribes of the southern hemisphere, as well as in the oldest and\r\nmost refined countries of Europe. In South Africa, the naked and\r\nmiserable Hottentots are pestered by the still more abject _Sonquas_;\r\nand it may be some satisfaction for us to know that our old enemies at\r\nthe Cape, the Kaffirs, are troubled with a tribe of rascals called\r\n_Fingoes_,\xe2\x80\x94the former term, we are informed by travellers, signifying\r\nbeggars, and the latter wanderers and outcasts. In South America, and\r\namong the islands of the Pacific, matters are pretty much the same.\r\nSleek rascals, without much inclination towards honesty, fatten, or\r\nrather fasten, like the insects in the famous epigram, upon other\r\nrascals, who would be equally sleek and fat but for their vagabond\r\ndependents. Luckily for respectable persons, however, vagabonds, both at\r\nhome and abroad, generally show certain outward peculiarities which\r\ndistinguish them from the great mass of law-abiding people on whom they\r\nsubsist. Observation shows that the wandering races are remarkable for\r\nan abnormal development of the bones of the face, as the jaws,\r\ncheek-bones, &c., for high-crowned, stubborn-shaped heads, quick,\r\nrestless eyes,[1] and hands nervously itching to be doing; for their\r\nlove of gambling; for sensuality of all kinds; and for their use of a\r\nCANT language with which to conceal their designs and plunderings.\r\n\r\nThe secret jargon, or rude speech, of the vagabonds who hang upon the\r\nHottentots is termed Cuze-cat. In Finland, the fellows who steal\r\nseal-skins, pick the pockets of bear-skin overcoats, and talk cant, are\r\ntermed Lappes. In France, the secret language of highwaymen,\r\nhousebreakers, and pickpockets, is named Argot. The brigands and more\r\nromantic rascals of Spain term their private tongue Germania,[2] or\r\nRobbers\xe2\x80\x99 Language. Rothw\xc3\xa4lsch,[3] or foreign-beggar-talk, is synonymous\r\nwith cant and thieves\xe2\x80\x99 talk in Germany. The vulgar dialect of Malta, and\r\nthe Scala towns of the Levant\xe2\x80\x94imported into this country and\r\nincorporated with English cant\xe2\x80\x94is known as the Lingua Franca, or\r\nbastard Italian. And the crowds of lazy beggars that infest the streets\r\nof Naples and Rome, as well as the brigands of Pompeii, use a secret\r\nlanguage termed Gergo. In England, as we all know, it is called\r\nCant\xe2\x80\x94often improperly Slang.\r\n\r\nMost nations, then, possess each a tongue, or series of tongues maybe,\r\neach based on the national language, by which not only thieves, beggars,\r\nand other outcasts communicate, but which is used more or less by all\r\nclasses. There is hardly any community in this country, hardly any\r\nprofession, but has its slang, and proficiency in this is the greatest\r\ndesideratum of an aspirant to the pleasures of Society, or the honours\r\nof literature and art. The formation of these secret tongues varies, of\r\ncourse, with the circumstances surrounding the speakers. A writer in\r\n_Notes and Queries_ has well remarked that \xe2\x80\x9cthe investigation of the\r\norigin and principles of cant and slang language opens a curious field\r\nof inquiry, replete with considerable interest to the philologist and\r\nthe philosopher. It affords a remarkable instance of lingual\r\ncontrivance, which, without the introduction of much arbitrary matter,\r\nhas developed a system of communicating ideas, having all the advantages\r\nof a foreign language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe terms Cant and Canting were probably derived from chaunt and\r\nchaunting,\xe2\x80\x94the whining tone, or modulation of voice adopted by\r\nbeggars, with intent to coax, wheedle, or cajole by pretensions of\r\nwretchedness.\xe2\x80\x9d[4] For the origin of the other application of the word\r\nCant, pulpit hypocrisy, we are indebted to the _Spectator_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCant is by\r\nsome people derived from one Andrew Cant, who, they say, was a\r\nPresbyterian minister in some illiterate part of Scotland, who, by\r\nexercise and use, had obtained the faculty, alias gift, of talking in\r\nthe pulpit in such a dialect that \xe2\x80\x99tis said he was understood by none\r\nbut his own congregation,\xe2\x80\x94and not by all of them. Since Master Cant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime it has been understood in a larger sense, and signifies all\r\nexclamations, whinings, unusual tones, and, in fine, all praying and\r\npreaching like the unlearned of the Presbyterians.\xe2\x80\x9d This anecdote is\r\ncurious, though it is but fair to assume that the preacher\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\ntaken from his practice, rather than that the practice was called after\r\nthe preacher. As far as we are concerned, however, in the present\r\ninquiry, Cant was derived from chaunt, a beggar\xe2\x80\x99s whine; \xe2\x80\x9cchaunting\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbeing the recognised term amongst beggars to this day for begging\r\norations and street whinings; and \xe2\x80\x9cchaunter,\xe2\x80\x9d a street talker and tramp,\r\nis still the term used by strollers and patterers. This race is,\r\nhowever, nearly obsolete. The use of the word Cant, amongst beggars,\r\nmust certainly have commenced at a very early date, for we find \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\ncante, to speake,\xe2\x80\x9d in Harman\xe2\x80\x99s list of Rogues\xe2\x80\x99 Words in the year 1566;\r\nand Harrison about the same time,[5] in speaking of beggars and\r\nGipsies, says, \xe2\x80\x9cthey have devised a language among themselves which they\r\nname Canting, but others Pedlars\xe2\x80\x99 Frenche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, the word Cant in its old sense, and Slang[6] in its modern\r\napplication, although used by good writers and persons of education as\r\nsynonyms, are in reality quite distinct and separate terms. Cant, apart\r\nfrom religious hypocrisy, refers to the old secret language of Gipsies,\r\nthieves, tramps, and beggars. Slang represents that evanescent language,\r\never changing with fashion and taste, which has principally come into\r\nvogue during the last seventy or eighty years, spoken by persons in\r\nevery grade of life, rich and poor, honest and dishonest.[7] Cant is\r\nold; Slang is always modern and ever changing. To illustrate the\r\ndifference: a thief in Cant language would term a horse a \xe2\x80\x9cprancer\xe2\x80\x9d or a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cprad;\xe2\x80\x9d while in Slang, a man of fashion would speak of it as a \xe2\x80\x9cbit of\r\nblood,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cspanker,\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cneat tit.\xe2\x80\x9d A handkerchief, too, would be a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbilly,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cfogle,\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cKent rag,\xe2\x80\x9d in the secret language of low\r\ncharacters; whilst amongst the modern folk who affect Slang, it would be\r\ncalled a \xe2\x80\x9cstook,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cwipe,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cfogle,\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cclout.\xe2\x80\x9d Cant was formed for\r\npurposes of secrecy. Slang, though it has a tendency the same way, is\r\nstill often indulged in from a mild desire to appear familiar with life,\r\ngaiety, town-humour, and the transient nicknames and street jokes of the\r\nday. Both Cant and Slang, we have before said, are often huddled\r\ntogether as synonyms; but they are most certainly distinct, and as such\r\nshould be used.\r\n\r\nTo the Gipsies, beggars and thieves are in great measure indebted for\r\ntheir Cant language. It is supposed that the Gipsies originally landed\r\nin this country early in the reign of Henry VIII. They were at first\r\ntreated as conjurors and magicians,\xe2\x80\x94indeed, they were hailed by the\r\npopulace with as much applause as a company of English performers\r\nusually receives on arriving in a distant colony. They came here with\r\nall their old Eastern arts of palmistry and second-sight, with their\r\nfactitious power of doubling money by incantation and burial,\xe2\x80\x94shreds of\r\npagan idolatry; and they brought with them, also, the dishonesty of the\r\nlower-caste Orientals, and the nomadic tastes they had acquired through\r\ncenturies of wandering over nearly the whole of the then known globe.\r\nThey possessed also a language quite distinct from anything that had\r\nbeen heard in England up till their advent; they claimed the title of\r\nEgyptians, and as such, when their thievish propensities became a public\r\nnuisance, were cautioned and proscribed in a royal proclamation by Henry\r\nVIII.[8] The Gipsies were not long in the country before they found\r\nnative imitators; and indeed the imitation is much more frequently found\r\nnowadays, in the ranks of the so-called Gipsies, than is the genuine\r\narticle. Vagabondism is peculiarly catching, and the idle, the vagrant,\r\nand the criminal soon caught the idea from the Gipsies, and learned from\r\nthem to tramp, sleep under hedges and trees, tell fortunes, and find\r\nlost property for a consideration\xe2\x80\x94frequently, as the saying runs,\r\nhaving found it themselves before it was lost. They also learned the\r\nvalue and application of a secret tongue; indeed, with the Gipsies came\r\nin all the accompaniments of maunding and imposture, except thieving and\r\nbegging, which were well known in this country, and perhaps in every\r\nother, long before visitors had an opportunity of teaching them.\r\n\r\nHarman, in 1566, wrote a singular, not to say droll, book, entitled, _A\r\nCaveat for commen Cvrsetors, vulgarly called Vagabones, newly augmented\r\nand inlarged_, wherein the history and various descriptions of rogues\r\nand vagabonds are given, together with their canting tongue. This book,\r\nthe earliest of the kind, gives the singular fact that within a dozen\r\nyears after the landing of the Gipsies, companies of English vagrants\r\nwere formed, places of meeting appointed, districts for plunder and\r\nbegging operations marked out, and rules agreed to for their common\r\nmanagement. In some cases Gipsies joined the English gangs; in others,\r\nEnglish vagrants joined the Gipsies. The fellowship was found convenient\r\nand profitable, as both parties were aliens to the laws and customs of\r\nthe country, living in a great measure in the open air, apart from the\r\nlawful public, and often meeting each other on the same by-path, or in\r\nthe same retired valley; but seldom intermarrying or entirely adopting\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s habits. The common people, too, soon began to consider them\r\nas of one family,\xe2\x80\x94all rogues, and from Egypt. This superstition must\r\nhave been very firmly imbedded, for it is still current. The secret\r\nlanguage spoken by the Gipsies, principally Hindoo, and extremely\r\nbarbarous to English ears, was found incomprehensible and very difficult\r\nto learn. The Gipsies naturally found a similar difficulty with the\r\nEnglish language. A rude, rough, and singular, but under the\r\ncircumstances not unnatural, compromise was made, and a mixture of\r\nGipsy, old English, newly-coined words, and cribbings from any foreign,\r\nand therefore secret, language, mixed and jumbled together, formed what\r\nhas ever since been known as the Canting Language, or Pedlar\xe2\x80\x99s French;\r\nor, during the past century, St. Giles\xe2\x80\x99s Greek.\r\n\r\nSuch was the origin of Cant; and in illustration of its blending with\r\nthe Gipsy or Cingari tongue, we are enabled to give the accompanying\r\nlist of Gipsy, and often Hindoo, words, with, in many instances, their\r\nEnglish representatives:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n             _Gipsy._                            _English._\r\n\r\n  ~Bamboozle~, to perplex or mislead    ~Bamboozle~, to delude, cheat,\r\n    by hiding. _Modern Gipsy._            or make a fool of any one.\r\n\r\n  ~Bosh~, rubbish, nonsense, offal.     ~Bosh~, stupidity, foolishness.\r\n    _Gipsy and Persian._\r\n\r\n  ~Cheese~, thing or article, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s   ~Cheese~, or CHEESY, a\r\n    the CHEESE,\xe2\x80\x9d or thing. _Gipsy and     first-rate or very good\r\n    Hindoo._                              article.\r\n\r\n  ~Chive~, the tongue. _Gipsy._         ~Chive~, or CHIVEY, a shout.

Dad, in Welsh, also signifies a\r\nfather. Cur is stated to be a mere term of reproach, like Dog, which in\r\nall European languages has been applied in an abusive sense. Objections\r\nmay also be raised against Gad, Maund, and many other of these\r\nparallels. We have, however, no wish to present them as infallible; our\r\nidea is merely to call the reader\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the undoubted\r\nsimilarity between both the sound and the sense in most examples.]\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have the remarkable fact of at least a few words of pure\r\nGipsy origin going the round of Europe, passing into this country before\r\nthe Reformation, and coming down to us through numerous generations\r\npurely by the mouths of the people. They have seldom been written or\r\nused in books, and it is simply as vulgarisms that they have reached us.\r\nOnly a few are now Cant, and some are household words. The word jockey,\r\nas applied to a dealer or rider of horses, came from the Gipsy, and\r\nmeans in that language a whip. The word, used as a verb, is an instance\r\nof modern slang grown out of the ancient. Our standard dictionaries\r\ngive, of course, none but conjectural etymologies. Another word,\r\nbamboozle, has been a sore difficulty with lexicographers. It is not in\r\nthe old dictionaries, although it is extensively used in familiar or\r\npopular language for the last two centuries; and is, in fact, the very\r\nkind of word that such writers as Swift, Butler, L\xe2\x80\x99Estrange, and\r\nArbuthnot would pick out at once as a telling and most serviceable term.\r\nIt is, as we have seen, from the Gipsy; and here we must state that it\r\nwas Boucher who first drew attention to the fact, although in his\r\nremarks on the dusky tongue he has made an evident mistake by concluding\r\nit to be identical with its offspring, Cant. Other parallel instances,\r\nwith but slight variations from the old Gipsy meanings, might be\r\nmentioned; but sufficient examples have been adduced to show that\r\nMarsden, a great Oriental scholar in the last century, when he declared\r\nbefore the Society of Antiquaries that the Cant of English thieves and\r\nbeggars had nothing to do with the language spoken by the despised\r\nGipsies, was in error. Had the Gipsy tongue been analysed and committed\r\nto writing three centuries ago, there is every probability that many\r\nscores of words now in common use could be at once traced to its source,\r\nhaving been adopted as our language has developed towards its present\r\nshape through many varied paths. Instances continually occur nowadays of\r\nstreet vulgarisms ascending to the drawing-rooms of respectable society.\r\nWho, then, can doubt that the Gipsy-vagabond alliance of three centuries\r\nago has contributed its quota of common words to popular speech?\r\n\r\nThomas Moore, in a humorous little book, _Tom Crib\xe2\x80\x99s Memorial to\r\nCongress_, 1819, says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Gipsy language, with the exception of such\r\nterms as relate to their own peculiar customs, differs but little from\r\nthe regular Flash or Cant language.\xe2\x80\x9d But this was magnifying the\r\nimportance of the alliance. Moore, we should think, knew nothing of the\r\nGipsy tongue other than the few Cant words put into the mouths of the\r\nbeggars in Beaumont and Fletcher\xe2\x80\x99s _Comedy of the Beggar\xe2\x80\x99s Bush_, and\r\nBen Jonson\xe2\x80\x99s _Masque of the Gipsies Metamorphosed_,\xe2\x80\x94hence his\r\nconfounding Cant with Gipsy speech, and appealing to the Glossary of\r\nCant for so-called \xe2\x80\x9cGipsy\xe2\x80\x9d words at the end of the _Life of Bamfylde\r\nMoore Carew_, to bear him out in his assertion. Still his remark bears\r\nmuch truth, and proof of this would have been found long ago if any\r\nscholar had taken the trouble to examine the \xe2\x80\x9cbarbarous jargon of Cant,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand to have compared it with Gipsy speech. George Borrow, in his\r\n_Account of the Gipsies in Spain_, thus eloquently concludes his second\r\nvolume; speaking of the connexion of the Gipsies with Europeans, he\r\nsays:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYet from this temporary association were produced two results;\r\nEuropean fraud became sharpened by coming into contact with Asiatic\r\ncraft; whilst European tongues, by imperceptible degrees, became\r\nrecruited with various words (some of them wonderfully expressive), many\r\nof which have long been stumbling-blocks to the philologist, who, whilst\r\nstigmatizing them as words of mere vulgar invention, or of unknown\r\norigin, has been far from dreaming that a little more research or\r\nreflection would have proved their affinity to the Sclavonic, Persian,\r\nor Romaic, or perhaps to the mysterious object of his veneration, the\r\nSanscrit, the sacred tongue of the palm-covered regions of Ind; words\r\noriginally introduced into Europe by objects too miserable to occupy for\r\na moment his lettered attention\xe2\x80\x94the despised denizens of the tents of\r\nRoma.\xe2\x80\x9d These words might with very little alteration be ascribed to the\r\nsubject of which this volume is supposed\xe2\x80\x94indeed hoped\xe2\x80\x94to be a\r\nhandbook.\r\n\r\nBut the Gipsies, their speech, their character\xe2\x80\x94bad enough, as all the\r\nworld testifies, but yet not devoid of redeeming qualities\xe2\x80\x94their\r\nhistory, and their religious belief, have been totally disregarded, and\r\ntheir poor persons buffeted and jostled about until it is a wonder that\r\nany trace of origin or national speech remains. On the Continent they\r\nreceived better attention at the hands of learned men. Their language\r\nwas taken down in writing and examined, their history was traced, and\r\ntheir extraordinary customs and practice of living in the open air, and\r\neating raw, and often putrid meat, were explained. They ate reptiles and\r\ntold fortunes because they had learnt to do so through their forefathers\r\ncenturies back in Hindostan; and they devoured carrion because the\r\nHindoo proverb\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThat which God kills is better than that killed by\r\nman\xe2\x80\x9d[10]\xe2\x80\x94was still in their remembrance. This is the sort of proverb,\r\nwe should imagine, that would hardly commend itself to any one who had\r\nnot an unnatural and ghoule-like tendency anxious for full development.\r\nGrellman, a learned German, was their principal historian, and to him,\r\nand those who have followed him, we are almost entirely indebted for the\r\nlittle we know of their language. The first European settlement of the\r\nGipsies was in the provinces adjoining the Danube, Moldau and\r\nTheiss, where M. Cogalniceano, in his _Essai sur les Cigains de la\r\nMoldo-Valachie_, estimates them at 200,000. Not a few of our ancient and\r\nmodern Cant and Slang terms are Wallachian and Greek words, picked up by\r\nthese wanderers from the East, and added to their common stock.\r\n\r\nGipsy, then, started, and was partially merged into Cant; and the old\r\nstory told by Harrison and others, that the first inventor of canting\r\nwas hanged for his pains, would seem to be a humorous invention, for\r\njargon as it is, it was doubtless of gradual formation, like all other\r\nlanguages or systems of speech. Most of the modern Gipsies know the old\r\nCant words as well as their own tongue\xe2\x80\x94or rather what remains of it. As\r\nBorrow says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe dialect of the English Gipsies is mixed with English\r\nwords.\xe2\x80\x9d[11] Those of the tribe who frequent fairs, and mix with English\r\ntramps, readily learn the new words, as they are adopted by what Harman\r\ncalls \xe2\x80\x9cthe fraternity of vagabonds.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, the old Cant is a common\r\nlanguage to the vagrants of many descriptions and every possible origin\r\nwho are scattered over the British Isles.\r\n\r\nEnglish Cant has its mutabilities like every other system of speech, and\r\nis considerably altered since the first dictionary was compiled by\r\nHarman in 1566. A great many words are unknown in the present tramps\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand thieves\xe2\x80\x99 vernacular. Some of them, however, still bear their old\r\ndefinitions, while others have adopted fresh meanings. \xe2\x80\x9cAbraham-man\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nyet seen in our modern \xe2\x80\x9csham Abraham,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cplay the old\r\nsoldier\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_i.e._, to feign sickness or distress. \xe2\x80\x9cAutum\xe2\x80\x9d is still a\r\nchurch or chapel amongst Gipsies; and \xe2\x80\x9cbeck,\xe2\x80\x9d a constable, is our modern\r\nCant and Slang \xe2\x80\x9cbeak,\xe2\x80\x9d once a policeman, but now a magistrate. \xe2\x80\x9cBene,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9cbone,\xe2\x80\x9d stands for good in Seven Dials and the back streets of\r\nWestminster; and \xe2\x80\x9cbowse\xe2\x80\x9d is our modern \xe2\x80\x9cbooze,\xe2\x80\x9d to drink or fuddle. A\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbowsing ken\xe2\x80\x9d was the old Cant term for a public-house; and \xe2\x80\x9cboozing\r\nken,\xe2\x80\x9d in modern Cant, has precisely the same meaning. There is little\r\ndoubt, though, that the pronunciations were always as they are now, so\r\nfar at least as these two instances are concerned. \xe2\x80\x9cCassan\xe2\x80\x9d is both old\r\nand modern Cant for cheese; the same may be said of \xe2\x80\x9cchattes,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cchatts,\xe2\x80\x9d the gallows. \xe2\x80\x9cCofe,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccove,\xe2\x80\x9d is still a vulgar synonym for\r\na man. \xe2\x80\x9cDudes\xe2\x80\x9d was Cant for clothes; we now say \xe2\x80\x9cduds.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFlag\xe2\x80\x9d is still\r\na fourpenny-piece; and \xe2\x80\x9cfylche\xe2\x80\x9d means to rob. \xe2\x80\x9cKen\xe2\x80\x9d is a house, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9click\xe2\x80\x9d means to thrash; \xe2\x80\x9cprancer\xe2\x80\x9d is yet known amongst rogues as a\r\nhorse; and to \xe2\x80\x9cprig,\xe2\x80\x9d amongst high and low, is to steal. Three centuries\r\nago, if one beggar said anything disagreeable to another, the person\r\nannoyed would say, \xe2\x80\x9cStow you,\xe2\x80\x9d or hold your peace; low people now say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStow it,\xe2\x80\x9d equivalent to \xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d There is, so far as the Slang goes,\r\nno actual difference in the use of these phrases, the variation being in\r\nthe pronouns\xe2\x80\x94in fact, in the direction. \xe2\x80\x9cTrine\xe2\x80\x9d is still to hang; \xe2\x80\x9cwyn\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nyet stands for a penny. And many other words, as will be seen in the\r\nDictionary, still retain their ancient meaning.\r\n\r\nAs specimens of those words which have altered their original Cant\r\nsignification, may be instanced \xe2\x80\x9cchete,\xe2\x80\x9d now written cheat. \xe2\x80\x9cChete\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nin ancient Cant what _chop_ is in the Canton-Chinese\xe2\x80\x94an almost\r\ninseparable adjunct. Everything was termed a \xe2\x80\x9cchete,\xe2\x80\x9d and qualified by a\r\nsubstantive-adjective, which showed what kind of a \xe2\x80\x9cchete\xe2\x80\x9d was meant;\r\nfor instance, \xe2\x80\x9ccrashing-chetes\xe2\x80\x9d were teeth; a \xe2\x80\x9cmoffling-chete,\xe2\x80\x9d was a\r\nnapkin; a \xe2\x80\x9ctopping-chete,\xe2\x80\x9d was the gallows, and a \xe2\x80\x9cgrunting-chete,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\na pig. Cheat nowadays means to cozen or defraud, and lexicographers have\r\ntortured etymology for an original\xe2\x80\x94but without success. _Escheats_ and\r\n_escheatours_ have been named, but with great doubts; indeed, Stevens,\r\nthe learned commentator on Shakspeare, acknowledged that he \xe2\x80\x9cdid not\r\nrecollect to have met with the word cheat in our ancient writers.\xe2\x80\x9d[12]\r\nCheat, to defraud, then, is no other than an old Cant term somewhat\r\naltered in its meaning,[13] and as such it should be described in the\r\nnext etymological dictionary. Another instance of a change in the\r\nmeaning of the old Cant, but the retention of the word, is seen in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccly,\xe2\x80\x9d formerly to take or steal, now a pocket; and with the remembrance\r\nof a certain class of low characters, a curious connexion between the\r\ntwo meanings is discovered. \xe2\x80\x9cMake\xe2\x80\x9d was a halfpenny: we now say\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmag,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d being modern Cant for getting money by any possible\r\nmeans, their apophthegm being\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGet money the best way you can, but\r\n_make_ it somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMilling\xe2\x80\x9d stood for stealing; it ultimately became a\r\npugilistic term, and then faded into nothingness, \xe2\x80\x9cthe cove wot loves a\r\nmill,\xe2\x80\x9d being a thing of the past. \xe2\x80\x9cNab\xe2\x80\x9d was a head,\xe2\x80\x94low people now say\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnob,\xe2\x80\x9d the former meaning, in modern Cant, to steal or seize. \xe2\x80\x9cPek\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nmeat,\xe2\x80\x94we still say \xe2\x80\x9cpeckish,\xe2\x80\x9d when hungry. \xe2\x80\x9cPeckish\xe2\x80\x9d is though more\r\nlikely to be derived from the action of birds when eating, as all slang\r\nhas its origin in metaphor. \xe2\x80\x9cPrygges, dronken Tinkers or beastly\r\npeople,\xe2\x80\x9d as old Harman wrote, would scarcely be understood now; a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cprig,\xe2\x80\x9d in the 19th century, is a pickpocket or thief. He is also a\r\nmean, contemptible little \xe2\x80\x9ccuss,\xe2\x80\x9d who is not, as a rule, found in low\r\nlife, but who could be very well spared from that of the middle and\r\nupper classes. \xe2\x80\x9cQuier,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cqueer,\xe2\x80\x9d like cheat, was a very common\r\nprefix, and meant bad or wicked,\xe2\x80\x94it now means odd, curious, or strange;\r\nbut to the ancient Cant we are possibly indebted for the word, which\r\netymologists should remember.[14] \xe2\x80\x9cRome,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crum,\xe2\x80\x9d formerly meant good,\r\nor of the first quality, and was extensively used like cheat and\r\nqueer,\xe2\x80\x94indeed as an adjective it was the opposite of the latter. \xe2\x80\x9cRum\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nnow means curious, and is synonymous with queer; thus,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9crummy old\r\nbloke,\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cqueer old man.\xe2\x80\x9d Here again we see the origin of an\r\nevery-day word, scouted by lexicographers and snubbed by respectable\r\npersons, but still a word of frequent and popular use. \xe2\x80\x9cYannam\xe2\x80\x9d meant\r\nbread; \xe2\x80\x9cpannum\xe2\x80\x9d is the word now. Other instances could be pointed out,\r\nbut they will be observed in the Dictionary.\r\n\r\nSeveral words are entirely obsolete. \xe2\x80\x9cAlybbeg\xe2\x80\x9d no longer means a bed,\r\nnor \xe2\x80\x9caskew\xe2\x80\x9d a cup. \xe2\x80\x9cBooget,\xe2\x80\x9d[15] nowadays, would not be understood for a\r\nbasket; neither would \xe2\x80\x9cgan\xe2\x80\x9d pass current for mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cFullams\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nold Cant term for false or loaded dice, and although used by Shakspeare\r\nin this sense, is now unknown and obsolete. Indeed, as Moore somewhere\r\nremarks, the present Greeks of St. Giles\xe2\x80\x99s themselves would be\r\nthoroughly puzzled by many of the ancient canting songs,\xe2\x80\x94taking, for\r\nexample, the first verse of an old favourite\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBing out, bien Morts, and toure and toure,\r\n      Bing out, bien Morts, and toure;\r\n    For all your duds are bing\xe2\x80\x99d awast;\r\n      The bien cove hath the loure.\xe2\x80\x9d[16]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps we cannot do better than present to the reader at once an\r\nentire copy of the first Canting Dictionary ever compiled. As before\r\nmentioned, it was the work of one Thomas Harman, who lived in the days\r\nof Queen Elizabeth. Some writers have remarked that Decker[17] was the\r\nfirst to compile a dictionary of the vagabonds\xe2\x80\x99 tongue; whilst\r\nBorrow[18] and Moore stated that Richard Head performed that service in\r\nhis _Life of an English Rogue_, published in the year 1680. All these\r\nstatements are equally incorrect, for the first attempt was made more\r\nthan a century before the latter work was issued. The quaint spelling\r\nand old-fashioned phraseology are preserved, and the initiated will\r\nquickly recognise many vulgar street words as old acquaintances dressed\r\nin antique garb.[19]\r\n\r\n    ~Abraham-men~ be those that fayn themselves to have beene mad, and\r\n    have bene kept either in Bethelem, or in some other pryson a good\r\n    time.\r\n\r\n    ~Alybbeg~, a bedde.\r\n\r\n    ~Askew~, a cuppe.\r\n\r\n    ~Autem~, a churche.\r\n\r\n    ~Autem mortes~, married women as chaste as a cowe.\r\n\r\n    ~Baudye baskets~ bee women who goe with baskets and capcases on\r\n    their armes, wherein they have laces, pinnes, nedles, whyte inkel,\r\n    and round sylke gyrdels of all colours.\r\n\r\n    ~Beck~ [Beak, a magistrate], a constable.\r\n\r\n    ~Belly-chete~, apron.\r\n\r\n    ~Bene~, good. _Benar_, better.\r\n\r\n    ~Benship~, very good.\r\n\r\n    ~Bleting chete~, a calfe or sheepe.\r\n\r\n    ~Booget~, a travelling tinker\xe2\x80\x99s baskete.\r\n\r\n    ~Borde~, a shilling.\r\n\r\n    ~Boung~, a purse.

Hard or infrequent words,\r\nvulgarly termed \xe2\x80\x9ccrack-jaw,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cjaw-breakers,\xe2\x80\x9d were very often used and\r\nconsidered as Cant terms. And here it should be mentioned that at the\r\npresent day the most inconsistent and far-fetched terms are often used\r\nfor secret purposes, when they are known to be caviare to the million.\r\nIt is strange that such words as incongruous, insipid, interloper,\r\nintriguing, indecorum, forestall, equip, hush, grapple, &c., &c., were\r\ncurrent Cant words a century and a half ago, if we are to judge by the\r\nDictionary of Canting Words at the end of _Bacchus and Venus_,[20] 1737.\r\nIt is but fair, however, to assume that the compiler of the dictionary\r\nwas but trading on the demand for Cant phrases, and was humbugging his\r\nreaders. The terms are inserted not as jokes or squibs, but as\r\nselections from the veritable pocket dictionaries of the Jack Sheppards\r\nand Dick Turpins of the day. If they were safely used as unknown and\r\ncabalistic terms amongst the commonalty, the fact would form a very\r\ncurious illustration of the ignorance of our poor ancestors; but it\r\nwould be unfair and, indeed, idiotic to assume this without much\r\nstronger proof than the book in question gives of itself.\r\n\r\nAmongst those Cant words which have either altered their meanings, or\r\nhave become extinct, may be cited lady, formerly the Cant for \xe2\x80\x9ca very\r\ncrooked, deformed, and ill-shapen woman;\xe2\x80\x9d[21] and Harman, \xe2\x80\x9ca pair of\r\nstocks, or a constable.\xe2\x80\x9d The former is a pleasant piece of sarcasm,\r\nwhilst the latter indicates a singular method of revenge, or else of\r\nsatire. Harman was the first author who specially wrote against English\r\nvagabonds, and for his trouble his name, we are told, became synonymous\r\nwith a pair of stocks, or a policeman of the olden time.\r\n\r\nApart from the Gipsy element, we find that Cant abounds in terms from\r\nforeign languages, and that it exhibits signs of a growth similar to\r\nthat of most recognised and completely-formed tongues,\xe2\x80\x94the gathering of\r\nwords from foreign sources. In the reign of Elizabeth and of King James\r\nI., several Dutch, Flemish, and Spanish words were introduced by\r\nsoldiers who had served in the Low Countries and sailors who had\r\nreturned from the Spanish Main, who, like \xe2\x80\x9cmine ancient Pistol,\xe2\x80\x9d were\r\nfond of garnishing their speech with outlandish phrases. Many of these\r\nwere soon picked up and adopted by vagabonds and tramps in their Cant\r\nlanguage. The Anglo-Norman and the Anglo-Saxon, the Scotch, the French,\r\nthe Italian, and even the classic languages of ancient Italy and Greece,\r\nbesides the various provincial dialects of England, have contributed to\r\nits list of words. Indeed, as has been remarked, English Cant seems to\r\nbe formed on the same basis as the Argot of the French and the\r\nRoth-Sprach of the Germans\xe2\x80\x94partly metaphorical, and partly by the\r\nintroduction of such corrupted foreign terms as are likely to be unknown\r\nto the society amid which the Cant speakers exist. Argot is the London\r\nthieves\xe2\x80\x99 word for their secret language; it is, of course, from the\r\nFrench, but that matters not, so long as it is incomprehensible to the\r\npolice and the mob. \xe2\x80\x9cBooze,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbouse,\xe2\x80\x9d is supposed to come from the\r\nDutch _buysen_, though the word has been in use in England for some\r\nhundreds of years. \xe2\x80\x9cDomine,\xe2\x80\x9d a parson, is from the Spanish. \xe2\x80\x9cDonna and\r\nfeeles,\xe2\x80\x9d a woman and children, is from the Latin; and \xe2\x80\x9cdon,\xe2\x80\x9d a clever\r\nfellow, has been filched from the Lingua Franca, or bastard Italian,\r\nalthough it sounds like an odd mixture of Spanish and French; whilst\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cduds,\xe2\x80\x9d the vulgar term for clothes, may have been pilfered either from\r\nthe Gaelic or the Dutch. \xe2\x80\x9cFeele,\xe2\x80\x9d a daughter, from the French; and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfrow,\xe2\x80\x9d a girl or wife, from the German\xe2\x80\x94are common tramps\xe2\x80\x99 terms. So\r\nare \xe2\x80\x9cgent,\xe2\x80\x9d silver, from the French _argent_; and \xe2\x80\x9cvial,\xe2\x80\x9d a country\r\ntown, also from the French. \xe2\x80\x9cHorrid-horn,\xe2\x80\x9d a fool, is believed to be\r\nfrom the Erse; and \xe2\x80\x9cgloak,\xe2\x80\x9d a man, from the Scotch. As stated before,\r\nthe dictionary will supply numerous other instances.\r\n\r\nThe Celtic languages have contributed many Cant and vulgar words to our\r\npopular vocabulary. These have come to us through the Gaelic and Irish\r\nlanguages, so closely allied in their material as to be merely dialects\r\nof a primitive common tongue. This element may arise from the Celtic\r\nportion of our population, which, from its position as slaves or\r\nservants to its ancient conquerors, has contributed so largely to the\r\nlowest class of the community, therefore to our Slang, provincial, or\r\ncolloquial words; or it may be an importation from Irish immigrants, who\r\nhave contributed their fair proportion to our criminal stock.\r\n\r\nThere is one source, however, of secret street terms which in the first\r\nedition of this work was entirely overlooked,\xe2\x80\x94indeed, it was unknown to\r\nthe original compiler until pointed out by a correspondent,\xe2\x80\x94the Lingua\r\nFranca, or bastard Italian, spoken at Genoa, Trieste, Malta,\r\nConstantinople, Smyrna, Alexandria, and all Mediterranean seaport towns.\r\nThe ingredients of this imported Cant are, as its name denotes, many.\r\nIts foundation is Italian, with a mixture of modern Greek, German (from\r\nthe Austrian ports), Spanish, Turkish, and French. It has been\r\nintroduced to the notice of the London wandering tribes by the sailors,\r\nforeign and English, who trade to and from the Mediterranean seaports,\r\nbut it must not be confounded with the mixture of Irish, English, and\r\nItalian spoken in neighbourhoods like Saffron Hill and Leather Lane,\r\nwhich are thronged with swarms of organ-grinders from all parts of\r\nItaly, and makers of images from Rome and Florence,\xe2\x80\x94all of whom, in\r\nthese dense thoroughfares, mingle with our lower orders. It would occupy\r\ntoo much space here to give a list of the words used in either of these\r\nBabel-like tongues, especially as the principal of them are noted in the\r\ndictionary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are several Hebrew terms in our Cant language, obtained, it\r\nwould appear, from the intercourse of the thieves with the Jew fences\r\n(receivers of stolen goods); many of the Cant terms, again, are\r\nSanscrit, got from the Gipsies; many Latin, got by the beggars from the\r\nCatholic prayers before the Reformation; and many again, Italian, got\r\nfrom the wandering musicians and others; indeed, the showmen have but\r\nlately introduced a number of Italian phrases into their Cant\r\nlanguage.\xe2\x80\x9d[22] The Hindostanee also contributes several words, and these\r\nhave been introduced by the Lascar sailors, who come over here in the\r\nEast Indiamen, and often lodge during their stay in the low tramps\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhouses at the East-end of London. Speaking of the learned tongues, it\r\nmay be mentioned that, precarious and abandoned as the vagabonds\xe2\x80\x99\r\nexistence is, many persons of classical or refined education have from\r\ntime to time joined the nomadic ranks,\xe2\x80\x94occasionally from inclination,\r\nas in the popular instance of Bamfylde Moore Carew, but generally\r\nthrough indiscretions, which involve pecuniary difficulty and loss of\r\ncharacter.[23] This will in some measure account for numerous classical\r\nand learned words figuring as Cant terms in the vulgar dictionary.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the last century, when highwaymen and footpads were\r\nplentiful, and when the dangerous classes were in larger proportion to\r\nthe bulk of the population than they are now, a great many new words\r\nwere added to the canting vocabulary, whilst several old terms fell into\r\ndisuse. \xe2\x80\x9cCant,\xe2\x80\x9d for instance, as applied to thieves\xe2\x80\x99 talk, was\r\nsupplanted by the word \xe2\x80\x9cflash.\xe2\x80\x9d In the North of England the Cant\r\nemployed by tramps and thieves is known as \xe2\x80\x9cGammy.\xe2\x80\x9d It is mainly from\r\nthe old Gipsy corrupted. In the large towns of Ireland and Scotland this\r\nsecret language is also spoken, with of course additions peculiar to\r\neach locality. All those words derived from \xe2\x80\x9cgammy\xe2\x80\x9d are inserted in the\r\ndictionary as from the North country.\r\n\r\nA singular feature, however, in vulgar language is the retention and the\r\nrevival of sterling old English words, long since laid up in ancient\r\nmanuscripts.

And a young lady living in the precincts of dingy but\r\naristocratic Mayfair, although enraptured with a Jenny Lind or a\r\nRistori, would hardly think of turning back in the box to inform papa\r\nthat she (Ristori or Lind) \xe2\x80\x9cmade no \xe2\x80\x98bones\xe2\x80\x99 of it\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94yet the phrase was\r\nmost respectable and well-to-do before it met with a change of\r\ncircumstances. Possibly fashion, in its journey from east to west, left\r\ncertain phrases and metaphors behind, which being annexed by the\r\nnewcomers, sank gradually in the social scale until they ultimately\r\npassed out of the written language altogether, and became \xe2\x80\x9cflash\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\nSlang. \xe2\x80\x9cA \xe2\x80\x98crack\xe2\x80\x99 article,\xe2\x80\x9d however first-rate, would have greatly\r\ndispleased Dr. Johnson and Mr. Walker\xe2\x80\x94yet both crack, in the sense of\r\nexcellent, and crack up, to boast or praise, were not considered\r\nvulgarisms in the time of Henry VIII. The former term is used frequently\r\nnowadays, as a kind of polite and modified Slang\xe2\x80\x94as a \xe2\x80\x9ccrack\xe2\x80\x9d regiment,\r\na \xe2\x80\x9ccrack\xe2\x80\x9d shot, &c. \xe2\x80\x9cDodge,\xe2\x80\x9d a cunning trick, is from the Anglo-Saxon;\r\nand ancient nobles used to \xe2\x80\x9cget each other\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98dander\xe2\x80\x99 up\xe2\x80\x9d before\r\nappealing to their swords,\xe2\x80\x94quite \xe2\x80\x9cflabbergasting\xe2\x80\x9d (also a respectable\r\nold word) the half-score of lookers-on with the thumps and cuts of their\r\nheavy weapons. \xe2\x80\x9cGallivanting,\xe2\x80\x9d waiting upon the ladies, was as polite in\r\nexpression as in action; whilst a clergyman at Paule\xe2\x80\x99s Crosse thought\r\nnothing of bidding a noisy hearer \xe2\x80\x9chold his \xe2\x80\x98gab,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cshut up his\r\n\xe2\x80\x98gob.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d But then the essence of preaching was to indulge in idiomatic\r\nphrases and colloquialisms\xe2\x80\x94a practice now almost peculiar to itinerant\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cranters.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGadding,\xe2\x80\x9d roaming about in an idle and vacant manner, was\r\nused in an old translation of the Bible; and \xe2\x80\x9cto do anything \xe2\x80\x98gingerly\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas to do it with great care. Persons of modern affected tastes will be\r\nshocked to know that the great Lord Bacon spoke of the lower part of a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s face as his \xe2\x80\x9cgills,\xe2\x80\x9d though the expression is not more\r\nobjectionable than the generality of metaphor, and is considerably more\r\nrespectable than many words admitted to the genteel\xe2\x80\x94we use the word\r\nadvisedly\xe2\x80\x94vocabulary.\r\n\r\nShakspeare also used many words which are now counted dreadfully vulgar.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Clean\xe2\x80\x99 gone,\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense of out of sight, or entirely away; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ntook me all \xe2\x80\x98a-mort,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d or confounded me; \xe2\x80\x9cit wont \xe2\x80\x98fadge,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d or suit, are\r\nphrases taken at random from the great dramatist\xe2\x80\x99s works. These phrases\r\nare the natural outcome of the poet\xe2\x80\x99s truth to life in the characters he\r\nportrayed. A London costermonger, or inhabitant of the streets, instead\r\nof saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make him yield,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgive in,\xe2\x80\x9d in a fight or contest,\r\nwould say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make him \xe2\x80\x98buckle\xe2\x80\x99 under.\xe2\x80\x9d Shakspeare in his _Henry the\r\nFourth_ (part ii. act i. scene 1), has the word; and Mr. Halliwell, one\r\nof the greatest and most industrious of living antiquaries, informs us\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cthe commentators do not supply another example.\xe2\x80\x9d If Shakspeare was\r\nnot a pugilist, he certainly anticipated the terms of the prize-ring\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nthey were respectable words before the prize-ring was thought of\xe2\x80\x94for he\r\nhas \xe2\x80\x9cpay,\xe2\x80\x9d to beat or thrash, and \xe2\x80\x9cpepper,\xe2\x80\x9d with a similar meaning; also\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfancy,\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense of pets and favourites,\xe2\x80\x94pugilists are often\r\ntermed \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98fancy.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The origin of the term, as applied to them, has,\r\nhowever, never been satisfactorily decided, though Pierce Egan and\r\nothers since his time have speculated ingeniously on the subject. The\r\nCant word \xe2\x80\x9cprig,\xe2\x80\x9d from the Saxon _priccan_, to filch, is also\r\nShakspearian; so, indeed, is \xe2\x80\x9cpiece,\xe2\x80\x9d a contemptuous term for a young\r\nwoman. Shakspeare was not the only vulgar dramatist of his time. Ben\r\nJonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Brome, and other play-writers,\r\noccasionally, and very naturally, put Cant words into the mouths of\r\ntheir low characters, or employed old words which have since degenerated\r\ninto vulgarisms. \xe2\x80\x9cCrusty,\xe2\x80\x9d poor tempered; \xe2\x80\x9ctwo of a kidney,\xe2\x80\x9d two of a\r\nsort; \xe2\x80\x9clark,\xe2\x80\x9d a piece of fun; \xe2\x80\x9clug,\xe2\x80\x9d to pull; \xe2\x80\x9cbung,\xe2\x80\x9d to give or pass;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpickle,\xe2\x80\x9d a sad plight; \xe2\x80\x9cfrump,\xe2\x80\x9d to mock, are a few specimens casually\r\npicked from the works of the old histrionic writers.\r\n\r\nOne old English mode of canting, simple enough, but affected only by the\r\nmost miserable impostors, was the inserting a consonant betwixt each\r\nsyllable; thus, taking _g_, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d would be \xe2\x80\x9cHow_g_ do_g_\r\nyou_g_ do_g_?\xe2\x80\x9d The name very properly given to this disagreeable\r\nnonsense, we are informed by Grose, was gibberish.\r\n\r\nAnother slang has been manufactured by transposing the initial letters\r\nof words, so that a mutton chop becomes a _ch_utton _m_op, and a pint of\r\nstout a _st_int of _p_out; but it is satisfactory to know that it has\r\ngained no ground, as it is remarkable for nothing so much as poverty of\r\nresource on the part of its inventors. This is called \xe2\x80\x9cMarrowskying,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMedical Greek,\xe2\x80\x9d from its use by medical students at the hospitals.\r\nAlbert Smith termed it the \xe2\x80\x9cGower Street Dialect,\xe2\x80\x9d and referred to it\r\noccasionally in his best-known works.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cLanguage of Ziph,\xe2\x80\x9d it may be noted, is another rude mode of\r\ndisguising English, in use among the students at Winchester College.\r\nSome notices of this method of conveying secret information, with an\r\nextensive Glossary of the Words, Phrases, Customs, &c., peculiar to the\r\nCollege, may be found in Mr. Mansfield\xe2\x80\x99s _School Life at Winchester\r\nCollege_. It is certainly too puerile a specimen of work to find place\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] \xe2\x80\x9cSwarms of vagabonds, whose eyes were so sharp as Lynx.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Bullein\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSimples and Surgery_, 1562.\r\n\r\n[2] Probably from the Gipsies, who were supposed to come from Germany\r\ninto Spain.\r\n\r\n[3] From _Roter_, beggar, vagabond, and _w\xc3\xa4lsch_, foreign.

Slang and Gibberish in the Gipsy\r\nlanguage are synonymous; but, as English adoptions, have meanings very\r\ndifferent from that given to them in their original.\r\n\r\n[7] \xe2\x80\x9cThe vulgar tongue consists of two parts; the first is the Cant\r\nlanguage; the second, those burlesque phrases, quaint allusions,\r\nand nicknames for persons, things, and places, which, from long\r\nuninterrupted usage, are made classical by prescription.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Grose\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_, 1st edition, 1785.\r\n\r\n[8] \xe2\x80\x9cOutlandish people calling themselves Egyptians.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x941530.\r\n\r\n[9] Jabber may be, after all, only another form of GABBER, GAB, very\r\ncommon in Old English, from the _Anglo-Saxon_, G\xc3\x86BBAN.\r\n\r\n[10] This very proverb was mentioned by a young Gipsy to Crabb, some\r\nyears ago.\xe2\x80\x94_Gipsies\xe2\x80\x99 Advocate_, p. 14.\r\n\r\n[11] _Gipsies in Spain_, vol. i. p. 18.\r\n\r\n[12] Shaks. _Henry IV._, part ii. act ii. scene 4.\r\n\r\n[13] It is but fair to imagine that cheat ultimately became synonymous\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x9cfraud,\xe2\x80\x9d when we remember that it was one of the most common words\r\nof the greatest class of impostors in the country.\r\n\r\n[14] We are aware that more than one eminent philologist states that the\r\norigin of \xe2\x80\x9cqueer\xe2\x80\x9d is seen in the German _quer_, crooked,\xe2\x80\x94hence strange\r\nand abnormal. While agreeing with this etymology, we have reason to\r\nbelieve that the word was first used in this country in a Cant sense.\r\n\r\n[15] Booget properly signifies a leathern wallet, and is probably\r\nderived from the _low Latin_, BULGA.

Head professed to\r\nhave lived with the Gipsies, but in reality filched his words from\r\nDecker and Brome.\r\n\r\n[19] The modern meanings of a few of the old Cant words are given within\r\nbrackets.\r\n\r\n[20] This is a curious volume, and is worth from one to two guineas. The\r\nCanting Dictionary was afterwards reprinted, word for word, with the\r\ntitle of _The Scoundrel\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary_, in 1751. It was originally\r\npublished, without date, about the year 1710, by B. E., under the title\r\nof _A Dictionary of the Canting Crew_.\r\n\r\n[21] _Bacchus and Venus._\xe2\x80\x941737.\r\n\r\n[22] _London Labour and the London Poor._\r\n\r\n[23] Mayhew (vol. i. p. 217) speaks of a low lodging-house \xe2\x80\x9cin which\r\nthere were at one time five university men, three surgeons, and several\r\nsorts of broken-down clerks.\xe2\x80\x9d But old Harman\xe2\x80\x99s saying, that \xe2\x80\x9ca wylde\r\nRoge is he that is _borne_ a roge,\xe2\x80\x9d will perhaps explain this seeming\r\nanomaly. There is, whatever may be the reason, no disputing the truth of\r\nthis latter statement, as there is not, we venture to say, a common\r\nlodging-house in London without broken-down gentlemen, who have been\r\ngentlemen very often far beyond the conventional application of the term\r\nto any one with a good coat on his back and money in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCOUNT\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nHIEROGLYPHICS USED BY VAGABONDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most singular chapters in a history of vagabondism would\r\ncertainly be \xe2\x80\x9cAn Account of the Hieroglyphic Signs used by Tramps and\r\nThieves,\xe2\x80\x9d and it certainly would not be the least interesting. The\r\nreader may be startled to know that, in addition to a secret language,\r\nthe wandering tribes of this country have private marks and symbols with\r\nwhich to score their successes, failures, and advice to succeeding\r\nbeggars; in fact, there is no doubt that the country is really dotted\r\nover with beggars\xe2\x80\x99 finger-posts and guide-stones. The subject was not\r\nlong since brought under the attention of the Government by Mr.\r\nRawlinson.[24] \xe2\x80\x9cThere is,\xe2\x80\x9d he says in his report, \xe2\x80\x9ca sort of\r\nblackguards\xe2\x80\x99 literature, and the initiated understand each other by\r\nSlang [Cant] terms, by pantomimic signs, and by hieroglyphics. The\r\nvagrant\xe2\x80\x99s mark may be seen in Havant, on corners of streets, on\r\ndoor-posts, on house-steps. Simple as these chalk-lines appear, they\r\ninform the succeeding vagrants of all they require to know; and a few\r\nwhite scratches may say, \xe2\x80\x98Be importunate,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Pass on.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother very curious account was taken from a provincial newspaper,\r\npublished in 1849, and forwarded to _Notes and Queries_,[25] under the\r\nhead of Mendicant Freemasonry. \xe2\x80\x9cPersons,\xe2\x80\x9d remarks the writer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cindiscreet enough to open their purses to the relief of the beggar\r\ntribe, would do well to take a readily-learned lesson as to the folly of\r\nthat misguided benevolence which encourages and perpetuates vagabondism.\r\nEvery door or passage is pregnant with instruction as to the error\r\ncommitted by the patron of beggars; as the beggar-marks show that a\r\nsystem of freemasonry is followed, by which a beggar knows whether it\r\nwill be worth his while to call into a passage or knock at a door. Let\r\nany one examine the entrances to the passages in any town, and there he\r\nwill find chalk marks, unintelligible to him, but significant enough to\r\nbeggars. If a thousand towns are examined, the same marks will be found\r\nat every passage entrance. The passage mark is a cypher with a twisted\r\ntail; in some cases the tail projects into the passage, in others\r\noutwardly; thus seeming to indicate whether the houses down the passage\r\nare worth calling at or not. Almost every door has its marks; these are\r\nvaried. In some cases there is a cross on the brickwork, in others a\r\ncypher; the figures ~1, 2, 3~ are also used. Every person may for\r\nhimself test the accuracy of these statements by the examination of the\r\nbrickwork near his own doorway\xe2\x80\x94thus demonstrating that mendicity is a\r\nregular trade, carried out upon a system calculated to save time, and\r\nrealize the largest profits.\xe2\x80\x9d These remarks refer mainly to provincial\r\ntowns, London being looked upon as the tramps\xe2\x80\x99 home, and therefore too\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfly\xe2\x80\x9d or experienced to be duped by such means. The title it obtains,\r\nthat of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Start,\xe2\x80\x9d or first place in everything, is significant of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nProvincial residents, who are more likely to view the foregoing extract\r\nwith an eye of suspicion than are those who live in a position\r\nto constantly watch for and profit by evidences of the secret\r\nintercommunication indulged in by the dangerous classes, should note, in\r\nfavour of the extract given, how significant is the practice of tramps\r\nand beggars calling in unfrequented localities, and how obvious it is\r\nthat they are directed by a code of signals at once complete and\r\nimperious. It is bad for a tramp who is discovered disobeying secret\r\norders. He is marked out and subjected to all kinds of annoyance by\r\nmeans of decoy hieroglyphs, until his life becomes a burden to him, and\r\nhe is compelled to starve or\xe2\x80\x94most horrible of alternatives\xe2\x80\x94go to work.\r\n\r\nThe only other notice of the hieroglyphs of vagabonds worth remarking is\r\nin Mayhew\xe2\x80\x99s _London Labour and the London Poor_.[26] Mayhew obtained his\r\ninformation from two tramps, who stated that hawkers employ these signs\r\nas well as beggars. One tramp thus described the method of \xe2\x80\x9cworking\xe2\x80\x9d[27]\r\na small town. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo hawkers (\xe2\x80\x98pals\xe2\x80\x99[27]) go together, but separate when\r\nthey enter a village, one taking one side of the road, and selling\r\ndifferent things, and so as to inform each other as to the character of\r\nthe people at whose houses they call, they chalk certain marks on their\r\ndoor-posts.\xe2\x80\x9d Another informant stated that \xe2\x80\x9cif a \xe2\x80\x98patterer\xe2\x80\x99[27] has been\r\n\xe2\x80\x98crabbed\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (that is, offended by refusal or exposure) \xe2\x80\x9cat any of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98cribs\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (houses), \xe2\x80\x9che mostly chalks a signal at or near the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThese hawkers were not of the ordinary, but of the tramp, class, who\r\ncarried goods more as a blind to their real designs than for the\r\npurposes of sale. They, in fact, represented the worst kinds of the two\r\nclasses. The law has comparatively recently improved these nondescript\r\ngentry off the face of the country, and the hawker of the present day is\r\ngenerally a man more sinned against than sinning.\r\n\r\nAnother use is also made of hieroglyphs. Charts of successful begging\r\nneighbourhoods are rudely drawn, and symbolical signs attached to each\r\nhouse to show whether benevolent or adverse.[28] \xe2\x80\x9cIn many cases there is\r\nover the kitchen mantelpiece\xe2\x80\x9d of a tramps\xe2\x80\x99 lodging-house \xe2\x80\x9ca map of the\r\ndistrict, dotted here and there with memorandums of failure or success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nA correct facsimile of one of these singular maps is given in this book.\r\nIt was obtained from the patterers and tramps who supplied a great many\r\nwords for this work, and who were employed by the original publisher in\r\ncollecting Old Ballads, Christmas Carols, Dying Speeches, and Last\r\nLamentations, as materials for a _History of Popular Literature_. The\r\nreader will, no doubt, be amused with the drawing. The locality depicted\r\nis near Maidstone, in Kent; and it was probably sketched by a wandering\r\nScreever[29] in payment for a night\xe2\x80\x99s lodging. The English practice of\r\nmarking everything, and scratching names on public property, extends\r\nitself to the tribe of vagabonds. On the map, as may be seen in the\r\nleft-hand corner, some Traveller[29] has drawn a favourite or noted\r\nfemale, singularly nicknamed Three-quarter Sarah. What were the peculiar\r\naccomplishments of this lady to demand so uncommon a name, the reader\r\nwill be at a loss to discover; but a patterer says it probably refers to\r\na shuffling dance of that name, common in tramps\xe2\x80\x99 lodging-houses, and in\r\nwhich \xe2\x80\x9c3/4 Sarah\xe2\x80\x9d may have been a proficient. Above her, three beggars\r\nor hawkers have reckoned their day\xe2\x80\x99s earnings, amounting to 13s., and on\r\nthe right a tolerably correct sketch of a low hawker, or cadger, is\r\ndrawn. \xe2\x80\x9cTo Dover, the _nigh_ way,\xe2\x80\x9d is the exact phraseology; and \xe2\x80\x9chup\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d a fair specimen of the self-acquired education of the\r\ndraughtsman. No key or explanation to the hieroglyphs was given in the\r\noriginal, because it would have been superfluous, when every inmate of\r\nthe lodging-house knew the marks from his cradle\xe2\x80\x94or rather his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nback.\r\n\r\nShould there be no map, in most lodging-houses there is an old man who\r\nis guide to every \xe2\x80\x9cwalk\xe2\x80\x9d in the vicinity, and who can tell on every\r\nround each house that is \xe2\x80\x9cgood for a cold tatur.\xe2\x80\x9d The hieroglyphs that\r\nare used are:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x98\x93 ~No good~; too poor, and know too much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x97\xa0+ ~Stop~,\xe2\x80\x94If you have what they want, they will buy. They are pretty\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfly\xe2\x80\x9d (knowing).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x8a\x83\xe2\x80\x94 ~Go in this direction~, it is better than the other road. Nothing\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x97\x87 ~Bone~ (good).

Knowing the character of the Gipsies, and\r\nascertaining from a tramp that they are well acquainted with the\r\nhieroglyphs, \xe2\x80\x9cand have been as long ago as ever he could remember,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthere is little fear of being wrong in ascribing the invention to them.\r\nHow strange it would be if some modern Belzoni, or Champollion\xe2\x80\x94say Mr.\r\nGeorge Smith, for instance\xe2\x80\x94discovered in these beggars\xe2\x80\x99 marks traces of\r\nancient Egyptian or Hindoo sign-writing!\r\n\r\nThat the Gipsies were in the habit of leaving memorials of the road they\r\nhad taken, and the successes that had befallen them, is upon record. In\r\nan old book, _The Triumph of Wit_, 1724, there is a passage which\r\nappears to have been copied from some older work, and it runs\r\nthus:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gipsies set out twice a year, and scatter all over England,\r\neach parcel having their appointed stages, that they may not interfere,\r\nnor hinder each other; and for that purpose, when they set forward in\r\nthe country, they stick up boughs in the way of divers kinds, according\r\nas it is agreed among them, that one company may know which way another\r\nis gone, and so take another road.\xe2\x80\x9d The works of Hoyland and Borrow\r\nsupply other instances.\r\n\r\nIt would be hardly fair to close this subject without drawing attention\r\nto the extraordinary statement that, actually on the threshold of the\r\ngibbet, the sign of the vagabond was to be met with! \xe2\x80\x9cThe murderer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsignal is even exhibited from the gallows; as a red handkerchief held in\r\nthe hand of the felon about to be executed is a token that he dies\r\nwithout having betrayed any professional secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d[30] Private\r\nexecutions have of course rendered this custom obsolete, even if it\r\never existed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the first editions of this work were published, the publishers\r\nhave received from various parts of England numerous evidences of the\r\nstill active use of beggars\xe2\x80\x99 marks and mendicant hieroglyphs. One\r\ngentleman writes from Great Yarmouth to say that, whilst residing in\r\nNorwich, he used frequently to see them on the houses and street corners\r\nin the suburbs. Another gentleman, a clergyman, states that he has so\r\nfar made himself acquainted with the meanings of the signs employed,\r\nthat by himself marking the characters \xe2\x97\xbb (gammy) and \xe2\xa6\xbf (flummuxed) on\r\nthe gate-posts of his parsonage, he enjoys a singular immunity from\r\nalms-seekers and cadgers on the tramp. This hint may not be lost on many\r\nother sufferers from importunate beggars, yet its publication may lead\r\nto the introduction of a new code.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a popular constable\xe2\x80\x99s guide,[31] giving the practice of justices in\r\npetty sessions, the following interesting paragraph is found,\r\ncorroborating what has just been said on the hieroglyphs used by\r\nvagabonds:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cGipsies follow their brethren by numerous marks, such as strewing\r\n    handfuls of grass in the daytime at a four lane or cross roads; the\r\n    grass being strewn down the road the gang have taken; also, by a\r\n    cross being made on the ground with a stick or knife\xe2\x80\x94the longest\r\n    end of the cross denotes the route taken. In the night-time a cleft\r\n    stick is placed in the fence at the cross roads, with an arm\r\n    pointing down the road their comrades have taken. The marks are\r\n    always placed on the left-hand side, so that the stragglers can\r\n    easily and readily find them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the cleft stick here alluded to, we learn the origin and use of \xe2\x8a\x83\xe2\x80\x94,\r\nthe third hieroglyph in the vagabond\xe2\x80\x99s private list. And the extract\r\nalso proves that the \xe2\x80\x9crule of the road\xe2\x80\x9d is the same with tramps as with\r\nthat body which is morally less but physically more dangerous, the\r\nLondon drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] Mr. Rawlinson\xe2\x80\x99s _Report to the General Board of Health, Parish of\r\nHavant, Hampshire_.\r\n\r\n[25] Vol. v. p. 210.\r\n\r\n[26] Vol. i. pp. 218 and 247.\r\n\r\n[27] See Dictionary.\r\n\r\n[28] Sometimes, as appears from the following, the names of persons and\r\nhouses are written instead. \xe2\x80\x9cIn almost every one of the padding-kens, or\r\nlow lodging-houses in the country, there is a list of walks pasted up\r\nover the kitchen mantelpiece.

It must be admitted, however, that within the past\r\nfew years they have become almost indivisible. They are both universal\r\nand ancient, and appear to have been, with certain exceptions, the\r\noffspring of gay, vulgar, or worthless persons in every part of the\r\nworld at every period of time. Indeed, if we are to believe implicitly\r\nthe saying of the wise man, that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing new under the sun,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cbloods\xe2\x80\x9d of buried Nineveh, with their knotty and door-matty-looking\r\nbeards, may have cracked Slang jokes on the steps of Sennacherib\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npalace; while the stocks and stones of ancient Egypt, and the bricks of\r\nvenerable and used-up Babylon, may be covered with Slang hieroglyphs,\r\nwhich, being perfectly unknown to modern antiquaries, have long been\r\nstumbling-blocks to the philologist; so impossible is it at this day to\r\nsay what was then authorized, or what vulgar, language. The only\r\nobjection that can be raised to this idea is, that Slang was, so far as\r\ncan be discovered, traditional, and unwritten, until the appearance of\r\nthis volume, a state of things which accounts for its many changes, and\r\nthe doubtful orthography of even its best known and most permanent\r\nforms. Slang is almost as old as speech, and must date from the\r\ncongregating together of people in cities. It is the result of crowding,\r\nand excitement, and artificial life. We have traces of this as far as we\r\ncan refer back. Martial, the epigrammatist, is full of Slang. When an\r\nuninvited guest accompanied his friend, the Slang of the day styled him\r\nhis \xe2\x80\x9cumbra;\xe2\x80\x9d when a man was trussed, neck and heels, it called him\r\njocosely \xe2\x80\x9cquadrupus.\xe2\x80\x9d Slang is nowadays very often the only vehicle by\r\nwhich rodomontade may be avoided. It is often full of the most pungent\r\nsatire, and is always to the point. Without point Slang has no _raison\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre_.\r\n\r\nOld English Slang was coarser, and depended more upon downright\r\nvulgarity than our modern Slang. It was a jesting speech, or humorous\r\nindulgence for the thoughtless moment or the drunken hour, and it acted\r\nas a vent-peg for a fit of temper or irritability; but it did not\r\ninterlard and permeate every description of conversation as now. It was\r\nconfined to nicknames and improper subjects, and encroached but to a\r\nvery small extent upon the domain of authorized speech. Indeed, it was\r\nexceedingly limited when compared with the vast territory of Slang in\r\nsuch general favour and complete circulation at the present day. Still,\r\nalthough not an extensive institution, as in our time, Slang certainly\r\ndid exist in this country centuries ago, as we may see if we look down\r\nthe page of any respectable History of England. Cromwell was familiarly\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cOld Noll,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in much the same way as Bonaparte was termed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoney,\xe2\x80\x9d and Wellington \xe2\x80\x9cConkey\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cNosey,\xe2\x80\x9d only a few years ago.[32]\r\nHis Legislature, too, was spoken of in a high-flavoured way as the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBarebones\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cRump\xe2\x80\x9d Parliament, and his followers were nicknamed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoundheads,\xe2\x80\x9d and the peculiar religious sects of his protectorate were\r\nstyled \xe2\x80\x9cPuritans\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cQuakers.\xe2\x80\x9d[33] The Civil War pamphlets, and the\r\nsatirical hits of the Cavaliers and the Commonwealth men, originated\r\nnumerous Slang words and vulgar similes in full use at the present\r\nmoment. Here is a field of inquiry for the Philological Society, indeed\r\na territory, for there are thirty thousand of these partisan tracts.\r\nLater still, in the court of Charles II., the naughty ladies and the gay\r\nlords, with Rochester at their head, talked Slang; and very naughty\r\nSlang it was too. Fops in those days, when \xe2\x80\x9cover head and ears\xe2\x80\x9d in debt,\r\nand in continual fear of arrest, termed their enemies, the bailiffs,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilistines\xe2\x80\x9d[34] or \xe2\x80\x9cMoabites.\xe2\x80\x9d At a later period, when collars were\r\nworn detached from shirts, in order to save the expense of washing\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nobject, it would seem, with needy \xe2\x80\x9cswells\xe2\x80\x9d in all ages\xe2\x80\x94they obtained\r\nthe name of \xe2\x80\x9cJacobites.\xe2\x80\x9d One-half of the coarse wit in Butler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Hudibras_ lurks in the vulgar words and phrases which he was so fond of\r\nemploying. These Slang phrases contained the marrow of his arguments\r\nstripped of all superfluous matter, and they fell with ponderous weight\r\nand terrible effect upon his opponents. They were more homely and\r\nforcible than the mild and elegant sentences of Cowley, and the people,\r\ntherefore, hurrahed them, and pronounced Butler one of themselves,\xe2\x80\x94or,\r\nas we should say, in a joyful moment, \xe2\x80\x9ca jolly good fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d Orator\r\nHenley preached and prayed in Slang, and first charmed and then ruled\r\nthe dirty mobs in Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Fields by vulgarisms. Burly Grose\r\nmentions Henley, with the remark that we owe a great many Slang phrases\r\nto him, though even the worst Slang was refinement itself compared with\r\nmany of Henley\xe2\x80\x99s most studied oratorical utterances, which proves that\r\nthe most blackguard parts of a blackguard speech may be perfectly free\r\nfrom either Slang or Cant. Swift, and old Sir Roger L\xe2\x80\x99Estrange, and\r\nArbuthnot, were all fond of vulgar or Slang language; indeed, we may see\r\nfrom a Slang word used by the latter how curious is the gradual adoption\r\nof vulgar terms in our standard dictionaries. The worthy doctor, in\r\norder to annihilate (or, as we should say, with a fitting respect to the\r\nsubject under consideration, to \xe2\x80\x9csmash\xe2\x80\x9d) an opponent, thought proper on\r\nan occasion to use the word \xe2\x80\x9ccabbage,\xe2\x80\x9d not in the ancient sense of a\r\nflatulent vegetable of the kitchen-garden, but in the at once Slang\r\nsense of purloining or cribbing. Johnson soon met with the word, looked\r\nat it, examined it, weighed it, and shook his head, but out of respect\r\nto a brother doctor inserted it in his dictionary, labelling it,\r\nhowever, prominently \xe2\x80\x9cCant;\xe2\x80\x9d whilst Walker and Webster, years after,\r\nwhen all over England \xe2\x80\x9cto cabbage\xe2\x80\x9d was to pilfer, placed the term in\r\ntheir dictionaries as an ancient and very respectable word. Another\r\nSlang term, \xe2\x80\x9cgull,\xe2\x80\x9d to cheat, or delude, sometimes varied to \xe2\x80\x9cgully,\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nstated to be connected with the Dean of St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cGull,\xe2\x80\x9d a dupe,\r\nor a fool, is often used by our old dramatists, and is generally\r\nbelieved to have given rise to the verb; but a curious little edition of\r\n_Bamfylde Moore Carew_, published in 1827, says that \xe2\x80\x9cto gull,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgully,\xe2\x80\x9d is derived from the well-known Gulliver, the hero of the famous\r\nTravels. It may be from the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t come Gulliver over me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin use while the popularity of the book was hot. How crammed with Slang\r\nare the dramatic works of the last century! The writers of the comedies\r\nand farces in those days must have lived in the streets, and written\r\ntheir plays in the public-houses, so filled are they with vulgarisms and\r\nunauthorized words. The popular phrases, \xe2\x80\x9cI owe you one,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nfor his nob,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cKeep moving, dad,\xe2\x80\x9d arose in this way.[35] The second\r\nof these sayings was, doubtless, taken from the card-table, for at\r\ncribbage the player who holds the knave of the suit turned up counts\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cone for his nob,\xe2\x80\x9d and the dealer who turns up a knave counts \xe2\x80\x9ctwo for\r\nhis heels.\xe2\x80\x9d From a dramatic point of view, the use of these phrases is\r\nperfectly correct, as they were in constant use among the people\r\nsupposed to be represented by the author\xe2\x80\x99s characters.\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Centlivre\xe2\x80\x99s admirable comedy of _A Bold Stroke for a Wife_, we\r\nsee the origin of that popular phrase, the real Simon Pure. Simon Pure\r\nis the Quaker name adopted by Colonel Feignwell as a trick to obtain the\r\nhand of Mistress Anne Lovely in marriage. The veritable Quaker, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9creal Simon Pure,\xe2\x80\x9d recommended by Aminadab Holdfast, of Bristol, as a\r\nfit sojourner with Obadiah Prim, arrives at last, to the discomfiture of\r\nthe Colonel, who, to maintain his position and gain time, concocts a\r\nletter in which the real Quaker is spoken of as a housebreaker who had\r\ntravelled in the \xe2\x80\x9cleather conveniency\xe2\x80\x9d from Bristol, and adopted the\r\ngarb and name of the western Quaker in order to pass off as the \xe2\x80\x9cReal\r\nSimon Pure,\xe2\x80\x9d but only for the purpose of robbing the house and cutting\r\nthe throat of the perplexed Obadiah. The scene in which the two Simon\r\nPures, the real and the counterfeit, meet, is one of the best in the\r\ncomedy.\r\n\r\nTom Brown, of \xe2\x80\x9cfacetious memory,\xe2\x80\x9d as his friends were wont to say, and\r\nNed Ward, who wrote humorous books, and when tired drew beer for his\r\ncustomers at his alehouse in Long Acre,[36] were both great producers of\r\nSlang in the last century, and to them we owe many popular current\r\nphrases and household words.\r\n\r\nWritten Slang was checked, rather than advanced, by the pens of\r\nAddison, Johnson, and Goldsmith; although Bee, the bottle-holder and\r\nhistoriographer of the pugilistic band of brothers in the youthful days\r\nof flat-nosed Tom Cribb, has gravely stated that Johnson, when young and\r\nrakish, contributed to an early volume of the _Gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s Magazine_ a\r\nfew pages, by way of specimen, of a slang dictionary, the result, Mr.\r\nBee says, \xe2\x80\x9cof his midnight ramblings!\xe2\x80\x9d[37] This statement is not only\r\nimprobable, but an investigation of the venerable magazine, though\r\nstrict and searching, produces no evidence in corroboration of Mr. Bee.\r\nGoldsmith, even, certainly coined a few words as occasion required,\r\nalthough as a rule his pen was pure and graceful, and adverse to\r\nneologisms. The word \xe2\x80\x9cfudge,\xe2\x80\x9d it has been stated, was first used by him\r\nin literary composition, although it probably originated with one\r\nCaptain Fudge, a notorious fibber, nearly a century before. Street\r\nphrases, nicknames, and vulgar words were continually being added\r\nto the great stock of popular Slang up to the commencement of\r\nthe present century, when it received numerous additions from pugilism,\r\nhorse-racing, and \xe2\x80\x9cfast\xe2\x80\x9d life generally, which suddenly came into great\r\npublic favour, and was at its height in the latter part of the reign of\r\nGeorge III., and in the early days of the Regency. Slang in those days\r\nwas generally termed \xe2\x80\x9cflash\xe2\x80\x9d language. It will thus be noted that the\r\nterm \xe2\x80\x9cflash\xe2\x80\x9d has in turn represented both Cant and Slang; now the word\r\nSlang has become perfectly generic. So popular was \xe2\x80\x9cflash\xe2\x80\x9d with the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbloods\xe2\x80\x9d of high life, that it constituted the best paying literary\r\ncapital for certain authors and dramatists. Pierce Egan issued\r\n_Boxiana_, and _Life in London_, six portly octavo volumes, crammed with\r\nSlang; and Moncrieff wrote the most popular farce of the day, _Tom and\r\nJerry_ (adapted from the latter work), which, to use newspaper Slang,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctook the town by storm,\xe2\x80\x9d and, with its then fashionable vulgarisms,\r\nmade the fortune of the old Adelphi Theatre, and was without exception\r\nthe most wonderful instance of a continuous theatrical run in ancient or\r\nmodern times. This also was brimful of Slang. Other authors helped to\r\npopularize and extend Slang down to our own time, and it has now taken a\r\nsomewhat different turn, dropping many of the Cant and old vulgar words,\r\nand assuming a certain quaint and fashionable phraseology\xe2\x80\x94familiar,\r\nutilitarian, and jovial. There can be no doubt that common speech is\r\ngreatly influenced by fashion, fresh manners, and that general change of\r\nideas which steals over a people once in a generation. But before\r\nproceeding further into the region of Slang, it will be well to say\r\nsomething on the etymology of the word.\r\n\r\nThe word Slang is only mentioned by two lexicographers\xe2\x80\x94Webster and\r\nOgilvie.[38] Johnson, Walker, and the older compilers of dictionaries\r\ngive \xe2\x80\x9cslang\xe2\x80\x9d as the preterite of \xe2\x80\x9csling,\xe2\x80\x9d but not a word about Slang in\r\nthe sense of low, vulgar, or unrecognised language. The origin of the\r\nword has often been asked for in literary journals and books, but only\r\none man, until recently, ever hazarded an etymology\xe2\x80\x94Jonathan Bee.[39]\r\nWith a recklessness peculiar to ignorance, Bee stated that Slang was\r\nderived from \xe2\x80\x9cthe _slangs_ or fetters worn by prisoners, having acquired\r\nthat name from the manner in which they were worn, as they required a\r\nsling of string to keep them off the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d Bee had just been nettled\r\nat Pierce Egan\xe2\x80\x99s producing a new edition of Grose\xe2\x80\x99s _Dictionary of the\r\nVulgar Tongue_, and was determined to excel in a vulgar dictionary of\r\nhis own, which should be more racy, more pugilistic, and more original.\r\nHow far he succeeded in this latter particular, his ridiculous etymology\r\nof Slang will show. Slang is not an English word; it is the Gipsy term\r\nfor their secret language, and its synonym is Gibberish\xe2\x80\x94another word\r\nwhich was believed to have had no distinct origin.[40] Grose\xe2\x80\x94stout and\r\nburly Captain Grose\xe2\x80\x94whom we may characterize as the greatest antiquary,\r\njoker, and porter-drinker of his day, was the first lexicographer to\r\nrecognise the word \xe2\x80\x9cSlang.\xe2\x80\x9d It occurs in his _Classical Dictionary of\r\nthe Vulgar Tongue_, of 1785, with the statement that it implies \xe2\x80\x9cCant or\r\nvulgar language.\xe2\x80\x9d Grose was a great favourite with Burns, and so pleased\r\nhim by his extensive powers of story-telling and grog-imbibing, that the\r\ncompanionable and humour-loving Scotch bard wrote for his fat\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x94or, to use his own words, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fine, fat, fodgel wight\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nimmortal poem of _Tam O\xe2\x80\x99 Shanter_.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while troubling the reader with a long account of the\r\ntransformation into an English term of the word Slang, as it is easily\r\nseen how we obtained it. Hucksters and beggars on tramp, or at fairs and\r\nraces, associate and frequently join in any rough enterprise with the\r\nGipsies. The word would be continually heard by them, and would in this\r\nmanner soon become part of their vocabulary,[41] and, when carried by\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfast\xe2\x80\x9d or vulgar fashionables from the society of thieves and low\r\ncharacters to their own drawing-rooms, would as quickly become Slang,\r\nand the representative term for all vulgar language. Modern philologists\r\ngive the word Slang as derived from the French _langue_. This is, at all\r\nevents, as likely as any other derivative.\r\n\r\nAny sudden excitement or peculiar circumstance is quite sufficient to\r\noriginate and set going a score of Slang words. Nearly every election or\r\npublic agitation throws out offshoots of excitement, or scintillations\r\nof humour in the shape of Slang terms\xe2\x80\x94vulgar at first, but at length\r\nadopted, if possessing sufficient hold on the public mind, as\r\nsemi-respectable from sheer force of habit. There is scarcely a\r\ncondition or calling in life that does not possess its own peculiar\r\nSlang. The professions, legal and medical, have each familiar and\r\nunauthorized terms for peculiar circumstances and things, and it is\r\nquite certain that the clerical calling, or \xe2\x80\x9cthe cloth\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in itself a\r\nSlang term given at a time when the laity were more distinguished by\r\ntheir gay dress from the clergy than they are now\xe2\x80\x94is not entirely free\r\nfrom this peculiarity. Every workshop, warehouse, factory, and mill\r\nthroughout the country has its Slang, and so have the public schools and\r\nthe Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Sea Slang constitutes the\r\nprincipal charm of a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cyarn;\xe2\x80\x9d and our soldiers have in turn\r\ntheir peculiar nicknames and terms for things and subjects, proper and\r\nimproper. A writer in _Household Words_ (No. 183) has gone so far as to\r\nremark, that a person \xe2\x80\x9cshall not read one single parliamentary debate,\r\nas reported in a first-class newspaper, without meeting scores of Slang\r\nwords,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthat from Mr. Speaker in his chair, to the Cabinet\r\nMinisters whispering behind it\xe2\x80\x94from mover to seconder, from true blue\r\nProtectionist to extremest Radical\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Barry\xe2\x80\x99s New House echoes and\r\nre-echoes with Slang.\xe2\x80\x9d This statement is most worthy of notice, as\r\nshowing how, with a very small sub-stratum of fact, a plausible, though\r\nnot the less gigantic, mis-statement may be built up.\r\n\r\nThe universality of Slang is extraordinary. Let any person for a short\r\ntime narrowly examine the conversation of his dearest and nearest\r\nfriends, or even analyse his own supposed correct talk, and he shall be\r\namazed at the numerous unauthorized, and what we can only call vulgar,\r\nwords in constant use. One peculiarity of the growth of Slang is the\r\nfinding of new meanings for old words. Take, for instance, the verbs\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdo,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccut,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgo,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctake,\xe2\x80\x9d and see how they are used to express\r\nfresh ideas, and then let us ask ourselves how is it possible for a\r\nFrenchman or German, be he never so well educated, to avoid continually\r\nblundering and floundering amongst our little words when trying to make\r\nhimself understood in an ordinary conversation? He may have studied our\r\nlanguage the required time, and have gone through the usual amount of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgrinding,\xe2\x80\x9d and practised the common allotment of patience, but all to\r\nno purpose as far as accuracy is concerned. As, however, we do not make\r\nour language, nor for the matter of that our Slang, for the convenience\r\nor inconvenience of foreigners, we need not pursue this portion of the\r\nsubject further. \xe2\x80\x9cJabber\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9choax\xe2\x80\x9d were Slang and Cant terms in\r\nSwift\xe2\x80\x99s time; so, indeed, were \xe2\x80\x9cmob\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csham.\xe2\x80\x9d[42] Words directly from\r\nthe Latin and Greek, framed in accordance with the rules which govern\r\nthe construction of the language, are not Slang, but are good English,\r\nif not Saxon,\xe2\x80\x94a term, by the way, which is as much misused as any\r\nunfortunate word that can be remembered just now. Sound contributes many\r\nSlang words\xe2\x80\x94a source that etymologists frequently overlook. Nothing\r\npleases an ignorant person so much as a high-sounding term, \xe2\x80\x9cfull of\r\nfury.\xe2\x80\x9d How melodious and drum-like are those vulgar coruscations\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crumbumptious,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cslantingdicular,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csplendiferous,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crumbustious,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cferricadouzer.\xe2\x80\x9d What a \xe2\x80\x9cpull\xe2\x80\x9d the sharp-nosed lodging-house-keeper\r\nthinks she has over her victims if she can but hurl such testimonies of\r\na liberal education at them when they are disputing her charges, and\r\nthreatening to \xe2\x80\x9cabsquatulate!\xe2\x80\x9d In the United States the vulgar-genteel\r\neven excel the poor \xe2\x80\x9cstuck-up\xe2\x80\x9d Cockneys in their formation of a native\r\nfashionable language. How charming to a refined ear are \xe2\x80\x9cabskize,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccatawampously,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexflunctify,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cobscute,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ckeslosh,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ckesouse,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckeswollop,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ckewhollux!\xe2\x80\x9d[43] It must not be forgotten, however,\r\nthat a great many new \xe2\x80\x9cAmericanisms\xe2\x80\x9d are perfectly unknown in America,\r\nand in this respect they resemble the manners and customs of our cousins\r\nas found in books, and in books only. Vulgar words representing action\r\nand brisk movement often owe their origin to sound, as has before been\r\nremarked. Mispronunciation, too, is another great source of vulgar or\r\nSlang words, and of this \xe2\x80\x9cramshackle,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cshackly,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnary-one\xe2\x80\x9d for neither\r\nor neither one, \xe2\x80\x9cottomy\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9catomy\xe2\x80\x9d for anatomy, \xe2\x80\x9crench\xe2\x80\x9d for rinse, are\r\nspecimens. The commonalty dislike frequently-occurring words difficult\r\nof pronunciation, and so we have the street abridgments of \xe2\x80\x9cbimeby\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\nby-and-by, \xe2\x80\x9ccaze\xe2\x80\x9d for because, \xe2\x80\x9cgin\xe2\x80\x9d for given, \xe2\x80\x9chankercher\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\nhandkerchief, \xe2\x80\x9cruma tiz\xe2\x80\x9d for rheumatism, \xe2\x80\x9cbacker\xe2\x80\x9d for tobacco, and many\r\nothers, not perhaps Slang, but certainly, all vulgarisms. Whately, in\r\nhis _Remains of Bishop Copleston_, has inserted a leaf from the bishop\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnote-book on the popular corruption of names, mentioning, among others,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckickshaws,\xe2\x80\x9d as from the French _quelques choses_; \xe2\x80\x9cbeefeater,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ngrotesque guardian of royalty in a procession, and the envied devourer\r\nof enormous beefsteaks, as but a vulgar pronunciation of the French\r\n_buffetier_, and \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge and Cannon,\xe2\x80\x9d the sign of a public-house, as\r\nnothing but a corruption (although so soon!) of the popular premier of\r\nthe last generation, George Canning.[44] Literature has its Slang terms;\r\nand the desire on the part of writers to say funny and startling things\r\nin a novel and curious way contributes many unauthorized words to the\r\ngreat stock of Slang.\r\n\r\nFashionable or Upper-class Slang is of several varieties. There is the\r\nBelgravian, military and naval, parliamentary, dandy, and the reunion\r\nand visiting Slang. English officers, civilians, and their families,\r\nwho have resided long in India, have contributed many terms from the\r\nHindostanee to our language. Several of these, such as \xe2\x80\x9cchit,\xe2\x80\x9d a letter,\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9ctiffin,\xe2\x80\x9d lunch, are fast losing their Slang character, and becoming\r\nregularly-recognised English words. \xe2\x80\x9cJungle,\xe2\x80\x9d as a term for a forest or\r\nwilderness, is now an English phrase; a few years past, however, it was\r\nmerely the Hindostanee \xe2\x80\x9cjunkul.\xe2\x80\x9d This, being a perfectly legal\r\ntransition, having no other recognised form, can hardly be characterized\r\nas Slang. The extension of trade in China, and the English settlement of\r\nHong Kong, have introduced among us several examples of Canton jargon,\r\nthat exceedingly curious Anglo-Chinese dialect spoken in the seaports of\r\nthe Celestial Empire. While these words have been carried as it were\r\ninto the families of the upper and middle classes, persons in a humbler\r\nrank of life, through the sailors and soldiers and Lascar and Chinese\r\nbeggars that haunt the metropolis, have also adopted many Anglo-Indian\r\nand Anglo-Chinese phrases. As this dictionary would have been incomplete\r\nwithout them, they are carefully recorded in its pages. Concerning the\r\nSlang of the fashionable world, it has been remarked that it is mostly\r\nimported from France; and that an unmeaning gibberish of Gallicisms runs\r\nthrough English fashionable conversation and fashionable novels, and\r\naccounts of fashionable parties in the fashionable newspapers. Yet,\r\nludicrously enough, immediately the fashionable magnates of England\r\nseize on any French idiom, the French themselves not only universally\r\nabandon it to us, but positively repudiate it altogether from their\r\nidiomatic vocabulary. If you were to tell a well-bred Frenchman that\r\nsuch and such an aristocratic marriage was on the _tapis_, he would\r\nstare with astonishment, and look down on the carpet in the startled\r\nendeavour to find a marriage in so unusual a place. If you were to talk\r\nto him of the _beau monde_, he would imagine you meant the world which\r\nGod made, not half-a-dozen streets and squares between Hyde Park Corner\r\nand Chelsea Bun House. The _th\xc3\xa9 dansant_ would be completely\r\ninexplicable to him. If you were to point out to him the Dowager Lady\r\nGrimgriffin acting as _chaperon_ to Lady Amanda Creamville, he would\r\nimagine you were referring to the _petit Chaperon rouge_\xe2\x80\x94to little\r\nRed-Riding Hood. He might just understand what was meant by _vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_,\r\n_entremets_, and some others of the flying horde of frivolous little\r\nforeign slangisms hovering about fashionable cookery and fashionable\r\nfurniture; but three-fourths of them would seem to him as barbarous\r\nFrench provincialisms, or, at best, but as antiquated and obsolete\r\nexpressions, picked out of the letters of Mademoiselle Scuderi, or the\r\ntales of Crebillon \xe2\x80\x9cthe younger.\xe2\x80\x9d Servants, too, appropriate the scraps\r\nof French conversation which fall from their masters\xe2\x80\x99 guests at the\r\ndinner table, and forthwith in the world of flunkeydom the word \xe2\x80\x9cknow\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nis disused, and the lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid, in doubt on a particular point, asks\r\nJohn whether or no he \xe2\x80\x9csaveys\xe2\x80\x9d it?[45] What, too, can be more abominable\r\nthan that heartless piece of fashionable newspaper Slang, regularly\r\nemployed when speaking of the successful courtship of young people in\r\nthe aristocratic world:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFE.\xe2\x80\x94We understand that a marriage is ARRANGED (!)\r\n    betwixt the Lady, &c. &c., and the Honourable, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArranged!\xe2\x80\x9d Is that cold-blooded Smithfield or Mark Lane term for a sale\r\nor a purchase the proper word to express the hopeful, joyous, golden\r\nunion of young and trustful hearts? Possibly, though, the word is often\r\nused with a due regard to facts, for marriages, especially amongst our\r\nupper classes, are not always \xe2\x80\x9cmade in heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Which is the proper way\r\nto pronounce the names of great people, and what the correct authority?\r\nLord Cowper, we are often assured, is Lord _Cooper_\xe2\x80\x94on this principle\r\nLord Cowley would certainly be Lord _Cooley_\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Carew, we are\r\ntold, should be Mr. _Carey_, Ponsonby should be _Punsunby_, Eyre should\r\nbe _Aire_, Cholmondeley should be _Chumley_, St. John _Sinjen_,\r\nBeauchamp should be _Beachem_, Majoribanks _Marshbanks_, and Powell\r\nshould always be _Poel_. The pronunciation of proper names has long been\r\nan anomaly in the conversation of the upper classes of this country.\r\nHodge and Podge, the clodhoppers of Shakspeare\xe2\x80\x99s time, talked in their\r\nmug-houses of the great Lords _Darbie_, _Barkelie_, and _Bartie_. In\r\nPall Mall and May Fair these personages are spoken of in exactly the\r\nsame manner at the present day, whilst in the City, and amongst the\r\n_middle_ classes, we only hear of Derby, Berkeley, &c.,\xe2\x80\x94the correct\r\npronunciations, if the spelling is worth aught. It must not be\r\nforgotten, however, that the pronunciation of the upper classes, as\r\nregards the names of places just mentioned, is a relic of old times when\r\nthe orthography was different. The middle-class man is satisfied to take\r\nmatters the modern way, but even he, when he wishes to be thought a\r\nswell, alters his style. In fact, the old rule as to proper names being\r\npronounced according to individual taste, is, and ever will be, of\r\nabsolute necessity, not only as regards the upper and middle, but the\r\nlower classes. A costermonger is ignorant of such a place as Birmingham,\r\nbut understands you in a moment if you talk of _Brummagem_. Why do not\r\nPall Mall exquisites join with the costermongers in this pronunciation?\r\nIt is the ancient one.[46]\r\n\r\n_Parliamentary Slang_, excepting a few peculiar terms connected with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_the_ House\xe2\x80\x9d (scarcely Slang), is mainly composed of fashionable,\r\nliterary, and learned Slang. When members get excited, and wish to be\r\nforcible, they are now and again, but not very often, found guilty of\r\nvulgarisms, and then may be not particular which of the street terms\r\nthey select, providing it carries, as good old Dr. South said, plenty of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwildfire\xe2\x80\x9d in it. Lord Cairns when Sir Hugh, and a member of the Lower\r\nHouse, spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cthat homely but expressive phrase, \xe2\x80\x98dodge.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Out of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe House,\xe2\x80\x9d several Slang terms are used in connexion with Parliament\r\nor members of Parliament. If Lord Palmerston was familiar by name to the\r\ntribes of the Caucasus and Asia Minor as a great foreign diplomatist,\r\nwhen the name of our Queen was unknown to the inhabitants of those\r\nparts\xe2\x80\x94as was once stated in the _Times_\xe2\x80\x94it is worthy of remark that,\r\namongst the costers and the wild inhabitants of the streets, he was at\r\nthat time better known as \xe2\x80\x9cPam.\xe2\x80\x9d The cabmen on the \xe2\x80\x9cranks\xe2\x80\x9d in Piccadilly\r\nhave been often heard to call each other\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the great\r\nleader of the Opposition in the following expressive manner\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHollo,\r\nthere! de yer see old \xe2\x80\x98Dizzy\xe2\x80\x99 doing a stump?\xe2\x80\x9d A \xe2\x80\x9cplumper\xe2\x80\x9d is a single\r\nvote at an election\xe2\x80\x94not a \xe2\x80\x9csplit-ticket;\xe2\x80\x9d and electors who had occupied\r\na house, no matter how small, and boiled a pot in it, thus qualifying\r\nthemselves for voting, used in the good old days to be termed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpotwallopers.\xe2\x80\x9d A quiet \xe2\x80\x9cwalk over\xe2\x80\x9d is a re-election without opposition\r\nand much cost; and is obtained from the sporting vocabulary, in which\r\nthe term is not Slang. A \xe2\x80\x9ccaucus\xe2\x80\x9d meeting refers to the private\r\nassembling of politicians before an election, when candidates are\r\nchosen, and measures of action agreed upon. The term comes from America,\r\nwhere caucus means a meeting simply. A \xe2\x80\x9cjob,\xe2\x80\x9d in political phraseology,\r\nis a Government office or contract obtained by secret influence or\r\nfavouritism; and is not a whit more objectionable in sound than is the\r\nnefarious proceeding offensive to the sense of those who pay but do not\r\nparticipate. The _Times_ once spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cthe patriotic member of\r\nParliament \xe2\x80\x98potted out\xe2\x80\x99 in a dusty little lodging somewhere about Bury\r\nStreet.\xe2\x80\x9d But then the _Times_ was not always the mildly respectable\r\nhigh-class paper it now is, as a reference to the columns devoted by it\r\nto Macaulay\xe2\x80\x99s official career will alone determine. These, which\r\nappeared during the present reign, would be far below the lowest\r\njournalistic taste nowadays; yet they are in keeping with the rest of\r\nthe political references made at that time by the now austere and\r\nhigh-principled \xe2\x80\x9cleading journal.\xe2\x80\x9d The term \xe2\x80\x9cquockerwodger,\xe2\x80\x9d although\r\nreferring to a wooden toy figure which jerks its limbs about when pulled\r\nby a string, has been supplemented with a political meaning. A\r\npseudo-politician, whose strings of action are pulled by somebody else,\r\nis often termed a \xe2\x80\x9cquockerwodger.\xe2\x80\x9d From an early period politics and\r\npartyism have attracted unto themselves quaint Slang terms. Horace\r\nWalpole quotes a party nickname of February, 1742, as a Slang word of\r\nthe day:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe Tories declare against any further prosecution, if Tories\r\nthere are, for now one hears of nothing but the \xe2\x80\x98broad-bottom;\xe2\x80\x99 it is\r\nthe reigning Cant word, and means the taking all parties and people,\r\nindifferently, into the Ministry.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus \xe2\x80\x9cbroad-bottom\xe2\x80\x9d in those days was\r\nSlang for \xe2\x80\x9ccoalition.\xe2\x80\x9d The term \xe2\x80\x9crat,\xe2\x80\x9d too, in allusion to rats\r\ndeserting vessels about to sink, has long been employed towards those\r\nturncoat politicians who change their party for interest. Who that\r\noccasionally passes near the Houses of Parliament has not often noticed\r\nstout or careful M.P.\xe2\x80\x99s walk briskly through the Hall, and on the\r\nkerb-stone in front, with umbrella or walking-cane uplifted, shout to\r\nthe cabmen on the rank, \xe2\x80\x9cFour-wheeler!\xe2\x80\x9d The term is both useful and\r\nexpressive; but it is none the less Slang, though of a better kind than\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgrowler,\xe2\x80\x9d used to denominate the same kind of vehicle, or \xe2\x80\x9cshoful,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nstreet term for a hansom cab.\r\n\r\nMilitary Slang is on a par, and of a character, with dandy Slang.\r\nInconvenient friends, or elderly and lecturing relatives, are pronounced\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdreadful bores.\xe2\x80\x9d This affectionate term, like most other Slang phrases\r\nwhich have their rise in a certain section of society, has spread and\r\nbecome of general application. Four-wheeled cabs are called \xe2\x80\x9cbounders;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand a member of the Four-in-hand Club, driving to Epsom on the Derby\r\nDay, would, using fashionable phraseology, speak of it as \xe2\x80\x9ctooling his\r\ndrag down to the Derby.\xe2\x80\x9d A vehicle, if not a \xe2\x80\x9cdrag\xe2\x80\x9d (or dwag), is a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctrap,\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9ccask;\xe2\x80\x9d and if the \xe2\x80\x9cturn-out\xe2\x80\x9d happens to be in other than a\r\ntrim condition, it is pronounced at once as not \xe2\x80\x9cdown the road,\xe2\x80\x9d unless\r\nthe critic should prefer to characterize the equipage as \xe2\x80\x9cdickey.\xe2\x80\x9d Your\r\nCity swell would say it is not \xe2\x80\x9cup to the mark;\xe2\x80\x9d whilst the costermonger\r\nwould call it a \xe2\x80\x9cwery snide affair.\xe2\x80\x9d In the army a barrack or military\r\nstation is known as a \xe2\x80\x9clobster-box;\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ccram\xe2\x80\x9d for an examination is to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmug-up\xe2\x80\x9d (this same term is much in vogue among actors, who regard\r\nmugging-up as one of the fine arts of the profession); to reject from\r\nthe examination is to \xe2\x80\x9cspin;\xe2\x80\x9d and that part of the barrack occupied by\r\nsubalterns is frequently spoken of as the \xe2\x80\x9crookery.\xe2\x80\x9d In dandy or swell\r\nSlang, any celebrity, from the Poet-Laureate to the Pope of Rome, is a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cswell,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe old swell\xe2\x80\x9d now occupies the place once held by the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cguv\xe2\x80\x99nor.\xe2\x80\x9d Wrinkled-faced old professors, who hold dress and fashionable\r\ntailors in abhorrence, are called \xe2\x80\x9cawful swells,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94if they happen to be\r\nvery learned or clever. In this upper-class Slang, a title is termed a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chandle;\xe2\x80\x9d trousers, \xe2\x80\x9cinexpressibles,\xe2\x80\x9d and bags, or \xe2\x80\x9chowling bags,\xe2\x80\x9d when\r\nof a large pattern;\xe2\x80\x94a superior appearance, or anything above the common\r\ncut, is styled \xe2\x80\x9cextensive;\xe2\x80\x9d a four-wheeled cab is called a \xe2\x80\x9cbirdcage;\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\ndance, a \xe2\x80\x9chop;\xe2\x80\x9d dining at another man\xe2\x80\x99s table, \xe2\x80\x9csitting under his\r\nmahogany;\xe2\x80\x9d anything flashy or showy, \xe2\x80\x9cloud;\xe2\x80\x9d the peculiar make or cut of\r\na coat, its \xe2\x80\x9cbuild;\xe2\x80\x9d full dress, \xe2\x80\x9cfull fig;\xe2\x80\x9d wearing clothes which\r\nrepresent the very extreme of fashion, \xe2\x80\x9cdressing to death;\xe2\x80\x9d a dinner or\r\nsupper party, a \xe2\x80\x9cspread;\xe2\x80\x9d a friend (or a \xe2\x80\x9cgood fellow\xe2\x80\x9d), a \xe2\x80\x9ctrump;\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\ndifficulty, a \xe2\x80\x9cscrew loose;\xe2\x80\x9d and everything that is unpleasant, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom\r\nbad sherry to a writ from a tailor,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cjeuced infernal.\xe2\x80\x9d The phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nsend a man to Coventry,\xe2\x80\x9d or permit no person \xe2\x80\x9cin the set\xe2\x80\x9d to speak to\r\nhim, although an ancient saying, must still be considered Slang.\r\n\r\nThe Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and the great public schools,\r\nare the hotbeds of fashionable Slang. Growing boys and high-spirited\r\nyoung fellows detest restraint of all kinds, and prefer making a dash at\r\nlife in a Slang phraseology of their own to all the set forms and\r\nsyntactical rules of _Alma Mater_. Many of the most expressive words in\r\na common chit-chat, or free-and-easy conversation, are old university\r\nvulgarisms. \xe2\x80\x9cCut,\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense of dropping an acquaintance, was\r\noriginally a Cambridge form of speech; and \xe2\x80\x9choax,\xe2\x80\x9d to deceive or\r\nridicule, we are informed by Grose, was many years since an Oxford term.\r\nAmong the words that fast society has borrowed from our great\r\nscholastic\xe2\x80\x94not establishments (they are sacred to linendrapery and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgentlemanly assistants\xe2\x80\x9d)\xe2\x80\x94institutions, is found \xe2\x80\x9ccrib,\xe2\x80\x9d a house or\r\napartments; \xe2\x80\x9cdead men,\xe2\x80\x9d empty wine bottles; \xe2\x80\x9cdrawing teeth,\xe2\x80\x9d[47]\r\nwrenching off knockers,\xe2\x80\x94an obsolete amusement; \xe2\x80\x9cfizzing,\xe2\x80\x9d first-rate,\r\nor splendid; \xe2\x80\x9cgovernor,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crelieving-officer,\xe2\x80\x9d the general term for a\r\nmale parent; \xe2\x80\x9cplucked,\xe2\x80\x9d defeated or turned back, now altered to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cplough;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cquiz,\xe2\x80\x9d to scrutinize, or a prying old fellow; and \xe2\x80\x9crow,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nnoisy disturbance. The Slang words in use at Oxford and Cambridge would\r\nalone fill a volume. As examples let us take \xe2\x80\x9cscout,\xe2\x80\x9d which at Oxford\r\nrefers to an undergraduate\xe2\x80\x99s valet, whilst the same menial at Cambridge\r\nis termed a \xe2\x80\x9cgyp,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94popularly derived by the Cantabs from the Greek,\r\n\xce\xb3\xe1\xbd\xba\xcf\x88, a vulture; \xe2\x80\x9cskull,\xe2\x80\x9d the head, or master, of a college; \xe2\x80\x9cbattles,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe Oxford term for rations, changed at Cambridge into \xe2\x80\x9ccommons.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nterm \xe2\x80\x9cdickey,\xe2\x80\x9d a half-shirt, it is said, originated with the students of\r\nTrinity College, Dublin, who at first styled it a \xe2\x80\x9ctommy,\xe2\x80\x9d from the\r\nGreek \xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb4, a section,\xe2\x80\x94the change from \xe2\x80\x9ctommy\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cdickey\xe2\x80\x9d requires no\r\nexplanation. \xe2\x80\x9cCrib,\xe2\x80\x9d a literal translation, is now universal; \xe2\x80\x9cgrind\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nrefers to \xe2\x80\x9cworking up\xe2\x80\x9d for an examination, also to a walk or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHivite\xe2\x80\x9d is a student of St. Begh\xe2\x80\x99s (St. Bee\xe2\x80\x99s)\r\nCollege, Cumberland; to \xe2\x80\x9cjapan,\xe2\x80\x9d in this Slang speech, is to ordain;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmortar board\xe2\x80\x9d is a square college cap; \xe2\x80\x9csim,\xe2\x80\x9d a student of a\r\nMethodistical turn\xe2\x80\x94in allusion to the Rev. Charles Simeon; \xe2\x80\x9csloggers,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nat Cambridge, refers to the second division of race-boats, known at\r\nOxford as \xe2\x80\x9ctorpids;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csport\xe2\x80\x9d is to show or exhibit; \xe2\x80\x9ctrotter\xe2\x80\x9d is the\r\njocose term for a tailor\xe2\x80\x99s man who goes round for orders; and \xe2\x80\x9ctufts\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nare privileged students who dine with the \xe2\x80\x9cdons,\xe2\x80\x9d and are distinguished\r\nby golden tufts, or tassels, in their caps. Hence we get the world-wide\r\nSlang term \xe2\x80\x9ctuft-hunter,\xe2\x80\x9d one whose pride it is to be acquainted with\r\nscions of the nobility\xe2\x80\x94a sycophantic race unfortunately not confined\r\nto any particular place or climate, nor peculiar to any age or either\r\nsex. There are many terms in use at Oxford not known at Cambridge; and\r\nsuch Slang names as \xe2\x80\x9ccoach,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgulf,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9charry-soph,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpoker,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpost-mortem,\xe2\x80\x9d common enough at Cambridge, are seldom or never heard\r\nat the great sister University. For numerous other examples of college\r\nSlang the reader is referred to the Dictionary.\r\n\r\nReligious Slang, strange as the compound may appear, exists with other\r\ndescriptions of vulgar speech at the present day. _Punch_, in one of\r\nthose half-humorous, half-serious articles, once so characteristic of\r\nthe wits engaged on that paper, who were, as a rule, fond of lecturing\r\nany national abuse or popular folly, remarked\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSlang has long since\r\npenetrated into the Forum, and now we meet it in the Senate, and even\r\nthe pulpit itself is no longer free from its intrusion.\xe2\x80\x9d There is no\r\nwish here, for one moment, to infer that the practice is general. On the\r\ncontrary, and in justice to the clergy, it must be said that the\r\nprincipal disseminators of pure English throughout the country are the\r\nministers of our Established Church. Yet it cannot be denied that a\r\ngreat deal of Slang phraseology and expressive vulgarism have gradually\r\ncrept into the very pulpits which should give forth as pure speech as\r\ndoctrine. This is an error which, however, has only to be noticed, to be\r\ncured.\r\n\r\nDean Conybeare, in his able \xe2\x80\x9cEssay on Church Parties,\xe2\x80\x9d[48] has noticed\r\nthis addition of Slang to our pulpit speech. As stated in his Essay, the\r\npractice appears to confine itself mainly to the exaggerated forms of\r\nthe High and Low Church\xe2\x80\x94the Tractarians and the \xe2\x80\x9cRecordites.\xe2\x80\x9d[49] By\r\nway of illustration, the Dean cites the evening parties, or social\r\nmeetings, common amongst the wealthier lay members of the Recordite\r\nchurches, where the principal topics discussed\xe2\x80\x94one or more favourite\r\nclergymen being present in a quasi-official manner\xe2\x80\x94are \xe2\x80\x9cthe merits and\r\ndemerits of different preachers, the approaching restoration of the\r\nJews, the date of the Millennium, the progress of the \xe2\x80\x98Tractarian\r\nheresy,\xe2\x80\x99 and the anticipated \xe2\x80\x98perversion\xe2\x80\x99 of High Church neighbours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThese subjects are canvassed in a dialect differing considerably from\r\nEnglish, as the word is generally understood. The terms \xe2\x80\x9cfaithful,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctainted,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cacceptable,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdecided,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clegal,\xe2\x80\x9d and many others,\r\nare used in a sense different from that given to any of them by the\r\nlexicographers. We hear that Mr. A. has been more \xe2\x80\x9cowned\xe2\x80\x9d than Mr. B.;\r\nand that Mr. C. has more \xe2\x80\x9cseals\xe2\x80\x9d[50] than Mr. D. Again, the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgracious\xe2\x80\x9d is invested with a meaning as extensive as that attached by\r\nyoung ladies to nice. Thus, we hear of a \xe2\x80\x9cgracious sermon,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cgracious\r\nmeeting,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cgracious child,\xe2\x80\x9d and even a \xe2\x80\x9cgracious whipping.\xe2\x80\x9d The word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdark\xe2\x80\x9d has also a new and peculiar usage. It is applied to every person,\r\nbook, or place not impregnated with Recordite principles. A ludicrous\r\nmisunderstanding resulting from this phraseology is on record (this is\r\nnot a joke). \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said A. to B., \xe2\x80\x9cby telling me that\r\n---- was such a very \xe2\x80\x98dark\xe2\x80\x99 village? I rode over there to-day, and found\r\nthe street particularly broad and cheerful, and there is not a tree in\r\nthe place.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe gospel is not preached there,\xe2\x80\x9d was B\xe2\x80\x99s. laconic reply.\r\nThe conclusion of one of these singular evening parties is generally\r\nmarked by an \xe2\x80\x9cexposition\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an unseasonable sermon of nearly one hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nduration, circumscribed by no text, and delivered from the table by one\r\nof the clerical visitors with a view to \xe2\x80\x9cimprove the occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nsame term, \xe2\x80\x9cimprove the occasion,\xe2\x80\x9d is of Slang slangy, and is so mouthed\r\nby Stigginses and Chadbands, and their followers, that it has become\r\npeculiarly objectionable to persons of broad views. In the Essay to\r\nwhich reference has been made, the religious Slang terms for the two\r\ngreat divisions of the Established Church receive some explanation. The\r\nold-fashioned High Church party\xe2\x80\x94rich and \xe2\x80\x9cstagnant,\xe2\x80\x9d noted for its\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csluggish mediocrity, hatred of zeal, dread of innovation, abuse of\r\nDissent, blundering and languid utterance\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is called the \xe2\x80\x9chigh and\r\ndry;\xe2\x80\x9d whilst the opposing division, known as the Low Church\xe2\x80\x94equally\r\nstagnant with the former, but poorer, and more lazily inclined (from\r\nabsence of education) towards Dissent\xe2\x80\x94receives the nickname of the \xe2\x80\x9clow\r\nand slow.\xe2\x80\x9d These terms are among persons learned in the distinctions\r\nshortened, in ordinary conversation, to the \xe2\x80\x9cdry\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cslow.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nBroad Church, or moderate division, is often spoken of as the \xe2\x80\x9cbroad\r\nand shallow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat can be more objectionable than the irreverent and offensive manner\r\nin which many Dissenting ministers continually pronounce the names of\r\nthe Deity\xe2\x80\x94God and Lord? God, instead of pronouncing in the plain and\r\nbeautiful simple old English way, \xe2\x80\x9cG\xe2\x80\x91o\xe2\x80\x91d,\xe2\x80\x9d they drawl out into \xe2\x80\x9cGorde\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9cGaude;\xe2\x80\x9d and Lord, instead of speaking in the proper way, they\r\ndesecrate into \xe2\x80\x9cLoard\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cLoerd,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94lingering on the _u_, or the _r_, as\r\nthe case may be, until an honest hearer feels disgusted, and almost\r\ninclined to run the gauntlet of beadles and deacons, and pull the vulgar\r\npreacher from his pulpit. This is, though a Christian impulse, hardly in\r\naccordance with our modern times and tolerant habits. Many young\r\npreachers strive hard to acquire this peculiar pronunciation, in\r\nimitation of the older ministers. What, then, can more properly be\r\ncalled Slang, or, indeed, the most objectionable of Slang, than this\r\nstudious endeavour to pronounce the most sacred names in a uniformly\r\nvulgar and unbecoming manner? If the old-fashioned preacher whistled\r\nCant through his nose, the modern vulgar reverend whines Slang from the\r\nmore natural organ. These vagaries of speech will, perhaps, by an\r\napologist, be termed \xe2\x80\x9cpulpit peculiarities,\xe2\x80\x9d and the writer may be\r\nimpugned for having dared to intermeddle with a subject that is or\r\nshould be removed from his criticisms. Honesty of purpose and evident\r\ntruthfulness of remark will, however, overcome the most virulent\r\nopposition. The terms used by the mob towards the Church, however\r\nilliberal and satirically vulgar, are fairly within the province of an\r\ninquiry such as the present. A clergyman, in vulgar language, is spoken\r\nof as a \xe2\x80\x9cchoker,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9ccushion-thumper,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cdominie,\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cearwig,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgospel-grinder,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cgrey-coat parson;\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cspouter,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cwhite-choker,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor a \xe2\x80\x9cwarming-pan rector,\xe2\x80\x9d if he only holds the living _pro tempore_. If\r\nhe is a lessee of the great tithes, \xe2\x80\x9cone in ten;\xe2\x80\x9d or if spoken of by an\r\nAnglo-Indian, a \xe2\x80\x9crook.\xe2\x80\x9d If a Tractarian, his outer garment is rudely\r\nspoken of as a \xe2\x80\x9cpygostole,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cM. B. (mark of the beast) coat.\xe2\x80\x9d His\r\nprofession is termed \xe2\x80\x9cthe cloth\xe2\x80\x9d (this item of Slang has been already\r\nreferred to), and his practice is called \xe2\x80\x9ctub-thumping.\xe2\x80\x9d This latter\r\nterm has of late years been almost peculiarly confined to itinerant\r\npreachers. Should he belong to the Dissenting body, he is probably\r\nstyled a \xe2\x80\x9cpantiler,\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cpsalm smiter,\xe2\x80\x9d or perhaps, a \xe2\x80\x9cswaddler.\xe2\x80\x9d[51]\r\nHis chapel, too, is spoken of as a \xe2\x80\x9cschism shop.\xe2\x80\x9d A Roman Catholic is\r\ncoarsely named a \xe2\x80\x9cbrisket-beater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParticular as lawyers generally are about the meanings of words, they\r\nhave not prevented an unauthorized phraseology from arising, which may\r\nbe termed legal Slang. So forcibly did this truth impress a late writer,\r\nthat he wrote in a popular journal, \xe2\x80\x9cYou may hear Slang every day in\r\nterm from barristers in their robes, at every mess-table, at every\r\nbar-mess, at every college commons, and in every club dining-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSwift, in his _Art of Polite Conversation_ (p. 15), published a century\r\nand a half ago, states that \xe2\x80\x9cvardi\xe2\x80\x9d was the Slang in his time for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cverdict.\xe2\x80\x9d A few of the most common and well-known terms used out of\r\ndoors, with reference to legal matters, are \xe2\x80\x9ccook,\xe2\x80\x9d to hash or make up a\r\nbalance-sheet; \xe2\x80\x9cdipped,\xe2\x80\x9d mortgaged; \xe2\x80\x9cdun\xe2\x80\x9d (from a famous writ or\r\nprocess-server named Dunn), to solicit payment; \xe2\x80\x9cfullied,\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9cfully\r\ncommitted for trial;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cland shark,\xe2\x80\x9d a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s definition of a lawyer;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9climb of the law,\xe2\x80\x9d a milder term for the same \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmonkey\r\nwith a long tail,\xe2\x80\x9d a mortgage; \xe2\x80\x9cmouthpiece,\xe2\x80\x9d the thief\xe2\x80\x99s term for his\r\ncounsel; \xe2\x80\x9cto run through the ring,\xe2\x80\x9d to take advantage of the Insolvency\r\nAct; \xe2\x80\x9csmash,\xe2\x80\x9d to become bankrupt; \xe2\x80\x9csnipe,\xe2\x80\x9d an attorney with a long bill;\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cwhitewash,\xe2\x80\x9d to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act. Comparatively\r\nrecent legislation has rendered many of these terms obsolete, and \xe2\x80\x9cin\r\nliquidation\xe2\x80\x9d is now the most ominous sound a creditor can hear. Lawyers,\r\nfrom their connexion with the police courts, and transactions with\r\npersons in every grade of society, have ample opportunities for\r\nacquiring street Slang, of which, in cross-questioning and wrangling,\r\nthey frequently avail themselves.\r\n\r\nIt has been said there exists a literary Slang, or the Slang of\r\nCriticism\xe2\x80\x94dramatic, artistic, and scientific. This is composed of such\r\nwords as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xa6sthetic,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctranscendental,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe harmonies,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe unities,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmyth;\xe2\x80\x9d such phrases as \xe2\x80\x9can exquisite _morceau_ on the big drum,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cscholarlike rendering of John the Baptist\xe2\x80\x99s great toe,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ckeeping\r\nharmony,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmiddle distance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca\xc3\xabrial perspective,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdelicate handling,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnervous chiaroscuro,\xe2\x80\x9d and the like. It is easy to find fault with this\r\nsystem of doing work, whilst it is not easy to discover another at once\r\nso easily understood by educated readers, and so satisfactory to artists\r\nthemselves. Discretion must, of course, always be used, in fact always\r\nis used by the best writers, with regard to the quantity of technical\r\nSlang an article will hold comfortably. Overdone mannerism is always a\r\nmistake, and generally defeats its own end. Properly used, these\r\ntechnicalities are allowable as the generous inflections and bendings of\r\na bountiful language, for the purpose of expressing fresh phases of\r\nthought, and ideas not yet provided with representative words.[52]\r\n_Punch_ often employs a Slang term to give point to a joke, or humour to\r\na line of satire. In his best day he gave an original etymology of the\r\nschoolboy-ism \xe2\x80\x9cslog.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSlog,\xe2\x80\x9d said the classical and then clever\r\n_Punch_, is derived from the Greek word \xe2\x80\x9cslogo,\xe2\x80\x9d to baste, to wallop, to\r\nslaughter. To show his partiality to the subject, he once amused his\r\nreaders with two columns on Slang and Sanscrit, from which the following\r\nis taken:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe allegory which pervades the conversation of all Eastern nations\r\n    is the foundation of Western Slang; and the increased number of\r\n    students of the Oriental languages, especially since Sanscrit and\r\n    Arabic have been made subjects for the Indian Civil Service\r\n    examinations, may have contributed to supply the English language\r\n    with a large portion of its new dialect. While, however, the spirit\r\n    of allegory comes from the East, there is so great a difference\r\n    between the brevity of Western expression and the more cumbrous\r\n    diction of the Oriental, that the origin of a phrase becomes\r\n    difficult to trace. Thus, for instance, whilst the Turkish merchant\r\n    might address his friend somewhat as follows\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98That which seems good\r\n    to my father is to his servant as the perfumed breath of the west\r\n    wind in the calm night of the Arabian summer;\xe2\x80\x99 the Western\r\n    negotiator observes more briefly, \xe2\x80\x98all serene!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d[53]\r\n\r\nBut the vulgar term, \xe2\x80\x9cbrick,\xe2\x80\x9d _Punch_ remarks in illustration,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cmust be allowed to be an exception, its Greek derivation being\r\n    universally admitted, corresponding so exactly as it does in its\r\n    rectangular form and compactness to the perfection of manhood,\r\n    according to the views of Plato and Simonides; but any deviation\r\n    from the simple expression, in which locality is indicated\xe2\x80\x94as, for\r\n    instance, \xe2\x80\x98a genuine Bath\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94decidedly breathes the Oriental spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is singular that what _Punch_ says unwittingly and in humour\r\nrespecting the Slang expression \xe2\x80\x9cbosh,\xe2\x80\x9d should be quite true. \xe2\x80\x9cBosh,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nremarks _Punch_, after speaking of it as belonging to the stock of words\r\npilfered from the Turks, \xe2\x80\x9cis one whose innate force and beauty the\r\nslangographer is reluctantly compelled to admit. It is the only word\r\nwhich seems a proper appellation for a great deal which we are obliged\r\nto hear and to read every day of our life.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBosh,\xe2\x80\x9d nonsense or\r\nstupidity, is derived from the Gipsy and the Persian. The universality\r\nof Slang is proved by its continual use in the pages of _Punch_. Who\r\never thinks, unless belonging to a past generation, of asking a friend\r\nto explain the stray vulgar words employed by the _London Charivari_?\r\nSome of the jokes, though, might nowadays be accompanied by explanatory\r\nnotes, in similar style to that adopted by youthful artists who write \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nman,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca horse,\xe2\x80\x9d &c., when rather uncertain as to whether or not their\r\nefforts will meet with due appreciation.\r\n\r\nThe _Athen\xc3\xa6um_, the _Saturday Review_, and other kindred \xe2\x80\x9cweeklies,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\noften indulge in Slang words when force of expression or a little humour\r\nis desired, or when the various writers wish to say something which is\r\nbetter said in Slang, or so-called vulgar speech, than in the authorized\r\nlanguage. Bartlett, the compiler of the _Dictionary of Americanisms_,\r\ncontinually cites the _Athen\xc3\xa6um_ as using Slang and vulgar expressions;\r\nbut the magazine the American refers to is not the literary journal of\r\nthe present day,\xe2\x80\x94it was a smaller, and now defunct, \xe2\x80\x9cweekly.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\npresent possessor of the classic title is, though, by no means\r\nbehindhand in its devotion to colloquialisms. Many other highly\r\nrespectable journals often use Slang words and phrases. The _Times_ (or,\r\nin Slang, the \xe2\x80\x9cThunderer\xe2\x80\x9d) frequently employs unauthorized terms; and,\r\nfollowing a \xe2\x80\x9cleader\xe2\x80\x9d[54] of the purest and most eloquent composition, may\r\nsometimes be seen another \xe2\x80\x9carticle\xe2\x80\x9d[54] on a totally different subject,\r\ncontaining, perhaps, a score or more of exceedingly questionable words.\r\nAmong the words and phrases which may be included under the head of\r\nLiterary Slang are, \xe2\x80\x9cbalaam,\xe2\x80\x9d matter kept constantly in type about\r\nmonstrous productions of nature, to fill up spaces in newspapers;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbalaam-box,\xe2\x80\x9d the term given in _Blackwood_ to the repository for\r\nrejected articles; and \xe2\x80\x9cslate,\xe2\x80\x9d to pelt with abuse, or \xe2\x80\x9ccut up\xe2\x80\x9d in a\r\nreview. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the fellow to slate a piece\xe2\x80\x9d is often said of dramatic\r\ncritics, especially of those who through youth, inexperience, and the\r\nprocess of unnatural selection which causes them to be critics, imagine\r\nthat to abuse all that is above their comprehension is to properly\r\nexercise the critical faculty. This is, however, dangerous ground. The\r\nSlang names given to newspapers are curious;\xe2\x80\x94thus, the _Morning\r\nAdvertiser_ is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cTap-tub,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tizer,\xe2\x80\x9d and was until\r\nrecently the \xe2\x80\x9cGin and Gospel Gazette.\xe2\x80\x9d The _Morning Post_ has obtained\r\nthe suggestive sobriquet of \xe2\x80\x9cJeames;\xe2\x80\x9d whilst the _Morning Herald_ was\r\nlong caricatured as \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Harris,\xe2\x80\x9d and the _Standard_ as \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nGamp.\xe2\x80\x9d[55]\r\n\r\nThe _Stage_, of course, has its Slang\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cboth before and behind the\r\ncurtain,\xe2\x80\x9d as a journalist remarks. The stage-manager is familiarly\r\ntermed \xe2\x80\x9cdaddy;\xe2\x80\x9d and an actor by profession, or a \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional,\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\ncalled a \xe2\x80\x9cpro.\xe2\x80\x9d It is amusing at times to hear a young actor\xe2\x80\x94who struts\r\nabout padded with copies of all newspapers that have mentioned his\r\nname\xe2\x80\x94talking, in a mixed company, of the stage as _the_ profession.\r\nThis is after all but natural, for to him \xe2\x80\x9call the world\xe2\x80\x99s a stage.\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\nman who is occasionally hired at a trifling remuneration to come upon\r\nthe stage as one of a crowd, or when a number of actors are wanted to\r\ngive effect, is named a \xe2\x80\x9csupe,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an abbreviation of \xe2\x80\x9csupernumerary.\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csurf\xe2\x80\x9d is a third-rate actor, who frequently pursues another calling;\r\nand the band, or orchestra between the pit and the stage, is generally\r\nspoken of as the \xe2\x80\x9cmenagerie.\xe2\x80\x9d A \xe2\x80\x9cben\xe2\x80\x9d is a benefit; and \xe2\x80\x9csal\xe2\x80\x9d is the\r\nSlang abbreviation of \xe2\x80\x9csalary.\xe2\x80\x9d Should no money be forthcoming on the\r\nSaturday night, it is said that the \xe2\x80\x9cghost doesn\xe2\x80\x99t walk;\xe2\x80\x9d or else the\r\nstatement goes abroad that there is \xe2\x80\x9cno treasury,\xe2\x80\x9d as though the coffers\r\nthemselves had departed. The travelling or provincial theatricals, who\r\nperform in any large room that can be rented in a country village, are\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cbarn-stormers.\xe2\x80\x9d A \xe2\x80\x9clength\xe2\x80\x9d is forty-two lines of any dramatic\r\ncomposition; and a \xe2\x80\x9crun\xe2\x80\x9d is the continuous term of a piece\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperformance. A \xe2\x80\x9csaddle\xe2\x80\x9d is the additional charge made by a manager to an\r\nactor or actress upon his or her benefit night. To \xe2\x80\x9cmug up\xe2\x80\x9d is to paint\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s face, or arrange the person, to represent a particular character;\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9ccorpse,\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cstick,\xe2\x80\x9d is to balk, or put the other actors out in\r\ntheir parts by forgetting yours. A performance is spoken of as either a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgooser\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cscreamer,\xe2\x80\x9d should it be a failure or a great success;\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nthe latter, it is not infrequently termed a \xe2\x80\x9chit.\xe2\x80\x9d To \xe2\x80\x9cgoose\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nperformance is to hiss it; and continued \xe2\x80\x9cgoosing\xe2\x80\x9d generally ends, or\r\ndid end before managers refused to accept the verdict of audiences, in\r\nthe play or the players being \xe2\x80\x9cdamned.\xe2\x80\x9d To \xe2\x80\x9cstar it\xe2\x80\x9d is to perform as\r\nthe centre of attraction, with your name in large type, and none but\r\nsubordinates and indifferent actors in the same performance. The\r\nexpressive term \xe2\x80\x9cclap-trap,\xe2\x80\x9d high-sounding nonsense, is nothing but an\r\nancient theatrical term, and signified a \xe2\x80\x9ctrap\xe2\x80\x9d to catch a \xe2\x80\x9cclap\xe2\x80\x9d by way\r\nof applause. \xe2\x80\x9cUp amongst the \xe2\x80\x98gods,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d refers to being among the\r\nspectators in the gallery,\xe2\x80\x94termed in French Slang \xe2\x80\x9cparadis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere exists, too, in the great territory of vulgar speech what may not\r\ninappropriately be termed Civic Slang. It consists of mercantile and\r\nStock Exchange terms, and the Slang of good living and wealth. A turkey\r\nhung with sausages is facetiously styled an \xe2\x80\x9calderman in chains,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nterm which has spread from the City and become general; and a\r\nhalf-crown, perhaps from its rotundity, is often termed an \xe2\x80\x9calderman.\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbear\xe2\x80\x9d is a speculator on the Exchange; and a \xe2\x80\x9cbull,\xe2\x80\x9d although of an\r\nopposite order, follows a like profession. There is something very\r\nhumorous and applicable in the Slang term \xe2\x80\x9clame duck,\xe2\x80\x9d a defaulter in\r\nstock-jobbing speculations. The allusion to his \xe2\x80\x9cwaddling out of the\r\nAlley,\xe2\x80\x9d as they say, is excellent. \xe2\x80\x9cBreaking shins,\xe2\x80\x9d in City Slang, is\r\nborrowing money; a rotten or unsound scheme is spoken of as \xe2\x80\x9cfishy;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crigging the market\xe2\x80\x9d means playing tricks with it; and \xe2\x80\x9cstag\xe2\x80\x9d was a\r\ncommon term during the railway mania for a speculator without capital, a\r\nseller of \xe2\x80\x9cscrip\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cDiddlesex Junction\xe2\x80\x9d and other equally safe lines.\r\nAt Tattersall\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cmonkey\xe2\x80\x9d is 500_l._, and in the City a \xe2\x80\x9cplum\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\n100,000_l._, and a \xe2\x80\x9cmarygold\xe2\x80\x9d is one million sterling. But before\r\nproceeding further in a sketch of the different kinds of Slang, it may\r\nbe as well to speak here of the extraordinary number of Cant and Slang\r\nterms in use to represent money\xe2\x80\x94from farthings to bank-notes the value\r\nof fortunes. Her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s coin, collectively or in the piece, is known\r\nby more than one hundred and thirty distinct Slang words, from the\r\nhumble \xe2\x80\x9cbrown\xe2\x80\x9d (a halfpenny) to \xe2\x80\x9cflimsies,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9clong-tailed ones\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(bank-notes).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney,\xe2\x80\x9d it has been well remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cthe bare, simple word itself, has a\r\nsonorous, significant ring in its sound,\xe2\x80\x9d and might have sufficed, one\r\nwould have imagined, for all ordinary purposes, excepting, of course,\r\nthose demanded by direct reference to specific sums. But a vulgar or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfast\xe2\x80\x9d society has thought differently; and so we have the Slang\r\nsynonyms\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbeans,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cblunt\xe2\x80\x9d (_i.e._, specie,\xe2\x80\x94not soft or rags,\r\nbank-notes), \xe2\x80\x9cbrads,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbrass,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbustle,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccoppers\xe2\x80\x9d (copper money, or\r\nmixed pence), \xe2\x80\x9cchink,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cchinkers,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cchips,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccorks,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdibbs,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdinarly,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdimmock,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdust,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfeathers,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgent\xe2\x80\x9d (silver,\xe2\x80\x94from argent), \xe2\x80\x9chaddock\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(a purse of money), \xe2\x80\x9chorse nails,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chuckster,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cloaver,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clour\xe2\x80\x9d (the\r\noldest Cant term for money), \xe2\x80\x9cmopusses,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cneedful,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnobbings\xe2\x80\x9d (money\r\ncollected in a hat by street-performers), \xe2\x80\x9cochre\xe2\x80\x9d (gold), \xe2\x80\x9cpewter,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpalm oil,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpieces,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cposh,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cqueen\xe2\x80\x99s pictures,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cquids,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crags\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(bank-notes), \xe2\x80\x9cready,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cready gilt,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9credge\xe2\x80\x9d (gold), \xe2\x80\x9crhino,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crowdy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cshiners\xe2\x80\x9d (sovereigns), \xe2\x80\x9cskin\xe2\x80\x9d (a purse of money), \xe2\x80\x9cstiff\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(checks, or bills of acceptance), \xe2\x80\x9cstuff,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cstumpy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctin\xe2\x80\x9d (silver),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwedge\xe2\x80\x9d (silver), and \xe2\x80\x9cyellow-boys\xe2\x80\x9d (sovereigns);\xe2\x80\x94just forty-three\r\nvulgar equivalents for the simple word money. So attentive is Slang\r\nspeech to financial matters, that there are seven terms for bad, or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbogus,\xe2\x80\x9d coin (as our friends the Americans call it): a \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d is a\r\ncounterfeit five-shilling piece; \xe2\x80\x9chalf a case\xe2\x80\x9d represents half that sum;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgrays\xe2\x80\x9d are halfpence made specially for unfair gambling purposes;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cqueer-soft\xe2\x80\x9d is counterfeit or lead coin; \xe2\x80\x9cschofel\xe2\x80\x9d refers to coated or\r\nspurious coin; \xe2\x80\x9csheen\xe2\x80\x9d is bad money of any description; and \xe2\x80\x9csinkers\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbears the same and not inappropriate meaning. \xe2\x80\x9cSnide\xe2\x80\x9d is now the generic\r\nterm for all bad money, whether coined or in notes; and \xe2\x80\x9csnide-pitching\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9cschoful-tossing\xe2\x80\x9d is the term in use among the professors of that\r\npursuit for what is more generally known as \xe2\x80\x9csmashing.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFlying the\r\nkite,\xe2\x80\x9d or obtaining money on bills and promissory-notes, is closely\r\nconnected with the allegorical expression of \xe2\x80\x9craising the wind,\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nis a well-known phrase for procuring money by immediate sale, pledging,\r\nor by a forced loan.

Any term representing this amount\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctakes in two,\xe2\x80\x9d and represents the half-crown by the addition of the\r\nusual prefix.

Bank-notes are\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cflimsies,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clong-tailed ones,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csoft.\xe2\x80\x9d A \xe2\x80\x9cfin,\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cfinnuf,\xe2\x80\x9d is a\r\nfive-pound note. Twenty-five pounds is a \xe2\x80\x9cpony,\xe2\x80\x9d and a hundred a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccentury.\xe2\x80\x9d One hundred pounds (or any other \xe2\x80\x9cround sum\xe2\x80\x9d), quietly handed\r\nover as payment for services performed, is curiously termed \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98cool\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhundred.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus ends, with several necessary omissions, this long list of\r\nSlang terms for the coins of the realm which, for copiousness, it is not\r\ntoo much to say, is not equalled by any other vulgar or unauthorized\r\nlanguage in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of many of these Slang names is remarkable. \xe2\x80\x9cWinn\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nvulgar term for a penny in the days of Queen Elizabeth; and \xe2\x80\x9ctester,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nsixpence (formerly a shilling), was the correct name in the days of\r\nHenry VIII. The reader, too, will have remarked the frequency of\r\nanimals\xe2\x80\x99 names as Slang terms for money. Little, as a modern writer has\r\nremarked, do the persons using these phrases know of their remote and\r\nsomewhat classical origin, which may, indeed, be traced to a period\r\nanterior to that when monarchs monopolized the surface of coined money\r\nwith their own images and superscriptions. They are identical with the\r\nvery name of money among the early Romans, which was _pecunia_, from\r\n_pecus_, a flock. The collections of coin-dealers amply show that the\r\nfigure of a \xe2\x80\x9chog\xe2\x80\x9d was anciently placed on a small silver coin; and that\r\nthat of a \xe2\x80\x9cbull\xe2\x80\x9d decorated larger ones of the same metal. These coins\r\nwere frequently deeply crossed on the reverse; this was for the\r\nconvenience of easily breaking them into two or more pieces, should the\r\nbargain for which they were employed require it, and the parties making\r\nit had no smaller change handy to complete the transaction. Thus we find\r\nthat the \xe2\x80\x9chalf bull\xe2\x80\x9d of the itinerant street-seller, or \xe2\x80\x9ctraveller,\xe2\x80\x9d so\r\nfar from being a phrase of modern invention, as is generally supposed,\r\nis in point of fact referable to an era extremely remote. This remark\r\nwill safely apply to most descriptions of money; and it must not be\r\nforgotten that farthing is but a corruption of fourthing, or, literally,\r\nfourth part of a penny. The representative coin of the realm was often\r\nin olden times made to break up,\xe2\x80\x94but this by the way. It is a reminder,\r\nhowever, that the word \xe2\x80\x9csmash,\xe2\x80\x9d as used by the classes that speak Slang\r\nfrom motives other than those of affectation, has nothing whatever to do\r\nwith base coin, as is generally supposed. It simply means to give\r\nchange. Thus:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCan you smash a thick \xe2\x80\x99un for me?\xe2\x80\x9d means simply, \xe2\x80\x9cCan\r\nyou give me change for a sovereign?\xe2\x80\x9d We learn from Erizzo, in his\r\n_Discorso_, a further illustration of the proverb \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is nothing\r\nnew under the sun;\xe2\x80\x9d for he says that the Roman boys at the time of\r\nHadrian tossed up their coppers and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cHead or ship;\xe2\x80\x9d of which\r\ntradition our \xe2\x80\x9cheads or tails,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cman or woman,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca tanner I heads\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d is certainly a less refined version. We thence gather, however,\r\nthat the prow of a vessel would appear to have been the more ordinary\r\ndevice of the reverse of the brass coin of that ancient period. There\r\nare many other Cant words directly from a classic source, as will be\r\nseen in the dictionary.\r\n\r\nShopkeepers\xe2\x80\x99 Slang is perhaps the most offensive of all Slang, though\r\nthis is not intended to imply that shopkeepers are perhaps the most\r\noffensive of people. This kind of Slang is not a casual eyesore, as\r\nnewspaper Slang, neither is it an occasional discomfort to the ear, as\r\nin the case of some vulgar byword of the street; but it is a perpetual\r\nnuisance, and stares you in the face on tradesmen\xe2\x80\x99s invoices, on labels\r\nin the shop-windows, and placards on the hoardings, in posters against\r\nthe house next to your own\xe2\x80\x94if it happen to be empty for a few\r\nweeks\xe2\x80\x94and in bills thrust into your hand, as you peaceably walk through\r\nthe streets. Under your door, and down your area, Slang handbills are\r\ndropped by some \xe2\x80\x9cpushing\xe2\x80\x9d tradesman; and for the thousandth time you are\r\ncalled upon to learn that an \xe2\x80\x9calarming sacrifice\xe2\x80\x9d is taking place in the\r\nnext street; that prices are \xe2\x80\x9cdown again;\xe2\x80\x9d that, in consequence of some\r\nother tradesman not \xe2\x80\x9cdriving a roaring trade,\xe2\x80\x9d being in fact, \xe2\x80\x9csold up,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand for the time being a resident in \xe2\x80\x9cBurdon\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel\xe2\x80\x9d (Whitecross-Street\r\nPrison), the \xe2\x80\x9cpushing\xe2\x80\x9d tradesman wishes to sell out at \xe2\x80\x9cawfully low\r\nprices,\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind patrons, and numerous customers,\xe2\x80\x9d &c. &c., \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nhave on every occasion,\xe2\x80\x9d &c. &c. These are, though, very venial\r\noffenders compared with those ghouls, the advertising undertakers, who\r\nemploy boys, loaded with ghastly little books, to follow up the parish\r\ndoctor, and leave their horrible wares wherever he calls. But what can\r\nbe expected of ignorant undertakers when a London newspaper of large\r\ncirculation actually takes out the death records from the _Times_, and\r\nsends a circular to each address therein, informing the bereaved persons\r\nthat the \xe2\x80\x9c----\xe2\x80\x9d charges so much per line for similar notices, and that\r\nits circulation is most extensive? Surely the typical \xe2\x80\x9cdeath-hunter,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhardened though he may be, is hardly down to that level. In shopkeeping\r\nSlang any occupation or calling is termed a \xe2\x80\x9cline,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94thus, the \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\r\nline.\xe2\x80\x9d A tailor usurps to himself a good deal of Slang. Amongst\r\noperatives he is called a \xe2\x80\x9csnip,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9csteel-bar driver,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9ccabbage\r\ncontractor,\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cgoose persuader;\xe2\x80\x9d by the world, a \xe2\x80\x9cninth part of a\r\nman;\xe2\x80\x9d and by the young collegian, or \xe2\x80\x9cfast\xe2\x80\x9d man, a \xe2\x80\x9csufferer.\xe2\x80\x9d If he\r\ntakes army contracts, it is \xe2\x80\x9csank work;\xe2\x80\x9d if he is a \xe2\x80\x9cslop\xe2\x80\x9d tailor, he is\r\na \xe2\x80\x9cspringer up,\xe2\x80\x9d and his garments are \xe2\x80\x9cblown together.\xe2\x80\x9d Perquisites with\r\nhim are \xe2\x80\x9cspiffs,\xe2\x80\x9d and remnants of cloth \xe2\x80\x9cpeaking, or cabbage.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nper-centage he allows to his assistants (or \xe2\x80\x9ccounter jumpers\xe2\x80\x9d) on the\r\nsale of old-fashioned articles is termed \xe2\x80\x9ctinge.\xe2\x80\x9d If he pays his workmen\r\nin goods, or gives them tickets upon other tradesmen, with whom he\r\nshares the profit, he is soon known as a \xe2\x80\x9ctommy master.\xe2\x80\x9d If his business\r\nsucceeds, it \xe2\x80\x9ctakes;\xe2\x80\x9d if neglected, it becomes \xe2\x80\x9cshaky,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgoes to\r\npot;\xe2\x80\x9d if he is deceived by a debtor (a by no means unusual\r\ncircumstance), he is \xe2\x80\x9clet in,\xe2\x80\x9d or, as it is sometimes varied, \xe2\x80\x9ctaken\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d It need scarcely be remarked that any credit he may give is termed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOperatives\xe2\x80\x99 or workmen\xe2\x80\x99s Slang, in quality, is but slightly removed from\r\ntradesmen\xe2\x80\x99s Slang. When belonging to the same shop or factory, they\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgraft\xe2\x80\x9d there, and are \xe2\x80\x9cbrother chips.\xe2\x80\x9d Among printers the favourite\r\nterm is \xe2\x80\x9ccomps,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not compositors, though the same contraction is used\r\nfor that word,\xe2\x80\x94but companions, whether so in actual fact, or as members\r\nof the same \xe2\x80\x9ccompanionship.\xe2\x80\x9d A companionship is the number of men\r\nengaged on any one work, and this is in turn reduced to \xe2\x80\x9cship:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsometimes it is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99stab ship,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, paid by the week, therefore on\r\nthe establishment; sometimes it is \xe2\x80\x9con the piece,\xe2\x80\x9d and anyhow it is an\r\nextremely critical organization, so perhaps it would be better to\r\nbroaden the subject. Workmen generally dine at \xe2\x80\x9cslap-bang shops,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nare often paid at \xe2\x80\x9ctommy shops.\xe2\x80\x9d At the nearest \xe2\x80\x9cpub,\xe2\x80\x9d or public-house,\r\nthey generally have a \xe2\x80\x9cscore chalked up\xe2\x80\x9d against them, which has to be\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwiped off\xe2\x80\x9d regularly on the Saturday night. This is often known as a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clight.\xe2\x80\x9d When credit is bad the \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d is said to be out. When out of\r\nwork, they describe themselves as being \xe2\x80\x9cout of collar.\xe2\x80\x9d They term each\r\nother \xe2\x80\x9cflints\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdungs,\xe2\x80\x9d if they are \xe2\x80\x9csociety\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnon-society\xe2\x80\x9d men.\r\nTheir salary is a \xe2\x80\x9cscrew,\xe2\x80\x9d and to be discharged is to \xe2\x80\x9cget the sack,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nvaried by the expression \xe2\x80\x9cget the bullet,\xe2\x80\x9d the connexion of which with\r\ndischarge is obvious, as the small lecturers\xe2\x80\x94those at the Polytechnic\r\nfor instance\xe2\x80\x94say, to the meanest capacity.

The same may be said of \xe2\x80\x9cstrike me lucky,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnever trust\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cso help me Davy;\xe2\x80\x9d the latter being evidently derived from the\r\ntruer old phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take my Davy on\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_i.e._, my affidavit,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDavy,\xe2\x80\x9d and sometimes \xe2\x80\x9cAlfred Davy,\xe2\x80\x9d being a corruption of that word.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Golly,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGol darn it,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cso help\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94generally pronounced \xe2\x80\x9cselp\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cswelp\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cme Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d are evident shams for profane oaths. \xe2\x80\x9cTarnation\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nbut a softening of damnation; and \xe2\x80\x9cod,\xe2\x80\x9d whether used in \xe2\x80\x9cod drat it,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cod\xe2\x80\x99s blood,\xe2\x80\x9d is but an apology for the name of the Deity. \xe2\x80\x9cMarry,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nterm of asseveration in common use, was originally, in Popish times, a\r\nmode of swearing by the Virgin Mary;\xe2\x80\x94so also \xe2\x80\x9cmarrow-bones,\xe2\x80\x9d for the\r\nknees. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him down upon his marrow-bones,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_i.e._, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\nhim bend his knees as he does to the Virgin Mary. The Irish phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cBad\r\nscran to yer!\xe2\x80\x9d is equivalent to wishing a person bad food. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsniggered if you will,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m jiggered,\xe2\x80\x9d are other mild forms of\r\nswearing among men fearful of committing an open profanity, yet slily\r\nnibbling at the sin. Maybe, some day one of these adventurers will meet\r\nwith the object of his desires, and then when fairly \xe2\x80\x9cjiggered,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhatever it may ultimately turn out to be, it is to be hoped he will\r\nprove a fearful example to all persons with the will, but not the pluck,\r\nto swear fierce oaths. Both \xe2\x80\x9cdeuce\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdickens\xe2\x80\x9d are vulgar old\r\nsynonyms for the devil; and \xe2\x80\x9czounds\xe2\x80\x9d is an abbreviation of \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwounds,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a very ancient oath.\r\n\r\nIn a casual survey of the territory of Slang, it is curious to observe\r\nhow well represented are the familiar wants and failings of life. First,\r\nthere is money, with one hundred and odd Slang terms and synonyms; then\r\ncomes drink, from small beer to champagne; and next as a very natural\r\nsequence, intoxication, and fuddlement generally, with some half a\r\nhundred vulgar terms, graduating the scale of drunkenness, from a slight\r\ninebriation to the soaky state which leads to the gutter, sometimes to\r\nthe stretcher, the station-house, the fine, and, most terrible of all,\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9ccaution.\xe2\x80\x9d The Slang synonyms for mild intoxication are certainly\r\nvery choice,\xe2\x80\x94they are \xe2\x80\x9cbeery,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbemused,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cboozy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbosky,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbuffy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccorned,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfoggy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfou,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfresh,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chazy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9celevated,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ckisky,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clushy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmoony,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmuggy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmuzzy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cscrewed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cstewed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctight,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwiney.\xe2\x80\x9d A higher or more intense state of beastliness is represented by\r\nthe expressions, \xe2\x80\x9cpodgy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbeargered,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cblued,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccut,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprimed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clumpy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cploughed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmuddled,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cobfuscated,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cswipey,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthree sheets in\r\nthe wind,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctop-heavy.\xe2\x80\x9d But the climax of fuddlement is only\r\nobtained when the \xe2\x80\x9cdisguised\xe2\x80\x9d individual \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t see a hole in a ladder,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor when he is all \xe2\x80\x9cmops and brooms,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9coff his nut,\xe2\x80\x9d or with his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmain-brace well spliced,\xe2\x80\x9d or with the \xe2\x80\x9csun in his eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d or when he\r\nhas \xe2\x80\x9clapped the gutter,\xe2\x80\x9d and got the \xe2\x80\x9cgravel rash,\xe2\x80\x9d or is on the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cran-tan,\xe2\x80\x9d or on the \xe2\x80\x9cree-raw,\xe2\x80\x9d or when \xe2\x80\x9csewed up,\xe2\x80\x9d and regularly\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cscammered,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94then, and not till then, is he entitled, in vulgar\r\nsociety, to the title of \xe2\x80\x9clushington,\xe2\x80\x9d or recommended to \xe2\x80\x9cput in the\r\npin,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, the linch-pin, to keep his legs steady.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] An outgrowth of this latter peculiarity consisted in anyone with a\r\nhigh or prominent nose being, a few years back, called by the street\r\nboys \xe2\x80\x9cDuke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[33] This term, with a singular literal downrightness, which would be\r\nremarkable in any other people than the French, is translated by them as\r\nthe sect of _Trembleurs_.\r\n\r\n[34] Swift alludes to this term in his _Art of Polite Conversation_, p.\r\n14, 1738.\r\n\r\n[35] See _Notes and Queries_, vol. i. p. 185. 1850.\r\n\r\n[36] He afterwards kept a tavern at Wapping, mentioned by Pope in the\r\n_Dunciad_.\r\n\r\n[37] _Sportsman\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary_, 1825, p. 15.\r\n\r\n[38] This introduction was written in 1859, before the new edition of\r\n_Worcester_, and Nuttall\xe2\x80\x99s recent work, were published.\r\n\r\n[39] Introduction to Bee\xe2\x80\x99s _Sportsman\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary_, 1825.\r\n\r\n[40] The Gipsies use the word Slang as the Anglican synonym for Romany,\r\nthe Continental (or rather Spanish) term for the Cingari or Gipsy\r\ntongue. Crabb, who wrote the _Gipsies\xe2\x80\x99 Advocate_ in 1831, thus mentions\r\nthe word:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThis language [Gipsy] _called by themselves_ Slang, or\r\nGibberish, invented, as they think, by their forefathers for secret\r\npurposes, is not merely the language of one or a few of these wandering\r\ntribes, which are found in the European nations, but is adopted by the\r\nvast numbers who inhabit the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[41] The word Slang assumed various meanings amongst costermongers,\r\nbeggars, and vagabonds of all orders. It was, and is still, used to\r\nexpress \xe2\x80\x9ccheating by false weights,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca raree show,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cretiring by a back\r\ndoor,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca watch-chain,\xe2\x80\x9d their \xe2\x80\x9csecret language,\xe2\x80\x9d &c.\r\n\r\n[42] North, in his _Examen_, p. 574, says, \xe2\x80\x9cI may note that the rabble\r\nfirst changed their title, and were called the \xe2\x80\x9cmob\xe2\x80\x9d in the assemblies\r\nof this [Green Ribbon] club. It was their beasts of burden, and called\r\nfirst _mobile vulgus_, but fell naturally into the contraction of one\r\nsyllable, and ever since is become proper English.\xe2\x80\x9d In the same work, p.\r\n231, the disgraceful origin of SHAM is given.\r\n\r\n[43] I am afraid my predecessor was of a somewhat satirical turn of\r\nmind, or else he had peculiar notions of melody.\xe2\x80\x94ED.\r\n\r\n[44] This latter is, as I take it, an error, as the sign was originally\r\nintended to represent the king\xe2\x80\x99s head and cross guns, and may still be\r\nseen in parts of the country.\xe2\x80\x94ED.\r\n\r\n[45] Savez-vous cela?\xe2\x80\x94[I fancy this is from the Spanish _sabe_. The\r\nword is in great use in the Pacific States of America, and is obtained\r\nthrough constant intercourse with the original settlers.\xe2\x80\x94ED.]\r\n\r\n[46] At page 24 of a curious old Civil War tract, entitled, _The Oxonian\r\nAntippodes_, by I. B., Gent., 1644, the town is called Brummidgham, and\r\nthis was the general rendering in the printed literature of the\r\nseventeenth century.\xe2\x80\x94[This must have been the first known step towards\r\nthe present vulgar style of spelling, for properly the word is\r\nBromwich-ham, which has been corrupted into Brummagem, a term used to\r\nexpress worthless or inferior goods, from the spurious jewellery, plate,\r\n&c., manufactured there expressly for \xe2\x80\x9cduffers.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94ED.]\r\n\r\n[47] This was more especially an amusement with medical students,\r\nafter the modern Mohocks had discarded it. The students are now a\r\ncomparatively mild and quiet race, with very little of the style of a\r\ngeneration ago about them.\r\n\r\n[48] _Edinburgh Review_, October, 1853.\r\n\r\n[49] A term derived from the _Record_ newspaper, the exponent of this\r\nsingular section of the Low, or so-called Evangelical Church.\r\n\r\n[50] A preacher is said, in this phraseology, to be \xe2\x80\x9cowned\xe2\x80\x9d when he\r\nmakes many converts, and his converts are called his \xe2\x80\x9cseals.\xe2\x80\x9d This is\r\nCant in its most objectionable form.\r\n\r\n[51] \xe2\x80\x9cSwaddler\xe2\x80\x9d is also a phrase by which the low Irish Roman Catholics\r\ndenominate those of their body who in winter become Protestants, _pro\r\ntem._, for the sake of the blankets, coals, &c., given by proselytizing\r\nProtestants. It is hard to say which are the worse, those who refuse to\r\ngive unless the objects of their charity become converted, or those who\r\nsham conversion to save themselves from starving, or the tender mercies\r\nof the relieving officer. I am much afraid my sympathies are with the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cswaddlers,\xe2\x80\x9d who are also called \xe2\x80\x9csoupers.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94ED.\r\n\r\n[52] \xe2\x80\x9cAll our newspapers contain more or less colloquial words; in fact,\r\nthere seems no other way of expressing certain ideas connected with\r\npassing events of every-day life with the requisite force and piquancy.\r\nIn the English newspapers the same thing is observable, and certain of\r\nthem contain more of the class denominated Slang words than our\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Bartlett\xe2\x80\x99s Americanisms_, p. 10, edit. 1859.\r\n\r\n[53] When this appeared, \xe2\x80\x9call serene\xe2\x80\x9d was one of those street phrases\r\nwhich periodically spring up, have their rage, and depart as suddenly as\r\nthey come into popularity.

But the _Herald_ has long since departed\r\nthis life, and with it has gone the title of \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Gamp,\xe2\x80\x9d as applied to\r\nthe _Standard_, which is, though, as impulsive and Conservative as\r\never.\xe2\x80\x94ED.\r\n\r\n[56] This is rhyming slang, and is corrupted into \xe2\x80\x9clord\xe2\x80\x9d only.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTouch-me,\xe2\x80\x9d a common term for a shilling, is also derived from the same\r\nsource, it being short for \xe2\x80\x9ctouch-me-on-the-nob,\xe2\x80\x9d which is rhyming slang\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x9cbob\xe2\x80\x9d or shilling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nSLANG DICTIONARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n~A\xc2\xa01~, first-rate, the very best; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s a prime girl, she is; she is\r\nA\xc2\xa01.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Sam Slick_.

As, \xe2\x80\x9cSabinus has been ADDED TO THE LIST.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnother form of expression in reference to this matter is that \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nknife has been brought into requisition.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cADDED TO THE LIST\xe2\x80\x9d is simply\r\na contraction for \xe2\x80\x9cadded to the list of geldings in training.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Addlepate~, a foolish fellow, a dullard.\r\n\r\n~Admiral of the Red~, a person whose very red face evinces a fondness\r\nfor strong potations.\r\n\r\n~Affygraphy.~ \xe2\x80\x9cIt fits to an AFFYGRAPHY,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, to a nicety\xe2\x80\x94to a _T_.\r\n\r\n~Afternoon Farmer~, one who wastes his best opportunity, and drives off\r\nthe large end of his work to the little end of his time.\r\n\r\n~Against the Grain~, in opposition to the wish. \xe2\x80\x9cIt went AGAINST THE\r\nGRAIN to do it, but I knew I must,\xe2\x80\x9d is a common expression.\r\n\r\n~Aggerawators~ (corruption of _Aggravators_), the greasy locks of hair\r\nin vogue among costermongers and other street folk, worn twisted from\r\nthe temple back towards the ear. They are also, from a supposed\r\nresemblance in form, termed NEWGATE KNOCKERS, and sometimes NUMBER\r\nSIXES. This style of adorning the head is, however, fast dying out, and\r\nthe everyday costermonger or street thief has his hair cut like any one\r\nelse. The yearly militia drill may have had a good deal to do with this\r\nalteration.\r\n\r\n~Akeybo~, a slang phrase used in the following manner:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHe beats\r\nAKEYBO, and AKEYBO beat the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Albertopolis~, a facetious appellation given by the Londoners to the\r\nKensington Gore district.

Once fashionable, but little worn now.\r\n\r\n~All Serene~, an ejaculation of acquiescence. Some years back a popular\r\nstreet cry.

Sometimes ALL THE WAY THERE. Always used as a\r\nterm of encomium.\r\n\r\n~All to Pieces~, utterly, excessively; \xe2\x80\x9che beat him ALL TO PIECES,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n_i.e._, excelled or surpassed him exceedingly.

Modernly introduced by Washington Irving in\r\n1837. The _idea_ of this phrase is, however, far older than the time of\r\n_Irving_. _Ben Jonson\xe2\x80\x99s Epistle to Elizabeth, Countess of Rutland_,\r\ncommences thus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWhilst that for which all virtue now is sold,\r\n    And almost every vice, _almightie gold_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seems almost obvious that the term must have been applied, not to\r\ndollars certainly, but to money, long before the time of Irving.\r\n\r\n~American Tweezers~, an instrument used by an hotel-sneak which nips the\r\nwards end of a key, and enables him to open a door from the opposite\r\nside to that on which it has been locked.\r\n\r\n~Andrew Millar~, a ship of war.\xe2\x80\x94_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Ain\xe2\x80\x99t~, the vulgar abbreviation of \xe2\x80\x9cam not,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9care not,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cis not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Anointed~, _i.e._, eminent; used to express great rascality in any one;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9can ANOINTED scoundrel,\xe2\x80\x9d king among scoundrels.\xe2\x80\x94_Irish._\r\n\r\n~Anointing~, a good beating.

PAUL (or Saint Poll), as being the least\r\nof the apostles, and \xe2\x80\x9cnot meet to be called an apostle\xe2\x80\x9d (_see_ 1 Cor.\r\nxv. 9). As in the \xe2\x80\x9cHonour\xe2\x80\x9d list (_see_ GULF), students who had failed\r\nonly slightly in one or more subjects were occasionally allowed their\r\ndegrees, and these were termed ELEGANT EXTRACTS.\xe2\x80\x94_Camb. Univ. Slang._\r\n\r\n~Apple-pie Bed~, a trick played at schools on new comers, or on any boy\r\ndisliked by the rest. One of the sheets is removed, and the other is\r\ndoubled in the middle, so that both edges are brought to the top, and\r\nlook as if both sheets were there; but the unhappy occupant is prevented\r\ngetting more than half-way down, and he has to remake his bed as best he\r\ncan. This trick is sometimes played by children of a larger growth.\r\n\r\n~Apple-Cart~, the human structure, so far as the phrases with which it\r\nis connected are concerned. As \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll upset your APPLE-CART,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdown with\r\nhis APPLE-CART.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Apple-pie Order~, in exact or very nice order.\r\n\r\n~Appro~, contraction of approbation, a word much in use among jewellers.\r\nMost of the extensive show of chains, watches, and trinkets in a shop\r\nwindow is obtained \xe2\x80\x9cON APPRO,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, \xe2\x80\x9con sale or return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Area Sneak~, a thief who commits depredations upon kitchens and\r\ncellars.\r\n\r\n~Argol-bargol~, to bandy words.\xe2\x80\x94_Scotch._\r\n\r\n~Article~, derisive term for a weak or insignificant specimen of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n~Atomy~, a diminutive or deformed person.

The fun consists in standing at a distance and demolishing\r\nAUNT SALLY\xe2\x80\x99S pipe-clay projection with short bludgeons, very similar to\r\nthe halves of broom-handles. The Duke of Beaufort is a \xe2\x80\x9ccrack hand\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nsmashing pipe noses; and his performances some years ago on Brighton\r\nracecourse, which brought the game into notoriety, are yet fresh in\r\nremembrance. AUNT SALLY has, however, had her day, and once again the\r\ninevitable \xe2\x80\x9cthree shies a penny!\xe2\x80\x9d is chief among our outdoor amusements.\r\n\r\n~Avast~, a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s phrase for stop, shut up, go away,\xe2\x80\x94apparently\r\nconnected with the _old Cant_, BYNGE A WASTE; or from the _Italian_,\r\nBASTA, hold! enough.\r\n\r\n~Awake~, or FLY, knowing, thoroughly understanding. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awake,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._,\r\nI know all.

They can, however, even after this agreement,\r\nbe secured on the other side for a little longer price.

Probably from the\r\naction of a cat when preparing to give battle to an enemy.\r\n\r\n~Back-end~, that portion of the year which commences with October. This\r\nphrase is peculiar to the turf, and has its origin in the fact that\r\nOctober was actually, and is now nearly, the finishing portion of the\r\nracing season. Towards BACK-END the punters and \xe2\x80\x9clittle men\xe2\x80\x9d generally\r\nbegin to look forward with anxiety to their winter prospects, and \xe2\x80\x9cgoing\r\nfor the gloves\xe2\x80\x9d is not only a frequent phrase, but a frequently\r\nrecurring practice.\r\n\r\n~Back Out~, to retreat from a difficulty; reverse of GO AHEAD. Metaphor\r\nborrowed from the stables.\r\n\r\n~Back Slang It~, to go out the back way.

Term used in the drapery trade.\r\n\r\n~Bag~, to seize or steal, equivalent to \xe2\x80\x9ccollar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Bagman~, a commercial traveller. This word is used more in reference to\r\nthe old style of commercial travellers than to the present.\r\n\r\n~Bags~, trousers. Trousers of an extensive pattern, or exaggerated\r\nfashion, have sometimes been termed HOWLING-BAGS, but only when the\r\nstyle has been very \xe2\x80\x9cloud.\xe2\x80\x9d The word is probably an abbreviation of\r\nbumbags. \xe2\x80\x9cTo have the BAGS off,\xe2\x80\x9d to be of age and one\xe2\x80\x99s own master, to\r\nhave plenty of money. BAGS OF MYSTERY is another phrase in frequent use,\r\nand refers to sausages and saveloys.

To \xe2\x80\x9cgive a man a BAKER\xe2\x80\x99S DOZEN,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin a slang sense, sometimes means to give him an extra good beating or\r\npummelling.\r\n\r\n~Balaam~, printers\xe2\x80\x99 slang for matter kept in type about monstrous\r\nproductions of nature, &c., to fill up spaces in newspapers that would\r\notherwise be vacant.

The probability is\r\nthat a nobleman then first _used_ it in polite society. The term is\r\nderived from the _Gipsies_.\r\n\r\n~Bandannah~, originally a peculiar kind of silk pocket-handkerchief, now\r\nslang used to denote all sorts of \xe2\x80\x9cstooks,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwipes,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfogles,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nin fact the generic term for a kerchief, whether neck or pocket.\r\n\r\n~Banded~, hungry.

It was the practice\r\n    of stock-jobbers, in the year 1720, to enter into a contract for\r\n    transferring South Sea stock at a future time for a certain price;\r\n    but he who contracted to sell had frequently no stock to transfer,\r\n    nor did he who bought intend to receive any in consequence of his\r\n    bargain; the seller was, therefore, called a BEAR, in allusion to\r\n    the proverb, and the buyer a BULL, perhaps only as a similar\r\n    distinction. The contract was merely a wager, to be determined by\r\n    the rise or fall of stock; if it rose, the seller paid the\r\n    difference to the buyer, proportioned to the sum determined by the\r\n    same computation to the seller.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Dr. Warton on Pope._\r\n\r\nThese arrangements are nowadays called \xe2\x80\x9ctime bargains,\xe2\x80\x9d and are as\r\nfairly (or unfairly) gambling as any transactions at the Victoria Club\r\nor Tattersall\xe2\x80\x99s, or any of the doings which call for the intervention of\r\nthe police and the protestations of pompous City magistrates, who,\r\nduring their terms of office, try to be virtuous and make their names\r\nimmortal.

But the introduction of this word into our\r\n    language belongs not to the vulgar, and is more than a century prior\r\n    to the time of Swift. Mr. Malone agrees with me in exhibiting the\r\n    two first of the following examples:\xe2\x80\x94The _black-guard_ is evidently\r\n    designed to imply a fit attendant on the devil. Mr. Gifford,\r\n    however, in his late edition of Ben Jonson\xe2\x80\x99s works, assigns an\r\n    origin of the name different from what the old examples which I have\r\n    cited seem to countenance. It has been formed, he says, from those\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98mean and dirty dependants, in great houses, who were selected to\r\n    carry coals to the kitchen, halls, &c. To this smutty regiment, who\r\n    attended the progresses, and rode in the carts with the pots and\r\n    kettles, which, with every other article of furniture, were then\r\n    moved from palace to palace, the people, in derision, gave the name\r\n    of _black guards_; a term since become sufficiently familiar, and\r\n    never properly explained.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Todd\xe2\x80\x99s Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary._\r\n\r\nBlackguard as an adjective is very powerful.\r\n\r\n~Blackleg~, a rascal, swindler, or card cheat. The derivation of this\r\nterm was solemnly argued before the full Court of Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Bench upon a\r\nmotion for a new trial for libel, but was not decided by the learned\r\ntribunal. Probably it is from the custom of sporting and turf men\r\nwearing black _top-boots_. Hence BLACKLEG came to be the phrase for a\r\nprofessional sporting man, and thence for a professional sporting cheat.\r\nThe word is now in its worst sense diminished to \xe2\x80\x9cleg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Black Maria~, the sombre van in which prisoners are conveyed from the\r\npolice court to prison.\r\n\r\n~Black Monday~, the Monday on which boys return to school after the\r\nholidays.

The waiters met at public dinners are often\r\nemployed during the day as mutes, etc. Omnibus and cab drivers regard\r\nBLACKWORK as a _dernier ressort_.\r\n\r\n~Bladder-of-Lard~, a coarse, satirical nickname for a bald-headed\r\nperson. From similarity of appearance.\r\n\r\n~Blade~, a man\xe2\x80\x94in ancient times the term for a soldier; \xe2\x80\x9cknowing\r\nBLADE,\xe2\x80\x9d a wide-awake, sharp, or cunning man.\r\n\r\n~Blarney~, flattery, powers of persuasion. A castle in the county of\r\nCork. It is said that whoever kisses a certain stone in this castle will\r\nbe able to persuade others of whatever he or she pleases. The name of\r\nthe castle is derived from BLADH, a blossom, _i.e._, the flowery or\r\nfertile demesne. BLADH is also flattery; hence the connexion. A more\r\nthan ordinarily persuasive Irishman is said to have \xe2\x80\x9ckissed the BLARNEY\r\nstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Blast~, to curse. Originally a _Military_ expression.\r\n\r\n~Blaze~, to leave trace purposely of one\xe2\x80\x99s way in a forest or unknown\r\npath by marking trees or other objects.\r\n\r\n~Blazes~, a low synonym for the infernal regions, and now almost for\r\nanything. \xe2\x80\x9cLike BLAZES\xe2\x80\x9d is a phrase of intensification applied without\r\nany reference to the original meaning.

An idle and useless person\r\nis often told that he is only fit to lead the BLIND MONKEYS to evacuate.\r\nAnother form this elegant conversation takes, is for one man to tell\r\nanother that he knows of a suitable situation for him. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much a week?\r\nand what to do?\xe2\x80\x9d are natural questions, and then comes the scathing and\r\nsarcastic reply, \xe2\x80\x9cFive bob a week at the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re to stand\r\nbehind the door and make the patients sick.

Beggars are of two kinds\xe2\x80\x94those who SCREEVE\r\n(introducing themselves with a FAKEMENT, or false document) and those\r\nwho BLOB, or state their case in their own truly \xe2\x80\x9cunvarnished\xe2\x80\x9d language.\r\n\r\n~Block~, the head. \xe2\x80\x9cTo BLOCK a hat,\xe2\x80\x9d is to knock a man\xe2\x80\x99s hat down over\r\nhis eyes.\xe2\x80\x94_See_ BONNET. Also a street obstruction.\r\n\r\n~Block Ornaments~, the small dark-coloured and sometimes stinking pieces\r\nof meat which used to be exposed on the cheap butchers\xe2\x80\x99 blocks or\r\ncounters; matters of interest to all the sharp-visaged women in poor\r\nneighbourhoods. Since the great rise in the price of meat there has been\r\nlittle necessity for butchers to make block ornaments of their odds and\r\nends. They are bespoke beforehand.\r\n\r\n~Bloke~, a man; \xe2\x80\x9cthe BLOKE with the jasey,\xe2\x80\x9d the man with the wig,\r\n_i.e._, the Judge. _Gipsy_ and _Hindoo_, LOKE. _North_, BLOACHER, any\r\nlarge animal.\r\n\r\n~Blood~, a fast or high-mettled man.

In _America_, \xe2\x80\x9cto BLOW\xe2\x80\x9d is slang for to lie in a boasting\r\nmanner, to brag or \xe2\x80\x9cgas\xe2\x80\x9d unduly.\r\n\r\n~Blow a Cloud~, to smoke a cigar or pipe\xe2\x80\x94a phrase used two centuries\r\nago. Most likely in use as long as tobacco here\xe2\x80\x94an almost evident\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n~Blow Me~, or BLOW ME TIGHT, a vow, a ridiculous and unmeaning\r\nejaculation, inferring an appeal to the ejaculator; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m BLOWED if you\r\nwill\xe2\x80\x9d is a common expression among the lower orders; \xe2\x80\x9cBLOW ME UP\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nthe term a century ago.\xe2\x80\x94_See Parker\xe2\x80\x99s Adventures_, 1781.\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nexpression BE-BLOWED is now more general. Thomas Hood used to tell a\r\nstory:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI was once asked to contribute to a new journal, not exactly\r\n    gratuitously, but at a very small advance upon nothing\xe2\x80\x94and avowedly\r\n    because the work had been planned according to that estimate.\r\n    However, I accepted the terms conditionally\xe2\x80\x94that is to say,\r\n    provided the principle could be properly carried out. Accordingly, I\r\n    wrote to my butcher, baker, and other tradesmen, informing them that\r\n    it was necessary, for the sake of cheap literature and the interest\r\n    of the reading public, that they should furnish me with their\r\n    several commodities at a very trifling per-centage above cost price.\r\n    It will be sufficient to quote the answer of the\r\n    butcher:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x94Respectin\xe2\x80\x99 your note, Cheap literater BE BLOWED!\r\n    Butchers must live as well as other pepel\xe2\x80\x94and if so be you or the\r\n    readin\xe2\x80\x99 publick wants to have meat at prime cost, you must buy your\r\n    own beastesses, and kill yourselves.\xe2\x80\x94I remane, etc.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98JOHN STOKES.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Blow Out~, or TUCK IN, a feast. Sometimes the expression is, \xe2\x80\x9cBLOW OUT\r\nyour bags.\xe2\x80\x9d A BLOW OUT is often called a tightener.\r\n\r\n~Blow Up~, to make a noise, or scold; formerly a cant expression used\r\namong thieves, now a recognised and respectable phrase. BLOWING UP, a\r\njobation, a scolding.\r\n\r\n~Blowen~, originally a showy or flaunting female, now a prostitute only.\r\nIn _Wilts_, a BLOWEN is a blossom. _Germ._ BL\xc3\x9cHEN, to bloom. In\r\n_German_, also, BUHLEN is to court, and BUHLE, a sweetheart.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cO du _bl\xc3\xbchende_ M\xc3\xa4dchen, viel sch\xc3\xb6ne Willkomm!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_German Song._\r\n\r\nPossibly, however, the street term BLOWEN may mean one whose reputation\r\nhas been BLOWN UPON or damaged.\r\n\r\n~Blower~, a girl; a contemptuous name in opposition to JOMER.\xe2\x80\x94_Gipsy._\r\n\r\n~Blowsey~, a word applied to a rough wench, or coarse woman.\r\n\r\n~Bludger~, a low thief, who does not hesitate to use violence, literally\r\none who will use a bludgeon.\r\n\r\n~Blue~, said of talk that is smutty or indecent. Probably from the\r\nFrench, \xe2\x80\x9cBiblioth\xc3\xa8que Bleu.\xe2\x80\x9d When the conversation has assumed an\r\nentirely opposite character, it is then said to be BROWN or Quakerish.\r\n\r\n~Blue~, a policeman; otherwise BLUE BOTTLE. From the colour of his\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\n~Blue~, or BLEW, to pawn or pledge. Actually to get rid of.\r\n\r\n~Blue~, confounded or surprised; \xe2\x80\x9cto look BLUE,\xe2\x80\x9d to look astonished,\r\nannoyed, or disappointed.\r\n\r\n~Blue Bellies~, a term applied by the Confederate soldiers during the\r\ncivil war in America to the Federals, the name being suggested by the\r\nskyblue gaberdines worn by the Northern soldiers. On the other hand, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfilthy BLUE BELLIES,\xe2\x80\x9d as the full title ran, dubbed the Confederates\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreybacks,\xe2\x80\x9d the epithet cutting both ways, as the Southern soldiers not\r\nonly wore grey uniforms, but \xe2\x80\x9cgreyback\xe2\x80\x9d is American as well as English\r\nfor a louse.\r\n\r\n~Blue Billy~, the handkerchief (blue ground with white spots) sometimes\r\nworn and used as a colour at prize-fights. Also, the refuse ammoniacal\r\nlime from gas factories.\r\n\r\n~Blue Blanket~, a rough overcoat made of coarse pilot cloth.\r\n\r\n~Blue Bottle~, a policeman. This well-known slang term for a London\r\nconstable is used by _Shakspeare_. In Part ii. of _King Henry IV._, act\r\nv. scene 4, Doll Tearsheet calls the beadle, who is dragging her in, a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthin man in a censer, a BLUE-BOTTLE rogue.\xe2\x80\x9d This may at first seem\r\nsingular, but the reason is obvious. The beadles of Bridewell whose duty\r\nit was to whip the women prisoners were clad in blue.\r\n\r\n~Blue Butter~, mercurial ointment used for the destruction of parasites.\r\n\r\n~Blued~, or BLEWED, tipsy, or drunk.

Form of _del. trem._\r\n\r\n~Blue Moon~, an unlimited period. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce in a blue moon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Blue Murders.~ Probably from desperate or alarming cries. A term used\r\nmore to describe cries of terror or alarm than for any other purpose.\r\nAs, \xe2\x80\x9cI heard her calling BLUE MURDERS.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94MORBLEU.\r\n\r\n~Blue-Pigeon-Flyer~, sometimes a journeyman plumber, glazier, or other\r\nworkman, who, when repairing houses, strips off the lead, and makes away\r\nwith it. This performance is, though, by no means confined to workmen.\r\nAn empty house is often entered and the whole of the roof in its\r\nvicinity stripped, the only notice given to the folks below being\r\nreceived by them on the occasion of a heavy downfall of rain. The term\r\nFLYER has, indeed, of late years been more peculiarly applied to the man\r\nwho steals the lead in pursuance of his vocation as a thief, than to him\r\nwho takes it because it comes in the way of his work.\r\n\r\n~Blue Ruin~, gin.\r\n\r\n~Blues~, a fit of despondency.\xe2\x80\x94_See_ BLUE DEVILS.\r\n\r\n~Blues~, the police. Sometimes called the Royal Regiment of Foot-guards\r\nBLUE.\r\n\r\n~Bluey~, lead.\xe2\x80\x94German, BLEI. Most likely, though, from the colour, as\r\nthe term is of the very lowest slang.\r\n\r\n~Bluff~, an excuse; also the game at cards known as euchre in America.\r\n\r\n~Bluff~, to turn aside, stop, or excuse.\r\n\r\n~Blunt~, money. It has been said that this term is from the _French_\r\nBLOND, sandy or golden colour, and that a parallel may be found in BROWN\r\nor BROWNS, the slang for half-pence. Far-fetched as this etymology\r\nseems, it may be correct, as it is borne out by the analogy of similar\r\nexpressions. Cf. BLANQUILLO, a word used in Morocco and Southern Spain\r\nfor a small Moorish coin. The \xe2\x80\x9casper\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe1\xbc\x84\xcf\x83\xcf\x80\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xce\xbd) of Constantinople is\r\ncalled by the Turks AKCHEH, _i.e._, \xe2\x80\x9clittle white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Blurt Out~, to speak from impulse, and without reflection, to let out\r\nsuddenly.\xe2\x80\x94_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~B.N.C.~, for Brasenose, initials of Brazen Nose College. In spite of\r\nthe nose over the gate the probability is the real name was Brasinium.\r\nIt is still famous for its beer.\xe2\x80\x94_University._\r\n\r\n~Board-of-Green-Cloth~, a facetious synonym for a card or billiard\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n~Boat~, originally to transport; the term is now applied to penal\r\nservitude. To \xe2\x80\x9cget the BOAT,\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cbe BOATED,\xe2\x80\x9d is to be sentenced to a\r\nlong term of imprisonment equivalent to transportation under the old\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n~Bob~, a shilling. Formerly BOBSTICK, which may have been the original.\r\nBOB-A-NOB, a shilling a-head.\r\n\r\n~Bob~, \xe2\x80\x9cs\xe2\x80\x99help me BOB,\xe2\x80\x9d a street oath, equivalent to \xe2\x80\x9cso help me God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nOther words are used in street language for a similarly evasive purpose,\r\n_i.e._, CAT, GREENS, TATUR, &c., all equally ridiculous. Ignorant people\r\nhave a singular habit of saying \xe2\x80\x9cso help _my_,\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9c_me_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhatever the following words may be. This shows how little they think of\r\nthe meanings of the phrases most in use among them. The words \xe2\x80\x9cso help\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nare almost invariably pronounced \xe2\x80\x9cswelp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Bobbery~, a squabble, tumult.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Bobbish~, very well, clever, spruce. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh! pretty\r\nBOBBISH.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Old._\r\n\r\n~Bobby~, a policeman: both BOBBY and PEELER were nicknames given to the\r\nnew police, in allusion to the Christian name and surname of the late\r\n_Sir Robert Peel_, who was the prime mover in effecting their\r\nintroduction and improvement. The term BOBBY is, however, older than the\r\nintroduction of the new police. The official square-keeper, who is\r\nalways armed with a cane to drive away idle and disorderly urchins, has,\r\ntime out of mind, been called by the said urchins, \xe2\x80\x9cBOBBY the beadle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Bodkin~, any one sitting between two others in a carriage, is said \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nride BODKIN.\xe2\x80\x9d Amongst sporting men, applied to a person who takes his\r\nturn between the sheets on alternate nights, when the hotel has twice as\r\nmany visitors as it can comfortably lodge; as, for instance, during a\r\nrace-week.\r\n\r\n~Body-Snatcher~, a bailiff or runner: SNATCH, the trick by which the\r\nbailiff captures the delinquent. These terms are now almost obsolete, so\r\nfar as the pursuits mentioned are concerned.\r\n\r\n~Bog~, or BOG-HOUSE, a privy, as distinguished from a water-closet.\r\nOriginally printers\xe2\x80\x99 slang, but now very common, and not applied to any\r\nparticular form of _cabinet d\xe2\x80\x99aisance_. \xe2\x80\x9cTo BOG\xe2\x80\x9d is to ease oneself by\r\nevacuation.\r\n\r\n~Bog-Oranges~, potatoes. A phrase perhaps derived from the term \xe2\x80\x9cIrish\r\nfruit,\xe2\x80\x9d which, by some strange peculiarity has been applied to potatoes;\r\nfor even the most ignorant Cockney could hardly believe that potatoes\r\ngrow in a bog. As, however, the majority of the lower classes of London\r\ndo believe that potatoes were indigenous to, and were first brought from\r\nthe soil of Ireland, which is also in some parts supposed to be capable\r\nof growing nothing else, they may even believe that potatoes are\r\nactually BOG-ORANGES.\r\n\r\n~Bog-Trotter~, satirical name for an Irishman.\xe2\x80\x94_Miege._ _Camden_,\r\nhowever, speaking of the \xe2\x80\x9cdebateable land\xe2\x80\x9d on the borders of England and\r\nScotland, says, \xe2\x80\x9cboth these dales breed notable BOG-TROTTERS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Bogus~, an American term for anything pretending to be that which it is\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94such as BOGUS degrees, BOGUS titles, &c.\r\n\r\n~Boilers~, or BROMPTON BOILERS, a name originally given to the New\r\nKensington Museum and School of Art, in allusion to the peculiar form of\r\nthe buildings, and the fact of their being mainly composed of, and\r\ncovered with, sheet iron. This has been changed since the extensive\r\nalterations in the building, or rather pile of buildings, and the words\r\nare now the property of the Bethnal Green Museum.\xe2\x80\x94_See_ PEPPER-BOXES.\r\n\r\n~Boko~, the nose. Originally pugilistic slang, but now general.\r\n\r\n~Bolt~, to run away, decamp, or abscond. Also to swallow without\r\nchewing. To eat greedily.\r\n\r\n~Bolus~, an apothecary. Origin evident.\r\n\r\n~Bombay Ducks;~ in the East India Company\xe2\x80\x99s army the Bombay regiments\r\nwere so designated. The name is now given to a dried fish (_bummelow_),\r\nmuch eaten by natives and Europeans in Western India.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Bone~, to steal or appropriate what does not belong to you.

The term was also applied to a resurrectionist. Cobbett\r\nwas therefore called \xe2\x80\x9ca BONE GRUBBER,\xe2\x80\x9d because he brought the remains of\r\nTom Paine from America.\r\n\r\n~Bone-Picker~, a footman.\r\n\r\n~Bones~, to rattle the BONES, to play at dice: also called St. Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBONES.\r\n\r\n~Bones~, \xe2\x80\x9che made no BONES of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he did not hesitate, _i.e._,\r\nundertook and finished the work without difficulty, \xe2\x80\x9cfound no BONES in\r\nthe jelly.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Ancient, vide Cotgrave._\r\n\r\n~Boniface~, landlord of a tavern or inn.\r\n\r\n~Bonnet~, or BONNETER, a gambling cheat. Sometimes called a \xe2\x80\x9cbearer-up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe BONNET plays as though he were a member of the general public, and\r\nby his good luck, or by the force of his example, induces others to\r\nventure their stakes. Bonneting is often done in much better society\r\nthan that to be found in the ordinary gaming rooms. A man who persuades\r\nanother to buy an article on which he receives commission or per-centage\r\nis said to BONNET or bear-up for the seller. Also, a pretence, or\r\nmake-believe, a sham bidder at auctions, one who metaphorically blinds\r\nor BONNETS others.\r\n\r\n~Bonnet~, to strike a man\xe2\x80\x99s cap or hat over his eyes. Also to \xe2\x80\x9cbear-up\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor another.\r\n\r\n~Booby-Trap~, a favourite amusement of boys at school. It consists in\r\nplacing a pitcher of water on the top of a door set ajar for the\r\npurpose; the person whom they wish to drench is then made to pass\r\nthrough the door, and receives the pitcher and its contents on his\r\nunlucky head. Books are sometimes used.\r\n\r\n~Book~, an arrangement of bets against certain horses marked in a\r\npocket-book made for that purpose. \xe2\x80\x9cMaking a BOOK upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d is a common\r\nphrase to denote that a man is prepared to lay the odds against the\r\nhorses in a race. \xe2\x80\x9cThat does not suit my BOOK,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, does not accord\r\nwith my other arrangements. The principle of making a BOOK, or betting\r\nround, as it is sometimes termed, is to lay a previously-determined sum\r\nagainst every horse in the race, or as many horses as possible; and\r\nshould the bookmaker \xe2\x80\x9cget round,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, succeed in laying against as\r\nmany horses as will more than balance the odds laid, he is certain to be\r\na winner. The BOOKMAKER is distinguished from the backer by its being\r\nhis particular business to bet against horses, or to lay, while the\r\nbacker, who is also often a professional gambler, stands by the chance\r\nof a horse, or the chances of a set of horses about which he supposes\r\nhimself to be possessed of special information. A bookmaker rarely backs\r\nhorses for his own particular fancy\xe2\x80\x94he may indeed put a sovereign or a\r\nfiver on an animal about which he has been told something, but as a rule\r\nif he specially fancies a horse, the bookmaker lets him \xe2\x80\x9crun for the\r\nBOOK,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, does not lay against him. When a bookmaker backs a horse\r\nin the course of his regular business, it is because he has laid too\r\nmuch against him, and finds it convenient to share the danger with other\r\nbookmakers.\r\n\r\n~Booked~, caught, fixed, disposed of.\xe2\x80\x94Term in _Book-keeping_.\r\n\r\n~Bookmaker\xe2\x80\x99s Pocket~, a breast-pocket made inside the waistcoat, for\r\nnotes of large amount.\r\n\r\n~Books~, a pack of cards. Term used by professional card-players.\xe2\x80\x94_See_\r\nDEVIL\xe2\x80\x99S BOOKS.\r\n\r\n~Boom~, \xe2\x80\x9cto top one\xe2\x80\x99s BOOM off,\xe2\x80\x9d to be off or start in a certain\r\ndirection.\xe2\x80\x94_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Boom-Passenger~, a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s slang term for a convict on board ship.\r\nDerived from the circumstance that prisoners on board convict ships were\r\nchained to, or were made to crawl along or stand on the booms for\r\nexercise or punishment.\r\n\r\n~Boon-Companion~, a comrade in a drinking bout. BOON evidently\r\ncorruption of BON.\r\n\r\n~Booze~, drink. _Ancient Cant_, BOWSE. BOOZE, or SUCK-CASA, a\r\npublic-house.\r\n\r\n~Booze~, to drink, or more properly, to use another slang term, to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clush,\xe2\x80\x9d viz., to drink continually, until drunk, or nearly so. The term\r\nis an old one. _Harman_, in Queen Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s days, speaks of \xe2\x80\x9cBOUSING\r\n(or boozing) and belly-cheere.\xe2\x80\x9d _Massinger_ also speaks of BOUSE. The\r\nterm was good English in the fourteenth century, and came from the\r\n_Dutch_, BUYZEN, to tipple.\r\n\r\n~Boozing-Ken~, a beer-shop, a low public-house.\xe2\x80\x94_Ancient._\r\n\r\n~Boozy~, intoxicated or fuddled.\r\n\r\n~Bore~, a troublesome friend or acquaintance, perhaps so called from his\r\nunvaried and pertinacious pushing; a nuisance; anything which wearies or\r\nannoys. The _Gradus ad Cantabrigiam_ suggests the derivation of BORE\r\nfrom the _Greek_ \xce\x92\xe1\xbd\xb1\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, a burden. _Shakspeare_ uses it, _King Henry\r\nVIII._, i. 1\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n            \xe2\x80\x9c----at this instant\r\n    He BORES me with some trick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_Grose_ speaks of this word as being much in fashion about the year\r\n1780-81, and states that it vanished of a sudden without leaving a trace\r\nbehind. That this was not so, the constant use of the word nowadays will\r\nprove. The late Prince Consort spoke as follows on the subject of BORES\r\nin his address to the British Association, at Aberdeen, September 14,\r\n1859\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI will not weary you by further examples, with which most of you\r\n    are better acquainted than I am myself, but merely express my\r\n    satisfaction that there should exist bodies of men who will bring\r\n    the well-considered and understood wants of science before the\r\n    public and the Government, who will even hand round the begging-box,\r\n    and expose themselves to refusals and rebuffs, to which all beggars\r\n    are liable, with the certainty besides of being considered great\r\n    BORES. Please to recollect that this species of BORE is a most\r\n    useful animal, well adapted for the ends for which nature intended\r\n    him. He alone, by constantly returning to the charge, and repeating\r\n    the same truths and the same requests, succeeds in awakening\r\n    attention to the cause which he advocates, and obtains that hearing\r\n    which is granted him at last for self-protection, as the minor evil\r\n    compared to his importunity, but which is requisite to make his\r\n    cause understood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Bore~ (_Pugilistic_), to press a man to the ropes of the ring by\r\nsuperior weight. In the world of athletics to BORE is to push an\r\nopponent out of his course. This is a most heinous crime among rowers,\r\nas it very often prevents a man having the full use of the tide, or\r\ncompels him to foul, in which case the decision of the race is left to\r\nindividual judgment, at times, of necessity, erroneous.\r\n\r\n~Bosh~, nonsense, stupidity.\xe2\x80\x94_Gipsy_ and _Persian_. Also pure\r\n_Turkish_, BOSH LAKERDI, empty talk. The term was used in this country\r\nas early as 1760, and may be found in the _Student_, vol. ii. p. 217. It\r\nhas been suggested, with what reason the reader must judge for himself,\r\nthat this colloquial expression is from the _German_ BOSH, or BOSSCH,\r\nanswering to our word \xe2\x80\x9cswipes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Bosh~, a fiddle. This is a _Gipsy_ term, and so the exclamations\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBosh!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFiddle-de-dee!\xe2\x80\x9d may have some remote connexion.\r\n\r\n~Bosh-Faker~, a violin player. Term principally used by itinerants.\r\n\r\n~Bos-Ken~, a farmhouse. _Ancient._\xe2\x80\x94_See_ KEN.\r\n\r\n~Bosky~, inebriated. Not much in use now.\r\n\r\n~Bosman~, a farmer: \xe2\x80\x9cfaking a BOSMAN on the main toby,\xe2\x80\x9d robbing a farmer\r\non the highway. BOSS, a master.\xe2\x80\x94_American._ Both terms from the\r\n_Dutch_, BOSCH-MAN, one who lives in the woods; otherwise _Boschjeman_,\r\nor _Bushman_.\r\n\r\n~Boss-Eyed~, said of a person with one eye, or rather with one eye\r\ninjured, a person with an obliquity of vision. In this sense sometimes\r\nvaried by the term \xe2\x80\x9cswivel-eyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Bostruchyzer~, a small kind of comb for curling the whiskers.\xe2\x80\x94_Oxford\r\nUniversity._\r\n\r\n~Botany Bay~, Worcester Coll. Oxon., so called from its remote\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n~Bother~, trouble or annoyance. Any one oppressed with business cares is\r\nsaid to be BOTHERED. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t BOTHER,\xe2\x80\x9d is a common expression. BLOTHER, an\r\nold word, signifying to chatter idly.\r\n\r\n~Botheration!~ trouble, annoyance; \xe2\x80\x9cBOTHERATION to it!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconfound it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9cdeuce take it!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an exclamation when irritated.\r\n\r\n~Bottle-Holder~, originally a term in prize ring parlance for the second\r\nwho took charge of the water-bottle, which was an essential feature in\r\nall pugilistic arrangements. This second used to hold the combatant on\r\nhis knee between the rounds, while the other or principal second\r\nsponged, instructed, and advised; an abettor; also the bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s man\r\nat a wedding. Slang term for Lord Palmerston, derived from a speech he\r\nmade some years ago when foreign secretary, in which he described\r\nhimself as acting the part of a judicious BOTTLE-HOLDER among the\r\nforeign powers.\r\n\r\n~Bottom~, stamina in a horse or man. Power to stand fatigue; endurance\r\nto receive a good beating and still fight on. \xe2\x80\x9cA fellow of pluck, sound\r\nwind, and good BOTTOM is fit to fight anything.\xe2\x80\x9d This was an old axiom\r\namong prize fighters. Pierce Egan was very fond of the word.\r\n\r\n~Bottom~, spirit placed in a glass before a\xc3\xabrated water is poured in.\r\nAs, \xe2\x80\x9ca soda and a BOTTOM of brandy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csoda and dark BOTTOM,\xe2\x80\x9d is American\r\nfor soda and brown brandy.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBOTTOMED well with brandy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Bon Gaultier Ballads._\r\n\r\n~Botts~, the colic or bellyache.\xe2\x80\x94_Stable Slang._ _Burns_ uses it. _See\r\nDeath and Dr. Hornbook._\r\n\r\n~Botty~, conceited, swaggering.\xe2\x80\x94_Stable._ An infant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nposteriors.\xe2\x80\x94_Nursery._\r\n\r\n~Bounce~, impudence, cheek. A showy swindler, a bully.\r\n\r\n~Bounce~, to boast, cheat, or bully.\xe2\x80\x94_Old Cant._ Also to lie.\r\n\r\n~Bounceable~, prone to bouncing or boasting.\r\n\r\n~Bouncer~, a person who steals whilst bargaining with a tradesman, a\r\nswindler, or a lie of more than ordinary dimensions.\r\n\r\n~Bounder~, a four-wheeled cab. Because of its jumping motion over the\r\nstones. Also a University term for a TRAP, which generally has a very\r\nrough time of it on the country roads.\r\n\r\n~Bow-Catcher~, or KISS-CURL, a small curl which a few years back used to\r\nbe, and probably will be again some day, twisted on the cheeks or\r\ntemples of young\xe2\x80\x94and often old\xe2\x80\x94girls, adhering to the face as if\r\ngummed or pasted. Evidently a corruption of BEAU-CATCHER. In old times\r\nthis was called a lovelock, when it was the mark at which all the\r\nPuritan and ranting preachers levelled their pulpit pop-guns, loaded\r\nwith sharp and virulent abuse. Hall and Prynne looked upon all women as\r\nstrumpets who dared to let the hair depart from a straight line\r\nupon their cheeks. The French prettily termed these adornments\r\n_accroche-c\xc5\x93urs_, whilst in the United States they were plainly and\r\nunpleasantly called \xe2\x80\x9cspit-curls.\xe2\x80\x9d Bartlett says: \xe2\x80\x9cSpit-curl, a detached\r\nlock of hair curled upon the temple; probably from having been at first\r\nplastered into shape by the saliva.\xe2\x80\x9d It is now understood that the\r\nmucilage of quince seed is used by the ladies for this purpose. When men\r\ntwist the hair on each side of their faces into ropes they are sometimes\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cbell-ropes,\xe2\x80\x9d as being wherewith to _draw the belles_. Whether\r\nBELL-ROPES or BOW-CATCHERS, it is singular they should form part of a\r\nprisoner\xe2\x80\x99s adornment, and that a jaunty little kiss-curl should, of all\r\nthings in the world, ornament a jail dock; yet such was formerly the\r\ncase. Hunt, \xe2\x80\x9cthe accomplice after the fact and King\xe2\x80\x99s evidence against\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe murderer of Weare, on his trial appeared at the bar with a highly\r\npomatumed love-lock sticking tight to his forehead. In the days of the\r\nCivil Wars, the very last thing a Cavalier would part with was his\r\nlove-lock.\r\n\r\n~Bowdlerization~, a term used in literary circles to signify undue\r\nstrictness of treatment caused by over-modesty in editing a classic. To\r\nBOWDLERIZE is to emasculate through squeamishness.

The method used at sea to teach boys the\r\npoints of the mariner\xe2\x80\x99s compass.\xe2\x80\x94_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Boy~, a hump on a man\xe2\x80\x99s back. In low circles it is usual to speak of a\r\nhumpbacked man as two persons\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chim and his BOY,\xe2\x80\x9d and from this much\r\ncoarse fun and personality are at times evolved.\r\n\r\n~Bracelets~, handcuffs.\r\n\r\n~Brace up~, to pawn stolen goods.\r\n\r\n~Brads~, money. Properly a small kind of nails used by\r\ncobblers.\xe2\x80\x94_Compare_ HORSE NAILS.\r\n\r\n~Brain-Pan~, the skull, and BRAIN-CANISTER, the head.

Properly _Brent_, BRAND or _Fire new_, _i.e._,\r\nfresh from the anvil, or fresh with the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s brand upon it.\r\n\r\n~Brass~, money. \xe2\x80\x9cTin\xe2\x80\x9d is also used, and so are most forms of metal.\r\n\r\n~Brass~, impudence. In 1803 some artillerymen stationed at Norwich were\r\ndirected to prove some brass ordnance belonging to the city. To the\r\nreport delivered to the corporation was appended this note:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_N.B._\xe2\x80\x94It\r\nis customary for the corporal to have the old metal when any of the\r\npieces burst.\xe2\x80\x9d _Answer._\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe corporation is of opinion that the\r\ncorporal does not want BRASS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Brass-Knocker~, broken victuals.

Blows in this region were called \xe2\x80\x9cporridge\r\ndisturbers,\xe2\x80\x9d and other fancy names, which were supposed to rob them of\r\ntheir hardness\xe2\x80\x94to those who did not receive them.\r\n\r\n~Break-Down~, a noisy dance, almost violent enough to break the floor\r\ndown; a jovial, social gathering, a \xe2\x80\x9cflare up;\xe2\x80\x9d in Ireland, a\r\nwedding\xe2\x80\x94_American_ so far as the dance is concerned.\r\n\r\n~Break One\xe2\x80\x99s Back~, a figurative expression, implying bankruptcy, or the\r\ncrippling of a person\xe2\x80\x99s means.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cA story is current of a fashionable author answering a late and\r\n    rather violent knock at his door one evening. A coal-heaver wanted\r\n    to know if the gentleman would like a cheap ton of coals; he was\r\n    sorry for troubling him so late, but \xe2\x80\x98the party as had a-ordered the\r\n    two ton and a-half couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be found,\xe2\x80\x99 although he had driven his\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98waggon for six blessed hours up and down the neighbourhood.\r\n    Five-and-twenty is the price, but yer shall have them for 20s.\xe2\x80\x99 Our\r\n    author was not to be tempted, he had heard of the trick before; so\r\n    bidding the man go away from his house, he shut the door. The man,\r\n    however, lingered there, expatiating on the quality of his\r\n    coals\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Acterly givin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em away, and the gent wont have \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\n    he, addressing the neighbourhood in a loud voice: and the last that\r\n    was heard of him was his anything but sweet voice whistling through\r\n    the keyhole, \xe2\x80\x98Will eighteen _bob_ BREAK YER BACK?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Break Shins~, to borrow money.

When you cut to your\r\n    adversary cut at the ends, and then it is a chance if you cut him an\r\n    honour, because the cards at the ends are all of a length. Thus you\r\n    may make breefs end-ways as well as sideways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nModern card-players of a certain kind have considerably improved on\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n~Breeks~, breeches.\xe2\x80\x94_Scotch_, now common.\r\n\r\n~Brick~, a \xe2\x80\x9cjolly good fellow;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca regular BRICK,\xe2\x80\x9d a staunch fellow.\r\nAbout the highest compliment that in one word can be paid one man.

BRIEF is also the synonym for a card in the\r\nGerman _Rothw\xc3\xa4lsch_ dialect, and BRIEFEN to play at cards. \xe2\x80\x9cItem\xe2\x80\x94beware\r\nof the Joners, (gamblers,) who practice Beseflery with the BRIEF,\r\n(cheating at cards,) who deal falsely and cut one for the other, cheat\r\nwith Boglein and spies, pick one BRIEF from the ground, and another from\r\na cupboard,\xe2\x80\x9d &c.\xe2\x80\x94_Liber Vagatorum_, ed. by Martin Luther, in 1529.\r\nEnglish translation, by J. C. Hotten, 1860, p. 47. _See_ BREEF.\r\n\r\n~Brim~, a violent irascible woman, as inflammable and unpleasant as\r\nbrimstone, from which the word is contracted.\r\n\r\n~Briney~, the sea. A \xe2\x80\x9cdip in the BRINEY\xe2\x80\x9d once a year is a great\r\nattraction to Cockney excursionists. A story is told of one excursionist\r\nsaying to another, as they stripped in a double machine, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, \xe2\x80\x99Arry,\r\nwhat dirty feet you\xe2\x80\x99ve got!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Ave I; well yer see I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t down last\r\nyear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Bring-up~, or BRING-TO, to stop suddenly, as a team of horses or a\r\nvessel.

Evidently a corruption of broadcloth. BROADY workers\r\nare men who go round selling vile shoddy stuff under the pretence that\r\nit is excellent material, which has been \xe2\x80\x9cgot on the cross,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._\r\nstolen.\r\n\r\n~Brolly~, an umbrella. Term used at both Oxford and Cambridge\r\nUniversities.\r\n\r\n~Brosier~, a bankrupt.\xe2\x80\x94_Cheshire._ BROSIER-MY-DAME, school term,\r\nimplying a clearing of the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s larder of provisions, in\r\nrevenge for stinginess.\xe2\x80\x94_Eton._\r\n\r\n~Brother-Chip~, originally fellow carpenter.

A suggestion has been made that BESS\r\nmay be from the _German_ BUSCHE, or BOSCHE, a barrel. It is much more\r\nlikely, however, that the phrase is derived from the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nsoldier is wedded to his weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Brown-papermen~, low gamblers.\r\n\r\n~Brown Study~, a reverie. Very common even in educated society, but\r\nhardly admissible in writing, and therefore considered a vulgarism. It\r\nis derived, by a writer in _Notes and Queries_, from BROW STUDY, and he\r\ncites the old German BRAUN, or AUG-BRAUN, an eye-brow.\xe2\x80\x94_Ben Jonson._\r\n\r\n~Brown Talk~, conversation of an exceedingly proper character,\r\nQuakerish. Compare BLUE.\r\n\r\n~Brown to~, to understand, to comprehend.\r\n\r\n~Bruiser~, a fighting man, a pugilist. _Shakspeare_ uses the word\r\nBRUISING in a similar sense.\r\n\r\n~Brum~, a counterfeit coin. _Nearly obsolete._ Corruption of\r\n_Brummagem_, for meaning of which _see_ Introductory Chapter.\r\n\r\n~Brush~, a fox\xe2\x80\x99s tail, a house-painter.

Also to be taken in custody. Both uses of the\r\nword common and exchangeable among the London lower classes.\r\n\r\n~Bubbley-Jock~, a turkey, or silly boasting fellow; a prig.\xe2\x80\x94_Scottish._\r\nIn the north of England the bird is called a BOBBLE-COCK. Both names, no\r\ndoubt, from its cry, which is supposed by imaginative persons to consist\r\nof the two words exactly.\r\n\r\n~Buck~, a gay or smart man; an unlicensed cabman; also a large marble\r\nused by schoolboys.\r\n\r\n~Buck~, sixpence. The word is rarely used by itself, but generally\r\ndenotes the sixpence attached to shillings in reference to cost, as,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthree and a BUCK,\xe2\x80\x9d three shillings and sixpence. Probably a corruption\r\nof Fyebuck.\r\n\r\n~Buckhorse~, a smart blow or box on the ear; derived from the name of a\r\ncelebrated \xe2\x80\x9cbruiser\xe2\x80\x9d of that name. Buckhorse was a man who either\r\npossessed or professed insensibility to pain, and who would for a small\r\nsum allow anyone to strike him with the utmost force on the side of the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n~Buckle~, to bend; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t BUCKLE to that.\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it; to\r\nyield or give in to a person. _Shakspeare_ uses the word in the latter\r\nsense, _Henry IV._, i. 1; and _Halliwell_ says that \xe2\x80\x9cthe commentators do\r\nnot supply another example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Buckle-Beggar~, a COUPLE-BEGGAR, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Buckle-to~, to bend to one\xe2\x80\x99s work, to begin at once, and with great\r\nenergy\xe2\x80\x94from buckling-to one\xe2\x80\x99s armour before a combat, or fastening on a\r\nbundle.\r\n\r\n~Buckley~, \xe2\x80\x9cWho struck BUCKLEY?\xe2\x80\x9d a common phrase used to irritate\r\nIrishmen. The story is that an Englishman having struck an Irishman\r\nnamed Buckley, the latter made a great outcry, and one of his friends\r\nrushed forth screaming, \xe2\x80\x9cWho struck Buckley?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nEnglishman, preparing for the apparently inevitable combat. \xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe ferocious Hibernian, after a careful investigation of the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthews and sinews, \xe2\x80\x9cthen, sarve him right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Buckra~, a white man. The original of this term is a \xe2\x80\x9cflogging man,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfrom the Hebrew, and the application of it to the whites by the West\r\nIndian negroes is, therefore, rather interesting. They probably first\r\nlearned it from a missionary.\r\n\r\n~Buckshish~, BUCKSHEESH or BACKSHEESH, a present of money. Over all\r\nIndia, and the East generally, the natives lose no opportunity of asking\r\nfor BUCKSHISH. The usage is such a complete nuisance that the word is\r\nsometimes answered by a blow; this is termed BAMBOO BUCKSHISH. BUCKSHISH\r\nhas taken up a very firm residence in Europe\xe2\x80\x94may, in fact, on a much\r\nlarger scale than that of Asia, be said to have always had an existence\r\nhere. BUCKSHISH is a very important item in the revenues of officials\r\nwho hold positions of considerable importance, as well as in those of\r\ntheir humbler brethren. During the recent visit of the Shah of Persia,\r\nthat potentate discovered that BUCKSHISH was by no means peculiar to the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n~Budge~, to move, to \xe2\x80\x9cmake tracks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Budge~, strong drink; BUDGY, drunk; BUDGING-KEN, a public-house; \xe2\x80\x9ccove\r\nof the BUDGING-KEN,\xe2\x80\x9d the landlord. Probably a corruption of BOOZE.\r\nProbably also, on the lucus a non lucendo principle, because its use\r\nmade one incapable of budging.\r\n\r\n~Buff~, the bare skin; \xe2\x80\x9cstripped to the BUFF.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Buff~, to swear to, or accuse; generally used in reference to a\r\nwrongful accusation, as, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, BUFF it on to him.\xe2\x80\x9d _Old_ word for\r\nboasting, 1582.\r\n\r\n~Buffer~, a navy term for a boatswain\xe2\x80\x99s mate, one of whose duties it\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94or was\xe2\x80\x94to administer the \xe2\x80\x9ccat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Buffer~, a familiar expression for a jolly acquaintance, probably from\r\nthe _French_ BOUFFARD, a fool or clown; a \xe2\x80\x9cjolly old BUFFER,\xe2\x80\x9d said of a\r\ngood-humoured or liberal old man. In 1737, a BUFFER was a \xe2\x80\x9crogue that\r\nkilled good sound horses for the sake of their skins, by running a long\r\nwire into them.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Bacchus and Venus._ The term was once applied to\r\nthose who took false oaths for a consideration; but though the word has\r\nfallen into disuse there is no particular reason for imagining that the\r\npractice has.\r\n\r\n~Buffer~, a woman employed in a Sheffield warehouse to give the final\r\npolish to goods previously to their being plated.\r\n\r\n~Buffer~, a dog. Dogs\xe2\x80\x99 skins were formerly in great request\xe2\x80\x94hence the\r\nterm BUFF, meaning in old English _to skin_. It is still used in the\r\nring, BUFFED meaning stripped naked, though the term BUFF, as applied to\r\nthe skin, is most likely due to its resemblance to the leather so\r\ncalled. \xe2\x80\x9cStripped to the BUFF,\xe2\x80\x9d cannot have any reference to dog\r\nskinning, though it may have originally referred to the BUFF jerkins\r\nworn under defensive armour. In Irish cant, BUFFER is a _boxer_. The\r\nBUFFER of a railway-carriage doubtless received its very appropriate\r\nname from the old pugilistic application of this term.\r\n\r\n~Buffle-Head~, a stupid or obtuse person.\xe2\x80\x94_Miege._ _German_,\r\nBUFFELHAUPT, buffalo-headed. Occurs in _Plautus\xe2\x80\x99 Comedies made English_,\r\n1694.\r\n\r\n~Buffs~, the Third Regiment of Foot in the British army. From their\r\nfacings.\r\n\r\n~Buffy~, intoxicated.\r\n\r\n~Buggy~, a gig, or light chaise. Common term in America and in India, as\r\nwell as in England.\r\n\r\n~Bug-Hunter~, a low wretch who plunders drunken men.\r\n\r\n~Bug-Walk~, a coarse term for a bed.\r\n\r\n~Build~, applied in fashionable slang to the make or style of dress, &c.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tidy BUILD, who made it?\xe2\x80\x9d A tailor is sometimes called a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctrousers\xe2\x80\x99 BUILDER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Bulger~, large; synonymous with BUSTER.\r\n\r\n~Bulky~, a constable.\xe2\x80\x94_North._\r\n\r\n~Bull~, one who agrees to purchase stock at a future day, at a stated\r\nprice, but who simply speculates for a rise in public securities to\r\nrender the transaction a profitable one. Should stocks fall, the BULL is\r\nthen called upon to pay the difference. _See_ BEAR, who is the opposite\r\nof a BULL, the former selling, the latter purchasing\xe2\x80\x94the one operating\r\nfor a _fall_, the other for a _rise_.\r\n\r\n~Bull~, a crown-piece, formerly BULL\xe2\x80\x99S EYE. _See_ WORK.\r\n\r\n~Bull~, term amongst prisoners for the meat served to them in jail. Also\r\nvery frequently used instead of the word beef. The costermonger often\r\nspeaks of his dinner, when he has beef, as a \xe2\x80\x9cbit o\xe2\x80\x99 BULL,\xe2\x80\x9d without any\r\nreference to its being either tough or tender, but he never speaks of\r\nmutton as \xe2\x80\x9csheep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Bull-Beef~, a term of contempt; \xe2\x80\x9cas ugly as BULL-BEEF,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgo to the\r\nbilly-fencer, and sell yourself for BULL-BEEF.\xe2\x80\x9d Sometimes used to\r\nindicate full size of anything. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was he, as big as BULL-BEEF.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Bulldogs~, the runners who accompany the proctor in his perambulations,\r\nand give chase to runaways.\xe2\x80\x94_University._\r\n\r\n~Bullet~, to discharge from a situation. To shake the BULLET at anyone,\r\nis to threaten him with \xe2\x80\x9cthe sack,\xe2\x80\x9d but not to give him actual notice to\r\nleave. To get the BULLET is to get notice, while to get the instant\r\nBULLET is to be discharged upon the spot. The use of the term is most\r\nprobably derived from a fancied connexion between it and the word\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n~Bullfinch~, a hunting term for a large, thick, quickset hedge,\r\ndifficult alike to \xe2\x80\x9ctop\xe2\x80\x9d or burst through. Probably a corruption of\r\nBULL-FENCE, a fence made to prevent cattle straying either in or out.\r\n\r\n~Bull the Cask~, to pour hot water into an empty rum puncheon, and let\r\nit stand until it extracts the spirit from the wood. The mixture is\r\ndrunk by sailors in default of something stronger.\xe2\x80\x94_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Bully~, a braggart; in the language of the streets, a man of the most\r\ndegraded morals, who protects fallen females, and lives off their\r\nmiserable earnings.\xe2\x80\x94_Shakspeare_, in _A Midsummer Night\xe2\x80\x99s Dream_, uses\r\nthe word in its old form, as a term of endearment. This epithet is often\r\napplied in a commendable sense among the vulgar; thus\xe2\x80\x94a good fellow or\r\na good horse will be termed \xe2\x80\x9ca BULLY fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca BULLY horse;\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nBULLY woman\xe2\x80\x9d signifies a right, good motherly old soul. Among Americans,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBULLY for you,\xe2\x80\x9d is a commendatory phrase, and \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s BULLY\xe2\x80\x9d is a\r\nhighly eulogistic term.\r\n\r\n~Bullyrag~, to abuse or scold vehemently; to swindle one out of money by\r\nintimidation and sheer abuse.\r\n\r\n~Bum~, the part on which we sit.\xe2\x80\x94_Shakspeare._ BUMBAGS, trousers;\r\n_Gael._ BUN, a base or bottom; _Welsh_, BON, the lowest or worst part of\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n~Bum-Bailiff~, a sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s-officer\xe2\x80\x94a term, some say, derived from the\r\nproximity which this gentleman generally maintains to his victims.\r\nBlackstone says it is a corruption of \xe2\x80\x9cbound bailiff.\xe2\x80\x9d A BUM-BAILIFF was\r\ngenerally called \xe2\x80\x9cbummy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Bumble~, to muffle. BUMBLE-FOOTED, club-footed, or awkward in the gait.\r\n\r\n~Bumble~, a beadle. Adopted from _Dickens\xe2\x80\x99s_ character in _Oliver\r\nTwist_. This and \xe2\x80\x9cBUMBLEDOM\xe2\x80\x9d are now common.\r\n\r\n~Bumble-Puppy~, a game played in public-houses on a large stone, placed\r\nin a slanting direction, on the lower end of which holes are excavated,\r\nand numbered like the holes in a bagatelle-table. The player rolls a\r\nstone ball, or marble, from the higher end, and according to the number\r\nof the hole it falls into the game is counted. It is undoubtedly the\r\nvery ancient game of _Troule-in-madame_.\r\n\r\n~Bumbles~, coverings for the eyes of horses that shy in harness.\r\n\r\n~Bumbrusher~, an usher at a school.\r\n\r\n~Bumclink~, in the Midland counties the inferior beer brewed for\r\nhaymakers and harvest labourers. Derivation obvious.\r\n\r\n~Bum-Curtain~, an old name for academical gowns when they were worn\r\nscant and short, especially those of the students of St. John\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCollege.\xe2\x80\x94_Camb. Univ._ Any ragged or short academical gown.\r\n\r\n~Bummarees~, a term given to a class of speculating salesmen at\r\nBillingsgate market, not recognised as such by the trade, but who get a\r\nliving by buying large quantities of fish from the salesmen and\r\nre-selling them to smaller buyers. The word has been used in the\r\nstatutes and bye-laws of the market for upwards of 200 years. It has\r\nbeen variously derived. Some persons think it may be from the _French_\r\nBONNE MAR\xc3\x89E, good fresh fish! \xe2\x80\x9cMar\xc3\xa9e signifie toute sorte de poisson de\r\nmer qui n\xe2\x80\x99est pas sale; bonne mar\xc3\xa9e\xe2\x80\x94_mar\xc3\xa9e fra\xc3\xaeche_, vendeur de\r\nmar\xc3\xa9e.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Dict. de l\xe2\x80\x99Acad. Franc._ The BUMMAREES are accused of many\r\ntrade tricks. One of them is to blow up codfish with a pipe until they\r\nlook double their actual size. Of course when the fish come to table\r\nthey are flabby, sunken, and half dwindled away. In Norwich, to BUMMAREE\r\none is to run up a score at a public-house just open, and is equivalent\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9crunning into debt with one.\xe2\x80\x9d One of the advertisements issued by Hy.\r\nRobinson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cOffice,\xe2\x80\x9d over against Threadneedle Street, was this:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cTouching Advice from the OFFICE, you are desired to give and take\r\n    notice as followeth:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOF Monies to be taken up, or delivered on _Botto-maria_, commonly\r\n    called _Bomarie_.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOF money to be put out or taken upon interest,\xe2\x80\x9d &c.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x94_The Publick Intelligencer_, numb. 17, 25th June, 1660.\r\n\r\n~Bummer~, literally one who sits or idles about; a loafer; one who\r\nsponges upon his acquaintances. In California, men who profess to be\r\njournalists, and so obtain free dinners and drinks, are called \xe2\x80\x9cliterary\r\nBUMMERS.\xe2\x80\x9d Although the term is not much in use in this country, the\r\nprofession of bumming, both literary and otherwise, is freely practised.\r\n\r\n~Bumper~, according to Johnson from \xe2\x80\x9cbump,\xe2\x80\x9d but probably from _French_\r\nBON P\xc3\x88RE, the fixed toast in monastic life of old, now used for \xe2\x80\x9cfull\r\nmeasure.\xe2\x80\x9d A match at quoits, bowls, &c., may end in a \xe2\x80\x9cBUMPER game,\xe2\x80\x9d if\r\nthe play and score be all on one side. BUMPER is used in sporting and\r\ntheatrical circles to denote a benefit which is one in reality as well\r\nas in name.\r\n\r\n~Bumptious~, arrogant, self-sufficient. One on very good terms with\r\nhimself is said to be BUMPTIOUS.\r\n\r\n~Bunce~, costermongers\xe2\x80\x99 perquisites; the money obtained by giving light\r\nweight, &c.; costermongers\xe2\x80\x99 goods sold by boys on commission. In fact\r\nanything which is clear profit or gain is said to be \xe2\x80\x9call BUNCE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nProbably a corruption of _bonus_; BONE, or BONER, being the slang for\r\ngood. BUNCE, _Grose_ gives as the cant word for money.\r\n\r\n~Bunch-of-Fives~, the hand, or fist.\r\n\r\n~Bundle~, \xe2\x80\x9cto BUNDLE a person off,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, to pack him off, send him\r\nflying.\r\n\r\n~Bundling~, men and women sleeping together, where the divisions of the\r\nhouse will not permit of better or more decent accommodation, with all\r\ntheir clothes on. BUNDLING was originally courting done in bed, the\r\nlovers being tied or bundled up to prevent undue familiarities. The\r\npractice still obtains in some parts of Wales.\r\n\r\n~Bung~, the landlord of a public-house. Much in use among sporting men.\r\n\r\n~Bung~, to give, pass, hand over, drink, or to perform almost any\r\naction.

The wretches\r\nhaving been apprehended and tried, Burke was executed, while Hare,\r\nhaving turned king\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, was released. Bishop and Williams were\r\ntheir London imitators. The term BURKE is now usually applied to any\r\nproject that is quietly stopped or stifled\xe2\x80\x94as \xe2\x80\x9cthe question has been\r\nBURKED.\xe2\x80\x9d A book suppressed before publication is said to be BURKED.\r\n\r\n~Burra~, great; as BURRA SAIB, a great man; BURRA KHANAII, a great\r\ndinner.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Bury a Moll~, to run away from a mistress.\r\n\r\n~Bus~, or BUSS, an abbreviation of \xe2\x80\x9comnibus,\xe2\x80\x9d a public carriage.

Whoever breaks the rule pays a fine, which is thrown on\r\nthe table, and the accumulation expended in drink for the company. _See_\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSNOOKS and WALKER\xe2\x80\x9d for more complicated varieties of a similar game.\r\nThese \xe2\x80\x9cparlour pastimes\xe2\x80\x9d are often not only funny, but positively\r\ningenious. But the Licensing Act and a zealous police are fast clearing\r\nthem all out.\r\n\r\n~Buz~, to pick pockets; BUZZING or BUZ-FAKING, robbing.\r\n\r\n~Buz-Bloke~, a pickpocket who principally confines his attention to\r\npurses and loose cash. _Grose_ gives BUZ-GLOAK, an ancient cant word.\r\nGLOAK was old cant for a man.

A\r\nspecimen ejaculation and moral waste-pipe for interior passion or wrath\r\nis seen in the exclamation\xe2\x80\x94BY THE EVER-LIVING JUMPING-MOSES\xe2\x80\x94a harmless\r\nand ridiculous phrase, that from its length is supposed to expend a\r\nconsiderable quantity of fiery anger.\r\n\r\n~By Jingo~, an oath or exclamation having no particular meaning, and no\r\npositive etymology, though it is believed by some that JINGO is derived\r\nfrom the Basque _jenco_, the devil.\r\n\r\n~Cab~, in statutory language, \xe2\x80\x9ca hackney carriage drawn by one horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAbbreviated from the _French_ CABRIOLET; originally meaning \xe2\x80\x9ca light low\r\nchaise.\xe2\x80\x9d The wags of Paris playing upon the word (quasi _cabri_ au lait)\r\nused to call a superior turn-out of the kind a _cabri au cr\xc3\xaame_. Our\r\nabbreviation, which certainly smacks of slang, has been stamped with the\r\nauthority of the Legislature, and has been honoured by universal custom.\r\n\r\n~Cab~, to stick together, to muck, or tumble up.\xe2\x80\x94_Devonshire._\r\n\r\n~Cabbage~, pieces of cloth said to be purloined by tailors.

Apparently from CAGER,\r\nor GAGER, the _old Cant_ term for a man. The exclusives at the English\r\nUniversities apply the term CAD to all non-members. It has also been\r\nsuggested that the word may be a contraction of the _French_ CADET.\r\n\r\n~Cad~, an omnibus conductor. Of late years the term has been generically\r\napplied to the objectionable class immortalized by Thackeray under the\r\ntitle of snob. A great deal of caddism is, however, perpetrated by those\r\nwho profess to have the greatest horror of it\xe2\x80\x94the upper classes\xe2\x80\x94a fact\r\nwhich goes far to prove that it is impossible to fairly ascribe a\r\ndistinctive feature to any grade of society.\r\n\r\n~Cadge~, to beg in an artful, wheedling manner.\xe2\x80\x94_North._ In Scotland to\r\nCADGE is to wander, to go astray. _See_ under CODGER.\r\n\r\n~Cadging~, begging, generally with an eye to pilfering when an\r\nopportunity occurs.

A correspondent at Trinity College, Dublin, considers\r\nthis as originally a University slang term for a _bad cook_, \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xce\xba\xe1\xbd\xb8\xcf\x82\r\n\xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb1\xce\xb3\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82.

Leg., for the curious facility with\r\nwhich the lower classes in England adopt foreign words as slang and cant\r\nterms. _Italian_, CAMICIA. This latter is the more likely etymology, as\r\nanyone who visits the various quarters where Irish, Italians, and a\r\nmongrel mixture of half-a-dozen races congregate and pig together, will\r\nadmit.\r\n\r\n~Camister~, a preacher, clergyman, or master.\r\n\r\n~Canary~, a sovereign.

This would seem to have been originally a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d for the police-court; drunkenness, &c. Among young ladies at\r\nboarding-schools a CASE means a love-affair. CASE now means any\r\nunfortunate matter. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s a CASE with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Case~, a bad crown-piece. HALF-A-CASE, a counterfeit half-crown. There\r\nare two sources, either of which may have contributed this slang term.\r\nCASER is the Hebrew word for a crown; and silver coin is frequently\r\ncounterfeited by coating or CASING pewter or iron imitations with\r\nsilver. Possibly from its being \xe2\x80\x9ca CASE\xe2\x80\x9d with the unfortunate owner.\r\n\r\n~Cask~, fashionable slang for a brougham, or other private carriage. Not\r\nvery general. \xe2\x80\x9cPILLBOX\xe2\x80\x9d is the more usual term.\r\n\r\n~Cassam~, cheese\xe2\x80\x94not CAFFAN, which Egan, in his edition of _Grose_, has\r\nridiculously inserted.\xe2\x80\x94_Ancient Cant._ _Latin_, CASEUS. _Gael._ and\r\n_Irish_, CAISE.\r\n\r\n~Cast~, to assist by lightening labour. Men in small boats who want to\r\nbe towed behind steamers or sailing vessels, say \xe2\x80\x9cGive us a CAST.\xe2\x80\x9d Also\r\nused by waggoners and others, who sometimes vary the performance by\r\nasking, when stuck on a hill, for a pound, possibly a pound of flesh,\r\nhorse or human.\r\n\r\n~Cast up Accounts~, to vomit.\xe2\x80\x94_Old._\r\n\r\n~Castor~, a hat. Mostly used in pugilistic circles. Indeed many\r\nhangers-on of the P.R. have considered that the term arose from the\r\ncustom of casting the hat into the ring, before entering oneself. CASTOR\r\nwas the _Latin_ name for the animal now known as the BEAVER; and,\r\nstrange to add, BEAVER was the slang for CASTOR, or hat, many years ago,\r\nbefore gossamer came into fashion.\r\n\r\n~Cat~, a lady\xe2\x80\x99s muff; \xe2\x80\x9cto free a CAT,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, steal a muff.\r\n\r\n~Cat~, to vomit like a cat.

A piece of\r\npaper smeared with a sweet sticky substance which is spread about where\r\nflies most abound, and in this sense not particularly humane.

Anything a cat will\r\ndrink is very innocuous.\r\n\r\n~Cats and Dogs.~ It is said to rain cats and dogs when a shower is\r\nexceptionally heavy.

Strange as it may appear, there are\r\nactually two men in London at the present day who gain their living in\r\nthis way. Very recently they were singing before the establishment of a\r\nfashionable tailor in Regent Street; and not long since they were\r\nbawling their doggrel rhymes outside the mansion of a Norfolk M.P., in\r\nBelgravia.[57]\r\n\r\n~Chaunters~, those street sellers of ballads, last copies of verses, and\r\nother broadsheets, who sang or bawled the contents of their papers.

The\r\npopular idea is that the inverse method of auctioneering saves them\r\npaying for the auction licence.\xe2\x80\x94_See_ DUTCH AUCTION.\r\n\r\n~Checks~, counters used in games at cards. In the Pacific States of\r\nAmerica a man who is dead is said to have handed (or passed) in his\r\nchecks.

It\r\ntakes its origin in a very common expression of half-caste females,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCHEE-CHEE,\xe2\x80\x9d equivalent to our Oh, fie!\xe2\x80\x94Nonsense!\xe2\x80\x94For\r\nshame!\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Cheek~, share or portion; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x99s my CHEEK?\xe2\x80\x9d where is my allowance?\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll to his own CHEEK,\xe2\x80\x9d all to himself.\r\n\r\n~Cheek~, impudence, assurance; CHEEKY, saucy or forward.\r\n\r\n~Cheek~, to irritate by impudence, to accuse.\r\n\r\n~Cheek by Jowl~, side by side\xe2\x80\x94said often of persons in such close\r\nconfabulation that their faces almost touch.\r\n\r\n~Cheese~, anything good, first-rate in quality, genuine, pleasant, or\r\nadvantageous, is termed the CHEESE. The _London Guide_, 1818, says it\r\nwas from some young fellows translating \xe2\x80\x9cc\xe2\x80\x99est une autre CHOSE\xe2\x80\x9d into\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat is another CHEESE.\xe2\x80\x9d But the expression CHEESE may be found in the\r\nGipsy vocabulary, and in the Hindostanee and Persian languages. In the\r\nlast CHIZ means a thing\xe2\x80\x94that is the thing, _i.e._, the CHEESE.\r\n\r\n~Cheese~, or CHEESE IT (evidently a corruption of _cease_), leave off,\r\nor have done; \xe2\x80\x9cCHEESE your barrikin,\xe2\x80\x9d hold your noise.

Caps fitted with square peaks are called cheesecutter caps.\r\n\r\n~Cheesemongers~, once a popular name for the First Lifeguards. Until the\r\nPeninsular War the First Lifeguards, from their almost exclusive service\r\nat home, were nicknamed CHEESEMONGERS. This term then fell into\r\ndesuetude; but at Waterloo the commanding officer of the regiment had\r\nnot forgotten it, and when leading his men to the charge, called out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, you damned CHEESEMONGERS!\xe2\x80\x9d an invitation complied with so\r\nreadily, that the title was restored, with the difference that it was no\r\nlonger a word of reproach.\r\n\r\n~Cheesy~, fine or showy. The opposite of \xe2\x80\x9cdusty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Cherry-bums~, or CHERUBIMS, a nickname given to the 11th Hussars, from\r\ntheir crimson trousers.\r\n\r\n~Cherry-colour~, either red or black, as you wish; a term used in a\r\ncheating trick at cards. When the cards are being dealt, a knowing one\r\noffers to bet that he will tell the colour of the turn-up card. \xe2\x80\x9cDone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays Mr. Green. The sum being named, Mr. Sharp affirms that it will be\r\nCHERRY-COLOUR; and as cherries are either black or red, he wins, leaving\r\nhis victim a wiser man, it is to be hoped, and not a _better_ for the\r\nfuture. It may be as well for the habitually unfortunate to know that\r\nwagers of this kind are not recoverable even according to the sporting\r\ncode, which disacknowledges all kinds of catch-bets.\r\n\r\n~Cherry-merry~, a present of money. CHERRY-MERRY-BAMBOO, a\r\nbeating.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Cherubs~, or still more vulgarly, CHERUBIMS, the chorister boys who\r\nchaunt in the services at the abbeys and cathedrals. Possibly because in\r\nsome places their heads alone are visible.\r\n\r\n~Cheshire Cat~, to grin like a CHESHIRE CAT, to display the teeth and\r\ngums when laughing. Formerly the phrase was \xe2\x80\x9cto grin like a CHESHIRE CAT\r\neating cheese.\xe2\x80\x9d A hardly satisfactory explanation has been given of this\r\nphrase\xe2\x80\x94that Cheshire is a county palatine, and the cats, when they\r\nthink of it, are so tickled with the notion that they can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\ngrinning.[59]\r\n\r\n~Chicken~, a term applied to anything young, small, or insignificant;\r\nCHICKEN STAKES, small paltry stakes; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s no CHICKEN,\xe2\x80\x9d said of an old\r\nmaid.\r\n\r\n~Chicken-hearted~, cowardly, fearful.

This at first seems like reversing the order\r\nof things, but it is only a contraction of \xe2\x80\x9ctake the CHILL off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Chimney-Sweep~, the aperient mixture commonly called a _black draught_.\r\n\r\n~Chin-chin~, a salutation, a compliment.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Chink~, or CHINKERS, money.\xe2\x80\x94_Ancient._ Derivation obvious.\r\n\r\n~Chin-wag~, officious impertinence.\r\n\r\n~Chip of the Old Block~, a child which physically or morally resembles\r\nits father.

Probably a corruption from the _Lingua Franca_.\r\nPerhaps from CHEVAULCHER.\r\n\r\n~Chive~, or CHIVEY, a shout, a halloo, or cheer; loud tongued. Probably\r\nfrom CHEVY-CHASE, a boy\xe2\x80\x99s game, in which the word CHEVY is bawled aloud.\r\nDickens uses the word CHIVEY in _Bleak House_ rather freely, but there\r\nit is from the other phase of CHEVY-CHASE which follows.\r\n\r\n~Chive~, a knife; also used as a verb, to knife. In all these cases the\r\nword is pronounced as though written CHIV or CHIVVY.\r\n\r\n~Chive-Fencer~, a street hawker of cutlery.\r\n\r\n~Chivey~, to chase round, or hunt about. Apparently from\r\nCHEVY-CHASE.\xe2\x80\x94_See_ above.\r\n\r\n~Choakee~, or CHOKEY, the black hole.\xe2\x80\x94_Military Anglo-Indian._ Chokey\r\nis also very vulgar slang for prison.\r\n\r\n~Chock-Full~, full till the scale comes down with a shock.

Possibly the idea is from the fact that,\r\nif a cock wins a fight, he will mount on anything near, and crow lustily\r\nand jubilantly.

The term comes from the \xe2\x80\x9ccocked-hat\xe2\x80\x9d placed\r\nbefore the president at the sittings. There was another cocked-hat club\r\nin London not many years back, which had nothing peculiar about it\r\nbeyond the fact that every member wore during club sittings, a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfore-and-aft\xe2\x80\x9d cocked-hat. Otherwise the proceedings were of the most\r\nordinary kind.\r\n\r\n~Cocked-hat-shaped~, shapeless: Anything which has been altered beyond\r\nrecognition, or any man who has been put completely _hors de combat_, is\r\nsaid to have been knocked into a COCKED-HAT.\r\n\r\n~Cocker~, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all right, according to Cocker,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning that\r\neverything has been done in accordance with the present system of\r\nfigures. The phrase refers to the celebrated writing-master of Charles\r\nII.\xe2\x80\x99s time, whose Arithmetic, Dictionary, &c., were long the standard\r\nauthorities. The Arithmetic was first published in 1677-8, and, though\r\nit reached more than sixty editions, is considered a very scarce book.\r\nProfessor de Morgan says that the main goodness of Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s _Tutor_\r\nconsists in his adopting the abbreviated system of division; and\r\nsuggests that it became a proverbial representative of arithmetic from\r\nMurphy\xe2\x80\x99s farce of _The Apprentice_, 1756, in which the strong point of\r\nthe old merchant, Wingate, is his extreme reverence for Cocker and his\r\narithmetic. A curious fact may here be mentioned in connexion with this\r\nsaying. It has been stated, and very well proved, that many words\r\npopular in Shakspeare\xe2\x80\x99s time, and now obsolete in this country, are\r\nstill in every-day use in the older English settlements of North\r\nAmerica. The original compiler of this work was surprised, when\r\ntravelling through Western Canada, to find that, instead of the renowned\r\nCocker, the people appealed to another and more learned authority.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to Gunter,\xe2\x80\x9d is a phrase in continual Transatlantic use. This\r\nscientific worthy invented the sector in 1606; and in 1623, about the\r\ntime of the great Puritan exodus to North America, he brought out his\r\nfamous _Rule of Proportion_. This was popularly known as Gunter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nProportion, or _Gunter\xe2\x80\x99s Line_, and the term soon became a vulgar\r\nstandard of appeal in cases of doubt or dispute.\r\n\r\n~Cock-eye~, a term of opprobrium often applied to one that squints.\r\n\r\n~Cockles~, \xe2\x80\x9cto rejoice the COCKLES of one\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\xe2\x80\x9d a vulgar phrase\r\nimplying great pleasure. Also, to \xe2\x80\x9cwarm one\xe2\x80\x99s COCKLES,\xe2\x80\x9d said of any hot,\r\nwell-spiced drink, taken in cold weather. COCKLES altogether seem to be\r\nan imaginary portion\xe2\x80\x94of great importance\xe2\x80\x94in the internal economy of\r\nthe human frame.\r\n\r\n~Cockney~, a native of London. Originally, a spoilt or effeminate boy,\r\nderived from COCKERING, or foolishly petting a person, rendering him of\r\nsoft and luxurious manners. Halliwell states, in his admirable essay\r\nupon the word, that \xe2\x80\x9csome writers trace the word with much probability\r\nto the imaginary land of COCKAYGNE, the lubber land of the olden times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGrose gives Minsheu\xe2\x80\x99s absurd but comical derivation:\xe2\x80\x94A citizen of\r\nLondon being in the country, and hearing a horse neigh, exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord! how that horse laughs!\xe2\x80\x9d A bystander informed him that the noise\r\nwas called neighing. The next morning when the cock crowed, the citizen,\r\nto show that he had not forgotten what was told him, cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nhear how the COCK NEIGHS?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_See_ MARE\xe2\x80\x99S NEST.\r\n\r\n~Cock of the walk~, a master spirit, head of a party. Places where\r\npoultry are fed are called WALKS, and the barn door cocks invariably\r\nfight for the supremacy till one has obtained it. At schools where this\r\nphrase was originally much used, it has been diminished to \xe2\x80\x9cCOCK\xe2\x80\x9d only.\r\n\r\n~Cock one\xe2\x80\x99s toes~, to die. Otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cturn-up one\xe2\x80\x99s toes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Cock-robin shop~, a small printing-office, where cheap and nasty work\r\nis done and low wages are paid.\r\n\r\n~Cocks~, fictitious narratives, in verse or prose, of murders, fires,\r\nand terrible accidents, sold in the streets as true accounts. The man\r\nwho hawks them, a patterer, often changes the scene of the awful event\r\nto suit the taste of the neighbourhood he is trying to delude. Possibly\r\na corruption of _cook_, a cooked statement, or maybe \xe2\x80\x9cthe story of a\r\ncock and a bull\xe2\x80\x9d may have had something to do with the term.\r\nImprovements in newspapers, especially in those published in the\r\nevening, and increased scepticism on the part of the public, have\r\ndestroyed this branch of a once-flourishing business.\r\n\r\n~Cockshy~, a game at fairs and races, where trinkets are set upon\r\nsticks, and for one penny three throws at them are accorded, the thrower\r\nkeeping whatever he knocks off. From the ancient game of throwing or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshying\xe2\x80\x9d at live cocks. Any prominent person abused in the newspapers is\r\nsaid to be a common COCKSHY.\r\n\r\n~Cocksure~, certain.\r\n\r\n~Cocky~, pert, saucy.\r\n\r\n~Cocoa-nut~, the head. A pugilistic term. Also, when anything is\r\nexplained to a man for the first time, it is not unusual for him to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that accounts for the milk in the cocoa-nut\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a remark which has\r\nits origin in a clever but not very moral story.\r\n\r\n~Cocum~, shrewdness, ability, luck; \xe2\x80\x9cJack\xe2\x80\x99s got COCUM, he\xe2\x80\x99s safe to get\r\non, he is,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94viz., he starts under favourable circumstances; \xe2\x80\x9cto fight\r\nCOCUM\xe2\x80\x9d is to be wily and cautious. Allied perhaps to the Scottish KEEK,\r\n_German_, GUCKEN, to peep or pry into.\r\n\r\n~Cod~, to hoax, to take a \xe2\x80\x9crise\xe2\x80\x9d out of one. Used as a noun, a fool.\r\n\r\n~Coddam~, a public-house game, much affected by medical students and\r\ncabmen, generally three on each side. The game is \xe2\x80\x9csimplicity itself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut requires a great amount of low cunning and peculiar mental\r\ningenuity. It consists in guessing in which of the six hands displayed\r\non the table, a small piece of marked money lies hid. If the guesser\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbrings it home,\xe2\x80\x9d his side takes the \xe2\x80\x9cpiece,\xe2\x80\x9d and the centre man \xe2\x80\x9cworks\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nit. If the guess is wrong, a chalk is taken to the holders, who again\r\nsecrete the coin. Great fun is to be obtained from this game when it is\r\nproperly played.\r\n\r\n~Codds~, the \xe2\x80\x9cpoor brethren\xe2\x80\x9d of the Charter House. In _The Newcomes_,\r\nThackeray writes, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cistercian lads call these old gentlemen CODDS; I\r\nknow not wherefore.\xe2\x80\x9d A probable abbreviation of CODGER.\r\n\r\n~Codger~, or COGER, an old man; \xe2\x80\x9ca rum old CODGER,\xe2\x80\x9d a curious old\r\nfellow. CODGER is sometimes used as synonymous with CADGER, and then\r\nsignifies a person who gets his living in a questionable manner.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCOGERS,\xe2\x80\x9d the name of a debating society, formerly held in Shoe Lane,\r\nFleet Street, and still in existence. The term is probably a corruption\r\nof COGITATORS.\r\n\r\n~Coffee-Shop~, a watercloset, or house of office.\r\n\r\n~Cog~, to cheat at dice.\xe2\x80\x94_Shakspeare._ Also, to agree with, as one\r\ncog-wheel does with another, to crib from another\xe2\x80\x99s book, as schoolboys\r\noften do. This is called \xe2\x80\x9ccogging over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Cogged~, loaded like false dice. Any one who has been hocussed or\r\ncheated is sometimes said to have been COGGED.\r\n\r\n~Coin~, \xe2\x80\x9cto post the COIN\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94sometimes \xe2\x80\x9cpost the coal\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a sporting phrase\r\nmeaning to make a deposit of money for a match of any kind.\r\n\r\n~Cold blood~, a house licensed for the sale of beer \xe2\x80\x9cNOT to be drunk on\r\nthe premises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Cold coffee~, misfortune; sometimes varied to COLD GRUEL. An unpleasant\r\nreturn for a proffered kindness is sometimes called COLD COFFEE.\xe2\x80\x94_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Cold coffee~, an Oxford synonym for a \xe2\x80\x9csell,\xe2\x80\x9d which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Cold cook~, an undertaker. Cold cook\xe2\x80\x99s shop, an undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n~Cold meat~, a corpse. COLD-MEAT BOX, a coffin.\r\n\r\n~Cold meat train~, the last train at night by which officers can reach\r\nAldershot per South Western Railway. So called because by this train\r\ncorpses are often conveyed on account of the Necropolis Company to\r\nWoking.\r\n\r\n~Cold shoulder~, \xe2\x80\x9cto show or give any one the COLD SHOULDER\xe2\x80\x9d is to \xe2\x80\x9ccut\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin a modified form, to assume a distant manner towards anybody, to\r\nevince a desire to cease acquaintanceship. Sometimes termed \xe2\x80\x9cCOLD\r\nSHOULDER of mutton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Colfabias~, a Latinized Irish phrase signifying the closet of decency,\r\napplied as a slang term to a place of resort in Trinity College, Dublin.\r\n\r\n~Collar~, \xe2\x80\x9cout of COLLAR,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, out of place, no work. Probably a\r\nvariation of the metaphorical expressions, \xe2\x80\x9cin, or out of harness,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n_i.e._, in or out of work\xe2\x80\x94the horse being in collar when harnessed for\r\nhis work. COLLAR work is any very hard work, from the expression among\r\ndrivers. Any uphill journey is said to be all \xe2\x80\x9cCOLLAR work\xe2\x80\x9d for the\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n~Collar~, to seize, to lay hold of. Thieves\xe2\x80\x99 slang, _i.e._, to steal.\r\n\r\n~Collar and elbow~, a term for a peculiar style of wrestling\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nCornwall and Devon style.\r\n\r\n~Collections~, the College examinations at the end of each term, when\r\nundergraduates wear white ties and bands, and are trotted through the\r\nsubjects of the term\xe2\x80\x99s lecture.

Connected with \xe2\x80\x9ccolloquy\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccolleague.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe mixture of\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n~Colly-wobbles~, the stomach-ache, a person\xe2\x80\x99s bowels,\xe2\x80\x94supposed by many\r\nto be the seat of feeling and nutrition.\xe2\x80\x94_Devonshire._\r\n\r\n~Colour~, complexion, tint; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen the COLOUR of his money,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n_i.e._, he has never paid me any. In fortune-telling by cards, a\r\n_diamond colour_ is the fairest; _heart-colour_, fair, but not so fair\r\nas the last; _club colour_, rather dark; _spade colour_, an extremely\r\nswarthy complexion.\r\n\r\n~Colour~, a handkerchief worn by each of the supporters of a\r\nprofessional athlete on the day of a match, so as to distinguish them\r\nfrom the partizans of the other side. The professional chooses his\r\ncolours, and his backers, and as many of the general public as can be\r\npersuaded to do so, take one each to wear on the eventful day, the\r\nunderstanding being that the man is to be paid, say, a guinea if he\r\nwins, and nothing if he loses. Some of these handkerchiefs used to be,\r\nin the palmy days of pugilism and professional rowing on the Thames,\r\nvery fine specimens of work; but as their purveyors expected to be paid\r\nwhether they won or lost, and as the price was generally about four\r\ntimes the intrinsic value, colours are rather shyly dealt with now. The\r\ncustom is, however, a very ancient one, and such men as Tom Sayers, Tom\r\nKing, Harry Kelley, and Bob Chambers have, even in these degenerate\r\ndays, received very large sums for their winning colours.\r\n\r\n~Colt~, a murderous weapon, formed by slinging a small shot to the end\r\nof a rather stiff piece of rope.

Also, in pugilistic phraseology, to COME IT means to show\r\nfear; and in this respect, as well as in that of giving information, the\r\nexpression \xe2\x80\x9cCOME IT\xe2\x80\x9d is best known to the lower and most dangerous\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n~Come down~, to pay down.\r\n\r\n~Commemoration~, the end of Lent term at Oxford, when honorary degrees\r\nare conferred and certain prizes given, and when men have friends \xe2\x80\x9cup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Commission~, a shirt.\xe2\x80\x94_Ancient Cant._ _Italian_, CAMICIA.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAs from our beds, we doe oft cast our eyes,\r\n    Cleane linnen yeelds a shirt before we rise,\r\n    Which is a garment _shifting_ in condition;\r\n    And in the _canting tongue_ is a COMMISSION.\r\n    In weale or woe, in joy or dangerous drifts,\r\n    A _shirt_ will put a man unto his _shifts_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n        \xe2\x80\x94_Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s Works_, 1630.\r\n\r\nFor further particulars, _see_ CAMESA.\r\n\r\n~Commister~, a chaplain or clergyman.\xe2\x80\x94Originally _Old Cant_.\r\n\r\n~Common sewer~, a DRAIN,\xe2\x80\x94vulgar equivalent for a drink.\r\n\r\n~Commons~, the allowance of anything sent out of the buttery or kitchen.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA COMMONS of bread,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cof cheese,\xe2\x80\x9d for instance.\xe2\x80\x94_University._ SHORT\r\nCOMMONS (derived from the University slang term), a scanty meal, a\r\nscarcity.\r\n\r\n~Competition wallah~, one who entered the Indian Civil Service by\r\npassing a competitive examination.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Compo~, a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s term for his monthly advance of wages.\r\n\r\n~Comprador~, a purveyor, an agent.\xe2\x80\x94_Originally Spanish, now\r\nAnglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Concaves and convexes~, a pack of cards contrived for cheating, by\r\ncutting all the cards from the two to the seven concave, and all from\r\nthe eight to the king convex.

Pierce Egan, in his _Life in London_, is responsible for a\r\ndeal of the modern use of this word; and after him _Bell\xe2\x80\x99s Life_, as the\r\noracle of Corinthian sport, was not idle.\r\n\r\n~Cork~, a broken man, a bankrupt.

Corruption of the _Old English_ word KERSE,\r\na small sour wild cherry; _French_, CERISE; _German_, KIRSCH. _Vision of\r\nPiers Ploughman_:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWisdom and witt nowe is _not worth_ a KERSE,\r\n    But if it be carded with cootis as clothers\r\n    Kembe their woole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe expression \xe2\x80\x9cnot worth a CURSE,\xe2\x80\x9d used frequently nowadays, is\r\ntherefore not properly profane, though it is frequently intensified by a\r\nprofane expletive. Horne Tooke says from KERSE, or CRESS. The expression\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnot worth a tinker\xe2\x80\x99s CURSE,\xe2\x80\x9d may or may not have arisen from\r\nmisapplication of the word\xe2\x80\x99s origin, though as now used it certainly\r\nmeans curse in its usual sense. Tinkers do curse, unfortunately, and it\r\nwill take a good deal of school-board work to educate them out of it, as\r\nwell as a fair amount of time. The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnot worth a tinker\xe2\x80\x99s damn,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nis evidently a variation of this, unless indeed it should be spelt\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdam,\xe2\x80\x9d and used as a reference to the general worthlessness of the wives\r\nand mothers of tinkers. This latter is merely offered to those who are\r\nspeculative in such matters, and is not advanced as an opinion.\r\n\r\n~Curse of Scotland~, the Nine of Diamonds. Various hypotheses have been\r\nset up as to this appellation\xe2\x80\x94that it was the card on which the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cButcher Duke\xe2\x80\x9d wrote a cruel order with respect to the rebels after the\r\nbattle of Culloden; that the diamonds are the nine lozenges in the arms\r\nof Dalrymple, Earl of Stair, detested for his share in the Massacre of\r\nGlencoe; that it is a corruption of Cross of Scotland, the nine diamonds\r\nbeing arranged somewhat after the fashion of a St. Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s Cross. The\r\nfirst supposition is evidently erroneous, for in Dr. Houston\xe2\x80\x99s Memoirs\r\nof his own Lifetime, 1747, p. 92, the Jacobite ladies are stated to have\r\nnicknamed the Nine of Diamonds \xe2\x80\x9cthe Justice Clerk,\xe2\x80\x9d after the rebellion\r\nof 1715, in allusion to the Lord Justice-Clerk Ormistone, who, for his\r\nseverity in suppressing it, was called the Curse of Scotland. Gules a\r\ncross of lozenges were also the arms of Colonel Packer, who attended\r\nCharles I. on the scaffold, and commanded in Scotland afterwards with\r\ngreat severity.\xe2\x80\x94_See_ Chatto on the _Origin and History of Playing\r\nCards_, p. 267. The most probable explanation is, that in the game of\r\nPope Joan the nine of diamonds is the POPE, of whom the Scotch have an\r\nespecial horror.\r\n\r\n~Curtail~, to cut off. Originally a Cant word\xe2\x80\x94vide _Hudibras_, and\r\n_Bacchus and Venus_, 1737.

When cutting for a \xe2\x80\x9cturn-up,\xe2\x80\x9d the residuum is called the CUT.\r\n\r\n~Cut~, in theatrical language, means to strike out portions of a\r\ndramatic piece, so as to render it shorter for representation. A late\r\ntreasurer of one of the so-called Patent Theatres when asked his opinion\r\nof a new play, always gave utterance to the brief but safe piece of\r\ncriticism, \xe2\x80\x9cWants cutting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Cut~, tipsy.\xe2\x80\x94_Old._\r\n\r\n~Cut~, to compete in business; \xe2\x80\x9ca CUTTING trade,\xe2\x80\x9d one conducted on\r\ncompetitive principles, where the profits are very closely shaved.\r\n\r\n~Cut-throat~, a butcher, a cattle-slaughterer; a ruffian.\r\n\r\n~Cute~, sharp, cunning.

Most people will remember \xe2\x80\x9ckind old DADDY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Daffy~, gin. A term with monthly nurses, who are always extolling the\r\nvirtues of Daffy\xe2\x80\x99s Elixir, and who occasionally comfort themselves with\r\na stronger medicine under Daffy\xe2\x80\x99s name. Of late years the term has been\r\naltered to \xe2\x80\x9csoothing syrup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Dags~, feat or performance; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do your DAGS,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, I will do\r\nsomething that you cannot do.

DAISY-KICKER, or GROGHAM, was likewise the cant\r\nterm for a horse. The DAISY-KICKERS were sad rogues in the old posting\r\ndays; frequently the landlords rented the stables to them, as the only\r\nplan to make them return a profit.\r\n\r\n~Damage~, in the sense of recompense; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the DAMAGE?\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, what\r\nis to pay? or actually, what is the DAMAGE to my pocket?\r\n\r\n~Damper~, a shop till; to DRAW A DAMPER, _i.e._, rob a till.

According to the stories\r\nrelated of him, Dando would visit an oyster-room, devour an almost\r\nfabulous quantity of bivalves, with porter and bread and butter to\r\nmatch, and then calmly state that he had no money.\r\n\r\n~Dandy~, a fop, or fashionable nondescript. This word, in the sense of a\r\nfop, is of modern origin. Egan says it was first used in 1820, and Bee\r\nin 1816. Johnson does not mention it, although it is to be found in all\r\nlate dictionaries. DANDIES wore stays, studied a feminine style, and\r\ntried to undo their manhood by all manner of affectations which were not\r\nactually immoral. Lord Petersham headed them. At the present day dandies\r\nof this stamp have almost entirely disappeared, but the new school of\r\nmuscular Christians is not altogether faultless. The feminine of DANDY\r\nwas DANDIZETTE, but the term only lived for a short season.\r\n\r\n~Dandy~, a small glass of whisky.\xe2\x80\x94_Irish._ \xe2\x80\x9cDimidium cyathi vero apud\r\nMetropolitanos Hibernicos dicitur DANDY.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Father Tom and the Pope_, in\r\n_Blackwood\xe2\x80\x99s Magazine_ for May 1838.\r\n\r\n~Dandy~, a boatman.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Dandypratt~, a funny little fellow, a mannikin; originally a\r\nhalf-farthing of the time of Henry VII.\r\n\r\n~Danna~, human ordure; DANNA DRAG, a nightman\xe2\x80\x99s or dustman\xe2\x80\x99s cart;\r\nhence DUNNA-KEN, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Darbies~, handcuffs.\xe2\x80\x94_Old Cant._\xe2\x80\x94_See_ JOHNNY DARBIES. Sir Walter\r\nScott mentions these, in the sense of fetters, in his _Peveril of the\r\nPeak_\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Hark ye! Jem Clink will fetch you the DARBIES.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Derby!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n    interrupted Julian, \xe2\x80\x98has the Earl or Countess\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d----\r\n\r\nHad Sir Walter known of any connexion between them and this family he\r\nwould undoubtedly have mentioned it. The mistake of Julian is corrected\r\nin the next paragraph. It is said that handcuffs were, when used to keep\r\ntwo prisoners together, called DARBIES and JOANS\xe2\x80\x94a term which would\r\nsoon be shortened as a natural consequence.\r\n\r\n~Darble~, the devil. _French_, DIABLE.\r\n\r\n~Dark~, \xe2\x80\x9ckeep it DARK,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, secret.

Literary and artistic work is often\r\nsaid to be full of DASH.\r\n\r\n~Dash~, an ejaculation, as \xe2\x80\x9cDASH my wig!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDASH my buttons!\xe2\x80\x9d A relic of\r\nthe attempts made, when cursing was fashionable, to be in the mode\r\nwithout using \xe2\x80\x9cbad words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Dashing~, showy, fast.\r\n\r\n~Daub~, in low language, an artist.

Latterly DAVY has become synonymous in street language with\r\nthe name of the Deity; \xe2\x80\x9cso help me DAVY,\xe2\x80\x9d generally rendered, \xe2\x80\x9cswelp my\r\nDAVY.\xe2\x80\x9d Slang version of the conclusion of the oath usually exacted of\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\n~Davy\xe2\x80\x99s locker~, or DAVY JONES\xe2\x80\x99S LOCKER, the sea, the common receptacle\r\nfor all things thrown overboard;\xe2\x80\x94a nautical phrase for death, is \xe2\x80\x9cgone\r\nto DAVY JONES\xe2\x80\x99S LOCKER,\xe2\x80\x9d which there means the other world.\xe2\x80\x94_See_\r\nDUFFY.\r\n\r\n~Dawdle~, to loiter, or fritter away time.\r\n\r\n~Dawk~, the post.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Daylights~, eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cto darken his DAYLIGHTS,\xe2\x80\x9d to give a person black\r\neyes.

The toast-master in such\r\ncases cries \xe2\x80\x9cno DAYLIGHTS or heeltaps!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Daze~, to confound or bewilder; an ancient form of dazzle used by\r\nSpenser, Drayton, &c. This is more obsolete English than slang, though\r\nits use nowadays might fairly bring it within the latter category.\r\n\r\n~Dead-against~, decidedly opposed to.\r\n\r\n~Dead-alive~, stupid, dull.\r\n\r\n~Dead-amiss~, said of a horse that from illness is utterly unable to run\r\nfor a prize.\r\n\r\n~Dead-beat~, utterly exhausted, utterly \xe2\x80\x9cdone up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Dead-heat~, when two horses run home so exactly equal that the judge\r\ncannot place one before the other; consequently, a DEAD-HEAT is a heat\r\nwhich counts for nothing, so far as the even runners are concerned, as\r\nit has to be run over again. When a race between dead-heaters has been\r\nunusually severe, or when the stake is sufficiently good to bear\r\ndivision, it is usual to let one of the animals walk over the course so\r\nas to make a deciding heat, and to divide the money. In such case all\r\nbets are divided. Sometimes, however, when no arrangement can be made,\r\nan owner will withdraw his horse, in which case the animal that walks\r\nover wins the whole of the stake, and his backers the whole of their\r\nmoney. Where the course is short and the money of small amount, the\r\nDEAD-HEAT is run off, the second essay being called the decider, though\r\non certain occasions even the decider has resulted in a\r\nDEAD-HEAT.\xe2\x80\x94_See_ NECK AND NECK.\r\n\r\n~Dead-horse~, \xe2\x80\x9cto draw the DEAD-HORSE;\xe2\x80\x9d DEAD-HORSE work\xe2\x80\x94working for\r\nwages already paid; also any thankless or unassisted service.\r\n\r\n~Dead-letter~, an action of no value or weight; an article, owing to\r\nsome mistake in its production, rendered utterly valueless,\xe2\x80\x94often\r\napplied to any instrument in writing, which by some apparently trivial\r\nomission, becomes useless. At the general and large district\r\npost-offices, there is a department for letters which have been\r\nerroneously addressed, or for which, from many and various causes, there\r\nare no receivers. These are called DEAD-LETTERS, and the office in\r\nconnexion with them is known as the DEAD-LETTER office.\r\n\r\n~Dead-lock~, a permanent standstill, an inextricable entanglement.\r\n\r\n~Dead-lurk~, entering a dwelling-house during divine service.\r\n\r\n~Dead-man~, a baker. Properly speaking, it is an extra loaf smuggled\r\ninto the basket by the man who carries it out, to the loss of the\r\nmaster. Sometimes the DEAD-MAN is charged to a customer, though never\r\ndelivered. Among London thieves and low people generally a \xe2\x80\x9cdead\xe2\x80\x99un\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\na half-quartern loaf.\r\n\r\n~Dead-men~, the term for wine bottles after they are emptied of their\r\ncontents.\xe2\x80\x94_Old._\xe2\x80\x94_See_ MARINES.\r\n\r\n~Dead-men\xe2\x80\x99s shoes~, property which cannot be claimed until after decease\r\nof present holder. \xe2\x80\x9cTo wait for a pair of DEAD-MEN\xe2\x80\x99S SHOES,\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nconsidered a wearisome affair. It is used by Fletcher:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAnd \xe2\x80\x99tis a general shrift, that most men use,\r\n    But yet \xe2\x80\x99tis tedious waiting DEAD MEN\xe2\x80\x99S SHOES.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n        _Fletcher\xe2\x80\x99s Poems_, p. 256.\r\n\r\n~Dead-set~, a pointed and persistent attack on a person.\r\n\r\n~Dead\xe2\x80\x99un~, a horse which will not run or will not try in a race, and\r\nagainst which money may be betted with safety.\xe2\x80\x94_See_ SAFE UN.\r\n\r\n~Deaner~, a shilling. From DENIER.\r\n\r\n~Death~, \xe2\x80\x9cto dress to DEATH,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, to the very extreme of fashion,\r\nperhaps so as to be killing.\r\n\r\n~Death-hunter~, a running patterer, who vends last dying speeches and\r\nconfessions. More modernly the term is supposed to mean an undertaker,\r\nor any one engaged in or concerned with burials.\r\n\r\n~Deck~, a pack of cards. Used by Shakspeare, 3 _K. Hen. VI._, v. 1.\r\nProbably because of DECKING or arranging the table for a game at cards.\r\nGeneral in the United States.\r\n\r\n~Dee~, a pocket-book; term used by tramps.\xe2\x80\x94_Gipsy._ DEE (properly D), a\r\ndetective policeman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe DEES are about, so look out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Delicate~, a false subscription-book carried by a LURKER.\r\n\r\n~Demirep~ (or DEMIRIP), a courtezan. Contraction of DEMI-REPUTATION,\r\nwhich is, in turn, a contraction for _demi-monde_ reputation.\r\n\r\n~Derby-dog~, a masterless animal, who is sure to appear as soon as the\r\nEpsom course is cleared for the great race of the season.

Probably from DOZE, though quite as likely from DORSE,\r\nthe back. Least likely of all, as any one who knows aught about the\r\nsurrounding circumstances of those who use the term will admit, is it\r\nfrom the Norman, DOSSEL, a hanging or bed canopy, from which some have\r\nprofessed to derive it.\r\n\r\n~Doss~, to sleep, formerly spelt DORSE. _Gael._, DOSAL, slumber. In the\r\nold pugilistic days a man knocked down, or out of time, was said to be\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csent to DORSE,\xe2\x80\x9d but whether because he was senseless, or because he lay\r\non his back, is not known, though most likely the latter.\r\n\r\n~Dossing-ken~, a lodging-house.\r\n\r\n~Dot and go one~, a lame or limping man.\r\n\r\n~Do the high~, to walk up and down High Street on Sunday evenings,\r\nespecially just after Church.\xe2\x80\x94_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Double~, \xe2\x80\x9cto tip (or give) the DOUBLE,\xe2\x80\x9d to run away from any person; to\r\ndouble back, turn short round upon one\xe2\x80\x99s pursuers, and so escape, as a\r\nhare does.\xe2\x80\x94_Sporting._\r\n\r\n~Double cross~, a CROSS in which a man who has engaged to lose breaks\r\nhis engagement, and \xe2\x80\x9cgoes straight\xe2\x80\x9d at the last moment.

Sometimes DOUSE\r\nmeans to rinse; and sometimes to throw water, clean or dirty, over any\r\none, is to \xe2\x80\x9cDOUSE it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Dovercourt~, a noisy assemblage; \xe2\x80\x9call talkers and no hearers, like\r\nDOVERCOURT.\xe2\x80\x9d At Dovercourt, in Essex, a court is annually held; and as\r\nthe members principally consist of rude fishermen, the irregularity\r\nnoticed in the proverbial saying frequently prevails. Bramston in his\r\n_Art of Politics_ says:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThose who would captivate the well-bred throng,\r\n    Should not too often speak, nor speak too long;\r\n    Church, nor church matters, ever turn to sport,\r\n    Nor make St. Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s Chapel DOVER COURT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis would seem to be more properly applied to a Court of Dover people,\r\na DOVER COURT, not a DOVERCOURT COURT.\r\n\r\n~Dove-tart~, a pigeon pie. A snake tart is an eel pie.\r\n\r\n~Dowd~, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s nightcap.\xe2\x80\x94_Devonshire_: also an American term;\r\npossibly from DOWDY, a slatternly woman.\r\n\r\n~Dowlas~, a linendraper. DOWLAS is a sort of towelling.\r\n\r\n~Down~, to be aware of, or awake to, any move\xe2\x80\x94in this meaning,\r\nexchangeable with UP; \xe2\x80\x9cDOWN upon one\xe2\x80\x99s luck,\xe2\x80\x9d unfortunate; \xe2\x80\x9cDOWN in the\r\nmouth,\xe2\x80\x9d disconsolate; \xe2\x80\x9cto be DOWN on one,\xe2\x80\x9d to treat him harshly or\r\nsuspiciously, to pounce upon him, or detect his tricks.\r\n\r\n~Downer~, a sixpence; apparently the Gipsy word, TAWNO, \xe2\x80\x9clittle one,\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\ncourse of metamorphosis into the more usual \xe2\x80\x9ctanner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Downs~, Tothill Fields\xe2\x80\x99 Prison.\r\n\r\n~Down the road~, stylish, showy, after the fashion.\r\n\r\n~Down to the ground~, an American rendering of the word entirely; as,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat suits me DOWN TO THE GROUND.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Downy~, knowing or cunning; \xe2\x80\x9ca DOWNY COVE,\xe2\x80\x9d a knowing or experienced\r\nsharper. Literally, a DOWNY person is one who is \xe2\x80\x9cDOWN to every move on\r\nthe board.\xe2\x80\x9d In Norfolk, however, it means low-spirited, _i.e._, DOWN in\r\nthe mouth.\r\n\r\n~Dowry~, a lot, a great deal; \xe2\x80\x9cDOWRY of parny,\xe2\x80\x9d lot of rain or\r\nwater.\xe2\x80\x94_See_ PARNY. Probably from the Gipsy.\r\n\r\n~Dowsers~, men who profess to tell fortunes, and who, by the use of the\r\ndivining rod, pretend to be able to discover treasure-trove.\xe2\x80\x94_Cornish._\r\n\r\n~Doxy~, the female companion of a tramp or beggar. In the West of\r\nEngland, the women frequently call their little girls DOXIES, in a\r\nfamiliar or endearing sense. _Orthodoxy_ has been described as being a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s own DOXY, and _heterodoxy_ another man\xe2\x80\x99s DOXY.\xe2\x80\x94_Ancient Cant._\r\n\r\n~Drab~, a vulgar or low woman.\xe2\x80\x94_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Drab~, poison.\xe2\x80\x94_Romany._\r\n\r\n~Draft on Aldgate Pump~, an old mercantile phrase for a fictitious\r\nbanknote or fraudulent bill.\r\n\r\n~Drag~, a cart of any kind, term generally used to denote any\r\nparticularly well-appointed turnout, drawn by a pair or four horses,\r\nespecially at race meetings.\r\n\r\n~Drag~, feminine attire worn by men. A recent notorious impersonation\r\ncase led to the publication of the word in that sense.\r\n\r\n~Drag~, a street, or road; BACK-DRAG, back street.\r\n\r\n~Drag~, or THREE MOON, three months in prison.\r\n\r\n~Drag~, THE, a favourite pursuit with fast-hunting sets; as, THE DRAG\r\ncan be trailed over very stiff country.\r\n\r\n~Dragging~, robbing carts, &c., by means of a light trap which follows\r\nbehind laden vehicles. Cabs are sometimes eased of trunks in this way,\r\nthough it is hard to say whether with or without the complicity of the\r\ncabmen.\r\n\r\n~Dragging time~, the evening of a country fair day, when the young\r\nfellows begin pulling the wenches about.\r\n\r\n~Draggletail~, a dirty, dissipated woman; a prostitute of the lowest\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n~Drain~, a drink; \xe2\x80\x9cto do a DRAIN,\xe2\x80\x9d to take a friendly drink\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdo a wet;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsometimes called a \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sewer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Draw~, used in several senses:\xe2\x80\x941, of a theatre, new piece or\r\nexhibition, when it attracts the public and succeeds; 2, to induce\xe2\x80\x94as,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDRAW him on;\xe2\x80\x9d 3, of pocket-picking\xe2\x80\x94as, \xe2\x80\x9cDRAW his wipe,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDRAW his\r\nticker.\xe2\x80\x9d In sporting parlance it is used with an ellipsis of \xe2\x80\x9ctrigger,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI DREW on it as it rose.\xe2\x80\x9d In America to \xe2\x80\x9cDRAW on a man\xe2\x80\x9d is to produce\r\nknife or pistol, and to use it as well. Where lethal weapons are used in\r\nthe States, no man raises his weapon till he means to use it, and a\r\ncelebrated American writer has recently given a dissertation on the\r\nrelative advantages of cocking and firing a pistol by an almost\r\nsimultaneous action as it is raised, and of cocking as the instrument is\r\nraised, and of then dropping the muzzle slightly as the trigger is\r\npulled. The former way is more speedy, the latter more effective. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nDRAW it mild!\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, don\xe2\x80\x99t exaggerate; opposite of \xe2\x80\x9ccome it strong,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfrom the phraseology of the bar (of a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d), where customers desire\r\nthe beer to be \xe2\x80\x9cdrawn mild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Draw-boy~, a cunning device used by puffing tradesmen. A really good\r\narticle is advertised or ticketed and exposed for sale in the shop\r\nwindow at a very low price, with a view of drawing in customers to\r\npurchase other and inferior articles at high prices. These gentry have\r\nfortunately found to their cost, on one or two occasions, by means of\r\nmagisterial decisions, that DRAW-BOYS have drawn for their owners\r\nsomething other than profit.\r\n\r\n~Drawers~, formerly the ancient cant name for very long stockings.\r\n\r\n~Drawing teeth~, wrenching off knockers.\xe2\x80\x94_Medical Student slang._\r\n\r\n~Drawlatch~, a loiterer.\r\n\r\n~Draw off~, to throw back the body to give impetus to a blow; \xe2\x80\x9che DREW\r\nOFF, and delivered on the left drum.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Pugilistic._ A sailor would say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che hauled off and slipped in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Draw the long bow~, to tell extravagant stories, to exaggerate\r\novermuch; same as \xe2\x80\x9cthrow the hatchet.\xe2\x80\x9d From the extremely wonderful\r\nstories which used to be told of the Norman archers, and more\r\nsubsequently of Indians\xe2\x80\x99 skill with the tomahawk.\r\n\r\n~Dress a hat~, TO, to rob in a manner very difficult of detection. The\r\nbusiness is managed by two or more servants or shopmen of different\r\nemployers, exchanging their master\xe2\x80\x99s goods; as, for instance, a\r\nshoemaker\xe2\x80\x99s shopman receives shirts or other articles from a hosier\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nin return for a pair of boots. Another very ingenious method may be\r\nwitnessed about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the forenoon in any of the suburban\r\ndistricts of London. A butcher\xe2\x80\x99s boy, with a bit of steak filched from\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s shop, or from a customer, falls in with a neighbouring\r\nbaker\xe2\x80\x99s man, who has a loaf obtained in a similar manner. Their mutual\r\nfriend, the potboy, in full expectation of their visit, has the tap-room\r\nfire bright and clear, and not only cooks the steak, but again, by means\r\nof collusion, this time with the barman or barmaid, \xe2\x80\x9cstands a shant of\r\ngatter\xe2\x80\x9d as his share. So a capital luncheon is improvised for the three,\r\nwithout the necessity of paying for it; and this practical communistic\r\noperation is styled DRESSING A HAT. Most likely from the fact that a hat\r\nreceives the attention of three or four people before it is properly fit\r\nfor wear.\r\n\r\n~Dripping~, a cook.\r\n\r\n~Drive~, a term used by tradesmen in speaking of business; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s DRIVING\r\na roaring trade,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, a very good one; hence, to succeed in a\r\nbargain, \xe2\x80\x9cI DROVE a good bargain,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, got the best end of it. To\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLET DRIVE at one,\xe2\x80\x9d to strike out. A man snoring hard is said to be\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDRIVING his pigs to market.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Drive at~, to aim at; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is he DRIVING AT?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does he intend to\r\nimply?\xe2\x80\x9d a phrase often used when a circuitous line of argument is\r\nadopted by a barrister, or a strange set of questions asked, the purport\r\nof which is not very evident.\r\n\r\n~Driz~, lace. In a low lodging-house this singular autograph inscription\r\nappeared over the mantelpiece. \xe2\x80\x9cScotch Mary, with DRIZ [lace], bound to\r\nDover and back, please God.\xe2\x80\x9d It is a common thing for ignorant or\r\nsuperstitious people to make some mark or sign before going on a\r\njourney, and then to wonder whether it will be there when they return.\r\n\r\n~Driz-fencer~, a person who sells lace.\r\n\r\n~Drop~, \xe2\x80\x9cto DROP an acquaintance,\xe2\x80\x9d to relinquish a connexion, is very\r\npolite slang. DROPPING is distinguished from cutting by being done\r\ngradually and almost imperceptibly, whereas cutting has outward and\r\nvisible signs which may be unpleasantly resented. To \xe2\x80\x9cDROP money\xe2\x80\x9d at any\r\nform of speculation or gambling, is to lose it.\r\n\r\n~Drop~, to quit, go off, or turn aside; \xe2\x80\x9cDROP the main Toby,\xe2\x80\x9d go off the\r\nmain road.\r\n\r\n~Drop~, \xe2\x80\x9cto DROP a man,\xe2\x80\x9d to knock him down; \xe2\x80\x9cto DROP into a person,\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\ngive him a thrashing. _See_ SLIP and WALK. \xe2\x80\x9cTo DROP on a man,\xe2\x80\x9d to accuse\r\nor rebuke him suddenly.\r\n\r\n~Drop it~, synonymous with \xe2\x80\x9ccut it\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccheese it.\xe2\x80\x9d Probably from the\r\nsignal given in the good old hanging days by the culprit, who used\r\ngenerally to drop a handkerchief when he was ready for the cart to be\r\nmoved from under him.\r\n\r\n~Drum~, a house, a lodging, a street; HAZARD-DRUM, a gambling-house;\r\nFLASH-DRUM, a house of ill-fame.\r\n\r\n~Drum~, the ear.\xe2\x80\x94_Pugilistic._ An example of slang synecdoche.\r\n\r\n~Drum~, as applied to the road, is doubtless from the Wallachian gipsy\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9cDRUMRI,\xe2\x80\x9d derived from the _Greek_, \xce\xb4\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xcf\x82.\r\n\r\n~Drum~, old slang for a ball or rout; afterwards called a hop.\r\n\r\n~Drummer~, a robber who first makes his victims insensible by drugs or\r\nviolence, and then plunders them.\r\n\r\n~Drumsticks~, legs; DRUMSTICK CASES, trousers. The leg of a fowl is\r\ngenerally called a DRUMSTICK.\r\n\r\n~Dryasdust~, an antiquary. From Scott.\r\n\r\n~Dry lodging~, sleeping and sitting accommodation only, without board.\r\nThis is lodging-house keepers\xe2\x80\x99 slang, and is generally used in reference\r\nto rooms let to lodgers who take their meals at their clubs, or in the\r\nCity, according to their social positions.\r\n\r\n~Dry nurse~, when an inferior officer on board ship carries on the duty,\r\non account of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s ignorance of seamanship, the junior officer\r\nis said to DRY-NURSE his captain. Majors and adjutants in the army also\r\nnot unfrequently DRY-NURSE the colonels of their regiments in a similar\r\nmanner. The sergeant who coaches very young officers, is called a \xe2\x80\x9cwet\r\nnurse.\xe2\x80\x9d The abolition of purchase has, however, considerably modified\r\nall this.\r\n\r\n~D.T.~, a popular abbreviation of delirium tremens; sometimes written\r\nand pronounced _del. trem._ D.T. also often represents the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_.\r\n\r\n~Dub~, to pay or give; \xe2\x80\x9cDUB UP,\xe2\x80\x9d pay up.\r\n\r\n~Dubash~, a general agent.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Dubber~, the mouth or tongue; \xe2\x80\x9cmum your DUBBER,\xe2\x80\x9d hold your tongue.\r\n\r\n~Dubsman~, or SCREW, a turnkey.\xe2\x80\x94_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Ducats~, money.\xe2\x80\x94_Theatrical Slang._\r\n\r\n~Duck~, a bundle of bits of the \xe2\x80\x9cstickings\xe2\x80\x9d of beef sold for food to the\r\nLondon poor.\xe2\x80\x94_See_ FAGGOT.\r\n\r\n~Ducket~, a ticket of any kind. Generally applied to pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nduplicates and raffle cards. Probably from DOCKET.\r\n\r\n~Ducks~, trousers. _Sea_ term.

In\r\nselling a waistcoat-piece, which cost him perhaps five shillings, for\r\nthirty shillings or two pounds, he would show great fear of the revenue\r\nofficer, and beg the purchasing clodhopper to kneel down in a puddle of\r\nwater, crook his arm, and swear that it might never become straight if\r\nhe told an exciseman, or even his own wife. The term and practice are\r\nnearly obsolete. In Liverpool, however, and at the East-end of London,\r\nmen dressed up as sailors, with pretended silk handkerchiefs and cigars\r\n\xe2\x80\x9conly just smuggled from the Indies,\xe2\x80\x9d are still to be plentifully found.\r\n\r\n~Dudeen~, or DUDHEEN, a short tobacco-pipe.

DUFFER was formerly synonymous with\r\nDUDDER, and was a general term given to pedlars. It is mentioned in the\r\n_Frauds of London_ (1760) as a word in frequent use in the last century\r\nto express cheats of all kinds.\r\n\r\n~Duffer~, anything of no merit. A term applied by artists to a picture\r\nbelow mediocrity, and by dealers in jewellery to any spurious article.\r\nIt is now general in its application to a worthless fellow.\r\n\r\n~Duffing~, false, counterfeit, worthless.\r\n\r\n~Duffy~, a term for a ghost or spirit among the West Indian negroes. In\r\nall probability the DAVY JONES of sailors, and a contraction thereof\r\noriginally.\r\n\r\n~Duke~, gin, a term amongst livery servants.\r\n\r\n~Duke Humphrey.~ \xe2\x80\x9cTo dine with DUKE HUMPHREY\xe2\x80\x9d is a euphuism for dining\r\nnot at all. Many reasons have been given for the saying, and the one\r\nmost worthy of credence is this:\xe2\x80\x94Some visitors were inspecting the\r\nabbey where the remains of Humphrey Duke of Gloucester lie, and one of\r\nthem was unfortunately shut in, and remained there _solus_ while his\r\ncompanions were feasting at a neighbouring hostelry. He was afterwards\r\nsaid to have dined with DUKE HUMPHREY, and the saying eventually passed\r\ninto a proverb.\r\n\r\n~Dukes~, or DOOKS, the hands, originally modification of the rhyming\r\nslang, \xe2\x80\x9cDuke of Yorks,\xe2\x80\x9d forks = fingers, hands\xe2\x80\x94a long way round, but\r\nquite true. The word is in very common use among low folk. \xe2\x80\x9cPut up your\r\nDOOKS\xe2\x80\x9d is a kind invitation to fight.\r\n\r\n~Dukey~, or DOOKEY, a penny gaff, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Dumbfound~, to perplex, to beat soundly till not able to speak.\r\nOriginally a cant word.

Chandlers\xe2\x80\x99 shop keepers\r\nand small general dealers use dummies largely, half-tubs of butter,\r\nbladders of lard, hams, cheeses, &c., being specially manufactured for\r\nthem. Dummies in libraries generally take the form of \xe2\x80\x9cHume and\r\nSmollett\xe2\x80\x99s History of England\xe2\x80\x9d and other works not likely to tempt the\r\ngeneral reader.\r\n\r\n~Dummy~, a deaf-and-dumb person; a clumsy, awkward fellow; any one\r\nunusually thick-witted.\r\n\r\n~Dummy~, in three-handed whist the person who holds two hands plays\r\nDUMMY.\r\n\r\n~Dummy~, a pocket-book. In this word the derivation is obvious, being\r\nconnected with DUMB, _i.e._, that which makes no sound. As a thieves\xe2\x80\x99\r\nterm for a pocket-book, it is peculiarly applicable, for the contents of\r\npocket-books, bank-notes and papers, make no noise, while the money in a\r\npurse may betray its presence by chinking.\r\n\r\n~Dump fencer~, a man who sells buttons.\r\n\r\n~Dumpish~, sullen or gloomy.\r\n\r\n~Dumpy~, short and stout.\r\n\r\n~Dun~, to solicit payment.\xe2\x80\x94_Old Cant_, from the French DONNEZ, give; or\r\nfrom JOE DIN, or DUN, a famous bailiff; or simply a corruption of DIN,\r\nfrom the _Anglo-Saxon_ DUNAN, to clamour.\r\n\r\n~Dunderhead~, a blockhead.\r\n\r\n~Dundreary~, an empty swell.\r\n\r\n~Dung~, an operative who works for an employer who does not give full or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csociety\xe2\x80\x9d wages.\r\n\r\n~Dungaree~, low, common, coarse, vulgar.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._ DUNGAREE is\r\nthe name of a disreputable suburb of Bombay, and also of a coarse blue\r\ncloth worn by sailors.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAs smart a young fellow as ever you\xe2\x80\x99d see,\r\n    In jacket and trousers of blue DUNGAREE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Dunkhorned~, sneaking, shabby.

Slang._\r\n\r\n~Dust-hole~, the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Theatre, Tottenham Court Road, was so called\r\nuntil comparatively recently, when it was entirely renovated and\r\nrenamed, and now, as the Prince of Wales\xe2\x80\x99s, it is one of the most\r\nfortunate and fashionable theatres in London.\r\n\r\n~Dustoorie~, commission, douceur, bribe.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Dusty~, a phrase used in answering a question where one expects\r\napprobation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of this?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so DUSTY,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n_i.e._, not so bad; sometimes varied to \xe2\x80\x9cnone so DUSTY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Dutch~, or DOUBLE DUTCH, gibberish, or any foreign tongue. \xe2\x80\x9cTo talk\r\nDOUBLE DUTCH backwards on a Sunday\xe2\x80\x9d is a humorous locution for\r\nextraordinary linguistic facility.\r\n\r\n~Dutch auction~, a method of selling goods, adopted by \xe2\x80\x9cCHEAP JOHNS,\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nevade the penalties for selling without a licence.

It\xe2\x80\x99s the worst ace, and the poorest\r\n    card in the pack, and is called the EARL OF CORK, because he\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\n    poorest nobleman in Ireland.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Carleton\xe2\x80\x99s Traits and Stories of\r\n    the Irish Peasantry._\r\n\r\n~Early~, \xe2\x80\x9cto get up EARLY,\xe2\x80\x9d to prepare for a difficult task. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave to get up very EARLY in the morning to beat that.\xe2\x80\x9d Early rising and\r\nability seem also closely connected by certain modifications of this\r\nexpression. Possibly the belief is that a man who rises early for early\r\nrising\xe2\x80\x99s sake deserves to be clever. Perhaps the greatest enjoyment a\r\nday labourer\xe2\x80\x94whose work commences at six in the winter mornings, and\r\nwho may have to rise at half-past four and trudge off\xe2\x80\x94can have, is a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cquiet snooze\xe2\x80\x9d after the usual time of rising. The early rising in \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nsteel\xe2\x80\x9d is the chief terror of that institution in the minds of habitual\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\n~Earwig~, a clergyman, also one who prompts another maliciously and\r\nprivately.\r\n\r\n~Earwigging~, a private conversation; a rebuke in private; an attempt to\r\ndefame another unfairly, and without chance of appeal; a WIGGING is more\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n~Ease~, to rob; \xe2\x80\x9cEASING a bloke,\xe2\x80\x9d robbing a man.\r\n\r\n~Eat his head off.~ A horse who is kept idle in the stable is said to\r\nEAT HIS HEAD OFF.

The name is derived from the punishment\r\nwhich, according to Oliver, was directed in the Lectures, at the revival\r\nof Masonry in 1717, to be inflicted on a detected Cowan [g. v.], and\r\nwhich was\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cTo be placed under the eaves of the house in rainy weather, till\r\n    the water runs in at his shoulders and out at his heels.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Mackey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n    Lexicon of Freemasonry._\r\n\r\n~Efter~, a thief who frequents theatres.\r\n\r\n~Egg~, or EGG ON, to excite, stimulate, or provoke one person to quarrel\r\nwith another, &c.

This applied to the \xe2\x80\x9cPoll\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlist, as the \xe2\x80\x9cGulf\xe2\x80\x9d did to the \xe2\x80\x9cHonours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Elephant~, \xe2\x80\x9cto have seen the ELEPHANT,\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9c_up_ to the latest\r\nmove,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c_down_ to the last new trick;\xe2\x80\x9d to be knowing, and not\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgreen,\xe2\x80\x9d &c. Possibly a metaphor taken from the travelling menageries,\r\nwhere the ELEPHANT is the finale of the exhibition.\xe2\x80\x94Originally an\r\nAmericanism. Bartlett gives conflicting examples. General now, however.\r\nA modification of this is \xe2\x80\x9chaving seen the king.\xe2\x80\x9d When a man becomes\r\naware that he has been cheated or imposed on, and does not mean to stand\r\nit any longer, he is said to have seen the king, _i.e._, to have seen\r\nhis adversary\xe2\x80\x99s best card, and to be prepared for it.\r\n\r\n~Elevated~, intoxicated. ELEVATION is the name of a drug-mixture much\r\nused in the fen-counties for keeping up the spirits and preventing ague.\r\nIt consists mainly of opium.\r\n\r\n~Enemy~, time, a clock, the ruthless enemy and tell-tale of idleness and\r\nof mankind generally; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat says the ENEMY?\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, how goes the time?\r\n\r\n~Essex lion~, a calf. A calf is probably the only lively animal to be\r\nseen in a journey through Essex.\r\n\r\n~Essex stile~, a ditch. A jocular allusion to the peculiarities of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clow county.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Evaporate~, to go, or run away.\r\n\r\n~Everlasting shoes~, the feet. The barefooted children about the Seven\r\nDials, and other low quarters of London, are said to wear EVERLASTING\r\nSHOES and stockings. Another expression in connexion with this want is,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe shoes and stockings their mothers gave them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Everlasting staircase~, the treadmill.

Term principally used by printers.\r\n\r\n~Face~, credit at a public-house, impudence, confidence, brass; thus a\r\nBRAZEN-FACE. \xe2\x80\x9cTo run one\xe2\x80\x99s FACE,\xe2\x80\x9d is to obtain credit in a bounceable\r\nmanner. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got some FACE,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, he has got lots of impudence.\r\n\r\n~Face entry~, the entr\xc3\xa9e to a theatre. From the FACE being known, as\r\ndistinguished from free-list entry.\r\n\r\n~Facer~, a blow on the face. In Ireland, a dram.\r\n\r\n~Facer~, a tumbler of whisky-punch.

Used by\r\nShakspeare, but now heard only in the streets.\r\n\r\n~Fadger~, a glazier\xe2\x80\x99s frame. Otherwise called a \xe2\x80\x9cfrail,\xe2\x80\x9d perhaps in\r\nreference to the fragile nature of its contents.\r\n\r\n~Fag~, a schoolboy who performs a servant\xe2\x80\x99s offices to a superior\r\nschoolmate. From FAG, to become weary or tired out. _Low German_, FAKK,\r\nwearied.\r\n\r\n~Fag~, to beat.\r\n\r\n~Faggot~, a bundle of bits of the \xe2\x80\x9cstickings\xe2\x80\x9d (hence probably its name)\r\nsold for food to the London poor. It is sometimes called a duck. In\r\nappearance it resembles a Scotch \xe2\x80\x9chaggis,\xe2\x80\x9d without, however, being\r\nnearly so good as that fragrant article. Probably the FAG-END of a\r\nthing, the inferior or remaining part, the refuse.\r\n\r\n~Faggot~, a term of opprobrium used by low people to children and women;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou little FAGGOT, you!\xe2\x80\x9d FAGGOT was originally a term of contempt for a\r\ndry shrivelled old woman, whose bones were like a bundle of sticks, only\r\nfit to burn.\xe2\x80\x94Compare the French expression for a heretic, _sentir le\r\nfagot_.\r\n\r\n~Faggot briefs~, bundles of worthless papers tied up with red tape,\r\ncarried by unemployed barristers in the back rows of the courts to\r\nsimulate briefs.\r\n\r\n~Faggot vote~, a phrase which belongs to the slang of politics, and\r\nwhich was applied to a class of votes, by no means extinct even now,\r\nthough not so common as in the days preceding the first Reform Bill,\r\nwhen constituencies were smaller, and individual votes were consequently\r\nmore valuable. FAGGOT VOTES were thus created:\xe2\x80\x94A large landowner who\r\nwas blessed with, say, seven sons and seven brothers, and had also on\r\nhis estate fourteen labourers\xe2\x80\x99 cottages worth about a shilling a week\r\neach, would go through the form of sale of one cottage to each son and\r\neach brother, it being perfectly understood that the title-deeds would\r\nbe returned when the occasion for their use was at an end. And thus the\r\nsquire would command fifteen votes instead of one. In a famous election\r\nfor the West Riding of Yorkshire during the third decade of the present\r\ncentury, which cost upwards of half a million sterling, and ruined the\r\nsuccessful candidate, it was said that six hundred FAGGOT VOTES were\r\ncreated by three noble lords. The origin of the term has been variously\r\nexplained. One ingenious writer has suggested that as a FAGGOT may be\r\nsplit into a bundle of sticks, so was one estate thus split into a\r\nbundle of votes. It is, however, more reasonable to suppose that it was\r\nderived from the old word \xe2\x80\x9cFAGGOT,\xe2\x80\x9d which was used to describe a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnominal soldier,\xe2\x80\x9d one, that is, whose name appeared on the muster-roll,\r\nand for whom the colonel drew pay, but who was never to be found in the\r\nranks. The connexion is evident enough.\r\n\r\n~Fake~, in the sporting world, means to hocus or poison. Fake is also a\r\nmixture supposed to be used for purposes of \xe2\x80\x9cmaking safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Fake~, to cheat, or swindle; to do anything; to go on, or continue; to\r\nmake or construct; to steal or rob,\xe2\x80\x94a verb variously used. FAKED, done,\r\nor done for; \xe2\x80\x9cFAKE away, there\xe2\x80\x99s no down;\xe2\x80\x9d go on, there is nobody\r\nlooking. From the _Latin_ FACERE.\r\n\r\n~Fakement~, a false begging petition, any act of robbery, swindling, or\r\ndeception. FAKEMENT is a word of most general application among the\r\nlower classes. Any things strange, and most things not strange, are\r\ncalled FAKEMENTS, particularly if there is anything peculiar or artistic\r\nin their production.\r\n\r\n~Fakement Charley~, the owner\xe2\x80\x99s private mark. FAKER, is one who makes or\r\nFAKES anything. To \xe2\x80\x9cfake a cly,\xe2\x80\x9d is to pick a pocket.\r\n\r\n~Fal-lals~, trumpery ornaments, gewgaws. Forby suggests as a derivation\r\nthe _Latin_ PHALER\xc3\x86, horse trappings.\r\n\r\n~Fambles~, or FAMMS, the hands.\xe2\x80\x94_Ancient Cant._ _German_, FANGEN.\r\n\r\n~Family men~, or PEOPLE, thieves, or burglars.\r\n\r\n~Fan~, a waistcoat.\xe2\x80\x94_Houndsditch term._\r\n\r\n~Fancy~, the favourite sports, pets, or pastime of a person, the ton of\r\nlow life. Pugilists are sometimes termed the FANCY. Shakspeare uses the\r\nword in the sense of a favourite or pet; and the paramour of a\r\nprostitute is still called her FANCY MAN.\r\n\r\n~Fancy bloak~, a fancy or sporting man.\r\n\r\n~Fanning~, a beating. FANNING is also stealing; CROSS-FANNING is\r\nstealing with the arms crossed so as to distract attention, as in\r\nstealing breast-pins, &c.\r\n\r\n~Fanqui~, a European, literally foreign devil.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Fantail~, a dustman\xe2\x80\x99s or coalheaver\xe2\x80\x99s hat. So called from the shape.\r\n\r\n~Farm~, to contract, after the manner of those who engage to feed and\r\nlodge children belonging to the parish, at so much a head; a fruitful\r\ncause of starvation and misery. _See Oliver Twist._ The baby farmings,\r\nunconnected with the parishes in which they occurred, which ultimately\r\nresulted in the trial and execution of Margaret Waters, on the 11th\r\nOctober, 1870, have caused the word FARM as applied to any dealings with\r\nchildren, parish or private, to be one of obloquy and reproach.\r\n\r\n~Farmer.~ In Suffolk this term is applied to the eldest son of the\r\noccupier of the farm. In London it is used derisively of a countryman,\r\nand denotes a farm-labourer or clodpole. Both senses are different from\r\nthe proper meaning.\r\n\r\n~Fast~, gay, spreeish, unsteady, thoughtless,\xe2\x80\x94an Americanism that has\r\nof late ascended from the streets to the drawing-room. The word has\r\ncertainly now a distinct meaning, which it had not thirty years ago.\r\nQUICK is the synonym for FAST, but a QUICK MAN would not convey the\r\nmeaning of a FAST MAN,\xe2\x80\x94a person who, by late hours, gaiety, and\r\ncontinual rounds of pleasure, lives too fast, and wears himself out. In\r\npolite society a FAST young lady is one who affects mannish habits, or\r\nmakes herself conspicuous by some unfeminine accomplishment,\xe2\x80\x94talks\r\nslang, drives about in London, smokes cigarettes, is knowing in dogs,\r\nhorses, &c. An amusing anecdote is told of a fast young lady, the\r\ndaughter of a right reverend prelate, who was an adept in horseflesh.\r\nBeing desirous of ascertaining the opinion of a candidate for\r\nordination, who had the look of a bird of the same feather, as to the\r\nmerits of some cattle just brought to her father\xe2\x80\x99s palace for her to\r\nselect from, she was assured by him they were utterly unfit for a lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuse. With a knowing look at the horses\xe2\x80\x99 points, she gave her decision in\r\nthese choice words, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I agree with you; they _are_ a rum lot, as\r\nthe devil said of the ten commandments.\xe2\x80\x9d Charles Dickens once said that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfast,\xe2\x80\x9d when applied to a young man, was only another word for loose, as\r\nhe understood the term; and a fast girl has been defined as a woman who\r\nhas lost her respect for men, and for whom men have lost their respect.\r\n\r\n~Fast~, embarrassed, wanting money, tied up. Sometimes synonymous with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chard up.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Yorkshire._\r\n\r\n~Fast and loose~, to play FAST AND LOOSE with a man, is to treat him as\r\na fast friend in the days while he is useful, and to cast him loose\r\nwhen he is no longer necessary; also, to equivocate or vacillate. In old\r\ndays it was the name of a vulgar pastime. _See_ PRICK THE GARTER.\r\n\r\n~Fat~, a printer\xe2\x80\x99s term signifying the void spaces on a page, for which\r\nhe is paid at the same rate as for full or unbroken pages. Occasionally\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cgrease,\xe2\x80\x9d and applied variously, but always as showing some undue\r\nor uncommon amount of advantage.\r\n\r\n~Fat~, rich, abundant, &c.; \xe2\x80\x9ca FAT lot;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto cut it FAT,\xe2\x80\x9d to exaggerate,\r\nto show off in an extensive or grand manner, to assume undue importance;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccut up FAT,\xe2\x80\x9d see under CUT. As a theatrical term, a part with plenty of\r\nFAT in it is one which affords the actor an opportunity of effective\r\ndisplay.\r\n\r\n~Father~, or FENCE, a buyer of stolen property.\r\n\r\n~Favourite~, the horse that has the lowest odds laid against it in the\r\nbetting list. When the FAVOURITE wins, the public or backers of horses\r\ngenerally are the gainers. When an outsider wins, the ring, that is to\r\nsay, the persons who make a business of laying against the chances of\r\nhorses, are the gainers.\r\n\r\n~Fawney~, a finger ring. _Irish_, FAINEE, a ring.\r\n\r\n~Fawney bouncing~, selling rings for a pretended wager. This practice is\r\nfounded upon the old tale of a gentleman laying a wager that if he were\r\nto offer \xe2\x80\x9creal gold sovereigns\xe2\x80\x9d at a penny a-piece at the foot of London\r\nBridge, the English public would be too incredulous to buy. The story\r\nstates that the gentleman stationed himself with sovereigns on a\r\ntea-tray, and sold only two within the hour, thus winning the bet. This\r\ntale the FAWNEY BOUNCERS tell the public, only offering brass,\r\ndouble-gilt rings, instead of sovereigns.\r\n\r\n~Fawney rig~, the ring-dropping trick. A few years ago this practice was\r\nvery common. A fellow purposely dropped a ring, or a pocket-book with\r\nsome little articles of jewellery, &c., in it, and when he saw any\r\nperson pick it up, ran to claim half. The ring found, the question of\r\nhow the booty was to be divided had then to be decided. The sharper\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will give me eight or nine shillings for my share, the\r\nthings are yours.\xe2\x80\x9d This the \xe2\x80\x9cflat\xe2\x80\x9d thinks very fair. The ring of course\r\nis valueless, and the swallower of the bait discovers the trick too\r\nlate. For another way of doing this trick, _see_ RING-DROPPING.\r\n\r\n~Feathers~, money, wealth; \xe2\x80\x9cin full FEATHER,\xe2\x80\x9d rich. FEATHERS is also a\r\nterm applied to dress; \xe2\x80\x9cin full FEATHER,\xe2\x80\x9d means very often in full\r\ncostume. It also means, at times, in high spirits.\r\n\r\n~Feed~, a meal, generally a dinner. Originally stable slang, now pretty\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n~Feele~, a daughter, or child.\xe2\x80\x94Corrupted _French_.\r\n\r\n~Fellow-commoner~, uncomplimentary epithet used at Cambridge for an\r\nempty bottle.\r\n\r\n~Felt~, a hat.\xe2\x80\x94_Old term_, in use in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n~Fence~, a purchaser or receiver of stolen goods; also, the shop or\r\nwarehouse of a FENCER.\xe2\x80\x94_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Fen-nightingales~, toads and frogs, from their continued croaking at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n~Feringee~, a European\xe2\x80\x94that is, a Frank.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Ferricadouzer~, a knock-down blow, a good thrashing. Probably derived,\r\nthrough the _Lingua Franca_, from the _Italian_, \xe2\x80\x9cfar\xe2\x80\x99 cader\xe2\x80\x99 douser,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nto knock down. \xe2\x80\x9cFar\xe2\x80\x99 cader\xe2\x80\x99 morto,\xe2\x80\x9d is to knock down dead.\r\n\r\n~Few~, used to signify the reverse, thus:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you call this\r\nconsiderably jolly?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you, my bo-o-oy, A FEW.\xe2\x80\x9d Sometimes the\r\nreply is, \xe2\x80\x9cjust a FEW.\xe2\x80\x9d Another expression of the same kind is RATHER,\r\nwhich _see_.\r\n\r\n~Fib~, to beat or strike.\xe2\x80\x94_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Fib~, to lie, to romance.\r\n\r\n~Fibbing~, a series of blows delivered quickly, and at a short\r\ndistance.\xe2\x80\x94_Pugilistic._\r\n\r\n~Fiddle~, a sharper, \xe2\x80\x9ca street mugger.\xe2\x80\x9d In America, a swindle or an\r\nimposture.\r\n\r\n~Fiddle~, \xe2\x80\x9cto play second FIDDLE,\xe2\x80\x9d to act subordinately, or follow the\r\nlead of another. From the orchestral practice.\r\n\r\n~Fiddle-face~, a person with a wizened countenance.\r\n\r\n~Fiddle-faddle~, twaddle, or trifling discourse.\xe2\x80\x94_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Fiddler~, a sharper, a cheat; also a careless, negligent, or dilatory\r\nperson. On board some ocean steamers the FIDDLER is the capstan-house,\r\nthe only place on board where passengers are permitted to smoke. The\r\nterm FIDDLER is easily traceable to the fact that, while the seamen are\r\nworking the capstan-bars, a man sometimes plays on the fiddle to cheer\r\nthem at their toil.\r\n\r\n~Fiddler~, a sixpence.

A story is\r\ntold of a drunken sailor who heard a street preacher threatening all\r\nlisteners with eternal damnation, and who went up and asked where he\r\n(the sailor) was going after death. \xe2\x80\x9cTo hell, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\npreacher. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, you lubberly son of a sea-cook!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the seaman,\r\nknocking the itinerant down; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to FIDDLER\xe2\x80\x99S GREEN; and if you\r\nsay I\xe2\x80\x99m not, I\xe2\x80\x99ll throttle you.\xe2\x80\x9d Under compulsion, the preacher admitted\r\nthe existence of FIDDLER\xe2\x80\x99S GREEN, _pro tempore_.\r\n\r\n~Fiddles~, transverse pieces of wood used on shipboard to protect the\r\ndishes at table during stormy weather.

Laying against favourites is called\r\nFIELDING, and bookmakers are often known as FIELDERS.\r\n\r\n~Field~, \xe2\x80\x9cto look out,\xe2\x80\x9d at cricket. In the outings of an eleven the\r\nFIELDERS are those who stand away from the wickets with a view to\r\nchecking the progress of the ball.

There is but the smallest vestige of this famous (or\r\ninfamous) thoroughfare left.

It has\r\nbeen hinted that this may have come from the German _Vogel_, a bird,\r\nfrom the bird\xe2\x80\x99s-eye spots on some handkerchiefs, but a more probable\r\nderivation is the Italian slang (_Fourbesque_), FOGLIA, a pocket, or\r\npurse; or from the French Argot, FOUILLE, also a pocket.\r\n\r\n~Fogus~, tobacco.\xe2\x80\x94_Ancient Cant._ FOGO, old word for stench.\r\n\r\n~Follow-me-lads~, curls hanging over a lady\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n~Foont~, a sovereign, or 20_s._ Probably a corruption of vingt.\r\n\r\n~Footing~, \xe2\x80\x9cto pay FOOTING.\xe2\x80\x9d _See_ SHOE.\r\n\r\n~Forakers~, the closet of decency, or house of office.

A plausible letter is sent with the voucher, and the\r\nvictim is informed that on account of early investments made by the\r\nfirm, which has of course a high-sounding title, the extra odds can be\r\nlaid by them, and a remittance to the amount named, or part of it, is\r\nrequested. Of course the firm \xe2\x80\x9cdries up\xe2\x80\x9d when claims become heavy, and,\r\nwith a new name and new address, appears in the next week\xe2\x80\x99s advertising\r\ncolumns. FORCING THE VOUCHER was a fine game when it was first started,\r\nbut it was soon overdone, as it required no particular ingenuity, and\r\noffered special immunities, theft of this kind being rather favoured\r\nthan otherwise by the authorities. Certainly the law that punishes\r\nhonest betting men seems powerless with regard to these plunderers,\r\notherwise we should hardly be treated as often as we are to the\r\nspectacle of one man being fined for honest dealing, while another\r\nescapes simply because he is not a betting man, but a welcher.\r\n\r\n~Fork out~, to bring out one\xe2\x80\x99s money, to pay the bill, to \xe2\x80\x9cstand for\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\ntreat a friend; to hand over what does not belong to you\xe2\x80\x94old cant term\r\nfor picking pockets, and very curious in its origin. In the early part\r\nof the last century, a little book was published on purloining, and of\r\ncourse it had to give the latest modes. FORKING was the newest mode, and\r\nit consisted in thrusting the fingers stiff and open into the pocket,\r\nand then quickly closing them and extracting any article thus caught.\r\n\r\n~Forks~, or GRAPPLING-IRONS, fingers. Costermongers and other clumsy\r\nfeeders have a proverb which seems to justify their taking bones and\r\nchoice morsels in their hands during the progress of a meal. It is,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFingers were the first FORKS;\xe2\x80\x9d sometimes varied to \xe2\x80\x9cFingers were made\r\nbefore FORKS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Form~, condition, training. \xe2\x80\x9cIn good FORM\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin bad FORM\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s or horse\xe2\x80\x99s state of being in the sporting world. FORM has also had\r\na moral significance of late years, and with the qualifying adjectives\r\nattached as occasion requires, is extensively used in general\r\nconversation. As, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was bad FORM of Brown to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat article\r\nwas bad FORM.\xe2\x80\x9d In the latter cases the word \xe2\x80\x9cin\xe2\x80\x9d rarely appears.\r\n\r\n~Forty foot~, a derisive appellation for a very short person.\r\n\r\n~Forty guts~, vulgar term for a fat man.\r\n\r\n~Forty-twa~, the common place of retirement on a well-known French plan\r\nat Edinburgh, so called from its accommodating that number of persons at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n~Forty winks~, a short sleep or nap.\r\n\r\n~Fou~, rather more than slightly intoxicated.\xe2\x80\x94_Scotch._\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWe are na\xe2\x80\x99 FOU, we are na\xe2\x80\x99 FOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Foul~, to jostle or bore unfairly in a race. _See_ BORE.

FOULS in boat-racing are often inevitable, and are not\r\nalways the result of boring or any other malicious practice.\r\n\r\n~Foul riding~, riding which after a horse-race is made the subject of\r\ncomplaint, such as refusing to let a competitor pass, boring him against\r\nthe rails, &c. Some jockeys are great adepts at this work, and are\r\ninvaluable to a confederacy as a means, not so much of attaining victory\r\nthemselves, as of preventing its attainment in others. Of course unless\r\nproof of jostling can be given, or evidence of malicious intent shown,\r\njockeyship of this kind is not considered foul riding.\r\n\r\n~Four-and-nine~, or FOUR-AND-NINEPENNY GOSS, a cheap hat, so called from\r\n4_s._ 9_d._, the price at which a once noted advertising hat-maker sold\r\nhis hats\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWhene\xe2\x80\x99er to slumber you incline,\r\n    Take a short nap at 4 and 9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Four-eyes~, a man or woman who habitually wears spectacles.\r\n\r\n~Four kings~, HISTORY OF THE, an old name for a pack of playing cards.\r\n_See_ Sir Thomas Urquhart\xe2\x80\x99s _Translation of Rabelais_.

At page 87 of a collection of some papers of William Crouch (8vo,\r\n1712), the Quaker, we find a mention of this Captain. Degory Marshall\r\ninformed Crouch that\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIn the year 1664 we were sentenced for banishment to Jamaica by\r\n    Judges Hyde and Twisden, and our number was 55.

Somner says, \xe2\x80\x9c_French_, GABBER; _Dutch_,\r\nGABBEREN; and our own GAB, GABBER; hence also, I take it, our GIBBERISH,\r\na kind of canting language used by a sort of rogues we vulgarly call\r\ngipsies, a gibble-gabble understood only among themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d _See\r\nIntroduction._ The GIBBERISH of schoolboys is formed by placing a\r\nconsonant between each syllable of a word, and is called the GIBBERISH\r\nof the letter inserted. Thus, if F were the letter, it would be termed\r\nthe F GIBBERISH; if L, the L GIBBERISH\xe2\x80\x94as in the sentence, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x94_Howl dol youl dol?_\xe2\x80\x9d A GIBBERISH is sometimes formed by adding\r\n_vis_ to each word, in which the previous sentence would be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Howvis\r\ndovis youvis dovis?_\xe2\x80\x9d These things are worthy of schoolboys, as they are\r\nin ability far below the rhyming, the back, or the centre slang, each of\r\nwhich is constructed by people possessing no claim to literary\r\nexcellence whatever. Schoolboys in France form a GIBBERISH, in a\r\nsomewhat similar manner, by elongating their words two syllables, in the\r\nfirst of which an _r_, in the second a _g_, predominates. Thus the words\r\n_vous \xc3\xaates un fou_ are spoken, _vousdregue esdregue undregue foudregue_.\r\nFast persons in Paris, of both sexes, frequently adopt terminations of\r\nthis kind, from some popular song, actor, exhibition, or political\r\nevent. In 1830, the favourite termination was _mar_, saying _\xc3\xa9picemar_\r\nfor \xc3\xa9picier, _caf\xc3\xa9mar_ for caf\xc3\xa9. In 1823, when the diorama created a\r\nsensation in Paris, the people spoke in _rama_ (_on parlait en rama_.)\r\nIn Balzac\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful tale, _Le P\xc3\xa8re Goriot_, the young painter at the\r\nboarding-house dinner-table mystifies the landlady by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\r\nbeautiful _soupeaurama_!\xe2\x80\x9d To which the old woman replies, to the great\r\nlaughter of the company, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, sir, it is _une soupe \xc3\xa0\r\nchoux_.\xe2\x80\x9d These adaptations can hardly be called slang, or we shall have\r\neverybody making a slang of his own, and refusing to believe in any\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s else\xe2\x80\x94a sort of secondhand edition of the Tower of Babel.\r\n\r\n~Gib-face~, a heavy, ugly face; GIB is properly the lower lip of a\r\nhorse; \xe2\x80\x9cto hang one\xe2\x80\x99s GIB,\xe2\x80\x9d to pout the lower lip, to be angry or\r\nsullen.\r\n\r\n~Gibus~, an opera hat.

At some schools blows on the hand\r\nadministered with a cane are so called.\r\n\r\n~Handicap~, an arrangement by which, in any description of sport, every\r\ncompetitor in a race is supposed to have a chance of winning equal to\r\nthe chances of his opponents. HANDICAPPING, in horse-racing signifies\r\nthe adjudgment of various weights to horses differing in age, power, and\r\nspeed, so as to place them as much as possible on an equality. At other\r\nsports this equalization is managed by means of starts.\r\n\r\nThe old game of HANDICAP (hand i\xe2\x80\x99 the cap) is a very different affair;\r\nand, as it is now almost obsolete, being only played by gentlemen in\r\nIreland, after hunting and racing dinners, when the wine has circulated\r\npretty freely, merits a description here. It is played by three persons,\r\nin the following manner:\xe2\x80\x94A wishes to obtain some article belonging to\r\nB, say a horse; and offers to \xe2\x80\x9cchallenge\xe2\x80\x9d his watch against it. B\r\nagrees; and C is chosen as HANDICAPPER to \xe2\x80\x9cmake the award\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, to\r\nname the sum of money that the owner of the article of lesser value\r\nshall give with it, in exchange for the more valuable one. The three\r\nparties, A, B, and C, put down a certain stake each, and then the\r\nHANDICAPPER makes his award. If A and B are both satisfied with the\r\naward, the exchange is made between the horse and watch, and the\r\nHANDICAPPER wins, and takes up the stakes. Or if neither be satisfied\r\nwith the award, the HANDICAPPER takes the stakes; but if A be satisfied\r\nand B not, or _vice vers\xc3\xa2_, the party who declares himself satisfied\r\ngets the stakes. It is consequently the object of the HANDICAPPER to\r\nmake such award as will cause the challenger and challenged to be of the\r\nsame mind; and considerable ingenuity is required and exhibited on his\r\npart. The challenge having been made, as stated, between A\xe2\x80\x99s watch and\r\nB\xe2\x80\x99s horse, each party puts his HAND into a CAP or hat [or into his\r\npocket] while C makes the award, which he purposely does in as rapid and\r\ncomplex a manner as possible. Thus, after humorously exaggerating the\r\nvarious excellences of the articles, he may say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe owner of the\r\nsuperior gold lever watch shall give to the owner of the beautiful\r\nthoroughbred bay horse, called Flyaway, the watch and fifteen\r\nhalf-crowns, seven crowns, eighteen half-guineas, one hundred and forty\r\ngroats, thirteen sovereigns, fifty-nine pence, seventeen shillings and\r\nsixty-three farthings. Draw, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d A and B must instantly then\r\ndraw out and open their hands. If money appears in both, they are\r\nagreed, and the award stands good; if money be in neither hand, they are\r\nalso agreed, but the award is rejected. If money be only in one hand,\r\nthey are not agreed, the award is off, and the stakes go as already\r\nstated. Very frequently, neither A nor B is sufficiently quick in his\r\nmental calculation to follow the HANDICAPPER, and not knowing on the\r\ninstant the total of the various sums in the award, prefers being \xe2\x80\x9coff,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand, therefore, \xe2\x80\x9cdraws\xe2\x80\x9d no money. As in this event the HANDICAPPER gets\r\nthe stakes, the reason for the complex nature of his award is obvious.\r\n\r\nWhen HANDICAPPING has once commenced in a convivial party, it is\r\nconsidered unsportsmanlike to refuse a challenge. So when the small\r\nhours draw on, and the fun becomes fast and furious, coats, boots,\r\nwaistcoats, even shirts are challenged, HANDICAPPED, and exchanged,\r\namidst an almost indescribable scene of good humoured joviality and\r\nstentorian laughter. This is the true HANDICAP. The application of the\r\nterm to horse-racing has arisen from one or more persons being chosen to\r\nmake the award between persons, who put down equal sums of money, on\r\nentering horses unequal in power and speed for the same race. So that\r\nthe HANDICAP has ultimately come to be regarded as an arrangement of a\r\npurely business-like nature, by which means affairs, no matter how much\r\nthey may differ in degree, may be arranged satisfactorily by all\r\nparties. The use of the word is spreading rapidly, and it has already a\r\nsense beyond that of mere sporting.\r\n\r\n~Handicap~, to make even, as a Roland for an Oliver. Not long since in a\r\npedestrian enclosure, a pugilist who had been specially retained on one\r\nside struck a member of the other party, who not being a fighting-man\r\nreceived the blow with apparent contentment. The injured person had,\r\nhowever, determined on being revenged, and about an hour afterwards he\r\nknocked the professional down with a big stick, using the words at the\r\nsame time, \xe2\x80\x9cthat HANDICAPS us\xe2\x80\x9d (that makes us even). The word is often\r\nused thus also: A man finding himself inferior to another at fisticuffs\r\nwill, seizing a weapon, exclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll HANDICAP you,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring\r\nyou to my level (or \xe2\x80\x9clevel myself up\xe2\x80\x9d) with this.\r\n\r\n~Handle~, a nose; the title appended to a person\xe2\x80\x99s name; also a term in\r\nboxing, \xe2\x80\x9cto HANDLE one\xe2\x80\x99s fists,\xe2\x80\x9d to use them against an adversary.\r\n\r\n~Handling~, a method of concealing certain cards in the palm of the\r\nhand, or in fashionable long wristbands; one of the many modes of\r\ncheating practised by sharpers.\r\n\r\n~Hand-me-downs~, second-hand clothes. _See_ REACH-ME-DOWNS.\r\n\r\n~Hand-saw~, or CHIVE FENCER, a man who sells razors and knives in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n~Handseller~, or CHEAP JACK, a street or open-air seller, a man who\r\ncarries goods to his customers, instead of waiting for his customers to\r\nvisit him.\r\n\r\n~Hanging~, in difficulties.

From information, or good\r\njudgment, a backer selects, say, three horses, A, B, and C, whom he\r\nthinks likely to advance in the betting, and takes 50 to 1\xe2\x80\x94say \xc2\xa31000 to\r\n\xc2\xa320\xe2\x80\x94against each of them. As the race-day approaches the horse A may\r\nfall out of the betting, from accident or other cause, and have to be\r\nwritten off as a dead loss of \xc2\xa320. But the other two horses, as\r\nanticipated, improve in public favour, and the backer, who now becomes a\r\nHEDGER, succeeds in laying 5 to 1\xe2\x80\x94say \xc2\xa3500 to \xc2\xa3100\xe2\x80\x94against B, and 2 to\r\n1\xe2\x80\x94say 500 to \xc2\xa3250\xe2\x80\x94against C. The account then stands thus:\xe2\x80\x94A is a\r\ncertain loss of \xc2\xa320; but if B wins, the HEDGER will receive \xc2\xa31000 and\r\npay \xc2\xa3500; balance in favour, \xc2\xa3500. If B loses, the HEDGER will receive\r\n\xc2\xa3100 and pay \xc2\xa320; balance in favour, \xc2\xa380. If C wins, the hedger will\r\nreceive \xc2\xa31000 and pay \xc2\xa3500; balance in favour, \xc2\xa3500. If C loses, the\r\nHEDGER will receive \xc2\xa3250 and pay \xc2\xa320; balance in favour, \xc2\xa3230.\r\nDeducting, then, the loss of \xc2\xa320 on A, the HEDGER\xe2\x80\x99S winnings will be\r\nconsiderable; and he cannot lose, providing his information or judgment\r\nlead to the required result. It must be borne in mind that very often a\r\nman who feels inclined to go in for a HEDGING speculation, may back half\r\na dozen horses, not one of which sees a short price or goes to the post;\r\nbesides which it must never be forgotten, that, however well turf\r\nspeculations may look on paper, they are subject to the contingency of\r\nthe bets being honourably paid on settling-day\xe2\x80\x94the Monday after a\r\nrace\xe2\x80\x94when unfortunately there are often more \xe2\x80\x9creceivers\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9cpayers\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nat the clubs. However, turf transactions are among professionals\r\nconducted at least as honourably as are any other business matters; and\r\nit is only the fledgling swell, to whom the Legislature gives special\r\nopportunities of losing his money, who is generally _non est_ when\r\npaytime comes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Druid\xe2\x80\x9d in _Post and Paddock_ has remarked:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe term HEDGING has been quite superseded by \xe2\x80\x9claying off;\xe2\x80\x9d and we\r\n    had, in fact, quite forgotten it till we saw it stated in the papers\r\n    lately, by a clergyman, who did not answer a question on doctrine as\r\n    the Bishop of Exeter exactly liked, that his lordship addressed him\r\n    to this effect: \xe2\x80\x98You are HEDGING, sir; you are HEDGING!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUsually correct as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Druid\xe2\x80\x9d was, he seems to have fallen into an\r\nerror here, as HEDGING, and \xe2\x80\x9claying off,\xe2\x80\x9d have been exchangeable terms,\r\nas far as the oldest turfite can say. It should be remembered that\r\nHEDGING is generally done with the man who has originally laid the odds;\r\nfor as a natural consequence, when the backer finds it convenient to\r\nhedge, the layer finds it equally so to back the horse back,\xe2\x80\x94the first\r\nloss being considered always the best by bookmakers who _are_\r\nbookmakers. Besides which, the layer has generally a lot of \xe2\x80\x9cdead\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94money to the good over horses he has laid against, which have\r\nsince been struck out\xe2\x80\x94and this he profitably expends in backing certain\r\nhorses back for the purpose of levelling up the book.\r\n\r\n~Hedge-popping~, shooting small birds about the hedges, as boys do;\r\nunsportsmanlike kind of shooting.\r\n\r\n~Heel-tap~, the small quantity of wine or other beverage left in the\r\nbottom of a glass, considered as a sign that the liquor is not liked,\r\nand therefore unfriendly and unsocial to the host and the company. _See_\r\nDAY-LIGHT.\r\n\r\n~Heigh-ho!~ a cant term for stolen yarn, from the expression used to\r\napprize the dishonest shopkeeper that the speaker had stolen yarn to\r\nsell.\xe2\x80\x94_Norwich Cant._\r\n\r\n~Hell~, a fashionable gambling-house.

Webster gives this word, but not its root, HIDE,\r\nto beat, to flay by whipping. Most likely from the part attacked.

This is a very old term.\r\n\r\n~Humbug~, an imposition, or a person who imposes upon others. A very\r\nexpressive but slang word, synonymous at one time with HUM AND HAW.\r\nLexicographers for a long time objected to the adoption of this term.\r\nRichardson uses it frequently to express the meaning of other words,\r\nbut, strange to say, omits it in the alphabetical arrangement as\r\nunworthy of recognition! In the first edition of this work, 1785 was\r\ngiven as the earliest date at which the word could be found in a printed\r\nbook. Since then HUMBUG has been traced half a century further back, on\r\nthe title-page of a singular old jest-book\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_The Universal Jester_; or\r\na pocket companion for the Wits: being a choice collection of merry\r\nconceits, facetious drolleries, &c., clenchers, closers, closures,\r\nbon-mots, and HUMBUGS,\xe2\x80\x9d by Ferdinando Killigrew. London, about 1735-40.\r\n\r\nThe notorious Orator Henley was known to the mob as ORATOR HUMBUG. The\r\nfact may be learned from an illustration in that exceedingly curious\r\nlittle collection of _Caricatures_, published in 1757, many of which\r\nwere sketched by Lord Bolingbroke\xe2\x80\x94Horace Walpole filling in the names\r\nand explanations. Halliwell describes HUMBUG as \xe2\x80\x9ca person who hums,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ncites Dean Milles\xe2\x80\x99s MS., which was written about 1760. In the last\r\ncentury, the game now known as double-dummy was termed HUMBUG. Lookup, a\r\nnotorious gambler, was struck down by apoplexy when playing at this\r\ngame. On the circumstance being reported to Foote, the wit said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I\r\nalways thought he would be HUMBUGGED out of the world at last!\xe2\x80\x9d It has\r\nbeen stated that the word is a corruption of Hamburgh, from which town\r\nso many false bulletins and reports came during the war in the last\r\ncentury. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is _Hamburgh_ [or HUMBUG],\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer to any\r\nfresh piece of news which smacked of improbability. Grose mentions it in\r\nhis Dictionary, 1785; and in a little printed squib, published in 1808,\r\nentitled _Bath Characters_, by T. Goosequill, HUMBUG is thus mentioned\r\nin a comical couplet on the title-page:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWee Thre Bath Deities bee,\r\n    HUMBUG, Follie, and Varietee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGradually from this time the word began to assume a place in periodical\r\nliterature, and in novels written by not over-precise authors. In the\r\npreface to a flat, and most likely unprofitable poem, entitled, _The\r\nReign of HUMBUG, a Satire_, 8vo, 1836, the author thus apologizes for\r\nthe use of the word:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have used the term HUMBUG to designate this\r\nprinciple [wretched sophistry of life generally], considering that, it\r\nis now adopted into our language as much as the words dunce, jockey,\r\ncheat, swindler, &c., which were formerly only colloquial terms.\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\ncorrespondent, who in a number of _Adversaria_ ingeniously traced\r\nbombast to the inflated Doctor Paracelsus Bombast, considers that HUMBUG\r\nmay, in like manner, be derived from Homberg, the distinguished chemist\r\nof the court of the Duke of Orleans, who, according to the following\r\npassage from Bishop Berkeley\xe2\x80\x99s _Siris_, was an ardent and successful\r\nseeker after the philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s stone!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa7194.\xe2\x80\x94Of this there cannot be a better proof than the experiment\r\n    of Monsieur Homberg, who made gold of mercury by introducing light\r\n    into its pores, but at such trouble and expense that, I suppose,\r\n    nobody will try the experiment for profit. By this injunction of\r\n    light and mercury, both bodies became fixed, and produced a\r\n    third different to either, to wit, real gold. For the truth\r\n    of which fact I refer to the memoirs of the French Academy of\r\n    Sciences.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Berkeley\xe2\x80\x99s Works_, vol ii. p. 366 (Wright\xe2\x80\x99s edition).\r\n\r\nAnother derivation suggested is that of AMBAGE, a Latin word adopted\r\ninto the English language _temp._ Charles I.

Again, in the (burlesque) _Loves of Hero and Leander_\r\n(date 1642), we find \xe2\x80\x9cMUM-BUG, quoth he, \xe2\x80\x99twas known of yore,\xe2\x80\x9d a cant\r\nexpression, no doubt, commanding a person to \xe2\x80\x9cshut up,\xe2\x80\x9d or hold his\r\ntongue, and evidently derived from the game of _mum-budget_ or\r\n_silence_, upon which Halliwell (_Dict. Arch_.) has descanted.\r\n\r\n    AMBAGE is also used in the sense of \xe2\x80\x9ccircumlocution.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWithout any\r\n    long studie or tedious AMBAGE.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Puttenham_, _Art of Poesie_.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cUmh! y\xe2\x80\x99 are full of AMBAGE.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Decker\xe2\x80\x99s Whore of Babylon_, 1607.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThus from her cell Cum\xc3\xa6an Sibyl sings\r\n    Ambiguous AMBAGES, the cloyster rings\r\n    With the shrill sound thereof, in most dark strains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n        _Vicar\xe2\x80\x99s Virgil_, 1632.\r\n\r\nDe Quincey thus discourses upon the word:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe word HUMBUG, for instance, rests upon a rich and comprehensive\r\n    basis; it cannot be rendered adequately either by German or by\r\n    Greek, the two richest of human languages; and without this\r\n    expressive word we should all be disarmed for one great case,\r\n    continually recurrent, of social enormity. A vast mass of villany,\r\n    that cannot otherwise be reached by legal penalties, or brought\r\n    within the rhetoric of scorn, would go at large with absolute\r\n    impunity were it not through the stern Rhadamanthean aid of this\r\n    virtuous and inexorable word.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Article on \xe2\x80\x9cLanguage.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nThe original collater of these notes purchased the collection of essays\r\nknown as the _Connoisseur_ at the sale of Thackeray\xe2\x80\x99s library. At the\r\nend of vol. i. he found a memorandum in the great humourist\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandwriting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cp. 108, \xe2\x80\x98HUMBUG,\xe2\x80\x99 a new-coined expression.\xe2\x80\x9d On referring\r\nto that page (in the 3rd edition, 1757) this paragraph was noted:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe same conduct of keeping close to their ranks was observed at\r\n    table, where the ladies seated themselves together. Their\r\n    conversation was here also confined wholly to themselves, and seemed\r\n    like the mysteries of the _Bona Dea_, in which men were forbidden to\r\n    have any share. It was a continued laugh and whisper from the\r\n    beginning to the end of dinner. A whole sentence was scarce ever\r\n    spoken aloud. Single words, indeed, now and then broke forth; such\r\n    as, odious, horrible, detestable, shocking, HUMBUG. This last\r\n    new-coined expression, which is only to be found in the nonsensical\r\n    vocabulary, sounds absurd and disagreeable whenever it is\r\n    pronounced; but from the mouth of a lady it is \xe2\x80\x98shocking,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98detestable,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98horrible,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98odious.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe use of this term is almost universal; in California there is a town\r\ncalled Humbug Flat\xe2\x80\x94a name which gives a significant hint of the\r\nacuteness of the first settler.\r\n\r\n~Humdrum~, monotonous, tedious, tiresome, boring; \xe2\x80\x9ca society of\r\ngentlemen who used to meet near the Charter House, and at the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHead, St. John\xe2\x80\x99s Street, Clerkenwell. They were characterized by less\r\nmystery and more pleasantry than the Freemasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Bacchus and Venus_,\r\n1737. In the West the term applies to a low cart.\r\n\r\n~Humming~, strong as applied to drink. Extra strong ale is often\r\ncharacterized as \xe2\x80\x9cHUMMING October.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe from its effect on heads not\r\nquite so strong.\r\n\r\n~Hump~, low spirits.

Both the verb and its use have\r\ntheir origin with our Transatlantic cousins, and \xe2\x80\x9cinterviewing\xe2\x80\x9d by means\r\nof special reporters, who question most minutely, is of frequent\r\noccurrence,\xe2\x80\x94of occurrence whenever opportunity offers. Should a man be\r\nfound guilty of murder, or start as a candidate for the Presidency, he\r\nwill be INTERVIEWED by \xe2\x80\x9cour special correspondent,\xe2\x80\x9d and there are\r\nalready signs of this objectionable form of newspaper work finding its\r\nway here. Should a visitor of importance arrive in New York, the\r\nconversation which passes, or is supposed to pass, between him and the\r\nreporter will be found minutely described, with an elaborate\r\nintroduction. It is but fair to Americans, however, to say that the\r\ngentleman to whom the credit, or discredit, of the invention of this\r\nsystem belongs was a native of Great Britain, who invented many other\r\nstartling Americanisms during his residence in New York.\r\n\r\n~Into~, \xe2\x80\x9chold my hat, Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be INTO him,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, I will fight him.\r\nIn this sense equivalent to pitch INTO, or slip INTO.\r\n\r\n~Invite~, an invitation\xe2\x80\x94a corruption used by stuck-up people of\r\nmushroom origin.

The Irish\r\nAmerican body is a power in the United States, and is the fount-spring\r\nas well as the maintaining power of all Fenianism.\r\n\r\n~Irish apricots~, potatoes.\r\n\r\n~Irish Cockney~, a child born of Irish parents in any part of the\r\nsouthern counties of England. It is a singular fact that Irishmen born\r\nprofess great abhorrence of IRISH COCKNEYS, while the latter despise all\r\nIrish, and use the word as one of reproach. IRISH COCKNEYS were\r\noriginally only Cockneys born of an Irish strain, but the term has\r\nproved very elastic, and threatens soon to mean any English-born person\r\nwhose descent is Hibernian. Liverpool will, however, always prove an\r\nexception to the rule, as the name \xe2\x80\x9cLiverpool Irishmen\xe2\x80\x9d is given to\r\nthose who would in any southern part be called Cockneys.\r\n\r\n~Irish theatre~, the temporary prison, guard-room, or lock-up in a\r\nbarracks. The fond fancy of the soldier supplies it with other\r\nfigurative appellations, as \xe2\x80\x9cthe mill,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe jigger,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe house that\r\nJack built.\xe2\x80\x9d In Edinburgh Castle it is termed \xe2\x80\x9cthe dryroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Irons in the fire~, a man is said to have too many IRONS IN THE FIRE\r\nwhen he turns his attention to too many occupations or enterprises at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n~Isthmus of Suez~, the covered bridge at St. John\xe2\x80\x99s College, Cambridge,\r\nwhich connects the college with its grounds on the other side of the\r\nriver.\xe2\x80\x94_See_ CRACKLE.\r\n\r\n~Ivories~, teeth; \xe2\x80\x9ca box of IVORIES,\xe2\x80\x9d a set of teeth, the mouth; \xe2\x80\x9cwash\r\nyour IVORIES,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, \xe2\x80\x9cdrink.\xe2\x80\x9d The word is also used to denote dice.\r\n\r\n~Jabber~, to talk, or chatter.

In large gambling establishments\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cheaps of gold\xe2\x80\x9d are frequently composed of JACKS. JACKS are not, as\r\nthey are sometimes supposed to be, counterfeit coins; they are simply\r\nlittle medals, and so \xe2\x80\x9cmagsmen\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstreet muggers\xe2\x80\x9d carry them with\r\nless concern than they would feel were their pockets loaded with\r\nspurious money.\r\n\r\n~Jack Sprat~, a diminutive boy or man.\r\n\r\n~Jack Tar~, a sailor.\r\n\r\n~Jacob~, a ladder. Grose says, from Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s dream.\xe2\x80\x94_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s ladder~, a longitudinal flaw in the leg of a ballet-girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntights.\r\n\r\n~Jagger~, a gentleman. _German_, JAGER, a sportsman.\r\n\r\n~Jail-bird~, a prisoner, one who has been in jail.\r\n\r\n~James~, a sovereign, or twenty shillings.

An ingenious etymology has been\r\nfound for JARVEY, thus:\xe2\x80\x94JARVEY, vernacular for Geoffrey, which was\r\noften written Geo. (gee-ho), hence JARVEY. This is open to considerable\r\nobjection, as George is shortened in similar manner to that shown above.\r\nStill it is worthy of record, independently of its ingenuity, being as\r\nexact as many accepted derivations.\r\n\r\n~Jaw~, speech, or talk; \xe2\x80\x9chold your JAW,\xe2\x80\x9d don\xe2\x80\x99t speak any more; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are\r\nyou JAWING about?\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, what are you making a noise about?\r\n\r\n~Jaw~, to talk without cessation, to scold vehemently.\r\n\r\n~Jawbone~, credit.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a few persons whose pockets are to let\xe2\x80\x94men who have more\r\n    complaints than dollars\xe2\x80\x94individuals who, in digger\xe2\x80\x99s parlance, live\r\n    on JAWBONE (credit), and are always to be found at saloons; a class\r\n    of men who, when they are here, wish themselves yonder, and when\r\n    yonder, wish themselves back.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Times Correspondent, San Francisco,\r\n    Oct. 21, 1862._\r\n\r\n~Jaw-breaker~, a hard or excessively long word.

Probably a\r\ncorruption of the _Italian_, GIOJE; _French_, JOAILLE, a jewel. In\r\nancient times, when a king was short of cash, he generally issued orders\r\nfor so many JEWS\xe2\x80\x99 EYES, or equivalent sums of money. The Jews preferred\r\npaying the ransom, although often very heavy. It is notorious that in\r\nthis country the order often went forth to draw Jews\xe2\x80\x99 teeth in the\r\nevent of their refusing to contribute so much to the Exchequer. A\r\nprobable idea is, that as a Jew\xe2\x80\x99s teeth brought in so much money, the\r\nvalue of a JEW\xe2\x80\x99S EYE must be something fabulous. Possibly, also, from\r\nthe _lex talionis_ so strongly believed in by Jews,\xe2\x80\x94an eye for an eye,\r\nand nothing less. The term is used by Shakspeare.\r\n\r\n~Jezebel~, a showily-dressed woman of suspected character; derived, of\r\ncourse, from 2 Kings ix. 30, but applied in this sense from the time of\r\nthe Puritans. Also, a hot-tempered female.\r\n\r\n~Jib~, a first-year man.\xe2\x80\x94_Dublin University._\r\n\r\n~Jib~, or JIBBER, a horse that starts or shrinks.

That sail of a ship, which in position and\r\nshape, corresponds to the nose on a person\xe2\x80\x99s face.\xe2\x80\x94_Sea._ A vessel is\r\noften known by the cut of the JIB sail; hence the popular phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nknow a man by the cut of his JIB.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Jibb~, the tongue.\xe2\x80\x94_Gipsy_ and _Hindoo_.

Frequently\r\nused to conceal the fact of their being stolen, or otherwise dishonestly\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n~Job~, a short piece of work, a prospect of employment. Johnson\r\ndescribes JOB as a low word, without etymology. It is, and was, however,\r\na cant word; and a JOB, two centuries ago, was an arranged robbery. Even\r\nat the present day it is mainly confined to the streets, in the sense of\r\nemployment for a short time. Amongst undertakers a JOB signifies a\r\nfuneral; \xe2\x80\x9cto do a JOB,\xe2\x80\x9d conduct any one\xe2\x80\x99s funeral; \xe2\x80\x9cby the JOB,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._,\r\npiece-work, as opposed to time-work.

The term is derived (like BOBBY from Sir\r\nRobert Peel) from Joseph Hume. The explanation is thus given in\r\nHawkins\xe2\x80\x99s _History of the Silver Coinage of England_:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThese pieces are said to have owed their existence to the pressing\r\n    instance of Mr. Hume, from whence they, for some time, bore the\r\n    nickname of JOEYS. As they were very convenient to pay short cab\r\n    fares, the hon. M.P. was extremely unpopular with the drivers, who\r\n    frequently received only a groat where otherwise they would have\r\n    received a sixpence without any demand for change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe term, therefore, was originated by the London cabmen, who have\r\ninvented many other popular phrases. Fancy offering a modern hansom\r\ncabman a JOEY!\r\n\r\n~Jog-trot~, a slow but regular trot, or pace.\r\n\r\n~Jogul~, to play up, at cards or other game. _Spanish_, JUGAR.\r\n\r\n~John Blunt~, a straightforward, honest, outspoken man.\r\n\r\n~Johnny~, half-a-glass of whisky.\xe2\x80\x94_Irish._\r\n\r\n~Johnny Darbies~, a nickname for policemen, an evident corruption of the\r\n_French_ GENSDARMES.

According\r\nto tradition, JOHN ORDERLY was a noted showman, who taught this move to\r\nthe no less noted Richardson. This is like the old story of the publican\r\nwho used to call out to his waiter, \xe2\x80\x9cA pot of ale, Robert,\xe2\x80\x9d when he\r\nwished his customers to be served with the best; but \xe2\x80\x9cA pot of ale,\r\nBob,\xe2\x80\x9d when they had been drinking long enough not to distinguish good\r\nstuff from the bad the latter order meant. One day after calling for Bob\r\nmany times, he reluctantly, at the request of a visitor, tasted the ale,\r\nand found it was the best. Rushing out immediately afterwards, and\r\ncalling for Bob with all his voice, he was answered by his wife, who\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Bob\xe2\x80\x99s been out these three hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~John Thomas~, a generic for \xe2\x80\x9cflunkeys,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94more especially footmen with\r\nlarge calves and fine bushy whiskers.\r\n\r\n~Jolly~, a Royal Marine.\xe2\x80\x94_See_ HORSE MARINE.\r\n\r\n~Jolly~, a word of praise, or favourable notice; \xe2\x80\x9cchuck Harry a JOLLY,\r\nBill,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, go and praise up his goods, or buy of him, and speak well\r\nof the article, that the crowd standing around his stall may think it a\r\ngood opportunity for laying out their money. This is called JOLLYING.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChuck a JOLLY,\xe2\x80\x9d lit. translated, is, throw \xe2\x80\x9ca shout\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgood word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Jolly~, to abuse or vituperate, sometimes to \xe2\x80\x9cbear up\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbonnet.\xe2\x80\x9d To\r\nJOLLY a man often means to give him a piece of one\xe2\x80\x99s mind.

Painters seem to\r\nhave accepted this idea, with modifications as to the exact amount of\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n~Jug~, a prison of any kind.

The\r\nRev. E. S. Taylor supplies the following note from his MS. additions to\r\nthe work of the East-Anglian lexicographer:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe allusion is to the way in which a slaughtered pig is hung\r\n    up\xe2\x80\x94viz., by passing the ends of a bent piece of wood behind the\r\n    tendons of the hind legs, and so suspending it to a hook in a beam\r\n    above. This piece of wood is locally termed a BUCKET, and so by a\r\n    coarse metaphor the phrase came to signify to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother correspondent says the real signification of this phrase is to\r\ncommit suicide by hanging, from a method planned and carried out by an\r\nostler at an inn on the Great North Road. Standing on a bucket, he tied\r\nhimself up to a beam in the stable; he then KICKED THE BUCKET away from\r\nunder his feet, and in a few seconds was dead. The natives of the West\r\nIndies have converted the expression into \xe2\x80\x9ckickeraboo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Kick over the traces~, to be over-extravagant.

The women sometimes\r\nwear KINGSMAN kerchiefs thrown over their shoulders. A coster will often\r\nimagine his caste, or position, is at stake, if his KINGSMAN is not of\r\nthe most approved pattern. When he fights, his KINGSMAN is tied around\r\nhis waist as a belt. This partiality for a peculiar-coloured neckcloth\r\nis part of the fondness for gaudy colours which at all times and in all\r\ncountries has been shown by the uncultivated. A strange similarity of\r\ntaste for certain colours exists amongst the Hindoos, Gipsies, and\r\nLondon lower classes. Red and yellow (or orange) are the great\r\nfavourites, and in these hues the Hindoo selects his turban and his\r\nrobe; the gipsy his breeches, and his wife her shawl or gown; and the\r\ncostermonger, his plush waistcoat and favourite KINGSMAN. Among either\r\nclass, when a fight takes place, the greatest regard is paid to the\r\nfavourite coloured article of dress. The Hindoo lays aside his turban,\r\nthe gipsy folds up his fancy breeches or coat, whilst the pugilistic\r\ncostermonger of Covent Garden or Billingsgate removes his favourite\r\nneckerchief to a part of his body, by the rules of the \xe2\x80\x9cring,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncomparatively out of danger.\r\n\r\n~King\xe2\x80\x99s pictures~ (now, of course, QUEEN\xe2\x80\x99S PICTURES), money.\r\n\r\n~Kisky~, drunk, fuddled.\r\n\r\n~Kiss-curl~, a small curl twisted on the temple. _See_ BOWCATCHER.\r\n\r\n~Kisser~, the mouth.\xe2\x80\x94_Pugilistic term._\r\n\r\n~Kissing-crust~, the soft crust which marks where one loaf has been\r\nbroken from another.\r\n\r\n~Kiss-me-quick~, the name given to the very small bonnets which have of\r\nlate years become fashionable.\r\n\r\n~Kit~, a person\xe2\x80\x99s baggage.

Accordingly, when they ultimately came upon a dungheap,\r\nthey judged by the signs therein that it must be a MARE\xe2\x80\x99S NEST,\r\nespecially as they could see the mare close handy. An old preacher in\r\nCornwall up to very lately employed a different simile, as, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like a\r\ncow calving up in a tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Marine~, or MARINE RECRUIT, an empty bottle. This expression having\r\nonce been used in the presence of an officer of marines, he was at first\r\ninclined to take it as an insult, until some one adroitly appeased his\r\nwrath by remarking that no offence could be meant, as all that it could\r\npossibly imply was, \xe2\x80\x9cone who had done his duty, and was ready to do it\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Mark~, to make one\xe2\x80\x99s MARK is to achieve a success literary, artistic,\r\nor otherwise.

We say, \xe2\x80\x9cas dead as a\r\ndoor-NAIL;\xe2\x80\x9d most possibly because of \xe2\x80\x9capt alliteration.\xe2\x80\x9d Shakspeare has\r\nthe expression in _Henry IV._\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c_Falstaff._ What! is the old king dead?\r\n\r\n    _Pistol._ As NAIL in door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickens, in that marvellous little book, _A Christmas Carol_, says:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOld Marley was as dead as a DOOR-NAIL.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cMind!

For at\r\nthe game of that name, in fairness to both parties, the nine pins must\r\nalways be set up with great accuracy. There is no nicety in NINEPENCE!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEvidently this correspondent does not know how nice it is to have\r\nninepence, after being without money.

Really, the word glasses is understood.

The Oxford and Cambridge boatrace, the Derby,\r\nand other events of a like character, are each said to be simply excuses\r\nto the Cockneys for a day\xe2\x80\x99s OUTING.\r\n\r\n~Out of collar~, out of place,\xe2\x80\x94in allusion to servants. When in place,\r\nthe term is IN COLLAR.

It also means to be in\r\nsearch of anything profitable, without much care as to honesty or\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n~Outsider~, a person who does not habitually bet, or is not admitted to\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cring,\xe2\x80\x9d a duffer or good-for-nothing fellow.

The same\r\nphrase would also be used to imply that an excess of flattery or praise\r\nwas being employed for a similar purpose, but that the adulation was\r\nbeing \xe2\x80\x9claid on a little too thick\xe2\x80\x9d to be considered genuine. Also used\r\nthus sometimes: \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t come Shakspeare OVER me,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t assume an air of immeasurable literary superiority OVER me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t come Rothschild OVER me,\xe2\x80\x9d &c.\r\n\r\n~Over~, in cricket, four balls delivered from one end to another. After\r\nan OVER has been bowled, the fielders, wicket-keepers, &c., change ends,\r\nand the bowling goes on from the recent batting wicket. A MAIDEN-OVER is\r\nan OVER from which no runs are obtained. Four balls is the regulation\r\nnumber to an OVER in all important matches; but little clubs and\r\npractice elevens suit their own convenience.\r\n\r\n~Overs~, the odd money remaining after the daily accounts are made up at\r\na banking-house,\xe2\x80\x94usually divided amongst the clerks. _See_ MENAVELINGS\r\nand SHORTS.\r\n\r\n~Owned~, a slang expression used by the ultra-Evangelicals when a\r\npopular preacher makes many converts. The converts themselves are called\r\nhis \xe2\x80\x9cseals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~P. P.~, an expression much in use among racing men, which means play or\r\npay, _i.e._, either go on with the arrangement or forfeit the money. The\r\nfollowing is a law of the turf on the subject:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    The following races shall be considered \xe2\x80\x9cplay or pay\xe2\x80\x9d:\xe2\x80\x94The Derby\r\n    and Oaks at Epsom, the St. Leger at Doncaster, the Two Thousand\r\n    Guineas, the One Thousand Guineas, the Cesarewitch and\r\n    Cambridgeshire, at Newmarket, the Ascot, Goodwood, and Doncaster\r\n    Cups, and all handicaps above 200 sovs. value with two forfeits, the\r\n    minor of which shall not be less than 5 sovs.; and the Committees of\r\n    Tattersall\xe2\x80\x99s, and of the Subscription Room at Newmarket, will take\r\n    no cognisance of any disputes respecting \xe2\x80\x9cplay or pay\xe2\x80\x9d bets on any\r\n    other races, or of any bets made upon handicap races before the\r\n    weights are published.\r\n\r\nThis is the exact law on the subject, but as a rule all bets on\r\nhorse-racing are considered P. P. unless otherwise arranged. In all\r\nmatches, though, whether turf, pedestrian, aquatic, or otherwise, a run\r\nis given for the money in ordinary betting transactions.\r\n\r\n~P\xe2\x80\x99s and q\xe2\x80\x99s~, particular points, precise behaviour; \xe2\x80\x9cmind your P\xe2\x80\x99S and\r\nQ\xe2\x80\x99S,\xe2\x80\x9d be very careful. Originating, according to some, from the\r\nsimilarity of P\xe2\x80\x99S and Q\xe2\x80\x99S in the hornbook alphabet, and therefore the\r\nwarning of an old dame to her pupils, or, according to others, of a\r\nFrench dancing-master to his pupils, to mind their _pieds_ (feet) and\r\n_queues_ (wigs) when bowing.\r\n\r\n~Pack~, to go away; \xe2\x80\x9cnow, then, PACK off there,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, be off, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstop here any longer.\xe2\x80\x94_Old._ \xe2\x80\x9cMake speede to flee, be PACKING\r\nawaie.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Baret\xe2\x80\x99s Alvearie_, 1580.

Publishers of magazines seem to\r\nthink that if they get a serial story from a popular novelist they can\r\npack any amount of rubbish into the remaining pages. This is not so in\r\nAmerica, as magazines like the _Atlantic Monthly_ and the _Overland\r\nMonthly_ show.\r\n\r\n~Padding-ken~, or CRIB, tramps\xe2\x80\x99 and boys\xe2\x80\x99 lodging-house.\r\n\r\n~Paddle~, to go or run away.\xe2\x80\x94_American._\r\n\r\n~Paddy~, PAT, or PADDY WHACK, an Irishman.

From the Portuguese.\r\n\r\n~Pal~, a partner, acquaintance, friend, an accomplice. _Gipsy_, a\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n~Palampo~, a quilt or bed-cover. Probably from PALANPORE, a town in\r\nIndia, renowned for its manufacture of chintz\r\ncounterpanes.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Palaver~, to ask, or talk\xe2\x80\x94deceitfully or otherwise, as occasion\r\nrequires; \xe2\x80\x9cPALAVER to his nibs for a shant of bivvy,\xe2\x80\x9d ask the master for\r\na pot of beer. NANTEE PALAVER (pronounced PERLARVER), cease talking. In\r\nthis sense used by tramps. Derived from the Portuguese.\r\n\r\n~Pall~, to stop; \xe2\x80\x9cPALL that,\xe2\x80\x9d spoken authoritatively, means, cease what\r\nyou are doing. From PALL, a small instrument which is used to stop the\r\nwindlass or capstan at sea. When a man says, \xe2\x80\x9cI am PALLED,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmeans he cannot or dare not say any more. A sailor, on receiving any\r\nextraordinary intelligence, will say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou PALL me,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, you\r\nconfound me. Most likely from the order frequently given on board ship,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEase and PALL.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Palm~, to impose upon. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t PALM that off upon me,\xe2\x80\x9d is said when\r\nan intending purchaser is suspicious of the quality of the article\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n~Palm oil~, or PALM SOAP, money; also, a bribe.\r\n\r\n~Palmer~, a swindler who used to visit shops under the pretence of\r\ncollecting harp halfpence. To induce shopkeepers to search for them, he\r\noffered thirteenpence for one shilling\xe2\x80\x99s-worth, when many persons were\r\nsilly enough to empty a large quantity of copper on their counters. The\r\nPALMER, a proficient with his fingers, generally contrived to conceal\r\nsome before he left the shop.\r\n\r\n~Palming~, robbing shops by pairs\xe2\x80\x94one thief bargaining with apparent\r\nintent to purchase, whilst the other watches his opportunity to steal.\r\nThe following anecdote will give an idea of their _modus operandi_. A\r\nman once entered a \xe2\x80\x9cready-made\xe2\x80\x9d boot and shoe shop, and desired to be\r\nshown a pair of boots\xe2\x80\x94his companion staying outside and amusing himself\r\nby looking in at the window. The one who required to be fresh shod was\r\napparently of a humble and deferential turn, for he placed his hat on\r\nthe floor directly he stepped into the shop. Boot after boot was tried\r\non until at last a fit was obtained, when in rushed a man, snatched up\r\nthe customer\xe2\x80\x99s hat left near the door, and ran down the street as fast\r\nas his legs could carry him. Away went the customer after his hat, and\r\nCrispin, standing at the door, clapped his hands, and shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cGo it,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll catch him!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94little thinking that it was a concerted trick, and\r\nthat neither his boots nor the customer would ever return. Instances of\r\nthis kind of work frequently occur. PALMING sometimes refers to\r\nsecreting money or rings in the hand, as well as to bribing. PALMING is\r\nalso the generic term for all that kind of conjuring which depends on\r\nmanual dexterity, and which is totally distinct from the\r\nmechanical-contrivance department.\r\n\r\n~Pam~, the knave of clubs at the game of loo; or, in street phraseology,\r\nwhile the \xe2\x80\x9cJudicious Bottleholder\xe2\x80\x9d was alive, Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\n~Pannikin~, a small pan.\r\n\r\n~Pannum~, food, bread.\xe2\x80\x94_Lingua Franca_, PANNEN; _Latin_, PANIS;\r\n_Ancient Cant_, YANNAM.\r\n\r\n~Pannum-bound~, said of a pauper or prisoner when his food is stopped.\r\nPANNUM-STRUCK, very hungry, starving.\r\n\r\n~Panny~, a house\xe2\x80\x94public or otherwise; \xe2\x80\x9cflash PANNY,\xe2\x80\x9d a public-house\r\nused by thieves; PANNY-MEN, housebreakers. PANNY, in thieves\xe2\x80\x99 cant, also\r\nsignifies a burglary.\r\n\r\n~Pantalettes~, the drawers worn in America by little girls.\r\n\r\n~Pantile~, a hat. The term PANTILE is properly applied to the mould into\r\nwhich the sugar is poured which is afterwards known as \xe2\x80\x9cloaf sugar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThus, PANTILE, from whence comes the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9ca sugar-loaf hat,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\noriginally signified a tall, conical hat, in shape similar to that\r\nusually represented as the head-gear of a bandit. From PANTILE the more\r\nmodern slang term TILE has been derived. Halliwell gives PANTILE SHOP, a\r\nmeeting-house, from the steeple-crowned or PANTILE hats of its\r\nfrequenters. PANTILE also means a flat cake with jam on it, given to\r\nboys at boarding-schools instead of pudding.\r\n\r\n~Pantiler~, a Dissenting preacher. Probably from the practice of the\r\nQuakers, and many Dissenters, of not removing their hats in a place of\r\nworship; or from the sugar-loaf hats originally worn by Puritans.\r\nAnother derivation is from the earthen tiles, technically PANTILES\r\n(tiles hollowed in the middle, as distinguished from \xe2\x80\x9cpintiles,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nolder sort, which are flat, smaller, and pinned or nailed to the\r\nrafters), with which meeting-houses of Dissenters are usually covered;\r\nhence the meeting-house came to be called a PANTILE, and its frequenters\r\nPANTILERS.\r\n\r\n~Pants~, American term for trousers. Here used to represent the long\r\ndrawers worn underneath.\r\n\r\n~Panupetaston~, a loose overcoat with wide sleeves, now out of\r\nfashion.\xe2\x80\x94_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Paper-maker~, a rag-gatherer, or gutter-raker\xe2\x80\x94similar to the\r\nchiffonnier of Paris. Also, a man who tramps through the country, and\r\ncollects rags on the pretence that he is an agent to a paper mill.\r\n\r\n~Paper-Worker~, a wandering vendor of street literature; one who sells\r\nballads, dying speeches, and confessions, sometimes termed a \xe2\x80\x9crunning\r\nstationer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Parachute~, a parasol.\r\n\r\n~Paradise~, French slang for the gallery of a theatre, \xe2\x80\x9cup amongst the\r\nGODS,\xe2\x80\x9d which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Parish lantern~, the moon.\r\n\r\n~Parish prig~, or PARISH BULL, a parson.\xe2\x80\x94_Thieves\xe2\x80\x99 cant._\r\n\r\n~Parney~, rain; \xe2\x80\x9cdowry of PARNEY,\xe2\x80\x9d a quantity of rain. _Anglo-Indian_\r\nslang from the _Hindoo_, PANI, water; _Gipsy_, PANE. Old Indian officers\r\nalways call brandy-and-water \xe2\x80\x9cbrandy PAWNEE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Parson~, a signpost. Common term in the north, where they say that the\r\nPARSON points, but does not lead. This is given, as the lawyers say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwithout prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Parson Trulliber~, a rude, vulgar, country clergyman, devoted to\r\nagricultural pursuits; the race is most probably now extinct. From the\r\npig-feeding and pig-headed parson in _Joseph Andrews_.\r\n\r\n~Parson\xe2\x80\x99s nose~, the hind part of a goose\xe2\x80\x94a savoury mouthful. Sometimes\r\ncalled the POPE\xe2\x80\x99S NOSE.\r\n\r\n~Part~, to pay, restore, or give up; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s a right un, he is; I know\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d PART,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, he is a liberal (or punctual) person, and pays his\r\ndebts, or bestows gratuities. The term is in general use in sporting\r\ncircles, and is very commonly employed when speaking of the settlement\r\nof bets after a race. It is probably derived from the very common\r\nreference to stingy people, who are described as not liking to PART with\r\ntheir money.\r\n\r\n~Parter~, a free, liberal person. Sometimes called a \xe2\x80\x9cgood PARTER.\xe2\x80\x9d Any\r\none who looks twice at his money, or who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay it at all, is\r\ncalled a \xe2\x80\x9cbad PARTER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Party~, a person\xe2\x80\x94term in very general use, similar in application to\r\nthe German pronoun, MAN, a person, people; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x99s the PARTY as \xe2\x80\x99ad a\xe2\x80\x99\r\norter be lookin\xe2\x80\x99 after this \xe2\x80\x99ere \xe2\x80\x99oss?\xe2\x80\x9d policeman\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry of the wrong\r\ncabman; \xe2\x80\x9cold PARTY,\xe2\x80\x9d an elderly person. The term is said to have arisen\r\nin our old justice courts, where, to save \xe2\x80\x9chis worship\xe2\x80\x9d and the clerk of\r\nthe court any trouble in exercising their memories with the names of the\r\ndifferent plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses, the word PARTY was\r\ngenerally employed. Dean Alford remarked:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe word PARTY for a man is especially offensive. Strange to say,\r\n    the use is not altogether modern. It occurs in the English version\r\n    of the Apocryphal book of Tobit, vi. 7. \xe2\x80\x98If an evil spirit trouble\r\n    any, one must make a smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and\r\n    the PARTY shall be no more vexed.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn Shakspeare we find the term:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c_Stephano._ How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to\r\n    the PARTY?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Tempest_, iii. 2.\r\n\r\nThis is not the only instance of the word being used by the immortal\r\nbard. \xe2\x80\x9cI once heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dean just quoted, \xe2\x80\x9ca venerable dignitary\r\npointed out by a railway porter as an old PARTY in a shovel.\xe2\x80\x9d The last\r\nword is the vulgar term applied to the peculiar hat worn by clerical\r\ndignitaries.\r\n\r\n~Pash~, to strike; now corrupted to BASH, which _see_.\xe2\x80\x94_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Paste~, to beat, to thrash vigorously.\r\n\r\n~Pasteboard~, a visiting card; \xe2\x80\x9cto PASTEBOARD a person,\xe2\x80\x9d to drop a card\r\nat an absent person\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n~Paste-horn~, the nose. Shoemakers nickname any shopmate with a large\r\nnose \xe2\x80\x9cold PASTE-HORN,\xe2\x80\x9d from the shape of the horn in which they keep\r\ntheir paste.\r\n\r\n~Pasty~, a bookbinder.\r\n\r\n~Patch.~ This old English term of reproach, long obsolete in polite\r\nlanguage, may yet occasionally be heard in sentences like these:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s not a PATCH upon him,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, he is not to be compared with him;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cone\xe2\x80\x99s not a PATCH on the other,\xe2\x80\x9d &c. Shakspeare uses the word in the\r\nsense of a paltry fellow:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pied ninny\xe2\x80\x99s this? thou scurvy PATCH!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn old English PATCH meant a fool, a wearer of patched clothes of\r\nmotley.\r\n\r\n~Patent coats~, the first coat, with the pockets inside the skirt, were\r\nso termed.\r\n\r\n~Patter~, a speech or discourse, a pompous street oration, a judge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsumming up, a trial. Ancient word for muttering. Probably from the\r\n_Latin_, PATERNOSTER, or Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer. This was said, before the\r\nReformation, in a \xe2\x80\x9clow voice\xe2\x80\x9d by the priest, until he came to \xe2\x80\x9cand lead\r\nus not into temptation,\xe2\x80\x9d to which the choir responded, \xe2\x80\x9cbut deliver us\r\nfrom evil.\xe2\x80\x9d In the reformed Prayer Book this was altered, and the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nPrayer directed to be said \xe2\x80\x9cwith a _loud voice_.\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Pusey takes this\r\nview of the derivation in his _Letter to the Bishop of London_, p. 78,\r\n1851.

From the ancient\r\npeg tankard, which was furnished with a row of PINS, or pegs, to\r\nregulate the amount which each person was to drink. Drunken people are\r\noften requested to \xe2\x80\x9cput in the PIN,\xe2\x80\x9d from some remote connexion between\r\ntheir unsteadiness and that of a carriage wheel which has lost its\r\nlinch-PIN. The popular cry, \xe2\x80\x9cPut in the PIN,\xe2\x80\x9d can have no connexion with\r\nthe drinking PIN or peg now, whatever it may originally have had.

It was very fashionable in the last century, and derived\r\nits name from a Mr. PINCHBECK, a well-known London tradesman, who\r\nmanufactured watches, buckles, and other articles out of it. PINCHBECK\r\nfirst obtained his notoriety by the invention of an ingenious\r\ncandle-snuffers, which the author of _The Heroic Epistle to Sir William\r\nChambers_ made the vehicle of a facetious Ode that went through eight\r\neditions. The title of this _jeu d\xe2\x80\x99esprit_ ran thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c_Ode to Mr. Pinchbeck, upon his Newly-invented Candle-Snuffers, by_\r\n    MALCOLM M\xe2\x80\x99GREGOR, Esq., 1776.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIllustrious PINCHBECK! condescend,\r\n    Thou well-beloved, and best king\xe2\x80\x99s friend,\r\n    These lyric lines to view;\r\n    Oh, may they prompt thee, ere too late,\r\n    To snuff the candle of the State,\r\n    That burns a little blue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPINCHBECK published a poetical reply, and the two pamphlets were for a\r\nlong time the talk of the town.\r\n\r\n~Pink~, the acme of perfection.

There are but one or two now left.\r\n\r\n~Pins~, legs.\r\n\r\n~Pipe~, to follow or dog a person; to watch, to notice.\r\n\r\n~Pipe~, to shed tears, or bewail; \xe2\x80\x9cPIPE one\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Sea term._\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHe first began to eye his pipe.\r\n    And then to PIPE his eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Hood._\r\n\r\nMetaphor from the boatswain\xe2\x80\x99s pipe, which calls to duty.\r\n\r\n~Pipe~, \xe2\x80\x9cto put one\xe2\x80\x99s PIPE out,\xe2\x80\x9d to traverse his plans, \xe2\x80\x9cto take a rise\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nout of him. When any one meets with a rebuff or a sharp answer, he is\r\noften told to \xe2\x80\x9cput that in his PIPE and smoke it,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, to digest it\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n~Piper~, a person employed by an omnibus proprietor to act as a spy on\r\nthe conductor.\r\n\r\n~Piper~, a broken-winded hack horse.\r\n\r\n~Pipkin~, the stomach,\xe2\x80\x94properly, an earthen round-bottomed\r\npot\xe2\x80\x94_Norwich._\r\n\r\n~Pips~, the marks, no matter of what suit, on playing cards.

The\r\nmaker probably never sees the actual passers of base money, the buyer\r\nbeing generally the intercommunicating medium. The holder is generally a\r\nman who carries the bulk of the \xe2\x80\x9csnides,\xe2\x80\x9d and waits about; while the\r\npitcher, often a woman\xe2\x80\x94indeed, more often than not\xe2\x80\x94runs the actual\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\n~Pitch~, to go to bed for less than the ordinary period. Journeymen\r\nbakers, and others whose work is disjointed, call any short interval of\r\nsleep a PITCH.

This is the duty of\r\nthe judge, who sees nothing of the race but the finish.

To run\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnowhere\xe2\x80\x9d is to be unplaced.\r\n\r\n~Place~, first, second, or third position in a race.

About\r\ntwenty years ago \xe2\x80\x9cpluck,\xe2\x80\x9d the word then used, began to be superseded\r\nby PLOUGH. It is said to have arisen from a man who could not supply\r\nthe examiner with any quotation from Scripture, until at last he\r\nblurted out, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the ploughers ploughed on my back, and made long\r\nfurrows.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_University._\r\n\r\n~Ploughed~, drunk.\r\n\r\n~Pluck~, the heart, liver, and lungs of an animal,\xe2\x80\x94all that is PLUCKED\r\naway in connexion with the windpipe, from the chest of a sheep or hog.\r\n\r\n~Pluck~, to turn back at a University examination.

The word met with great disfavour at\r\nfirst from the \xe2\x80\x9cgenteel,\xe2\x80\x9d but of course they followed when aristocracy\r\ndeigned to use it.\r\n\r\n~Plum~, \xc2\xa3100,000, usually applied to the dowry of a rich heiress, to a\r\nlegacy, or to a sum made in business or by a lucky speculation.\r\n\r\n~Plum-cash~, prime cost.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Plummy~, round, sleek, jolly, or fat; excellent, very good, first-rate.\r\n\r\n~Plumper~, a single vote at an election, not a \xe2\x80\x9csplit ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Plunder~, a common word in the horse trade to express profit.

Also an unwelcome\r\nguest, who manages to be just in time for dinner.\r\n\r\n~Pot-luck~, just as it comes; to take POT-LUCK, _i.e._, one\xe2\x80\x99s chance of\r\na dinner, or of what there is for dinner.

The garter is then unfolded, and\r\nnine times out of ten you will find that you have been deceived, and\r\nthat one of the false folds has been pricked. The owner of the GARTER\r\nholds the ends tightly with one hand, and there is little doubt that he\r\ncan make the \xe2\x80\x9cflat\xe2\x80\x9d lose and the \xe2\x80\x9cbonnet\xe2\x80\x9d win at pleasure. This was,\r\ndoubtless, originally a gipsy game, and we are informed by Brand that it\r\nwas much practised by the gipsies in the time of Shakspeare. In those\r\ndays it was termed PRICKING AT THE BELT, or FAST AND LOOSE.\r\n\r\n~Prig~, a thief.

In Scotland the term PRIG is\r\nused in a different sense from what it is in England.

Many hangers-on of the turf live\r\nalmost entirely by what they are PUT ON, by bookmakers and backers for\r\nwhom they do odd work.\r\n\r\n~Put that in your pipe and smoke it~, said of a blow or repartee, and\r\nequivalent to take that and think over it, or digest it, or let it be a\r\nwarning to you.\r\n\r\n~Put the pot on~, to put too much money upon one horse.\xe2\x80\x94_Sporting._\r\n\r\n~Put up~, to suggest, to incite, \xe2\x80\x9che PUT me UP to it;\xe2\x80\x9d he prompted me to\r\ndo it.

A man of this description\r\nwill assume many characters, sometimes ingratiating himself with the\r\nmaster of a house, sometimes with the servants, but all to one end, that\r\nof robbery. He rarely or never joins in the actual burglary, his work\r\nbeing simply to obtain full particulars as to how, when, and where, for\r\nwhich he receives his full share of the \xe2\x80\x9cswag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Puttun~, regiment.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Pyah~, weak, useless, paltry. This word, much in use among sailors, is\r\nevidently derived from the Indian term PARIAH, signifying the lowest\r\ncaste of Hindoos.

It illustrates, like \xe2\x80\x9chocus-pocus,\xe2\x80\x9d and other compound\r\ncolloquialisms, the singular origin of slang expressions. QUANDARY, a\r\ndilemma, a doubt, a difficulty, is from the French, QU\xe2\x80\x99EN\r\nDIRAI-JE?\xe2\x80\x94_Skinner._\r\n\r\n~Quartereen~, a farthing.\xe2\x80\x94_Gibraltar term._ _Italian_, QUATTRINO.\r\n\r\n~Quaver~, a musician.\r\n\r\n~Quean~, a strumpet.

QUEER, in all probability, is immediately derived from the\r\ncant language. It has been mooted that it came into use from a _qu\xc3\xa6re_\r\n(?) being set before a man\xe2\x80\x99s name; but it is more than probable that it\r\nwas brought into this country, by the gipsies, from Germany, where QUER\r\nsignifies \xe2\x80\x9ccross\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccrooked.\xe2\x80\x9d At all events it is believed to have\r\nbeen first used in England as a cant word.\r\n\r\n~Queer~, \xe2\x80\x9cto QUEER a flat,\xe2\x80\x9d to puzzle or confound a \xe2\x80\x9cgull,\xe2\x80\x9d or silly\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWho in a row like Tom could lead the van,\r\n      Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?\r\n    Who QUEER a flat,\xe2\x80\x9d &c.\xe2\x80\x94_Don Juan_, xi. 19.\r\n\r\n~Queer bail~, worthless persons who for a consideration formerly stood\r\nbail for any one in court.

In this sense, as well\r\nas in that of the verb just given, the term is evidently derived from\r\n_qu\xc3\xa6ro_, to inquire, to question. Quiz and _quis?_ have also an\r\nundoubted connexion.\r\n\r\n~Queer-soft~, bad notes.\r\n\r\n~Queer-street~, \xe2\x80\x9cin QUEER STREET,\xe2\x80\x9d in difficulty or in want.\r\n\r\n~Querier~, a chimney-sweep who calls from house to house soliciting\r\nemployment,\xe2\x80\x94formerly termed KNULLER, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Qui-hi~, an English resident at Calcutta.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Quick sticks~, in a hurry, rapidly; \xe2\x80\x9cto cut QUICK STICKS,\xe2\x80\x9d to start off\r\nhurriedly, or without more ado. _See_ CUT ONE\xe2\x80\x99S STICK.\r\n\r\n~Quid~, or THICK UN, a sovereign; \xe2\x80\x9chalf a QUID,\xe2\x80\x9d half a sovereign;\r\nQUIDS, money generally; \xe2\x80\x9cQUID for a QUOD,\xe2\x80\x9d one good turn for another.\r\nThe word is used by old French writers:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cDes testamens qu\xe2\x80\x99on dit le maistre\r\n    De mon fait n\xe2\x80\x99aura QUID ne QUOD.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n        _Grand testament de Villon._\r\n\r\n~Quid~, a small piece of tobacco\xe2\x80\x94one mouthful. _Quid est hoc?_ asked\r\none, tapping the swelled cheek of another; _Hoc est quid_, promptly\r\nreplied the other, exhibiting at the same time a \xe2\x80\x9cchaw\xe2\x80\x9d of the weed. CUD\r\nis probably a corruption. Derivation, _O. F._, or _Norman_, QUIDER, to\r\nruminate.\r\n\r\n~Quid-nunc~, an inquisitive person, always seeking for news. The words\r\ntranslated simply signify, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Quiet~, \xe2\x80\x9con the QUIET,\xe2\x80\x9d clandestinely, so as to avoid observation,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cunder the rose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Quill-driver~, a scrivener, a clerk,\xe2\x80\x94satirical phrase similar to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csteel bar driver,\xe2\x80\x9d a tailor.\r\n\r\n~Quiller~, a parasite, a person who sucks neatly through a quill. _See_\r\nSUCK UP.\r\n\r\n~Quilt~, to thrash, or beat.\r\n\r\n~Quisby~, bankrupt, poverty-stricken.

The term would, therefore, with\r\ngreater propriety, be applied to a spy than to a solicitor.\r\n\r\n~Quiz~, a prying person, an odd fellow. Originally Oxford slang, but now\r\ngeneral, and lately admitted into some dictionaries. _See_ QUEER CUFFEN.\r\n\r\n~Quiz~, to pry, or joke; to hoax.\r\n\r\n~Quizzical~, jocose, humorous.\r\n\r\n~Quizzing-glass~, an eyeglass.

QUOD is really a\r\nshortening of quadrangle; so to be QUODDED is to be within four walls.\r\nThe expression is, however, seldom used now except to mean in prison. At\r\nOxford, where it is spelt QUAD, the word has its original signification.\r\n\r\n~Quodger~, a contraction, or corruption rather, of the _Latin_ law\r\nphrase, QUO JURE? by what law?\xe2\x80\x94_Legal._\r\n\r\n~R.

The term, from its frequent use, long\r\nsince claimed a place in our dictionaries; but, with the exception of\r\nJohnson, who says RUM, a cant word for a clergyman(!), no lexicographer\r\nhas deigned to notice it.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThus RUMLY floor\xe2\x80\x99d, the kind Acestes ran,\r\n    And pitying, raised from earth the game old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n        _Virgil\xe2\x80\x99s \xc3\x86neid_, book v., Translation _by Thomas Moore_.\r\n\r\n~Rum cull~, the manager of a theatre, generally the master of a\r\ntravelling troop.\r\n\r\n~Rumbler~, a four-wheeled cab.

Originally stable slang.\r\n\r\n~Run for the money~, TO HAVE A, to have a start given in with a bet. As\r\n20 to 1 against Doncaster, with a RUN given. _See_ P.P. To have a RUN\r\nFOR ONE\xe2\x80\x99S MONEY is also to have a good determined struggle for anything.\r\n\r\n~Run-in~, to lock up in the station-house. The police are very fond of\r\nthreatening to RUN-IN any person to whom they may take exception, and,\r\nas recent revelations have shown, are by no means averse from putting\r\ntheir threats into execution.\r\n\r\n~Running patterer~, a street seller who runs or moves briskly along,\r\ncalling aloud his wares.\r\n\r\n~Running stationer~, a hawker of books, ballads, dying speeches, and\r\nnewspapers. Persons of this class formerly used to run with newspapers,\r\nblowing a horn, when they were sometimes termed FLYING STATIONERS.\r\nNowadays, in the event of any political or social disturbance, the\r\nmiserable relics of these peripatetic newsmen bawl the heads of the\r\ntelegram or information in quiet London thoroughfares, to the\r\ndisturbance of the residents. The race is very nearly extinct, the\r\nevening-paper boys having run them to earth.\r\n\r\n~Rush~, to come upon suddenly, generally for the purpose of borrowing.\r\nTo \xe2\x80\x9cgive a man the RUSH,\xe2\x80\x9d is to spunge upon him all day, and then borrow\r\nmoney at the finish, or pursue some such similar mode of procedure.\r\n\r\n~Rush~, \xe2\x80\x9cdoing it on the RUSH,\xe2\x80\x9d running away, or making off.\r\n\r\n~Rust~, \xe2\x80\x9cto nab the RUST,\xe2\x80\x9d to take offence.

A SAFE card is a man who knows\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d A SAFE man among betters is one who is sure to fulfil\r\nhis engagements.\r\n\r\n~Safe un~, a horse which will not run, or will not try, in a race. The\r\nbookmakers in London have the information sent them by the touts in\r\ntheir pay, and lay against the SAFE UN, who is also called a \xe2\x80\x9cstiff un,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\na \xe2\x80\x9cdead un,\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cshtumer,\xe2\x80\x9d as often as they can, irrespective of the\r\nstate of their books. Sometimes a SAFE UN will win, owing to the owner\r\nor trainer having, for various reasons, altered his mind. Such a result\r\nthen goes to prove the \xe2\x80\x9cglorious uncertainty of the turf,\xe2\x80\x9d a phrase in\r\nvery common use among sporting writers whenever a favourite is beaten,\r\nor whenever a horse runs slow one day and loses, and very fast the next\r\nday and wins.\r\n\r\n~Sails~, nickname for the sail-maker on board ship.\r\n\r\n~St. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s lace~, imitation gold lace; stage tinsel.\r\n\r\n~Saint Monday~, a holiday most religiously observed by journeymen\r\nshoemakers and other mechanics. An Irishman observed that this saint\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanniversary happened every week. In some parts of the country Monday is\r\ntermed Cobblers\xe2\x80\x99 Sunday.\r\n\r\n~Sal~, a salary.\xe2\x80\x94_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Salaam~, a compliment or salutation.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Salamander~, a street acrobat and juggler who eats fire.\r\n\r\n~Saloop~, SALEP, or SALOP, a greasy-looking beverage, formerly sold on\r\nstalls at early morning, prepared from a powder made of the root of the\r\n_Orchis mascula_, or Red-handed Orchis. Coffee-stands have superseded\r\nSALOOP stalls; but, in addition to other writers, Charles Lamb, in one\r\nof his papers, has left some account of this drinkable, which he says\r\nwas of all preparations the most grateful to the stomachs of young\r\nchimney-sweeps. The present generation has no knowledge of this drink,\r\nexcept that derived from books. The word \xe2\x80\x9cslops\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as applied to weak,\r\nwarm drink\xe2\x80\x94is very likely derived from the Cockney pronunciation of\r\nSALOOP.\r\n\r\n~Salt~, a sailor.\r\n\r\n~Salt~, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s rather too SALT,\xe2\x80\x9d said of an extravagant hotel bill. Also,\r\na sort of black mail or tribute levied on visitors or travellers by the\r\nEton boys, at their triennial festival called the \xe2\x80\x9cMontem,\xe2\x80\x9d by ancient\r\ncustom and privileges. It is now abolished. A periodical published at\r\nEton many years ago for circulation amongst the boys was called \xe2\x80\x9c_The\r\nSALT-box_.\xe2\x80\x9d When a person about to sell a business connexion makes\r\nfictitious entries in the books of accounts, to simulate that a much\r\nmore profitable trade is carried on than there really is, he is said to\r\nSALT the books\xe2\x80\x94SALTING and COOKING being somewhat similar operations.\r\nAt the gold diggings of Australia, miners sometimes SALT an unproductive\r\nhole by sprinkling a few grains of gold-dust over it, and thus obtain a\r\ngood price from a \xe2\x80\x9cgreen hand.\xe2\x80\x9d Unpromising speculations are frequently\r\nthus SALTED to entrap the unwary, the wildest ideas being rendered\r\npalatable _cum grano salis_. And though old birds are not readily caught\r\nby chaff, the efficacy of SALT in bird-catching, so far as the young are\r\nconcerned, is proverbial.\r\n\r\n~Salt-box~, the condemned cell in Newgate.\r\n\r\n~Salt junk~, navy salt beef. _See_ OLD HORSE.\r\n\r\n~Saltee~, a penny. Pence, &c., are thus reckoned:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n ONEY SALTEE, a penny, from the _Italian_,             UNO SOLDO.\r\n DOOE SALTEE, twopence                                 DUE SOLDI.\r\n TRAY SALTEE, threepence                               TRE SOLDI.\r\n QUARTERER SALTEE, fourpence                           QUATTRO SOLDI.\r\n CHINKER SALTEE, fivepence                             CINQUE SOLDI.\r\n SAY SALTEE, sixpence                                  SEI SOLDI.\r\n SAY ONEY SALTEE, or SETTER SALTEE, sevenpence         SETTE SOLDI.\r\n SAY DOOE SALTEE, or OTTER SALTEE, eightpence          OTTO SOLDI.\r\n SAY TRAY SALTEE, or NOBBA SALTEE, ninepence           NOVE SOLDI.\r\n SAY QUARTERER SALTEE, or DACHA SALTEE, tenpence       DIECI SOLDI.\r\n SAY CHINKER SALTEE, or DACHA ONEY SALTEE, elevenpence DIECI UNO SOLDI, &c.\r\n ONEY BEONG, one shilling.\r\n A BEONG SAY SALTEE, one shilling and sixpence.\r\n DOOE BEONG SAY SALTEE, or MADZA CAROON, half-a-crown, or two\r\n shillings and sixpence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x81\x82 This curious list of numerals in use among the London street folk is,\r\nstrange as it may seem, derived from the _Lingua Franca_, or bastard\r\n_Italian_, of the Mediterranean seaports, of which other examples may be\r\nfound in the pages of this Dictionary. SALTEE, the cant term used by the\r\ncostermongers and others for a penny, is no other than the _Italian_,\r\nSOLDO (plural, SOLDI), and the numerals\xe2\x80\x94as may be seen by the _Italian_\r\nequivalents\xe2\x80\x94are a tolerably close imitation of the originals. After the\r\nnumber six, a curious variation occurs, which is peculiar to the London\r\ncant, seven being reckoned as SAY ONEY, _six-one_, SAY DOOE, _six-two_\r\n= 8, and so on. DACHA is perhaps from the _Greek_ \xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xba\xce\xb1, ten, which, in\r\nthe Constantinopolitan _Lingua Franca_, is likely enough to have been\r\nsubstituted for the _Italian_. MADZA is clearly the _Italian_ MEZZA. The\r\norigin of BEONG has not yet been discovered, unless it be the _French_\r\nBIEN, the application of which to a shilling is not so evident; but\r\namongst costermongers and other street folk it is quite immaterial what\r\nforeign tongue contributes to their secret language. Providing the terms\r\nare unknown to the police and the public generally, they care not a rush\r\nwhether the polite French, the gay Spaniards, or the cloudy Germans help\r\nto swell their vocabulary. The numbers of low foreigners, however,\r\ndragging out a miserable existence in our crowded neighbourhoods, organ\r\ngrinders and image sellers, foreign seamen from the vessels in the\r\nriver, and our own connexion with Malta and the Ionian Isles, may\r\nexplain, to a certain extent, the phenomenon of these Southern phrases\r\nin the mouths of costers and tramps. Professor Ascoli, in his _Studj\r\nCritici_, absurdly enough derives these words from the ancient\r\ncommercial importance of Italian settlers in England, when they gave a\r\nname to Lombard Street!\r\n\r\n~Salve~, praise, flattery, chaff.\r\n\r\n~Sam~, _i.e._, DICKY-SAM, a native of Liverpool.\r\n\r\n~Sam~, to \xe2\x80\x9cstand SAM,\xe2\x80\x9d to pay for refreshment or drink, to stand\r\npaymaster for anything.

In use in this country as early as 1827.\r\n\r\n~Sammy~, a stupid fellow.\r\n\r\n~Sampan~, a small boat.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Samshoo~, a fiery, noxious spirit, distilled from rice. Spirits\r\ngenerally.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Samson and Abel~, a group of wrestlers in the centre of Brasenose\r\nquadrangle. Some said it represented Samson killing a Philistine; others\r\nCain killing Abel. So the matter was compromised as above.\xe2\x80\x94_Oxford\r\nUniversity._\r\n\r\n~Sandwich~, a human advertising medium, placed between two boards\r\nstrapped, one on his breast the other on his shoulders. A \xe2\x80\x9ctoad in the\r\nhole\xe2\x80\x9d is the term applied to the same individual when his person is\r\nconfined by a four-sided box. A gentleman with a lady on each arm is\r\nsometimes called a SANDWICH. The French phrase for this kind of\r\nSANDWICH, _l\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa2ne \xc3\xa0 deux panni\xc3\xa8res_, is expressive.\r\n\r\n~Sanguinary James~, a raw sheep\xe2\x80\x99s-head. _See_ BLOODY JEMMY.\r\n\r\n~Sank work~, tailors\xe2\x80\x99 phrase for soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 clothes. Perhaps from the\r\n_Norman_ SANC, blood,\xe2\x80\x94in allusion either to the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s calling, or\r\nthe colour of his coat.\r\n\r\n~Sap~, or SAPSCULL, a poor green simpleton, with no heart for work.\r\n\r\n~Sappy~, soft, foolish, namby-pamby, milk-and-watery. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s such a SAPPY\r\nbook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Satin~, gin; \xe2\x80\x9ca yard of SATIN,\xe2\x80\x9d a glass of gin. Term used by females on\r\nmake-believe errands, when the real object of their departure from home\r\nis to replenish the private bottle. With servants the words \xe2\x80\x9ctape\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cribbon\xe2\x80\x9d are more common, the purchase of these feminine requirements\r\nbeing the general excuse for asking to \xe2\x80\x9crun out for a little while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n_See_ WHITE SATIN.\r\n\r\n~Saucebox~, a pert young person. In low life it also signifies the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n~Save~, to give part of one bet for part of another. A. and B. have\r\nbacked different horses, and they agree that in the event of either one\r\nwinning he shall give the other, say, \xc2\xa35. This is called \xe2\x80\x9cSAVING a\r\nfiver,\xe2\x80\x9d and generally is done when scratchings and knockings-out have\r\nleft the field so that one of the two speculators must be a winner. The\r\npractice also obtains much in competitions decided in heats or rounds,\r\nin the course of which backers and layers comparing their prospects\r\noften \xe2\x80\x9cSAVE a bit\xe2\x80\x9d with each other. Saving is, therefore, a form of\r\nhedging.\r\n\r\n~Saveloy~, a sausage of bread and chopped beef smoked, a minor kind of\r\nPOLONY, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Savvey~, to know; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you SAVVEY that?\xe2\x80\x9d _Spanish_, SABE. In the nigger\r\nand _Anglo-Chinese patois_, this is SABBY, \xe2\x80\x9cme no SABBY.\xe2\x80\x9d It is a\r\ngeneral word among the lower classes all over the world. It also means\r\nacuteness or cleverness; as, \xe2\x80\x9cThat fellow has plenty of SAVVEY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Saw~, a term at whist. A SAW is established when two partners\r\nalternately trump a suit, played to each other for the express purpose.\r\n\r\n~Saw your timber~, \xe2\x80\x9cbe off!\xe2\x80\x9d equivalent to \xe2\x80\x9ccut your stick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nOccasionally varied, with mock refinement, to \xe2\x80\x9camputate your mahogany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n_See_ CUT.\r\n\r\n~Sawbones~, a surgeon.\r\n\r\n~Sawney~, or SANDY, a Scotchman.

Perhaps anything which betokens the presence\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cOld Serpent,\xe2\x80\x9d or it may be a variation of \xe2\x80\x9cfishy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Scamander~, to wander about without a settled purpose;\xe2\x80\x94possibly in\r\nallusion to the winding course of the Homeric river of that name.\r\n\r\n~Scammered~, drunk.\r\n\r\n~Scamp~, a graceless fellow, a rascal; a wandering vagabond; scamping\r\nwas formerly the cant term for plundering and thieving. A ROYAL-SCAMP\r\nwas a highwayman, whilst a FOOT-SCAMP was an ordinary thief with nothing\r\nbut his legs to trust to in case of an attempt at capture. Some have\r\nderived SCAMP from _qui ex campo exit_, one who leaves the field, a\r\ndeserter.\r\n\r\n~Scamp~, to give short measure or quantity; applied to dishonest\r\ncontractors. Also to hurry through a task in a way which precludes the\r\npossibility of its being done well.

Also a disreputable\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n~Scarborough-warning~, a warning given too late to be taken advantage\r\nof. When a person is driven over, and then told to keep out of the way,\r\nhe receives SCARBOROUGH-WARNING. Fuller says the proverb alludes to an\r\nevent which happened at that place in 1557, when Thomas Stafford seized\r\nupon Scarborough Castle before the townsmen had the least notice of his\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n~Scarce~, TO MAKE ONESELF; to be off; to decamp.\r\n\r\n~Scarlet fever~, the desire felt by young ladies to flirt with officers\r\nin preference to civilians.\r\n\r\n~Scarlet-town~, Reading, in Berkshire. As the name of this place is\r\npronounced Redding, SCARLET-TOWN is probably a rude pun upon it.\r\n\r\n~Scarper~, to run away; _Spanish_, ESCAPAR, to escape, make off;\r\n_Italian_, SCAPPARE. \xe2\x80\x9cSCARPER with the feeley of the donna of the\r\ncarzey,\xe2\x80\x9d to run away with the daughter of the landlady of the house;\r\nalmost pure _Italian_, \xe2\x80\x9cSCAPPARE COLLA FIGLIA DELLA DONNA DELLA\r\nCASA.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Seven Dials and Prison Cant_, from the _Lingua Franca_.\r\n\r\n~Schism-shop~, a Dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 meeting-house.\xe2\x80\x94_University._\r\n\r\n~Schofel~, bad money. _See_ SHOFUL.\r\n\r\n~School~, a knot of men or boys; generally a body of idlers or street\r\ngamblers.

Used by Dons as well as undergrads. The Dons fined or\r\nSCONCED for small offences; _e.g._, five shillings for wearing a\r\ncoloured coat in hall at dinner-time. Among undergrads a pun, or an\r\noath, or an indecent remark, was SCONCED by the head of the table. If\r\nthe offender could, however, floor the tankard of beer which he was\r\nSCONCED, he could retort on his SCONCER to the extent of twice the\r\namount he was SCONCED in.\xe2\x80\x94_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Score~, a reckoning, \xe2\x80\x9cto run up a SCORE at a public-house,\xe2\x80\x9d to obtain\r\ncredit there until pay-day, or a fixed time, when the debt must be\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwiped off.\xe2\x80\x9d From the old practice of scoring a tippler\xe2\x80\x99s indebtedness\r\non the inside of a public-house door.\r\n\r\n~Scorf~, to eat voraciously.\r\n\r\n~Scot~, a quantity of anything, a lot, a share.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Saxon_, SCEAT,\r\npronounced SHOT.\r\n\r\n~Scot~, temper, or passion,\xe2\x80\x94from the irascible temperament of the\r\nScotch; \xe2\x80\x9cOh! what a SCOT he was in,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, what temper he showed.\r\n\r\n~Scotch coffee~, biscuits toasted and boiled in water.

This\r\nterm has been in common use for nearly two centuries, and latterly has\r\nfound its way into most dictionaries.

Shakspeare\r\nuses SELLING in a similar sense, viz., blinding or deceiving.\r\n\r\n~Sensation~, a quartern of gin.\r\n\r\n~Serene~, all right; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all SERENE,\xe2\x80\x9d a street phrase of very modern\r\nadoption, the burden of a song.

With confirmed\r\ndrinkers, however, the phrase is used with an air of mingled humour and\r\nregret at their own position. A still more pathetic phrase is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cputting\r\na NAIL IN ONE\xe2\x80\x99S COFFIN,\xe2\x80\x9d which _see_. The term SHED A TEAR is probably\r\nderived from \xe2\x80\x9ceye-water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Sheen~, bad money.\xe2\x80\x94_Scotch._\r\n\r\n~Sheeny~, a Jew.

The old cloth is pulled to pieces, the yarn\r\nunravelled and carded over again. This produces shoddy, which is very\r\nshort in the fibre, and from it are produced, on again twisting and\r\nweaving, cloth fabrics used for ladies\xe2\x80\x99 mantles, &c. Also, a term of\r\nderision applied to workmen in woollen factories.\xe2\x80\x94_Yorkshire._\r\n\r\n~Shoddy~, the plutocracy created out of bogus contracts during the civil\r\nwar in the United States. The SHODDYITES enriched themselves at the\r\nexpense of their country in the most shameless manner, having most\r\nlikely studied under those contractors who should have supplied our\r\nsoldiers with necessaries during the Crimean War.\r\n\r\n~Shoe~, to free or initiate a person,\xe2\x80\x94a practice common in most trades\r\nto a new-comer. The SHOEING consists in paying for beer, or other\r\nliquor, which is drunk by the older hands. The cans emptied, and the\r\nbill paid, the stranger is considered properly SHOD. SHOEING is a\r\nvariation of \xe2\x80\x9cpaying one\xe2\x80\x99s footing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Shoe leather!~ a thief\xe2\x80\x99s warning cry when he hears footsteps. This\r\nexclamation is used in the spirit which animated the friend who, when he\r\nsuspected treachery towards Bruce at King Edward\xe2\x80\x99s court, in 1306, sent\r\nhim a purse and a pair of spurs, as a sign that he should use them in\r\nmaking his escape.\r\n\r\n~Shoes~, \xe2\x80\x9cto die in one\xe2\x80\x99s SHOES,\xe2\x80\x9d to be hanged. In the old hanging days\r\na highwayman would often kick off his shoes when the rope was round his\r\nneck, so as\xe2\x80\x94oh, vain and impotent attempt!\xe2\x80\x94to defeat the prophecy that\r\nhad foreshadowed his present position.\r\n\r\n~Shoes, children\xe2\x80\x99s, to make~, to suffer oneself to be made sport of, or\r\ndepreciated.

This favourite carriage was the invention of a\r\nMr. Hansom, afterwards connected with the _Builder_ newspaper. It has\r\nbeen asserted that the term SHOFUL was derived from \xe2\x80\x9cshovel,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nearliest slang term applied to Hansoms by other cab-drivers, who\r\nconceived their shape to be after the fashion of a scoop or shovel. A\r\nlogical friend of the present Editor\xe2\x80\x99s argues thus:\xe2\x80\x94SHOFUL, full of\r\nshow, _ergo_, beautiful\xe2\x80\x94handsome\xe2\x80\x94Hansom. This is clever, but it\r\ncertainly never entered into the heads of those who gave the name of\r\nSHOFUL to the Hansom cabs.\r\n\r\n~Shoful~, bad or counterfeit money. Perhaps, as some think, from the\r\n_Danish_, SKUFFE, to shove, to deceive, cheat; _Saxon_, SCUFAN,\xe2\x80\x94whence\r\nthe _English_, SHOVE. The term, however, is possibly one of the many\r\nstreet words from the _Hebrew_ (through the low Jews); SHEPHEL, in that\r\nlanguage, signifying a low or debased estate. _Chaldee_, SHAPHAL.\xe2\x80\x94_See_\r\nPsalm cxxxvi. 23, \xe2\x80\x9cin our low estate.\xe2\x80\x9d A correspondent suggests a very\r\nprobable derivation, from the _German_, SCHOFEL, trash, rubbish,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n_German_ adjective, SCHOFELIG, being the nearest possible translation\r\nof our shabby. SHOFUL means anything mock, as SHOFUL jewellery. A SHOFUL\r\nis also a humbug, an impostor.\r\n\r\n~Shoful-pitcher~, a passer of bad money. SHOFUL-PITCHING, passing bad\r\nmoney. \xe2\x80\x9cSnide-pitcher\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSnide-pitching\xe2\x80\x9d are terms exchangeable with\r\nthe preceding.\r\n\r\n~Shoful pullet~, a \xe2\x80\x9cgay\xe2\x80\x9d or unsteady woman, especially a young woman.\r\n\r\n~Sholl~, to bonnet one, or crush a person\xe2\x80\x99s hat over his eyes.\xe2\x80\x94_North._\r\n\r\n~Shool~, to saunter idly, to become a vagabond, to beg rather than\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x94_Smollett\xe2\x80\x99s Roderick Random_, vol. i., p. 262.\r\n\r\n~Shool~, Jews\xe2\x80\x99 term for their synagogue.\r\n\r\n~Shoot the cat~, to vomit.

The only instance we have met with of the\r\nuse of this word in literature occurs in Mr. Trollope\xe2\x80\x99s _Framley\r\nParsonage:_\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If we are merely to do as we are bid, and have no voice of our\r\n    own, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what\xe2\x80\x99s the good of our going to the SHOP at all,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n    said Mr. Sowerby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Shop~, to discharge a shopman. In military slang, to SHOP an officer is\r\nto put him under arrest in the guard-room. In pugilistic slang, to\r\npunish a man severely is \xe2\x80\x9cto knock him all over the SHOP,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, the\r\nring, the place in which the work is done.\r\n\r\n~Shop-bouncer~, or SHOP-LIFTER, a person generally respectably attired,\r\nwho, while being served with a small article at a shop, steals one of\r\nmore value. Shakspeare has the word LIFTER, a thief.\r\n\r\n~Shop-walker~, a person employed to walk up and down a shop, to hand\r\nseats to customers, and see that they are properly served. Contracted\r\nalso to WALKER.\r\n\r\n~Shopping~, purchasing at shops.

A similar phrase is used at\r\nthe counters of banks; upon presenting a cheque, the clerk asks, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nwill you take it?\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, in gold, or notes. If in notes, long or\r\nshort? Should it be desired to receive it in notes for the largest\r\npossible amount, the answer is, SHORT. A conductor of an omnibus, or any\r\nother servant, is said to be SHORT when he does not give all the money\r\nhe receives to his master.\r\n\r\n~Short~, hard-up; a polite term for impecuniosity used in clubs and\r\namong military men.\r\n\r\n~Short commons~, short allowance of food. _See_ COMMONS.\r\n\r\n~Shorter~, one who makes a dishonest profit by reducing the coin of the\r\nrealm by clipping and filing. From a crown-piece a SHORTER could gain\r\n5d. Another way was by chemical means: a guinea laid in aquafortis\r\nwould, in twelve hours, precipitate 9d.-worth of sediment; in\r\ntwenty-four, 1s. 6d.-worth.\xe2\x80\x94_Rommany Rye._\r\n\r\n~Shot~, from the modern sense of the word to SHOOT,\xe2\x80\x94a guess, a random\r\nconjecture; \xe2\x80\x9cto make a bad SHOT,\xe2\x80\x9d to expose one\xe2\x80\x99s ignorance by making a\r\nwrong guess, or random answer, without knowing whether it is right or\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n~Shot~, from the once general, but now provincial word, to SHOOT, to\r\nsubscribe, contribute in fair proportion;\xe2\x80\x94a share, from the\r\n_Anglo-Saxon_ word, SCEAT; \xe2\x80\x9cto pay one\xe2\x80\x99s SHOT,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, share of the\r\nreckoning, &c.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYet still while I have got\r\n    Enough to pay the SHOT\r\n    Of Boniface, both gruff and greedy O!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n        _Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s Garland_ for 1835.\r\n\r\n~Shot~, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I may be SHOT, if,\xe2\x80\x9d &c., a common form of mild swearing.\r\n\r\n~Shot~, a term used among horse chaunters.

The following is from a literary\r\npaper:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the other day we heard of a preacher who, speaking of the\r\nscene with the doctors in the Temple, remarked that the Divine disputant\r\ncompletely SHUT THEM UP!\xe2\x80\x9d SHUT UP, utterly exhausted, done for.\r\n\r\n~Shy~, a throw. _See_ the following:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n~Shy~, to fling; COCK-SHY, a game at fairs, consisting of throwing short\r\nsticks at trinkets or cocoanuts set upon other sticks,\xe2\x80\x94both name and\r\npractice derived from the old game of throwing or SHYING at live cocks.\r\nThis game is best known to the London public as \xe2\x80\x9cthree shies a penny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Shy.~ \xe2\x80\x9cTo fight SHY of a person,\xe2\x80\x9d to avoid his society either from\r\ndislike, fear, or other reason.

All kinds of\r\ncrazes on political and social subjects are then ventilated, gigantic\r\ngooseberries, monstrous births, and strange showers then become\r\nplentiful, columns are devoted to matters which would not at any other\r\ntime receive consideration, and, so far as the newspapers are concerned,\r\nsilliness is at a premium.\r\n\r\n~Silver beggar~, or LURKER, a vagabond who travels through the country\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x9cbriefs\xe2\x80\x9d containing false statements of losses by fire, shipwrecks,\r\naccidents, &c.

Those who have\r\nwitnessed Mr. Charles Mathews\xe2\x80\x99s performance in Mrs. Centlivre\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadmirable comedy of _A Bold Stroke for a Wife_, and the laughable\r\ncoolness with which he, the false SIMON PURE, assuming the Quaker dress\r\nand character of the real one, elbows that worthy out of his expected\r\nentertainment, will at once perceive the origin of this phrase.\xe2\x80\x94_See_\r\nact v. scene i.\r\n\r\n~Simpkin~, or SIMKIN, champagne.\xe2\x80\x94_Anglo-Indian._ Derived from the\r\nmanner in which native servants pronounce champagne.\r\n\r\n~Simpson~, water used in the dilution of milk.

The Deity is mentioned in the _Towneley Mysteries_ as He that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cset all on seven,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, set or appointed everything in seven days. A\r\nsimilar phrase at this early date implied confusion and disorder, and\r\nfrom these, Halliwell thinks, has been derived the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cto be at\r\nSIXES AND SEVENS.\xe2\x80\x9d A Scotch correspondent, however, states that the\r\nphrase probably came from the workshop, and that amongst needle-makers,\r\nwhen the points and eyes are \xe2\x80\x9cheads and tails\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cheeds and thraws\xe2\x80\x9d), or\r\nin confusion, they are said to be SIXES AND SEVENS, because those\r\nnumbers are the sizes most generally used, and in the course of\r\nmanufacture have frequently to be distinguished.\r\n\r\n~Sixty~, \xe2\x80\x9cto go along like SIXTY,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, at a good rate, briskly.\r\n\r\n~Sixty-per-cent~, a bill-discounter.

The American war introduced this new\r\nand amusing word. A Northerner who retreated \xe2\x80\x9cretired upon his\r\nsupports,\xe2\x80\x9d but a Southerner was said to SKEDADDLE. The _Times_ remarked\r\non the word, and Lord Hill wrote to prove that it was excellent Scotch.\r\nThe Americans only misapply the word, which means, in Dumfries, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nspill\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94milkmaids, for example, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are SKEDADDLING all that\r\nmilk.\xe2\x80\x9d The Yankees therefore adopted the term, and altered the\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n~Skid~, a sovereign.

When a non-favourite wins a race,\r\nbookmakers are said to SKIN THE LAMB, under the supposition that they\r\nwin all their bets, no person having backed the winner.

Sternberg, in his _Northamptonshire Glossary_, says the Eastern\r\nlanguages have the same expression.

The pins are\r\nset up in an alley, and thrown (not bowled) at with a round piece of\r\nhard wood, shaped like a small flat cheese. The costers used to consider\r\nthemselves the best players in London, but they have been frequently\r\nundeceived. SKITTLES has within the past few years received an awful\r\nblow\xe2\x80\x94quite a floorer\xe2\x80\x94from \xe2\x80\x9cthe powers that be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Skow-banker~, a fellow who loiters about the premises of any one\r\nwilling to support him, and who objects to the necessity of working for\r\nhis living; a rogue, a rascal.

SKY-BLUE formerly meant gin.\r\n\r\n~Sky-lark.~ _See under_ LARK.\r\n\r\n~Sky-parlour~, the garret.\r\n\r\n~Sky-scraper~, a tall man; \xe2\x80\x9cAre you cold up there, old SKY-SCRAPER?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nProperly a sea-term.

The word is only to be found in the dictionaries of\r\nWebster and Ogilvie. It is given, however, by Grose, in his _Dictionary\r\nof the Vulgar Tongue_, 1785. SLANG, since it has been adopted as an\r\nEnglish word, generally implies vulgar language not known or recognised\r\nas CANT; and latterly, when applied to speech, it has superseded the\r\nword FLASH. Latterly, however, SLANG has become the generic term for all\r\nunauthorized language. The earliest instance of the use of the word that\r\ncan be found, is the following:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cLet proper nurses be assigned, to take care of these babes of\r\n    grace, [young thieves]....

Shakspeare\r\nhas, \xe2\x80\x9cYou gave me the counterfeit,\xe2\x80\x9d in _Romeo and Juliet_. Giving the\r\nSLIP, however, is a sea phrase, and refers to fastening an anchor and\r\nchain cable to a floating buoy, or water-cask, until a time arrives when\r\nit is convenient to return and take them on board. In fastening the\r\ncable, the home end is SLIPPED through the hawse-pipe.

In pugilistic parlance, \xe2\x80\x9cto SLIP a man,\xe2\x80\x9d is to \xe2\x80\x9cduck and get\r\naway\xe2\x80\x9d with great dexterity.\r\n\r\n~Slips~, the sides of the gallery in a theatre are generally so called.\r\n\r\n~Slog~, to beat or baste, to fight. _German_, SCHLACHTEN; or perhaps\r\nfrom some connexion with the _Gaelic_ SLOGAN.

SLOPS properly signify sailors\xe2\x80\x99 working clothes,\r\nwhich are of a very cheap and inexpensive character.\r\n\r\n~Slope~, to decamp, to run, or rather slip away. Some persons think it\r\ncame originally from LOPE, to make off; and that the _s_ probably became\r\naffixed as a portion of the preceding word, as in the case of \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlope,\xe2\x80\x9d let us run. It is purely an Americanism, and is possibly but an\r\nemendation of our own word elope. Lope, leap, and elope are kindred. A\r\nhumorous correspondent says that Tennyson is decidedly partial to slang,\r\nand instances amongst other proofs a passage from the laureate\xe2\x80\x99s famous\r\n_Locksley Hall_:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cMany a night, from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,\r\n    Did I look on great Orion SLOPING slowly to the west.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough this correspondent may not have intended it, his joke has given\r\nthe key to the situation, and has shown how our cousins most probably\r\ncame to use the word in its present sense. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sun is SLOPING fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Slops~, any weak, wet, and warm mixture.

Supposed to be from the\r\nnickname usually applied to a cobbler or maker of shoes; but believed\r\nby many in its later sense to be a contraction of the _Latin_, SINE\r\nOBOLO. Others go to work for an etymology thus:\xe2\x80\x94They assume that NOBS,\r\n_i.e._, _nobiles_, was appended in lists to the names of persons of\r\ngentle birth, whilst those who had not that distinction were marked down\r\nas S NOB, _i.e._, _sine nobilitate_, without marks of gentility,\xe2\x80\x94thus,\r\nby a simple transposition, quite reversing the meaning. Others, again,\r\nremark that, as at college sons of noblemen wrote after their names in\r\nthe admission lists, _fil. nob._, son of a lord, and hence all young\r\nnoblemen were called NOBS, and what they did NOBBY, so those who\r\nimitated them would be called _quasi-nobs_, \xe2\x80\x9clike a nob,\xe2\x80\x9d which by a\r\nprocess of contraction would be shortened to _si-nob_, and then SNOB,\r\none who pretends to be what he is not, and apes his betters. The short\r\nand expressive terms which many think fitly represent the three great\r\nestates of the realm\xe2\x80\x94NOB, SNOB, and MOB\xe2\x80\x94were all originally slang\r\nwords. The last has safely passed through the vulgar ordeal of the\r\nstreets, and found respectable quarters in the standard dictionaries.\r\nFor fuller particulars of the genus SNOB, in all its ramifications, the\r\nreader cannot do better than apply to the general works of that great\r\nmaster of the subject, William Makepeace Thackeray, though it may be as\r\nwell to remark that the SNOB for whom the novelist had such an aversion\r\nis now very widely known as \xe2\x80\x9ccad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Snobbish~, stuck up, proud, make-believe.\r\n\r\n~Snob-Stick~, a workman who refuses to join in strikes, or trade-unions.\r\nAmplification of KNOB-STICK.\r\n\r\n~Snooks~, an imaginary personage often brought forward as the answer to\r\nan idle question, or as the perpetrator of a senseless joke.

In a Westminster school vocabulary for boys, published\r\nin the last century, the term is curiously applied. Its proper meaning\r\nis the glandular mucus discharged through the nose.\r\n\r\n~Snot~, a small bream, a slimy kind of flat fish.\xe2\x80\x94_Norwich._\r\n\r\n~Snotter~, or WIPE-HAULER, a pickpocket whose chief fancy is for\r\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s pocket-handkerchiefs.\xe2\x80\x94_North._\r\n\r\n~Snottinger~, a coarse word for a pocket-handkerchief. The German\r\n_Schnupftuch_ is, however, nearly as plain. A handkerchief was also\r\nanciently called a \xe2\x80\x9cmuckinger\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmuckender,\xe2\x80\x9d and from that a\r\nneckerchief was called a \xe2\x80\x9cneckinger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Snow~, wet linen, or linen hung out to dry.\xe2\x80\x94_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Snow-gatherer~, or SNOW-DROPPER, a rogue who steals linen from hedges\r\nand drying-grounds.\r\n\r\n~Snuff~, \xe2\x80\x9cup to SNUFF,\xe2\x80\x9d knowing and sharp; \xe2\x80\x9cto take SNUFF,\xe2\x80\x9d to be\r\noffended.

A\r\nfanciful variation of \xe2\x80\x9cputting one\xe2\x80\x99s light out,\xe2\x80\x9d and used simply in\r\nreference to the action of the person dying. Thus any one threatening to\r\nmurder another says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put your light out,\xe2\x80\x9d or any one committing\r\nsuicide is said to \xe2\x80\x9cput his own light out;\xe2\x80\x9d but to \xe2\x80\x9cSNUFF IT\xe2\x80\x9d is always\r\nto die from disease or accident. To \xe2\x80\x9clay down one\xe2\x80\x99s knife and fork,\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpeg out,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgive up,\xe2\x80\x9d are variations of this form of euphemism.\r\n\r\n~Snuffy~, tipsy, drunk.\r\n\r\n~Snuggle~, to lie closely and cosily.\r\n\r\n~Snyder~, a tailor. _German_, SCHNEIDER.\r\n\r\n~Soaker~, an habitual drunkard.\r\n\r\n~Soap~, flattery. _See_ SOFT SOAP.\r\n\r\n~Sober-water~, a jocular allusion to the uses of soda-water.\r\n\r\n~Social evil~, a name for some years applied to our street-walking\r\nsystem, in consequence of the articles in the newspapers which treat on\r\nthe evils of prostitution being so headed. A good story has been often\r\ntold on this subject, which will bear repeating:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cA well-known divine\r\nand philanthropist was walking in a crowded street at night in order to\r\ndistribute tracts to promising subjects. A young woman was walking up\r\nand down, and he accosted her. He pointed out to her the error of her\r\nways, implored her to reform, and tendered her a tract with fervent\r\nentreaties to go home and read it. The girl stared at him for a moment\r\nor two in sheer bewilderment; at last it dawned on her what he meant,\r\nand for what he took her, and looking up in his face with simple\r\namazement, she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Lor\xe2\x80\x99 bless you, sir, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a SOCIAL EVIL;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m waitin\xe2\x80\x99 for the \xe2\x80\x99bus!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The enthusiasm which was felt in this\r\ndirection a few years back has received considerable modification, as it\r\nhas been proved that the efforts of the promoters of midnight meetings\r\nand other arrangements of a similar nature, praiseworthy though they\r\nare, have little or no effect; and that the early-closing movement in\r\nthe Haymarket has done more to stamp out the SOCIAL EVIL than years of\r\npreaching, even when accompanied by tea and buns, could ever have done.\r\n\r\n~Sock~, the Eton College term for a treat, synonymous with \xe2\x80\x9cchuck\xe2\x80\x9d used\r\nat Westminster and other schools. Believed to be derived from the\r\nmonkish word SOKE. An old writer speaks of a pious man \xe2\x80\x9cwho did not SOKE\r\nfor three days,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning that he fasted. The word is still used by the\r\nboys of Heriot\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital School at Edinburgh, and signifies a\r\nsweetmeat; being derived from the same source as sugar, _suck_, SUCRE,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n~Sock~, credit. As, \xe2\x80\x9cHe gets his goods on SOCK, while I pay ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Sock into him~, _i.e._, give him a good drubbing; \xe2\x80\x9cgive him SOCK,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n_i.e._, thrash him well.\r\n\r\n~Sockdolager.~ _See_ STOCKDOLLAGER.\r\n\r\n~Socket-money~, money extorted by threats of exposure. To be applied to\r\nfor SOCKET-MONEY is perhaps one of the most terrible inflictions that\r\ncan befall a respectable man.

Costermongers\r\ncall anything extra good, STUNNING. Sometimes amplified to STUNNING JOE\r\nBANKS! when the expression is supposed to be in its most intense form.\r\nJoe Banks was a noted character in the last generation. He was the\r\nproprietor of a public-house in Dyott Street, Seven Dials, and\r\nafterwards, on the demolition of the Rookery, of another in Cranbourn\r\nAlley. His houses became well-known from their being the resort of the\r\nworst characters, while at the same time the strictest decorum was\r\nalways maintained in them. Joe Banks also acquired a remarkable\r\nnotoriety by acting as a medium betwixt thieves and their victims. Upon\r\nthe proper payment to Joe, a watch or a snuff-box would at any time be\r\nrestored to its lawful owner\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cno questions in any case being asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe most daring depredators in London placed the fullest confidence in\r\nJoe, and it is believed (although the _Biographie Universelle_ is quiet\r\nupon this point) that he never, in any instance, \xe2\x80\x9csold\xe2\x80\x9d them. He was of\r\nthe middle height, stout, and strongly made, and was always noted for a\r\nshowy pin and a remarkably STUNNING neck-tie.

When an\r\nomnibus is being nursed, the driver of the hindmost vehicle keeps so\r\nclose to his opponent that the horses get their heads almost into the\r\ndoorway.

The former was originally applied to a\r\ndischarged soldier, and perhaps came from SHODDY, which is made from\r\nsoldiers\xe2\x80\x99 and policemen\xe2\x80\x99s worn-out coats. The term was one of\r\nopprobrium, and was probably the result of a long peace, for it became\r\nobsolete as soon as the Crimean War commenced.\r\n\r\n~Swag~, a lot or plenty of anything, a portion or division of property.\r\nIn Australia the term is used for the luggage carried by diggers.\r\n_Scotch_, SWEG, or SWACK; _German_, SWEIG, a flock.

One\r\nexplanation of the phrase is this:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYears ago there was a person named\r\nWalker, an aquiline-nosed Jew, who exhibited an orrery, which he called\r\nby the erudite name of \xe2\x80\x98Eidouranion.\xe2\x80\x99 He was also a popular lecturer on\r\nastronomy, and often, telescope in hand, invited his pupils to \xe2\x80\x98take a\r\nsight\xe2\x80\x99 at the moon and stars. The lecturer\xe2\x80\x99s phrase struck his schoolboy\r\nauditory, who frequently \xe2\x80\x98took a sight\xe2\x80\x99 with that gesture of\r\noutstretched arm and adjustment to nose and eye which was the first\r\ngarnish of the popular saying. The next step was to assume phrase and\r\ngesture as the outward and visible mode of knowingness in general.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nhas been denied, however, and a statement made that HOOKEY WALKER was a\r\nmagistrate of dreaded acuteness and incredulity, whose hooked nose gave\r\nthe title of \xe2\x80\x9cbeak\xe2\x80\x9d to all his successors; it is also said, moreover,\r\nthat the gesture of applying the thumb to the nose and agitating the\r\nlittle finger, as an expression of \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you wish you may get it?\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nconsiderably older than the first story would seem to indicate.

Winners of certain great races generally carry\r\npenalties in addition to WEIGHT-FOR-AGE, for the purpose of equalizing\r\nmatters somewhat; but as a rule the results are fairly foreshadowed as\r\nsoon as in these races the horses are at the post, or as soon as the\r\nstarters are positively known.\r\n\r\n~Wejee~, a chimney-pot.

The word is modern,\r\nbut the practice is ancient.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOne Moore, the unworthy incumbent of the \xe2\x80\x98Suffolk curacy,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n    dedicated a book to \xe2\x80\x98Duke Humphrey,\xe2\x80\x99 and was then entirely lost\r\n    sight of by his old college friends, till one of them espied him\r\n    slung up in \xe2\x80\x98the basket,\xe2\x80\x99 for not paying his bets at a\r\n    cock-pit.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Post and Paddock._\r\n\r\nOne writer says the term \xe2\x80\x9carose from a fellow who took deposits on\r\naccount of Welsh ponies, which he said he was importing, and never\r\ndelivered them.\xe2\x80\x9d It is not unfrequently suggested by irreverent persons\r\nthat the word was suggested by the dislike his gracious Majesty George\r\nthe Fourth had, when a young man, for settling. Others derive it from\r\nthe nursery rhyme,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cTaffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that, from the days when the stout Earl of\r\nChester and others were constantly employed in checking and cutting off\r\nthe expeditions of their neighbours till comparatively recently, the\r\nterm \xe2\x80\x9cWelshman\xe2\x80\x9d has been hardly one of kindness. It is not hard,\r\ntherefore, to imagine its use on the Roodee, and its subsequent\r\ncorruption into WELCHER. The spelling of the word, WELCHER or WELSHER,\r\nis optional.\r\n\r\n~Well~, to pocket, to save money.

An old maid, who lived in this district, was particularly\r\nshocked at having W.C. marked on all her letters, and informed the\r\nletter-carrier that she could not think of submitting to such an\r\nindecent fashion. On being informed that the letters would not be\r\nforwarded without the obnoxious initials, she remarked that she would\r\nhave them left at the Post-Office. \xe2\x80\x9cThen, marm,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fellow, with a\r\ngrin, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will put P.O. on them, which will be more ondacenter than\r\nthe tother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Wet~, a drink, a drain.\r\n\r\n~Wet~, to drink.

This is an Americanism, but is\r\nin pretty general use here.\r\n\r\n~Wire-in~, a London street phrase in general use, which means to go in\r\nwith a will. In its original form of \xe2\x80\x9cWIRE-IN, and get your name up,\xe2\x80\x9d it\r\nwas very popular among London professional athletes.

The last in mathematical honours had long been known as the\r\nWOODEN SPOON; but when the classical Tripos was instituted in 1824, it\r\nwas debated among the undergraduates what sobriquet should be given to\r\nthe last on the examination list. Curiously enough, the name that year\r\nwhich happened to be last was WEDGEWOOD (a distinguished Wrangler).\r\nHence the title.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n~Wool~, courage, pluck; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not half-WOOLED,\xe2\x80\x9d term of reproach from\r\none thief to another.\r\n\r\n~Wool~, bravery, pluck. Term much in use among pugilists and their\r\nadmirers. The highest praise that can be bestowed on a man of courage in\r\nlower-class circles is that which characterizes him as being \xe2\x80\x9ca reg\xe2\x80\x99lar\r\nwooled un,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca rare WOOL-TOPPED UN.\xe2\x80\x9d Derived from the great pluck and\r\nperseverance shown by many pugilists of whole or partial colour, from\r\nMolyneux down to Bob Travers.\r\n\r\n~Woolbird~, a lamb; \xe2\x80\x9cwing of a WOOLBIRD,\xe2\x80\x9d a shoulder of lamb.\r\n\r\n~Wool-gathering~, said of any person\xe2\x80\x99s wits when they are wandering, or\r\nin a reverie.\r\n\r\n~Wool-hole~, the workhouse.\r\n\r\n~Woolly~, out of temper.\r\n\r\n~Woolly~, a blanket.\r\n\r\n~Work~, to plan, or lay down and execute any course of action, to\r\nperform anything; \xe2\x80\x9cto WORK the bulls,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, to get rid of false crown\r\npieces; \xe2\x80\x9cto work the oracle,\xe2\x80\x9d to succeed by man\xc5\x93uvring, to concert a\r\nwily plan, to victimize,\xe2\x80\x94a possible reference to the stratagems and\r\nbribes used to corrupt the Delphic oracle, and cause it to deliver a\r\nfavourable response. \xe2\x80\x9cTo WORK a street or neighbourhood,\xe2\x80\x9d to try at each\r\nhouse to sell all one can, or to bawl so that every housewife may know\r\nwhat is to be sold.

P.~, or WARMING-PAN. A clergyman who holds a living _pro tempore_,\r\nunder a bond of resignation, is styled a W. P., or WARMING-PAN rector,\r\nbecause he keeps the place warm for his successor.

Derived from the use of\r\nthe word by Swift.\r\n\r\n~Yam~, to eat. This word is used by the lowest class all over the world;\r\nby the Wapping sailor, West Indian negro, or Chinese coolie. When the\r\nfort, called the Dutch Folly, near Canton, was in course of erection by\r\nthe Hollanders, under the pretence of being intended for an hospital,\r\nthe Chinese observed a box containing muskets among the alleged hospital\r\nstores. \xe2\x80\x9cHy-aw!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed John Chinaman, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can sick man YAM gun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe Dutch were surprised and massacred the same night.\r\n\r\n~Yappy~, soft, foolish; mostly applied to an over-generous person, from\r\nthe fact that it originally meant one who paid for everything. YAP is\r\nback slang for pay, and often when a man is asked to pay more than he\r\nconsiders correct, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I\xe2\x80\x99m YAPPY?\xe2\x80\x9d do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\npaying mad?

YIDDEN, the Jewish people. The Jews use these\r\nterms very frequently.\r\n\r\n~Yokel~, a countryman. Probably from yoke, representative of his\r\noccupation. Some fancy, however, that the word was originally YOWKEL, in\r\nimitation of the broad tones of country labourers.\r\n\r\n~Yokuff~, a chest, or large box.\r\n\r\n~Yorkshire~, \xe2\x80\x9cto YORKSHIRE,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccome YORKSHIRE over any person,\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\ncheat or cozen him. The proverbial over-reaching of the rustics of this\r\ncounty has given rise to the phrase, which is sometimes pronounced\r\nYorshar. To put Yorshar to a man, is to trick or deceive him. This\r\nlatter is from a work in the Lancashire dialect, 1757.\r\n\r\n~Yorkshire compliment~, a gift of something useless to the giver.\r\nSometimes called a North-country compliment.\r\n\r\n~Yorkshire estates;~ \xe2\x80\x9cI will do it when I come into my YORKSHIRE\r\nESTATES,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94meaning if I ever have the money or the means.\r\n\r\n~Yorkshire reckoning~, a reckoning in which every one pays his own\r\nshare.\r\n\r\n~Younker~, in street language, a lad or a boy. Term in general use\r\namongst costermongers, cabmen, and old-fashioned people. Barnefield\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Affectionate Shepherd_, 1594, has the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9ca seemelie YOUNKER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n_Danish_ and _Friesic_, JONKER. In the navy, a naval cadet is usually\r\ntermed a YOUNKER.\r\n\r\n~Your nibs~, yourself. _See_ NIBS.\r\n\r\n~Yoxter~, a convict returned from transportation before his time.\r\n\r\n~Ziff~, a juvenile thief.\r\n\r\n~Ziph~, LANGUAGE OF, a way of disguising English in use among the\r\nstudents at Winchester College. Compare MEDICAL GREEK. De Quincey, in\r\nhis _Autobiographic Sketches_, says that he acquired this language as a\r\nboy, from a Dr. Mapleton, who had three sons at Winchester who had\r\nimported it from thence as their sole accomplishment, and that after the\r\nlapse of fifty years he could, and did with Lord Westport, converse in\r\nit with ease and rapidity. It was communicated at Winchester to\r\nnew-comers for a fixed fee of half a guinea. The secret is this,\xe2\x80\x94repeat\r\nthe vowel or diphthong of every syllable, prefixing to the vowel so\r\nrepeated the letter G, and placing the accent on the intercalated\r\nsyllable. Thus, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cShall we go away in an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShagall\r\nwege gogo agawagay igin agan hougour?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThree hours we have already\r\nstayed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThreegee hougours wege hagave agalreageadygy stagayed.\xe2\x80\x9d De\r\nQuincey could hardly have been considered complimentary to his own\r\nmemory if he supposed that he, or for the matter of that any one\r\npossessed of brains, could forget anything so simple; or that, if\r\nforgotten until suddenly recalled, it could not be mastered by any\r\nsensible person in a minute. The language of ZIPH is far inferior to any\r\nof the slangs manufactured by the lower classes. Evidently any consonant\r\nwill answer the purpose; F or L would be softer, and so far better. This\r\nZIPH system is not confined to Winchester College, as it is recorded and\r\ndescribed amongst many other modes of cryptical communication, oral and\r\nvisual, spoken, written, and symbolic, in an _Essay towards a Real\r\nCharacter and a Philosophic Language_ (founded on or suggested by a\r\ntreatise published just before, by Geo. Dalgarne), by John Wilkins,\r\nBishop of Chester, published by order of the Royal Society, fol. 1668,\r\nand as the bishop does not speak of it as a recent invention, it may\r\nprobably at that time have been regarded as an antique device for\r\nconducting a conversation in secrecy amongst bystanders\xe2\x80\x94which says very\r\nlittle for either the designers or the bystanders.\r\n\r\n~Zounds!~ a sudden exclamation\xe2\x80\x94abbreviation of \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s wounds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[57] Since the first edition of this work a great alteration has taken\r\nplace in this respect. Though topical ballads are now often sung, the\r\nsingers confine themselves to low neighbourhoods, and as soon as a\r\npoliceman approaches, if ever he does, they make themselves scarce. The\r\npractice is singular. One man gets as far through a line as he can, and\r\nwhen his voice cracks his companion takes up. For this reason the\r\nbusiness is as a rule conducted by a man and woman, or sometimes by a\r\nwoman and child. The writing of these ditties is generally work of a\r\ncharacter for which even 7_s._ 6_d._ would be a high rate of pay.\xe2\x80\x94ED.\r\n\r\n[58] Eurasian is not a child of mixed race, but one born of European\r\nparents in an Asiatic clime. A similar error exists with regard to the\r\nword creole, which is generally supposed to mean a man or woman in whom\r\nwhite and black strains are mixed. I need not say how wrong this is, but\r\nthe vulgar error is none the less current.\xe2\x80\x94ED.\r\n\r\n[59] There is something so extremely humorous and far-fetched about this\r\nexplanation, that though it is utterly unworthy of its place in a\r\ndictionary, I, finding it there, have not the heart to cut it out.\xe2\x80\x94ED.\r\n\r\n[60] Of course by those who don\xe2\x80\x99t know the scientific way used in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccanine exhibitions\xe2\x80\x9d and dog-fights\xe2\x80\x94of biting their tails till they\r\nturn round to bite the biter.\xe2\x80\x94ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME ACCOUNT\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nTHE BACK SLANG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe costermongers of London number between thirty and forty thousand.\r\nLike other low tribes, they boast a language, or secret tongue, by which\r\nthey hide their designs, movements, and other private affairs. This\r\ncosters\xe2\x80\x99 speech offers no new fact, or approach to a fact, for\r\nphilologists; it is not very remarkable for originality of construction,\r\nneither is it spiced with low humour, as other cant. But the\r\ncostermongers boast that it is known only to themselves; that it is far\r\nbeyond the Irish, and puzzles the Jews. This is, however, but a poor\r\nfiction; for, as will be seen, the slang current among them is of the\r\ncrudest conception, and only difficult to the most ignorant. Any one of\r\nthe smallest pretensions to ability could learn back slang\xe2\x80\x94could, in\r\nfact, create it for himself\xe2\x80\x94as far as the costers\xe2\x80\x99 vocabulary extends,\r\nin a couple of hours. Since the early editions of this work were\r\npublished back slang has become very common; and is now mostly spoken,\r\nmixed however, with various other kinds of slang, in the public\r\nmarkets\xe2\x80\x94the new dead-meat market being, perhaps, strongest in the way\r\nof pure\xe2\x80\x94if the term may be used\xe2\x80\x94back slang.\r\n\r\nThe main principle of this language is spelling the words backwards\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nrather, pronouncing them rudely backwards. Sometimes, for the sake of\r\nharmony, an extra syllable is prefixed or annexed; and occasionally the\r\nword receives quite a different turn, in rendering it backwards, from\r\nwhat an uninitiated person would have expected. One coster told Mayhew\r\nthat he often gave the end of a word \xe2\x80\x9ca new turn, just as if he chorused\r\nit with a tol-de-rol.\xe2\x80\x9d But then costermongers, and more especially those\r\nwho confided their joys and sorrows to the gentleman just named, are not\r\nto be relied on. The coster has, of course, his own idea of the proper\r\nway of spelling words, and is not to be convinced but by an overwhelming\r\nshow of learning,\xe2\x80\x94and frequently not then, for he is a very headstrong\r\nfellow. By the time a coster has spelt an ordinary word of two or three\r\nsyllables in the proper way, and then spelt it backwards, it has become\r\na tangled knot that no etymologist could unravel. The word \xe2\x80\x9cgeneralize,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor instance, is considered to be \xe2\x80\x9cshilling\xe2\x80\x9d spelt backwards, while\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgenitraf\xe2\x80\x9d is supposed to represent farthing. Sometimes slang and cant\r\nwords are introduced, and even these, when imagined to be tolerably well\r\nknown, are pronounced backwards. Very often, instead of a word being\r\nspelt backwards right through, the syllables retain their original\r\norder; the initial _h_ is pronounced as though _c_ were before it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctatch\xe2\x80\x9d being back slang for hat, and \xe2\x80\x9cflatch\xe2\x80\x9d the word supposed to\r\nrepresent half. Again, the full words are shortened, as \xe2\x80\x9cgen\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgeneralize,\xe2\x80\x9d a shilling; and various other artifices are resorted to,\r\nin the hope of adding to the natural difficulties of back slang.\r\n\r\nThis back language, back slang, or \xe2\x80\x9ckacab genals,\xe2\x80\x9d as it is called by\r\nthe costermongers themselves, is supposed to be regarded by the rising\r\ngeneration of street-sellers as a distinct and regular mode of\r\nintercommunication. People who hear this slang for the first time never\r\nrefer words, by inverting them, to their originals; and the \xe2\x80\x9cyanneps,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cesclops,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnammows,\xe2\x80\x9d are looked upon as secret terms. Those who\r\npractise the slang soon obtain a considerable stock vocabulary, so that\r\nthey converse rather from the memory than the understanding. Amongst the\r\nsenior costermongers, and those who pride themselves on their\r\nproficiency in back slang, a conversation is often sustained for a whole\r\nevening\xe2\x80\x94that is, the chief words are in the back slang\xe2\x80\x94especially if\r\nany \xe2\x80\x9cflats\xe2\x80\x9d are present whom they wish to astonish or confuse.\r\n\r\nThe addition of an _s_ invariably forms the plural, so that this is\r\nanother source of complication. For instance, woman in the back slang is\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnammow,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnammows\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cwomen.\xe2\x80\x9d The explorer, then, in undoing the\r\nback slang, and turning the word once more into English, would have a\r\nnovel and very extraordinary rendering of women. Where a word is\r\nrefractory in submitting to a back rendering, as in the case of \xe2\x80\x9cpound,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nletters are made to change positions for the sake of harmony; thus we\r\nhave \xe2\x80\x9cdunop,\xe2\x80\x9d a pound, instead of \xe2\x80\x9cdnuop,\xe2\x80\x9d which nobody could pleasantly\r\npronounce. Also all words of one syllable which end with two\r\nconsonants\xe2\x80\x94such, for instance, as cold, drunk\xe2\x80\x94become dissyllables when\r\nread backwards, the vowel e being imagined between the then first and\r\nsecond consonants, as \xe2\x80\x9cdeloc,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ckennurd.\xe2\x80\x9d Others take the vowel as an\r\ninitial, girl being pronounced \xe2\x80\x9celrig.\xe2\x80\x9d This arrangement, as a\r\nmodification to suit circumstances, may remind the reader of the Jews\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld clo\xe2\x80\x99! old clo\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cOld clothes! old clothes!\xe2\x80\x9d which it is\r\nsupposed would tire the patience of even a Jew to repeat all day.\r\n\r\nThe back slang has been in vogue for many years. It is, as before\r\nstated, very easily acquired, and is principally used by the\r\ncostermongers and others who practise it (as the specimen Glossary will\r\nshow) for communicating the secrets of their street tradings, the cost\r\nof and profit on goods, and for keeping their natural enemies, the\r\npolice, in the dark. \xe2\x80\x9cCool the esclop\xe2\x80\x9d (look at the police) is often\r\nsaid among them, when one of the constabulary makes his appearance. It\r\nis only fair to assume, however, that the police know as much or more\r\nabout the back slang than do the costers; and every child in a \xe2\x80\x9cshy\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nneighbourhood knows the meaning of the phrase just quoted. Those who\r\nregard the London costermonger as a fearful being are very much\r\nmistaken,\xe2\x80\x94he is singularly simple-minded and innocent, and has, indeed,\r\nvery little to conceal; but he certainly does like to wrap himself up as\r\nin a garment of mystery, and sometimes believes that the few words of\r\nslang he knows, mixed as they are, and troublesome as they have been to\r\nhim, form an impenetrable barrier between him and the rest of the world.\r\nHe is fond of exhibiting what knowledge he possesses, and so talks slang\r\nin public much more than in private; but at most the slang words used\r\nbear not forty per cent. proportion to the rest of his conversational\r\nstructure, even when he exerts himself to the uttermost limits of his\r\nability and education, and even when he is a leader in his walk of life.\r\n\r\nPerhaps on no subject is the costermonger so silent as on his money\r\naffairs. All costs and profits, he thinks, should be kept profoundly\r\nsecret. The back slang, therefore, gives the various small amounts very\r\nminutely, but, as has been before remarked, these words are known\r\nwherever common folk most do congregate, and are peculiar only for their\r\nvariations from the original in the way of pronunciation:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    ~Flatch~, halfpenny.\r\n    ~Yannep~, penny.\r\n    ~Owt-yanneps~, twopence.\r\n    ~Erth-yanneps~, threepence.\r\n    ~Roaf-yanneps~, fourpence.\r\n    ~Evif, or ewif-yanneps~, fivepence.\r\n    ~Exis-yanneps~, sixpence.\r\n    ~Nevis-yanneps~, sevenpence.\r\n    ~Teaich, or theg-yanneps~, eightpence.\r\n    ~Enin-yanneps~, ninepence.\r\n    ~Net-yanneps~, tenpence.\r\n    ~Nevel\xc3\xa9-yanneps~, elevenpence.\r\n    ~Evl\xc3\xa9net-yanneps~, twelvepence.\r\n    ~Generalize~, one shilling.\r\n    ~Yannep-flatch~, three-halfpence.\r\n    ~Owt-yannep-flatch~, twopence-halfpenny. The word \xe2\x80\x9cflatch\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n        represents the odd halfpenny when added to any number of\r\n        \xe2\x80\x9cyanneps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    ~Gen, or eno-gen~, one shilling. \xe2\x80\x9cGen\xe2\x80\x9d is a contraction of\r\n        \xe2\x80\x9cgeneralize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    ~Owt-gens~, two shillings.\r\n    ~Erth-gens~, three shillings.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cgens\xe2\x80\x9d continue in the same sequence as the \xe2\x80\x9cyanneps\xe2\x80\x9d above; but, as\r\na rule, the _s_ is left out, and \xe2\x80\x9cowt\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9certh gen\xe2\x80\x9d represents the\r\nquantity. This is, however, matter of individual taste; and any reader\r\nwho is anxious to become proficient need not be afraid of committing a\r\nsolecism\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a good word for back slanging\xe2\x80\x94by giving vent to any\r\npeculiarity that may strike him. Variety is the charm of nature, we are\r\ntold; and in this particular, if in no other, back slang and nature\r\napproach each other. So do extremes meet.\r\n\r\n    ~Yenork~, a crown piece, or five shillings.\r\n    ~Flatch-yenork~, half-a-crown. This is generally slurred into\r\n        \xe2\x80\x9cflatch-a-nock.\xe2\x80\x9d The crown in full rarely receives the title\r\n        \xe2\x80\x9cyenork\xe2\x80\x9d nowadays,\xe2\x80\x94it is usually a \xe2\x80\x9cwheel\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cevif gen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    ~Flatch a dunop~, ten shillings, _i.e._, half a pound.\r\n\r\nBeyond this amount the slangist reckons after an intricate and\r\ncomplicated mode. Fifteen shillings would be \xe2\x80\x9certh-evif-gen,\xe2\x80\x9d or,\r\nliterally, three times 5_s._; seventeen and sixpence would be\r\n\xe2\x80\x9certh-yenork-flatch,\xe2\x80\x9d or three crowns and a half; or, by another mode of\r\nreckoning, \xe2\x80\x9certh-evif-gen flatch-yenork,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, three times 5_s._, and\r\nhalf-a-crown.\r\n\r\n    ~Dunop~, a pound. Varied by \xe2\x80\x9cDick,\xe2\x80\x9d back slang for \xe2\x80\x9cquid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFurther than which the costermonger seldom goes in money reckoning.\r\n\r\nIn the following Glossary only those words are given which are\r\ncontinually used,\xe2\x80\x94the terms connected with street traffic, the names\r\nof the different coins, vegetables, fruit, and fish, technicalities of\r\npolice courts, &c. The reader might naturally think that a system of\r\nspeech so simple as the back slang would require no Glossary; but he\r\nwill quickly perceive, from the specimens given, that a great many words\r\nin frequent use in a \xe2\x80\x9cback\xe2\x80\x9d sense, have become so twisted as to require\r\na little glossarial explanation.\r\n\r\nThis kind of slang, formed by reversing and transposing the letters of a\r\nword, is not peculiar to the London costermongers. Instances of an\r\nexactly similar secret dialect are found in the Spanish \xe2\x80\x9cGermania\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nFrench \xe2\x80\x9cArgot.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    _Spanish._   _Germania._    _English._\r\n\r\n    PLATO.

A phrase frequently used when one costermonger\r\nwarns another of the approach of a policeman, or when any person worthy\r\nof notice passes by. When any old lady has been bargaining with a\r\ncostermonger, and leaves his barrow without purchasing, the proprietor\r\nof the barrow will call out to the rest, \xe2\x80\x9cCOOL the delo nammow,\xe2\x80\x9d which,\r\nthough it means literally nothing beyond \xe2\x80\x9cLook at the old woman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nconveys to them an intimation that she is, from their point of view, a\r\nnuisance, and should be treated as such.\r\n\r\n~Dab~, bad.\r\n\r\n~Dab tros~, a bad sort.\r\n\r\n~Dabheno~, a bad one, sometimes a bad market. _See_ DOOGHENO.\r\n\r\n~Da-erb~, bread.\r\n\r\n~Deb~, or DAB, a bed; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m off to the DEB,\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m going to bed.\r\n\r\n~Delo nammow~, an old woman.\r\n\r\n~Delog~, gold.\r\n\r\n~Doog~, good.\r\n\r\n~Doogheno~, literally \xe2\x80\x9cgood-one,\xe2\x80\x9d but implying generally a good market,\r\na good man, &c.\r\n\r\n~Doogheno hit~, one good hit. A coster remarks to a mate, \xe2\x80\x9cJack made a\r\nDOOGHENO HIT this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d implying that he did well at market, or sold\r\nout with good profit. Actually a good hit only is intended, but\r\nredundancy has its charms in the back slang as well as in more\r\npretentious literary efforts.\r\n\r\n~Dunop~, a pound.\r\n\r\n~Edgabac~, cabbage.\r\n\r\n~Edgenaro~, an orange.\r\n\r\n~E-fink~, a knife.\r\n\r\n~Ekame~, a \xe2\x80\x9cmake,\xe2\x80\x9d or swindle.\r\n\r\n~Ekom~, a \xe2\x80\x9cmoke,\xe2\x80\x9d or donkey.\r\n\r\n~Elrig~, a girl.\r\n\r\n~Emag~, game, \xe2\x80\x9cI know your little EMAG.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Enif~, fine.\r\n\r\n~Enin gen~, nine shillings.\r\n\r\n~Enin yanneps~, ninepence.\r\n\r\n~Eno~, one.\r\n\r\n~Erif~, fire.\r\n\r\n~Erth~, three.\r\n\r\n~Erth gen~, three shillings.\r\n\r\n~Erth-pu~, three-up, a street game, played with three halfpence.\r\n\r\n~Erth sith-noms~, three months,\xe2\x80\x94a term of imprisonment unfortunately\r\nvery familiar to the lower orders.

ESCLOP is\r\npronounced \xe2\x80\x9cslop\xe2\x80\x9d simply, but the _c_ was never sounded. A policeman is\r\nnow and then called, by some purist or stickler for etiquette, an\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cesclopnam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Es-roch~, a horse.\r\n\r\n~Esuch~, a house.\r\n\r\n~Evif-gen~, a crown, or five shillings.\r\n\r\n~Evif-yanneps~, fivepence.\r\n\r\n~Evlenet-gen~, twelve shillings.\r\n\r\n~Evlenet sith-noms~, twelve months.

Pronounced SEE.\r\n\r\n~Shif~, fish.\r\n\r\n~Sirretch~, cherries. Very often SIRRETCHES.\r\n\r\n~Sith-nom~, a month. This is because the slang was made from months, not\r\nmonth. Perhaps because the latter was not easy; perhaps because terms of\r\nimprisonment run longer than a month, and are often enumerated in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckacab genals.\xe2\x80\x9d However it may be, \xe2\x80\x9cmonths\xe2\x80\x9d in this mode of speaking has\r\na double plural as it stands now.\r\n\r\n~Slaoc~, coals.\r\n\r\n~Slop~, a policeman. _See_ ESCLOP.\r\n\r\n~Sneerg~, greens.\r\n\r\n~Spinsrap~, parsnips.  }\r\n\r\n~Sret-sio~, oysters.   }\r\n\r\n~Sres-wort~, trousers. }\r\n\r\n~Starps~, sprats.      } All these will take the _s_, which is now initial,\r\n\r\n~Stoobs~, boots.       } after them, if desired, and, as may be seen, some\r\n\r\n~Storrac~, carrots.    } take it doubly.\r\n\r\n~Stun~, nuts.          }\r\n\r\n~Stunlaw~, walnuts.    }\r\n\r\n~Tach~, a hat.\r\n\r\n~Taf~, fat. A TAF ENO is a fat man or woman, literally A FAT ONE.\r\n\r\n~Taoc~, a coat. \xe2\x80\x9cCool the DELO TAOC\xe2\x80\x9d means, \xe2\x80\x9cLook at the old coat,\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nis really intended to apply to the wearer as well, as professors of\r\nmixed slangs might say, \xe2\x80\x9cVardy his nibs in the snide bucket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Taoc-tisaw~, a waistcoat.\r\n\r\n~Teaich-gir~, right, otherwise TADGER.\r\n\r\n~Tenip~, a pint.\r\n\r\n~Theg~ (or TEAICH) gen, eight shillings.\r\n\r\n~Theg~ (or TEAITCH) yanneps, eightpence.\r\n\r\n~Tib~, a bit, or piece.\r\n\r\n~Tol~, lot, stock, or share.\r\n\r\n~Top-yob~, a potboy.\r\n\r\n~Torrac~, a carrot. \xe2\x80\x9cEkat a TORRAC.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n~Trork~, a quart.\r\n\r\n~Trosseno~, literally, \xe2\x80\x9cone sort,\xe2\x80\x9d but professional slangists use it to\r\nimply anything that is bad. TROSS, among costermongers, means anything\r\nbad. It is probably a corruption of trash. Possibly, however, the\r\nconstant use of the words \xe2\x80\x9cdab-tros\xe2\x80\x9d may have led them in their\r\nunthinking way to imagine that the latter word will do by itself.\r\n\r\n~Wedge~, a Jew. This may look strange, but it is exact back slang.\r\n\r\n~Wor-rab~, a barrow.\r\n\r\n~Yad~, a day; YADS, days.\r\n\r\n~Yadnarb~, brandy.\r\n\r\n~Yannep~, a penny.\r\n\r\n~Yannep a time~, a penny each. Costermongers say \xe2\x80\x9ca time\xe2\x80\x9d for many\r\nthings. They say a \xe2\x80\x9cbob a time,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning a shilling each for admission\r\nto a theatre, or any other place, or that certain articles are charged a\r\nshilling each. The context is the only clue to the exact meaning.\r\n\r\n~Yannep-flatch~, three halfpence,\xe2\x80\x94all the halfpence and pennies\r\ncontinue in the same sequence, as for instance, OWT-YANNEP-FLATCH,\r\ntwopence-halfpenny.\r\n\r\n~Yap pu~, pay up.\r\n\r\n~Yeknod~, or JERK-NOD, a donkey.\r\n\r\n~Yenork~, a crown.\r\n\r\n~Yob~, a boy.\r\n\r\n~Zeb~, best.\r\n\r\nFrom these examples the apt student may fairly judge how to form his own\r\nback slang to his own liking and that of his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME ACCOUNT\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nTHE RHYMING SLANG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere exists in London a singular tribe of men, known amongst the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfraternity of vagabonds\xe2\x80\x9d as chaunters and patterers. Both classes are\r\ngreat talkers. The first sing or chaunt through the public thoroughfares\r\nballads\xe2\x80\x94political and humorous\xe2\x80\x94carols, dying speeches, and the various\r\nother kinds of gallows and street literature. The second deliver street\r\norations on grease-removing compounds, plating powders, high-polishing\r\nblacking, and the thousand-and-one wonderful penny-worths that are\r\nretailed to gaping mobs from a London kerb-stone.\r\n\r\nThey are quite a distinct tribe from the costermongers; indeed, amongst\r\ntramps, they term themselves the \xe2\x80\x9charristocrats of the streets,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nboast that they live by their intellects. Like the costermongers,\r\nhowever, they have a secret tongue or cant speech known only to each\r\nother. This cant, which has nothing to do with that spoken by the\r\ncostermongers, is known in Seven Dials and elsewhere as the \xe2\x80\x9crhyming\r\nslang,\xe2\x80\x9d or the substitution of words and sentences which rhyme with\r\nother words intended to be kept secret. The chaunter\xe2\x80\x99s cant, therefore,\r\npartakes of his calling, and he transforms and uses up into a rough\r\nspeech the various odds and ends of old songs, ballads, and street\r\nnicknames, which are found suitable to his purpose. Unlike nearly all\r\nother systems of cant, the rhyming slang is not founded upon allegory;\r\nunless we except a few rude similes, thus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afloat\xe2\x80\x9d is the rhyming\r\ncant for \xe2\x80\x9cboat,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csorrowful tale\xe2\x80\x9d is equivalent to \xe2\x80\x9cthree months in\r\njail,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cartful dodger\xe2\x80\x9d signifies a \xe2\x80\x9clodger,\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9csnake in the grass\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nstands for a \xe2\x80\x9clooking-glass\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a meaning that would delight a fat\r\nChinaman, or a collector of Oriental proverbs. But, as in the case of\r\nthe costers\xe2\x80\x99 speech and the old gipsy-vagabond cant, the chaunters and\r\npatterers so interlard this rhyming slang with their general remarks,\r\nwhile their ordinary language is so smothered and subdued, that, unless\r\nwhen they are professionally engaged, and talking of their wares, they\r\nmight almost pass for foreigners.\r\n\r\nFrom the inquiries I have made of various patterers and \xe2\x80\x9cpaper-workers,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI learn that the rhyming slang was introduced about twelve or fifteen\r\nyears ago.[61] Numbering this class of oratorical and bawling wanderers\r\nat twenty thousand, scattered over Great Britain, including London and\r\nthe large provincial towns, we thus see the number of English vagabonds\r\nwho converse in rhyme and talk poetry, although their habitations and\r\nmode of life constitute a very unpleasant Arcadia. These nomadic poets,\r\nlike the other talkers of cant or secret languages, are stamped with the\r\nvagabond\xe2\x80\x99s mark, and are continually on the move. The married men mostly\r\nhave lodgings in London, and come and go as occasion may require. A few\r\nnever quit London streets, but the greater number tramp to all the large\r\nprovincial fairs, and prefer the \xe2\x80\x9cmonkery\xe2\x80\x9d (country) to town life. Some\r\ntransact their business in a systematic way, sending a post-office order\r\nto the Seven Dials\xe2\x80\x99 printer for a fresh supply of ballads or penny\r\nbooks, or to the \xe2\x80\x9cswag shop,\xe2\x80\x9d as the case may be, for trinkets and\r\ngewgaws, to be sent on by rail to a given town by the time they shall\r\narrive there.\r\n\r\nWhen any dreadful murder, colliery explosion, or frightful railway\r\naccident has happened in a country district, three or four chaunters\r\nare generally on the spot in a day or two after the occurrence, vending\r\nand bawling \xe2\x80\x9cA True and Faithful Account,\xe2\x80\x9d &c., which \xe2\x80\x9ctrue and\r\nfaithful account\xe2\x80\x9d was concocted purely in the imaginations of\r\nthe successors of Catnach and Tommy Pitts,[62] behind the counters\r\nof their printing-shops in Seven Dials. And but few fairs are held\r\nin any part of England without the patterer being punctually at his\r\npost, with his nostrums, or real gold rings (with the story of the wager\r\nlaid by the gentleman\xe2\x80\x94_see_ FAWNEY-BOUNCING, in the Dictionary), or\r\nsavealls for candlesticks, or paste which, when applied to the strop,\r\nmakes the dullest razor keen enough to hack broom handles and sticks,\r\nand after that to have quite enough sharpness left for splitting hairs,\r\nor shaving them off the back of one of the hands of a clodhopper,\r\nlooking on in amazement. And Cheap John, too, with his coarse jokes, and\r\nno end of six-bladed knives, and pocket-books, containing information\r\nfor everybody, with pockets to hold money, and a pencil to write with\r\ninto the bargain, and a van stuffed with the cheap productions of\r\nSheffield and \xe2\x80\x9cBrummagem,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he, too, is a patterer of the highest order,\r\nand visits fairs, and can hold a conversation in the rhyming slang.\r\n\r\nSuch is a rough description of the men who speak this jargon; and simple\r\nand ridiculous as the vulgar scheme of a rhyming slang may appear, it\r\nmust always be regarded as a curious fact in linguistic history. In\r\norder that the reader\xe2\x80\x99s patience may not be too much taxed, only a\r\nselection of rhyming words has been given in the Glossary,\xe2\x80\x94and these\r\nfor the most part, as in the case of the back slang, are the terms of\r\nevery-day life, as used by this order of tramps and hucksters.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that the chaunter or patterer confines\r\nhimself entirely to this slang when conveying secret intelligence. On\r\nthe contrary, although he speaks not a \xe2\x80\x9cleash of languages,\xe2\x80\x9d yet is he\r\nmaster of the beggar\xe2\x80\x99s cant, and is thoroughly \xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x80\x9d in street slang. The\r\nfollowing letter, written by a chaunter to a gentleman who took an\r\ninterest in his welfare, will show his capabilities in this line:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    Dear Friend,[63]\r\n\r\n    Excuse the liberty, since i saw you last i have not earned a thick\r\n    un, we have had such a Dowry of Parny that it completely Stumped\r\n    Drory the Bossman\xe2\x80\x99s Patter therefore i am broke up and not having\r\n    another friend but you i wish to know if you would lend me the price\r\n    of 2 Gross of Tops, Dies, or Croaks, which is 7 shillings, of the\r\n    above-mentioned worthy and Sarah Chesham the Essex Burick for the\r\n    Poisoning job, they are both to be topped at Springfield Sturaban on\r\n    Tuesday next. i hope you will oblige me if you can, for it will be\r\n    the means of putting a James in my Clye. i will call at your Carser\r\n    on Sunday Evening next for an answer, for i want a Speel on the Drum\r\n    as soon as possible. hoping you and the family are All Square,\r\n\r\n    I remain Your obedient Servant,\r\n\r\nThe numerous allusions in the Glossary to well-known places in London\r\nshow that this rude speech was mainly concocted in the metropolis. The\r\npolice have made themselves partially acquainted with the back slang,\r\nbut they are still profoundly ignorant of the rhyming slang.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing was written, matters have changed considerably,\r\neven, which I much doubt, if they ever were as is stated; for, as I have\r\nalready remarked, wherever opportunity has occurred, the costermonger,\r\nthe patterer, the chaunter, and the various other itinerants who \xe2\x80\x9cwork\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nLondon and the provinces, delight in making themselves appear a most\r\nmysterious body; and this, when added to their natural disinclination to\r\ncommit themselves to anything like fact so far as their natural\r\nenemies\xe2\x80\x94inquirers, and well-dressed inquirers in particular\xe2\x80\x94are\r\nconcerned, has caused all sorts of extraordinary stories to be set\r\nafloat, which have ultimately led to an opinion becoming prevalent, that\r\nthe costermonger and his friends form a race of beings differing\r\nentirely from those who mix in the ordinary humdrum routine of\r\nrespectable life. Nothing could really be much further from fact. Any\r\none who has ever been driven by stress of circumstances or curiosity to\r\ntake up a permanent or temporary residence in any of the lodging-houses\r\nwhich abound in St. Giles\xe2\x80\x99s, Saffron Hill, Turnmill Street, and in all\r\nparts of the eastern district of the metropolis, will bear me out when I\r\nsay that a more commonplace individual, so far as his inner life is\r\nconcerned, than the London itinerant cannot possibly exist. Certainly he\r\nis ignorant, and takes a very limited view of things in general, and\r\nreligion and politics in particular; but these peculiarities are held in\r\ncommon with his betters, and so cannot be regarded as the special\r\nprerogative of any class. If you ask him a question he will attempt to\r\nmislead you, because, by your asking the question, he knows you are\r\nignorant of his way of life; and when he does not mystify from love of\r\nmischief, as it appears he does from all published books I have seen\r\nabout him, he does so as a duty he owes his natural enemies, the parish\r\nauthorities and the tract distributors, the latter of whom he holds in\r\nspecial abhorrence.\r\n\r\nIf the rhyming slang was ever, during its existence, regarded as a\r\nsecret language, its secrecy has long since departed from it. Far easier\r\nof construction than even the back slang, it has been common, especially\r\nin several printing-offices I could name, for many years, while\r\nstreet-boys are great proficients in its small mysteries. The Glossary\r\nwhich follows here will explain a good deal of its mechanism; but it\r\nmust be borne in mind that the rhymes are all matters of individual\r\nopinion, and that if one man says Allacompain means rain, another is\r\nquite justified in preferring Mary Blane, if his individual fancy lies\r\nin that direction. And now, if there is any secret about the rhyming\r\nslang, it is this\xe2\x80\x94the rhyme is left out. This may at first seem\r\nextraordinary; but on reflection it will be seen that there is no other\r\nway of making the proceedings of its exponents puzzling to ordinarily\r\nsharp ears which have received the slightest clue. Thus, when the first\r\nword of a series only is used, and others in the sentence are made up\r\nfrom the back, the centre and various slangs, there is some hope of\r\nfogging an intruding listener to a private conversation. When a man is\r\ndrunk, the rhyming slang would illustrate that fact by the words\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElephant\xe2\x80\x99s trunk;\xe2\x80\x9d but the practised hand confines himself to the\r\nstatement that \xe2\x80\x9cBill\xe2\x80\x99s Elephants.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBullock\xe2\x80\x99s horn\xe2\x80\x9d represents to pawn,\r\nbut an article is said to be \xe2\x80\x9cBullocked\xe2\x80\x9d only; and so on through the\r\nlist, providing always that the curtailment represents two syllables; if\r\nit does not, then the entire rhyme is given.\r\n\r\nI think that this will be sufficient to guide those readers anxious to\r\nbecome proficient themselves, or to understand others who are themselves\r\nproficient at this item in the world of slang; and so I have nothing\r\nmore to say except to call attention to the fact that, in all the other\r\nintroductions, I have made my corrections, which have been neither few\r\nnor unimportant, in the text; but that I could see no way of working on\r\nthe subject of the rhyming slang fairly and explicitly other than by\r\nmeans of this note.\xe2\x80\x94EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] This was written in 1858.\r\n\r\n[62] The famous printers and publishers of sheet songs and last dying\r\nspeeches thirty years ago.\r\n\r\n[63] The writer, a street chaunter of ballads and last dying speeches,\r\nalludes in his letter to two celebrated criminals\xe2\x80\x94Thos.

As this knowledge can never be acquired in any other way than by\r\nactual observation, and is not to be obtained by hearsay, or second-hand\r\ninformation, or from books, it is rarely brought to bear upon any\r\nsubject of this kind as treated in the newspapers, and the articles on\r\nreal low and criminal life which now and again appear, though extremely\r\namusing, amuse those about whom they are written as much as they do\r\nthose for whose information they are produced. So, perhaps, those\r\nwriters who have heard centre slang, and have had opportunity of\r\nreferring to it, did not know what it was, or certainly, as an\r\ninstitution unique in its way, it would have received some little\r\nattention. There is not much in it, of course, as its origin shows, the\r\nkey being everything towards success in experimentalizing with it.\r\nCentre slang, then, is formed by making the central vowel of a word its\r\ninitial letter, and adding vowels and consonants sufficient to make the\r\nsound imposing, or, as cooks say, to flavour palatably. An occasional\r\ninfusion of back slang is now and again considered advisable, but the\r\ntaste of the speaker must decide how much is requisite. Mug is a common\r\nword to signify a fool or flat; this, in centre slang, becomes Ugmer, or\r\nHugmer, as the speaker likes, while fool and flat themselves become\r\nOolerfer and Atfler respectively. The aspirate can be added, if\r\nrelished, to any centre slang word. A welcher, by means of the new\r\nslang, becomes an Elcherwer or Elchwer, a thief is an Evethee, and a\r\nsticker-up of skittles is an Ickitser-pu. As the inventors of this slang\r\nare not particular about spelling, phonography is used extensively in\r\nits composition\xe2\x80\x94that is, it would be, if it were possible to write\r\ncentre slang to any extent. However, as it is a spoken language only,\r\nand no patent has been taken out for its use, boldness is the chief\r\nessential for any one possessed of a mobile tongue and a desire to\r\nbecome expert. There is no Glossary of this slang necessary, as it is\r\nonly made up of small parcels, as occasion requires, and does not keep\r\nwell without guiding sentences attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nSLANG, CANT, AND VULGAR LANGUAGE:\r\n\r\nA LIST OF THE\r\n\r\nBOOKS CONSULTED IN COMPILING THIS WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlang has a literary history, the same as authorized language. More than\r\none hundred works have treated upon the subject in one form or other,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfew devoting but a chapter, whilst many have given up their entire pages\r\nto expounding its history and use. Old Harman, a worthy man, who\r\ninterested himself in suppressing and exposing vagabondism in the days\r\nof good Queen Bess, was the first to write upon the subject. Decker\r\nfollowed fifty years afterwards, but helped himself, evidently, to his\r\npredecessor\xe2\x80\x99s labours. Shakspeare, Beaumont and Fletcher, Ben Jonson,\r\nand Brome, each employed beggars\xe2\x80\x99 cant as part of the machinery of their\r\nplays. Then came Head (who wrote _The English Rogue_ in 1680) with a\r\nGlossary of cant words \xe2\x80\x9cused by the Gipsies.\xe2\x80\x9d But it was only a reprint\r\nof what Decker had given sixty years before. About this time authorized\r\ndictionaries began to insert vulgar words, labelling them \xe2\x80\x9ccant.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nJack Sheppards and Dick Turpins of the early and middle part of the last\r\ncentury made cant popular, and many small works were published upon the\r\nsubject. But it was Grose, burly, facetious Grose, who, in the year\r\n1785, collected the scattered Glossaries of cant and secret words, and\r\nformed one large work, adding to it all the vulgar words and slang terms\r\nused in his own day. The indelicacy and extreme vulgarity of the work\r\nrenders it unfit for ordinary use, still it must be admitted that it is\r\nby far the most important work which has ever appeared on street or\r\npopular language; indeed, from its pages every succeeding work has, up\r\nto the present time, drawn its contents. The great fault of Grose\xe2\x80\x99s book\r\nconsists in the author not contenting himself with slang and cant terms,\r\nbut inserting every \xe2\x80\x9csmutty\xe2\x80\x9d and offensive word that could be\r\ndiscovered. However, Harman and Grose are, after all, the only authors\r\nwho have as yet treated the subject in an original manner, or who have\r\nwritten on it from personal inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Ainsworth\xe2\x80\x99s~ (William Harrison) Novels and Ballads.     _London_, V.\xc2\xa0D.\r\n\r\nSome of this author\xe2\x80\x99s novels, such as _Rookwood_ and _Jack Sheppard_,\r\nabound in Cant words, placed in the mouths of the highwaymen.

This work\r\nis scarce, and much prized by collectors. The Canting Dictionary\r\nappeared before, about 1710, with the initials B. E. on the title.

Many words, owing to the caprices of fashion or society, have\r\nwholly disappeared in the parent country, whilst in the colonies they\r\nare yet heard. The words \xe2\x80\x9cskink,\xe2\x80\x9d to serve drink in company, and the old\r\nterm \xe2\x80\x9cmiching\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmeeching,\xe2\x80\x9d skulking or playing truant, for instance,\r\nare still in use in the United States, although nearly obsolete here.\r\n\r\n~Beaumont and Fletcher\xe2\x80\x99s~ Comedy of _The Beggar\xe2\x80\x99s Bush_, 4to, 1661.\r\n\r\nContains numerous Cant words.\r\n\r\n~Bee\xe2\x80\x99s~ (Jon.)

It was concocted by Caulfield as a\r\nspeculation, and published at _one guinea_ per copy; and, owing to the\r\nremarkable title, and the notification at the bottom that \xe2\x80\x9conly a few\r\ncopies were printed,\xe2\x80\x9d soon became scarce. For philological purposes it\r\nis not worth so much as any edition of Grose.\r\n\r\n~Book of Vagabonds.~ _See_ under LIBER VAGATORUM.\r\n\r\n~Boxiana;~ or, Sketches of Modern Pugilism, by Pierce Egan (an account\r\nof the prize-ring), 3 vols. 8vo.      1820.\r\n\r\nGives more particularly the Cant terms of pugilism, but contains\r\nnumerous (what were then styled) \xe2\x80\x9cflash\xe2\x80\x9d words.\r\n\r\n~Brandon.~ Poverty, Mendicity, and Crime; or, The Facts, Examinations,\r\n&c., upon which the Report was founded, presented to the House of Lords\r\nby W.

It was frequently reprinted at other places in Germany: and in\r\n1528 there appeared an edition at Wirtemberg, with a preface by Martin\r\nLuther, who says that the \xe2\x80\x9cRotwelsche Sprach,\xe2\x80\x9d the Cant language of the\r\nbeggars, comes from the Jews, as it contains many Hebrew words, as any\r\none who understands that language may perceive. This book is divided\r\ninto three parts, or sections; the first gives a special account of the\r\nseveral orders of the \xe2\x80\x9cFraternity of Vagabonds;\xe2\x80\x9d the second, sundry\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_notabilia_\xe2\x80\x9d relating to the different classes of beggars previously\r\ndescribed; and the third consists of a \xe2\x80\x9cRotwelsche Vocabulary,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCanting Dictionary.\xe2\x80\x9d There is a long notice of the \xe2\x80\x9cLiber Vagatorum\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cWeimarisches Jahrbuch,\xe2\x80\x9d 10ter Band, 1856.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\r\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\'s web site and official\r\npage at http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
