The general\r\n  route must be left to your discretion. Whether it will be necessary\r\n  for you to go beyond Fond du Lac, you can best determine on your\r\n  arrival there. From the limited means applicable to this object, I\r\n  am apprehensive that your journey cannot be extended beyond that\r\n  place. But in that event, it will be necessary to summon some of\r\n  the principal Mississippi Chiefs to meet you, as without their\r\n  concurrence no durable pacification can be effected.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cYour object will be to impress upon them, the necessity\r\n  of terminating their hostilities with the Sioux. And the\r\n  considerations connected with the subject are so familiar to you,\r\n  that I need not dwell upon them. You are perfectly acquainted with\r\n  their useless and harrowing contests, and the miseries these have\r\n  inflicted, and yet threaten to inflict upon them. But it will be\r\n  well to state to them the result of the recent council at Prairie\r\n  du Chien, that they may know what has been done by the other\r\n  Indians, and that the Sioux, now freed from the pressure in other\r\n  quarters, can direct their whole force against them.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cIn addition to the other considerations you may urge, I enclose a\r\n  speech to be delivered to them, which you will please to accompany\r\n  with a proper belt. I think it will be best for them to send a\r\n  message to the Sioux without delay, stating their determination to\r\n  refrain from hostilities in conformity with the wish of their great\r\n  father the President, and their adhesion to the treaty of Prairie\r\n  du Chien. This message should be sent while you are with them,\r\n  and I recommend that one from you be likewise sent to the Sioux,\r\n  explanatory of the matter.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cYou will proceed to the execution of this duty without delay, if\r\n  the season be not too far advanced when you receive this letter.\r\n  But I am apprehensive it will not reach you in season. Should\r\n  it be so, you will please send a message to the chiefs stating\r\n  your intention to visit them next summer, and recommending them\r\n  to sit still until you can see them. It may have the effect of\r\n  keeping them quiet. If, however, you cannot proceed this fall, it\r\n  is probable that circumstances may require some change in these\r\n  instructions before the next season, and your arrangements must\r\n  therefore depend upon such as may be hereafter given.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x9cVery respectfully, &c.\r\n                                                          LEW. CASS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                          \xe2\x80\x9cDEPARTMENT OF WAR,                       }\r\n                      _Office of Indian Affairs, 25th April, 1831_. }\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cSir: Since writing the letter to you of the 5th instant, Gov.\r\n  Cass has arrived here, and submitted to the Secretary of War\r\n  his views, as to the propriety of directing you to proceed into\r\n  Lake Superior and the Mississippi country, &c. These views have\r\n  been approved, and I am accordingly directed to instruct you to\r\n  proceed as soon as your arrangements can be made for the purpose,\r\n  on the proposed expedition. The objects to be accomplished are so\r\n  well known, and have also been so fully explained in the letter\r\n  of Gov. Cass to you of the 9th of August last, that it is deemed\r\n  unnecessary to give you any further instructions on the subject.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cOrders will be issued through the proper department, to the\r\n  Commanding Officer at the Sault Ste. Marie for a detachment of the\r\n  troops, to form a part of the proposed expedition.\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x9cVery respectfully, &c.\r\n                                                 SAMUEL S. HAMILTON.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                             \xe2\x80\x9cDEPARTMENT OF WAR,                    }\r\n                         _Office of Indian Affairs, May 3rd, 1832_. }\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cSir: Your letter of Feb. 13th has been received, and its general\r\n  views are approved. The Secretary of War deems it important\r\n  that you should proceed to the country upon the heads of the\r\n  Mississippi, and visit as many of the Indians in that, and the\r\n  intermediate region, as circumstances will permit.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cReports have reached the department, from various quarters, that\r\n  the Indians upon our frontiers are in an unquiet state, and that\r\n  there is a prospect of extensive hostilities among themselves. It\r\n  is no less the dictate of humanity, than of policy, to repress this\r\n  feeling, and to establish permanent peace among these tribes. It is\r\n  also important to inspect the condition of the trade in that remote\r\n  country, and the conduct of the traders. To ascertain whether the\r\n  regulations and the laws are complied with, and to suggest such\r\n  alterations as may be required. And finally to inquire into the\r\n  numbers, standing, disposition and prospects of the Indians, and to\r\n  report all the statistical facts you can procure and which will be\r\n  useful to the government in its operations, or to the community in\r\n  the investigation of these subjects.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cIn addition to these objects, you will direct your attention\r\n  to the vaccination of the Indians. An act for that purpose, has\r\n  passed Congress, and you are authorised to take a surgeon with\r\n  you. Vaccine matter prepared and put up by the Surgeon General is\r\n  herewith transmitted to you, and you will, upon your whole route,\r\n  explain to the Indians the advantages of vaccination, and endeavor\r\n  to persuade them to submit to the process. You will keep and report\r\n  an account of the number, ages, sex, tribe, and local situation of\r\n  the Indians who may be vaccinated, and also of the prevalence, from\r\n  time to time, of the small pox among them, and of its effects as\r\n  far as these can be ascertained.\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x9cVery respectfully, &c.\r\n                                                     ELBERT HERRING.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the execution of these orders, the summer season of two years was\r\ndevoted. All the bands of the Chippewa nation, located north of the\r\nmouth of the Wisconsin, and some bands of the Sioux were visited.\r\nCouncils were held with them at various points, for the objects above\r\nspecified, and no opportunity was omitted to acquire statistical and\r\nother information suited to aid in the formation of correct opinions\r\nrespecting their condition, and the policy to be pursued respecting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe portion of country situated between the bands of Lake Superior\r\nand the Mississippi, south of St. Anthony\xe2\x80\x99s falls, occupied the\r\nsummer of 1831. The area extending thence north, to the source of\r\nthe Mississippi, and the Hauteur des Terres, forming the elevation\r\nseparating its waters, from the streams received by Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s bay,\r\nconstituted the object of the expedition of 1832. So much of this area,\r\nas lies north of a latitude line passing through Cass lake, and west\r\nof about its parallel of longitude, comprehends the principal topic of\r\ndescription in the following work. And it is thus distinguished, from\r\nother portions of the western country, brought into discussion, in my\r\ntwo previous volumes of travels.\r\n\r\n                                                HENRY R.

The first and second of these, related to\r\nthe source of the Missouri, and to the course and termination of the\r\nColumbia. Both, were substantially resolved by the expedition of Lewis\r\nand Clark, under the administration of Mr. Jefferson. It is to be\r\nborne in mind, however, that but one of the three forks, up to which\r\nthe Missouri was traced, has been explored, that its two northwestern\r\nbranches have not been ascended, and that, consequently, we do not\r\nactually know, which of its primary tributaries is the longest, or\r\nbrings down the greatest volume of water.\r\n\r\nThe true source of the Mississippi, which forms the third topic\r\nof inquiry, was brought into discussion at the same period. And\r\nimmediately after the acquisition of Louisiana, the American government\r\nsent an officer, with a suitable body of men, to determine it. Lieut.\r\nPike, who was selected for this service (who, nine years afterwards\r\nlost his life as a general in the service, at the taking of York) did\r\nnot, however, set out early enough in the season (1805) to accomplish\r\nthe object. After the selection and purchase of the site, on which the\r\nfort near the Falls of St. Anthony, is now situated, he encountered\r\ndelays in ascending the rapids characteristic of that part of the\r\nMississippi. Winter overtook him before reaching the junction of the De\r\nCorbeau. He prepared for its severities by erecting a block house, for\r\nthe security of his provisions and men. He then proceeded with a small\r\ndetachment, on snow shoes to Sandy Lake, and Leech Lake; two points\r\nof central influence, which were then occupied by the North West Fur\r\nCompany. As the partners of this company consisted of foreigners, and\r\ntheir operations were continued after the legal transfer of the country\r\nto the American government, Lieut. Pike would have been justified in\r\nmaking a seizure of the valuable furs then in their possession. He\r\ndid not, however, adopt this course, and exhibited a magnanimity in\r\nrelation to it, which is in accordance with his subsequent acts of\r\ndisinterested intrepidity. He collected the geographical data, which\r\nare embodied in his published map and journal, and returned from his\r\nwintry station, on the opening of navigation in the spring.\r\n\r\nNo further effort was made to explore the sources of the Mississippi,\r\nfor several years. In 1820, Gov. Cass, then administering the\r\ngovernment of Michigan Territory and exercising jurisdiction over\r\nIndian affairs, obtained the sanction of the general government to\r\nvisit the region. He left Detroit, with a party of thirty-eight men,\r\nincluding the gentlemen composing his suit, during the latter part of\r\nMay. He was supplied for a journey of four months. After traversing\r\nthe coasts of Lake Huron, and visiting Michilimackinac, he proceeded\r\nnorth-westward, by ascending the primitive summit at the Falls of St.\r\nMary, went through the extended and picturesque basin of Lake Superior,\r\nand first struck the waters of the Upper Mississippi at Sandy Lake. To\r\nthis point he was accompanied by the military escort, and by the train\r\nof larger canoes employed to transport stores and baggage. But the\r\nfatigues which the men had undergone in crossing portages, added to the\r\nlow state of the water, induced him to form a permanent encampment at\r\nthis place. And he proceeded with a select party, in canoes to explore\r\nthe Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIt was the middle of July when the expedition reached Sandy Lake, and\r\nthe difficulty of subsisting so large a party in so remote a position,\r\nwith the constant claims of suffering and hungry tribes, who presented\r\nthemselves at every point, began to be severely felt. The exploring\r\nparty, which was now organized, went out, under a sense of these\r\ncircumstances, and with a feeling of the responsibility pressing upon\r\nthe claims of the expedition in other quarters, which limited the time\r\napplicable to the ascent. They entered the Mississippi on the 17th\r\nof the month, and found a strong current, with alluvial banks, and a\r\nvegetation indicative of a fertile soil. For the distance of about\r\none hundred and fifty miles, above this point, the party found no\r\ndiminution in the average strength of the current, which was frequently\r\naccelerated by rapids. The latter then assumed a more formidable aspect\r\nfor ten or a dozen miles, at the end of which they were terminated\r\nby the falls of Peck\xc3\xa1gama. At this cataract, the river, which below\r\nhas its course through alluvial banks, densely wooded, is compressed\r\nbetween rocks of granulated quartz, over which it rushes with a\r\nvelocity, which would seem to threaten destruction to any species of\r\ncraft that should attempt the descent. It became necessary, at this\r\npoint, to transport the canoes and baggage from two to three hundred\r\nyards over land.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Peck\xc3\xa1gama summit, the channel of the Mississippi\r\nwas found to flow more directly from the west, with a comparatively\r\nsluggish current. But the most distinctive trait of this part of the\r\nriver was found to consist of a series of extensive savannahs, through\r\nwhich the river displays itself in the most elaborate windings. The\r\njunction of the Leech Lake branch takes place at this plateau, at the\r\ncomputed distance of fifty-five miles above the falls. After passing\r\nthis point, the course of the river is again, generally, from the\r\nnorth-west, about forty-five miles to Lake Winnipec, a handsome body\r\nof clear water, estimated to be ten miles broad. The course of the\r\nascent is then west, for about fifty miles, at which distance the\r\nriver is found expanded into a more considerable lake, presenting\r\nan area of limpid water of, perhaps, 120 square miles. This sheet,\r\nwhich has subsequently been found to be the largest expansion of the\r\nMississippi, is since denominated Cass Lake. It was the highest point\r\nreached. The party entered it on the 21st of July. The question of\r\npursuing the stream further, was then submitted by Gov. Cass, to the\r\ngentlemen composing his party. Anxious as all were to see the actual\r\nsource of so celebrated a stream, their wishes were controlled by\r\ncircumstances. Inconveniences had been felt from leaving the supplies\r\nat so considerable a distance below, and as the waters were found to\r\nbe low, and the preparations inadequate for a journey of indefinite\r\nextent, a decisive opinion was expressed in favor of a return from this\r\npoint. This decision was immediately carried into effect.\r\n\r\nFrom the best information that could be obtained, the Mississippi\r\nwas represented to have its origin in a lake called _La Biche_,\r\nsupposed to be sixty miles distant, in a north-west direction. Upon\r\nthis estimate, the length of the river was computed to be 3038 miles,\r\nand by a series of approximate estimates, its altitude placed at 1330\r\nfeet above the Atlantic. Numerous rapids and lakes were, however,\r\nstated to exist in this remote part of the stream, and a degree of\r\nvagueness and uncertainty exhibited in relation to it, which evinced,\r\nthat the traders, who were relied on for information, either, had\r\nseldom frequented it, or preserved an indefinite recollection of its\r\ngeographical features.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of public information on this point in 1820. A\r\nveil of obscurity was still cast about the actual source of the\r\nMississippi, which there was no further attempt to remove for ten or\r\neleven years. In 1830, the writer of these sheets was directed to\r\nproceed into the Chippewa country, north-west of Lake Superior, in the\r\nexecution of duties connected with Indian affairs. But the instructions\r\nwere received so late in the season, that their execution became\r\nimpracticable until the next year. In the mean time, means for more\r\nextensive observation were provided, a physician and botanist engaged,\r\nand a small detachment of troops, under the command of a subaltern,\r\nordered to form a part of the expedition.\r\n\r\nThis expedition numbering twenty-seven persons, exclusive of guides and\r\nIndian auxiliaries, employed on the portages, left St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s at the\r\nfoot of Lake Superior, late in June 1831. After entering, and coursing\r\naround the shores of Lake Superior to Lapointe, it was found, from\r\nevery representation, that the low state of the water on the Upper\r\nMississippi, would render it difficult, if not impracticable, to reach\r\nthe bands at its sources, during the drought of summer. Public reasons\r\nwere, at the same time, urgent for visiting the interior bands, located\r\nbetween the group of islands at the head of Lake Superior, and the\r\nMississippi\xe2\x80\x94where a useless and harassing conflict was kept up between\r\nthe Sioux and Chippewa nations.\r\n\r\nThe expedition returned eight miles on its track, and entered the\r\nmouth of Mushkigo, or Mauvais river of Lake Superior. This stream,\r\nwhich carries down the waters of an extensive slope of highlands, is\r\nembarrassed with permanent rafts of flood wood, and with numerous\r\nrapids, presenting an arduous ascent. The axe, the canoe-pole, and the\r\ncarrying-strap, were alternately employed in the ascent, and they were\r\nemployed under the influence of the midsummer\xe2\x80\x99s heat, and the annoyance\r\nof the hordes of smaller insects, who are on the wing, in this secluded\r\nvalley, during the greater part of the twenty-four hours. This stream\r\nwas ascended one hundred and four miles, to the portage. The goods and\r\ncanoes were then carried 8\xc2\xbe miles, across highlands, to a lake called\r\nKagin\xc3\xb3gumoc, or the Longwater; and thence by four separate portages,\r\nand three intervening lakes, to the Namak\xc3\xa1gon river. The latter was\r\ndescended one hundred and sixty-one miles, to its junction with the St.\r\nCroix, of which it is the right fork, and the channel of the latter\r\npursued to Yellow River. From this point, where a public council was\r\nconvened, the expedition re-ascended the Namak\xc3\xa1gon to the portage into\r\n_lac Courtorielle_, or Ottawa Lake. This portage consists of a carrying\r\nplace of three miles and a lake, then another carrying place of 750\r\nyards and a lake, from the latter of which there is a navigable outlet\r\ninto the Ottawa for canoes.\r\n\r\nOttawa Lake is a sheet of water about twelve miles long, having an\r\noutlet into the Chippewa river of the Upper Mississippi. In order,\r\nhowever, to visit certain hostile bands, a portage was made from this\r\noutlet (after following it down about half a day\xe2\x80\x99s journey,) of 3\xc2\xbd\r\nmiles, into lac Chetac, the principal source of Red Cedar river. The\r\nlatter was then pursued, through four principal expansions, called\r\nWigwas, Warpool, Red Cedar and Rice Lakes, to its falls. A short\r\nportage over horizontal sand-rock, interrupts the navigation, after\r\nwhich there is a series of rapids, extending about 24 miles. Deep\r\nand strong water was then found to its junction with the Chippewa\r\nriver, which it enters at the estimated distance of 40 miles from the\r\nconfluence of the latter with the Mississippi, (on its eastern bank.)\r\n\r\nThe entire line of country travelled by this interior route was 643\r\nmiles. The Mushkigo, the St. Croix, and the Chippewa, were the rivers,\r\nwhich by their common origin and interlocking on the summit lands,\r\nafforded this communication. Many bands of Indians were visited in\r\ntheir fastnesses, where they had hitherto supposed themselves out of\r\nthe reach of observation. Councils were held at various points, and\r\npresents distributed. And the pauses afforded by these assemblages,\r\nand by the necessary delays of overland transportation, furnished\r\nopportunities for preserving notes on the manner of living, among\r\nthose bands, and their population, traditions and resources, as well\r\nas the geographical features and the natural history of the country.\r\nOn entering the Mississippi, the truth of the information, derived on\r\nLake Superior, respecting its depressed state, was verified. Extensive\r\nportions of its outer channel and bars, were found exposed and dry. The\r\nparty encamped on a sand bar formed by the junction of the Chippewa,\r\nwhich is usually several feet under water.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the Chippewa, the expedition descended the\r\nMississippi to Galena, in Illinois. While at Prairie du Chien, the\r\nmurder of twenty-six Monomonee men, women, and children, by a war\r\nparty of the Sacs and Foxes, which had transpired a few days previous,\r\nwas the subject of exciting interest. It was narrated with all its\r\natrocious circumstances. A flag waved over the common grave of the\r\nslain, and several of the wounded Monomonees, who had escaped the\r\nmassacre, were examined and conversed with. This affray unparalleled\r\nfor its boldness and turpitude, having occurred in the village of\r\nPrairie du Chien, in the hearing of its inhabitants, and in sight of\r\nthe fort, was made the subject of demand by the government for the\r\nsurrendry of the murderers, and produced the concentration of troops\r\non that frontier, which eventuated in the Indian war of 1832. Some\r\nexcitement was also felt at Galena, and its vicinity, in consequence of\r\nthe menacing attitude which the Sacs and Foxes had recently assumed,\r\nin the vicinity of Rock Island, and a general mistrust felt of their\r\nsincerity in the treaty concluded with the United States a short time\r\nprevious.\r\n\r\nAt Galena, the exploring party separated, part returning in canoes up\r\nthe Wisconsin, and part crossing the mine country, over the branches of\r\nthe Pekatolika, and by the way of the Blue Mounds, to fort Winnebago.\r\nFrom this point, Fox River was descended to Green Bay, and the route of\r\nthe lake coast pursued northward to the straits, and to the Sault of\r\nSt. Mary.\r\n\r\nA narrative of this expedition, embracing its principal incidents, and\r\nobservations on the productions of the country, is in preparation for\r\npublication by one of the gentlemen of the party. In the mean time, the\r\nofficial report transmitted to Government, and submitted to Congress by\r\nthe War Department, together with remarks in a series of letters on the\r\nmine country, are subjoined in the appendix to this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  _Farther observations on the exploration of the Upper Mississippi,\r\n    and the discovery of its source.\xe2\x80\x94An expedition authorised\r\n    by the United States government, in 1832.\xe2\x80\x94Its organization,\r\n    objects, and route.\xe2\x80\x94Leaves St. Mary, and proceeds through Lake\r\n    Superior.\xe2\x80\x94Sketch of this lake.\xe2\x80\x94Notice of the murder of Brunet,\r\n    by an Indian, in 1831.\xe2\x80\x94Mission at Lapointe, or Chagoimegon.\xe2\x80\x94The\r\n    importance of this point in Indian history.\xe2\x80\x94Mongozid,\r\n    Wahbojeeg.\xe2\x80\x94Meet Ozawindib, at the Brule.\xe2\x80\x94Route to Sandy Lake, on\r\n    the Upper Mississippi.\xe2\x80\x94Portages on the St. Louis.\xe2\x80\x94The Savanne\r\n    portage.\xe2\x80\x94Sandy Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Assassination of Mr. Kay._\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in 1832, the plan of visiting the source of the Mississippi,\r\nwas resumed. And a memoir for its execution, accompanied by estimates,\r\nforwarded to the Department of War, which received the sanction of the\r\nHon. L. Cass, then placed at the head of that department. An expedition\r\nwas accordingly organized, consisting of thirty persons, including\r\nan officer of the army, detached, with ten men, for topographical\r\nduty, a surgeon and geologist, an interpreter of the language, and a\r\nmissionary to the north-western Indians, who was invited to accompany\r\nthe exploring party. This expedition was based on a renewal of the\r\neffort to effect a permanent peace with the two principal Indian\r\nnations, who inhabit that region, and whose continued feuds, not only\r\nweaken and harass each other, but embarrass the trade, interrupt\r\nthe execution of the intercourse laws, and involve the lives and\r\nproperty of the frontier inhabitants. Additional weight was given\r\nto these considerations, by the unquiet state of the Indians on the\r\nUpper Mississippi, which broke out in open hostility during the year.\r\nThese reasons were connected with the supervision of the trade, the\r\nacquisition of statistical facts, and the carrying into effect an act\r\nof Congress of that year, for extending the benefits of vaccination\r\nto the Indian tribes. To which end it was enjoined \xe2\x80\x9cto proceed to the\r\ncountry on the heads of the Mississippi, and to visit as many Indians\r\nin that, and the intermediate region, as circumstances would permit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis expedition, to the account of which the present volume is devoted,\r\nleft St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s on the 7th of June, 1832. As the route through\r\nLake Superior, and thence north-west, on the waters of the Upper\r\nMississippi, to Cass Lake, has been described in a \xe2\x80\x9cNarrative Journal\r\nof Travels in the North-west,\xe2\x80\x9d of 1820, heretofore published by the\r\nauthor, no details of the geography of the country then passed over\r\nand described, or of the ordinary incidents of a journey through this\r\nportion of the country, will be given. A brief sketch, however, of\r\nthe general route, will serve to refresh the memory of readers whose\r\nattention has been before called to the subject, and cannot but prove\r\nacceptable to all, who feel an interest in the development of its\r\nnatural features and character.\r\n\r\nThe village of the Sault of St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s is situated on the communication\r\nwhich connects Lake Huron with Lake Superior, fifteen miles below\r\nthe foot of the latter. A strong and continued rapid, over shelving\r\nsand rock, interrupts the navigation for vessels. The water has been\r\ncomputed to sink its level, twenty two feet ten inches, at this place.\r\nA portage exceeding half a mile, enables boats to proceed beyond.\r\nThe river above has a brisk current, which is imperceptibly lost on\r\nentering between the two prominent capes, which form the opening into\r\nLake Superior.\r\n\r\nThis lake, which is called Igomi, Chigomi, and Gitchigomi, by the\r\nIndians, as the term is more or less abbreviated, is remarkable for\r\nits extent, its depth, and the purity of its waters. It lies in a\r\nbasin of trap rocks, with alternations of the granite and sand stone\r\nseries. No variety of calcareous rock is present,[1] and its waters\r\nare consequently free from impregnations from this source. As it is\r\nthe largest and the purest of the series of lakes it is also the\r\nhighest in position; its altitude being computed at 640 feet above\r\nthe Atlantic. Its banks are diversified with mural precipices, with\r\nextensive deposits of marine sand, and with beds of mixed detritus. Its\r\nimmediate margin is loaded with primitive boulders and pebble-stones,\r\nalternating with shores of yellow and of iron sand. Several bold\r\nmountains of primitive construction, stand near the central parts of\r\nits south shores, which are in striking contrast with the ruin-like,\r\nwalled masses, of horizontal structure, which characterize other parts.\r\nAmong the detritus of its shores are still occasionally found masses of\r\nnative copper, which are now referred to the trap formation.\r\n\r\nOf a body of water so irregular in its shape and imperfectly defined,\r\nit may be vague to speak of its superficial area, but this may be\r\nassumed to cover 30,000 square miles. It embraces numerous islands,\r\nthe largest of which are Grand, Royal, and Magdalen islands. It has\r\nseveral noble harbors, bays and inlets, and receives numerous rivers.\r\nIt abounds with fish, the most noted of which are white-fish, sturgeon,\r\nand salmon-trout. But by far the most valuable product of its present\r\ncommerce, is its furs and peltries. The Indian population of its\r\nimmediate shores, is not great. Exclusive of bands located on the heads\r\nof its rivers, it does not exceed 1006 souls, to which may be added 436\r\nfor the American side of the St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s river. Their trade is conducted\r\nby 15 clerks, licensed by the Indian department, employing 70 boatmen,\r\ninterpreters and runners. Recently a mission has been established on\r\nMagdalen Island (_La Pointe_ of the traders,) by the American Board of\r\nForeign Missions, and the gospel began to be preached to the natives.\r\nThe estimated population which, in a comprehensive view, should be\r\nadded for the south shores, extending to the borders of the Winnebago\r\nand Monomonee lands, and running west, to the Sioux line, is, for the\r\nnorthern curve of Green Bay, 210; heads of the Monomonee and Wisconsin\r\nrivers, 342; the Chippewa river and its tributaries, 1376; the St.\r\nCroix and its tributaries, 895; Grand Portage, and Rainy Lake, 476;\r\nto which latter may perhaps be added, 249, making, with the former\r\nestimates, 5000 souls.\r\n\r\nIn travelling through this lake, in boats or canoes, the shores are\r\nfollowed round. The distance from Point Iroquois to the entrance of the\r\nSt. Louis river of Fond du Lac, is estimated at 490 miles, exclusive\r\nof the journey around the peninsula of Keweena, which is ninety miles\r\nmore. The general course is nearly due west, in consequence of which,\r\nthe climate is deemed to be decidedly more favorable to agriculture at\r\nits head than at its outlet. Traders, who course round the peninsula\r\nin boats, take, on an average, twenty-six days in the voyage. Fifteen\r\nwere employed on the present expedition. Indians were met at various\r\npoints, and wherever it was practicable, they were vaccinated. The\r\nsurgeon employed on that service reported 699 vaccinations on the\r\nvoyage through the lake, and experienced no difficulty in getting them\r\nto submit to the process.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the Ontonagon, where the party arrived on the 19th\r\nof June, a band of Indians was encamped on its way out, from Ottawa\r\nlake. Mozojeed, their chief, confirmed a report of the murder of an\r\n_engag\xc3\xa9_, or under clerk, named Brunet, by a Chippewa, named Waba\r\nAnnimikee, or the White Thunder. He said that he had concurred with\r\nthe traders in apprehending the Indian, and bringing him out to be\r\ndelivered up to the Indian agent. But that he had effected his escape\r\non the Mauvais Portage. He promised to exert himself to re-apprehend\r\nhim, the following year. And he rigidly performed his promise. In July,\r\n1833, the White Thunder was delivered by Mozojeed and his followers, to\r\nthe civil authorities. He was tried for the murder at the U. S. circuit\r\ncourt holden at Michilimackinac, in that month. Counsel being assigned\r\nto defend him, every advantage was secured to him that the laws\r\nprovide. His own confessions were proved, to substantiate the murder,\r\nand on these he was convicted.\r\n\r\nHe made no defence whatever on the trial, silently submitting to the\r\ndeterminations of his counsel. When judgment had been pronounced, he\r\narose, and, through an interpreter, stated to the judge the reasons\r\nwhich had actuated him. He observed, that after aiding Brunet, on a\r\ncertain occasion, in carrying his goods to the banks of a river, he\r\nhad taken a canoe bound there, (being his _own_ canoe) to cross the\r\nstream. For this Brunet threatened him, and _shook a tomahawk over his\r\nhead_. On another occasion, having sold Brunet a shaved deer-skin, he\r\nasked him (as is customary after getting payment) for tobacco; but he\r\nreplied abusively, that he did not give tobacco to _such scaly dogs_.\r\nNot long afterwards, being engaged in playing at the Indian game of\r\nbowl, Brunet took him by the hair, _on the crown of his head_, and\r\nshook him. Finally, on the morning of the day of the murder, Brunet had\r\nstruck him on the chin, with violence. This, together with the other\r\nindignities, took place in the presence of the Indians, in whose eyes\r\nhe was, consequently, disgraced. In the afternoon of that day, Brunet\r\nwent back from the lake on which they were encamped, into the forest\r\nto procure some birch bark for making flambeaux for fishing. The White\r\nThunder secretly followed him. He observed him tie up a roll of bark,\r\nput it across his shoulders, and commence his return. He soon crossed\r\na log which lay in his path. The Indian quickly followed him, mounting\r\nthe same log, and, from this elevation, raised his gun and deliberately\r\nshot him in the back. He fell dead.\r\n\r\nAt _La Pointe_, the party were introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Hall,\r\nmissionaries, who, with Mr. Ayer, had proceeded to this place, in 1831,\r\nto establish a mission among the Chippewas. Mrs. Hall had presented to\r\nher husband a daughter during their residence, which is believed to\r\nbe the first child of white parents, both by father and mother, ever\r\nborn within the precincts of this lake. The mission had encountered no\r\nunforeseen obstacles in its first efforts. It has since been enlarged\r\nin its means and the number of its laborers, and promises to exert a\r\nhappy influence in the region.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe the dawning of the gospel at a spot,\r\nwhich has been long noted as the scene of Indian trade, and the\r\nrallying point of Indian war parties. It is at this place, the\r\nChegoimegon of early writers, that tradition places the ancient\r\ncouncil fire of the Chippewa nation. And here resided the presiding\r\nchief, called Mudjikiwis, or Waishki, who exercised the sovereign\r\npower over a rude confederation of local tribes, whose dissolution, or\r\nseparation into independent fragments, may be traced to the right of\r\neach chieftain of declaring a negative to any decision, and silently\r\nwithdrawing his aid, for the time being. Personal influence and\r\nauthority may be supposed to have counteracted this defect, while\r\nthe tribe was small, as tradition represents it to have been when it\r\nfirst migrated from _the east_, to this lake; but its increase and\r\nspread over the adjacent country, would naturally destroy so feeble a\r\ntie of political power, and must soon have left each local band as it\r\nnow remains, independent and sovereign in its acts. Yet the voice of\r\ntradition refers to this era of the reign of the Mudjikiwis as one of\r\ncomparative splendor. Although republican in all that is left of their\r\ninstitutions, the succession of the Mudjikiwis is said to have been\r\nhereditary among the Chippewas, and the descendants of this magistrate,\r\nwho yet exist at Chegoimegon, evince a pride of ancestry which we\r\nshould only look for, among feudal or despotic nations. The last\r\nperson who may be said to have exercised this office was Mongazid, (or\r\nMamongazida,) who was in high favor with the French. He is represented\r\nto have visited Quebec in the time of Montcalm, and to have been an\r\nactor in the final battle in which that distinguished commander fell.\r\nHis son Wahbojeeg, or the White Fisher, succeeded him as the ruling\r\nchieftain of the band, and eminently distinguished himself as a war\r\nleader. He died in 1793, after having been greatly instrumental in\r\ndriving his cousins-german, the Foxes, from the Chippewa country. The\r\npresent chieftain, Chi Waishki, alias Pizhickee, or the Buffalo, is\r\nthe representative of this line. He said to the Indian Agent, who, by\r\ndirection of the commissioners at the treaty of Fond du Lac, in 1826,\r\ninvested him with a silver medal, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat need I of this! It is known\r\nwhence I am descended.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut there is no space for these reminiscences. Many scattered parties\r\nof Chippewas were encountered east of this point, interspersed with the\r\nloaded boats of the traders, bringing out their annual returns. Some of\r\nthe parties were bound to the British post of Penetanguishine, others,\r\nto St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s or Michilimackinac. Chi Waishki, the chief above alluded\r\nto, was met at Keweena, on his way to visit the Agency. He expressed\r\nhis regret that the agent would not be there, evinced a strong interest\r\nin the object of the expedition, and presented a peace-pipe, as the\r\nevidence of his friendship. At the mouth of the river Brule, a small\r\nparty of the Chippewas was encountered, from the sources of the\r\nMississippi. It turned out to be the family of Ozawindib, one of the\r\nprincipal Chippewas, from Cass Lake. He was persuaded to return, and\r\nproved himself to be a trusty and experienced guide through the most\r\nremote and difficult parts of the route.\r\n\r\nThe expedition entered the mouth of the St. Louis river on the\r\n23d of June. The ascent of this stream is attended with separate\r\nportages of nine, and of three miles. There is, finally, a portage\r\nof six miles across a sandy tract, which separates the Lake Superior\r\nfrom the Mississippi waters, making 18 miles of land carriage. The\r\nother portions of the route consist of rapid water, much of which is\r\nshallow and interspersed with sharp rocks, requiring both strength and\r\ndexterity in the men to manage the canoes, and to repair them when\r\ninjured. A part of the summit portage, immediately after quitting the\r\nSavanne river, consists of bog, the sod of which being cut through,\r\nit becomes necessary to wade in a pathway of mud and water, portions\r\nof which, are mid-thigh deep. The entire distance from Lake Superior\r\nto the Mississippi, estimating from water to water, is 150 miles. The\r\nexpedition spent about ten days on this part of the route, and reached\r\nthe trading house of Mr. Aitkin, on the banks of the Mississippi, on\r\nthe 3rd of July. It remained there, until the evening of the 4th,\r\ngiving Lieut. Allen, who was in command of the troops, an opportunity\r\nto fire a salute in honor of the day, to the no small gratification of\r\nthe Indians, who, being apprized of the occasion, thronged the banks of\r\nthe river to witness the ceremony.\r\n\r\nSandy Lake has been a post of importance in the fur trade from the\r\nearliest French times, being one of the central seats of Indian\r\npower on the Upper Mississippi. An assassination occurred here in\r\n1785, which affords a striking illustration of the evils of using\r\nardent spirits in the Indian country. Mr. Kay, the victim of Indian\r\nresentment on this occasion, was a gentleman of Montreal, who had\r\ncome out with an adventure of Indian goods, into this region. After\r\npassing the winter on the waters of the Mississippi, he awaited the\r\nassembling of his clerks at this place, and employed himself in closing\r\nthe spring business with the Indians, preparatory to his return to\r\nMichilimackinac. On the 2nd of May, he was informed of the near arrival\r\nof one of his clerks, and prepared to go and meet him. The sequel is\r\ngiven in a translation of the words of an eye witness, whose manuscript\r\naccount is before the author.[2]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Kay said that he would himself go, although somewhat fatigued by\r\nthe continual running of the Indians, the night previous. On parting\r\nhe told me to draw some rum, of which he took a stout drink. And as\r\nhe knew there was no rum at the post of Pine river, when he left Mr.\r\nHarris, he thought a dram would be pleasing to him also; for which\r\nreason he told me to fill one of the flagons of his liquor case, to\r\ntake with him. And he gave me orders to give the Indians no drink\r\nduring his absence, which was difficult, because they were already\r\ntipsey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Indians had given me the name of The Writer, which they are\r\naccustomed to do to all whom they observe writing. As soon as Mr. Kay\r\nhad gone, I did not want for visits, his _savagesse_ remaining in\r\nthe tent with me. A great many Indians came in; among the number was\r\nKatawabida and Mongozid, who said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cWriter, give us rum!\xe2\x80\x9d I told\r\nthem that I could not\xe2\x80\x94that I was not master. They tormented me a long\r\ntime. Mongozid threw to me a pair of _metasses_, which he had got on\r\ncredit, and had not paid for, (for he was a poor paymaster,) demanding\r\nrum for them. I told him, no! He then talked with Mr. Kay\xe2\x80\x99s woman, who\r\nwas tired of them, as well as myself. She begged me to give them a\r\nlittle, after which they went out of the tent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithin an hour after _Le Barrique Eau_ arrived, and told me that Mr.\r\nHarris and Mr. Pinot had actually arrived at the fish-dam. The Indians,\r\none and all, set up a shout of joy, and ran to the beach to receive\r\nthem. They did not however, meet with a very good reception, the flagon\r\nMr. Kay had taken with him having intoxicated the whole party. They\r\ndebarked, and while Mr. Harris was getting his tent pitched, Mr. Kay\r\nentered mine and took a glass in my presence. Mr. Harris was quite\r\nnoisy. To complete the scene, the ferocity of _Cul Blanc_[3] (an Indian\r\nunfriendly to Mr. K.) had returned. He had persuaded _Le Cousin_ to\r\nstab Mr. Kay, in the course of the winter, saying to him, that he had\r\nnot courage enough himself to do it. The other gloried in being equal\r\nto the commission of a crime, which he had promised to perpetrate when\r\nthey came together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Cul Blanc was sitting, with many others, on a hillock, before\r\nthe fire, smoking, directly before Mr. Kay\xe2\x80\x99s tent. Le Cousin got up\r\nand went towards the tent, at the entrance of which he met Mr. Kay.\r\nMr. Kay\xe2\x80\x99s bed was placed across, opposite the pole supporting the\r\ntail-piece of his tent. The barrel of rum was behind the bed, in the\r\nbottom of the tent. Mr. Kay saw him coming, as he was going to take\r\na seat beside me on the bed. At this moment Le Cousin entered. He\r\ntendered his hand, and asked for rum. Mr. Kay, who did not like the\r\nman, answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo! You do not pay your credits! You shall have none!\r\nGo out, immediately!\xe2\x80\x9d With this, he took him by the arm, and conducted\r\nhim out of the tent. On turning round to re-enter, the Indian, who\r\nwas armed with a knife, which he had concealed under a _mantelet de\r\ncalmande_, gave him a stab in the back of the neck. He then retired\r\ntowards the camp fire, which was surrounded by a great many Indians and\r\nour men. I got up immediately, hearing the scream of his wife, whom I\r\nperceived in front of me. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you been stabbed?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired of Mr.\r\nKay. \xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he shall pay for it.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying he put his\r\nhand in the mess-basket and drew out a large, pointed table knife, with\r\nwhich he sallied furiously from the tent, without my being able to stop\r\nhim. The Indians seeing the knife in his hand, asked the cause of it.\r\nHe said that Le Cousin had stabbed him, and that he was in search of\r\nhim to kill him. But Le Cousin had taken refuge in his own lodge which\r\nwas near our camp. Mr. Kay went towards the lodge. We ran after him to\r\nprevent some fatal accident. The tumult was, by this time, very great.\r\nGreat numbers were collected from all sides, and all, both French and\r\nIndians, bereft of their reason, for it was in the midst of a general\r\ncarouse. In a moment, every one seized his arms, and there was a motley\r\ndisplay of knives, guns, axes, cudgels, war-clubs, lances, &c. I found\r\nmyself greatly at a non-plus, for I had not before witnessed such\r\na scene. I saw so many preparations that I judged we should have a\r\nserious time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Kay pursued Le Cousin, but before he could reach him, the passage\r\nto his lodge was blocked up by the crowd. Le Cousin\xe2\x80\x99s mother asked him\r\nwhat he wanted. \xe2\x80\x9cEnglishman!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you come to kill me?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nmade her way among the crowd, armed with a small knife, and reached\r\nthe spot where Mr. Kay was standing, without any one\xe2\x80\x99s observing the\r\nknife, for she came in an humble attitude imploring Mr. Kay for the\r\nlife of her son. In a moment, Mr. Kay cried out, in a loud voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nkilled,\xe2\x80\x9d and he fell. We entered, and found that she had struck him in\r\nthe side, making an incision of more than three inches. We now took him\r\nto his tent, bathed in his blood. We laid him on his bed, which in a\r\nmoment, was soaking with his blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this moment his friend _Le Petit Mort_, (Jeebyains) who had been\r\ntipsey and gone to sleep, started up. He ran to Mr. Kay\xe2\x80\x99s tent, where\r\nthe first object he saw, was his friend pale and quivering. He went and\r\nembraced him amidst a flood of tears, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend, you are dead,\r\nbut I survive to revenge you.\xe2\x80\x9d In contemplating a calico night-gown\r\nwhich Mr. Kay had on when he was wounded, and which was all bloody, he\r\ncould no longer restrain his anger. He took up the knife which Mr. Kay\r\nhad, at the time he was wounded, and which had been brought back by\r\nhis wife, who was present. He sallied out of the tent to seek revenge,\r\nnot of Le Cousin,\xe2\x80\x94who was the instrument, but not the author of the\r\nmurder\xe2\x80\x94but of Cul Blanc, who was sitting before the fire, smoking his\r\npipe. He seized him by the scalp-lock, drew his body back with one\r\nhand, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cDie, thou dog!\xe2\x80\x9d with the other hand, he plunged a\r\nknife into his breast, Cul Blanc begging all the while for mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis scene of carnage put a stop to the drinking. The women spilled\r\nout all the rum, of which there was still no small quantity in the\r\ndifferent lodges. The stab Cul Blanc had received did not prove mortal,\r\nnotwithstanding the ghastliness of the wound, the knife having passed\r\nout through the flesh without penetrating any vital part. But the blood\r\nissued copiously and disfigured his wife, who carried him off, trailing\r\nhis blood through the camp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis tragedy being finished, Le Petit Mort re-entered the tent. He\r\ntold his wife, who followed him, to go and search for certain roots,\r\nwhich he chewed and formed into a cataplasm for the wound, after having\r\napplied his mouth to it, and sucked out the extravasated blood, an\r\noperation that caused Mr. Kay great pain. He enjoyed a little ease\r\nduring the remainder of the night and following day. Le Petit Mort\r\npassed the night opposite to his bed. The next day he took off the\r\ncompress, and replaced it by another, after having once more sucked\r\nout the blood and cleaned the wound. The patient became so exhausted\r\nby this dressing, that for the space of half an hour he lost all\r\nrecollection. When he regained his senses he felt easier, and asked for\r\nthe Bras Casse, (the chief of the band,) who had not yet heard what had\r\nhappened, for the Indians had been occupied in drinking, and he had\r\nbeen getting ready to depart, having only delayed a little, to give\r\nsome game to the Frenchmen. He came to the field of these atrocities,\r\nentered Mr. Kay\xe2\x80\x99s tent, and gave him his hand, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend, your\r\nmisfortune has given me much pain. If I had been here, it would not\r\nhave taken place. One thing, however, consoles me. It is, that I had\r\nnot gone off; you may depend on my best efforts to restore you.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nKay accepted his offer, having confidence in him, and in his skill in\r\nthe medical art, in which he was very expert. He resolved to take him\r\nalong with him on his route to Mackinac, to take care of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the third of May, the Bras Casse took him in hand, and began to\r\napply his medicines, which were found to be efficacious. After letting\r\nhim repose a little, he told him he would cure him, but in order to do\r\nthis he must consent to bridle his appetites. He must abstain from the\r\nuse of pepper and salt in his food; he must guard against drinking, _de\r\nne point toucher des femmes_. The next day Mr. Kay was a little better.\r\nHe sent for M. Harris and myself to come to his tent, to receive his\r\norders. He said to us: \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, you see my situation. I do not know\r\nwhether God will spare my life or not. I have determined to leave you,\r\nand at all hazards to set out for Mackinac with seven men, accompanied\r\nby the Bras Casse and his wife, to take care of me on the road. Assort\r\nthe remainder of the goods, and ascend to Leech Lake, and wait there\r\nfor the return of the Pillagers, who are out on the prairies. In short,\r\ncomplete the inland trade. Mr. Pinot is too feeble an opponent to do\r\nyou much injury. I confide in the capacity of you both.\xe2\x80\x9d A few moments\r\nafterwards Mr. Harris went out, when he said to me particularly, taking\r\nhold of my hands\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, you understand the language of the\r\nChippewas. Mr. Harris would go with me, but he must accompany you. He\r\nis a good trader, but he has, like myself and others, a strong passion\r\nfor drinking, which takes away his judgment. On these occasions, advise\r\nhim. I will myself speak to him before my departure. Prepare every\r\nthing to facilitate our passage over the portages and along the lake. I\r\nshall set out to-morrow. I find myself better every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left him with his physician, and went to distribute the provisions\r\nand lading for two inland canoes, one for Mr. Kay, and one for the four\r\nmen who were to take the furs from Pine river, consisting of 19 packs\r\nof 80 lbs. each, and four packs of deer skins, to serve as seats for\r\nMr. Kay\xe2\x80\x99s men. The next day Mr. Kay was a little better, which diffused\r\npleasure among us all. I constructed a litter (_un broncard_) for two\r\nmen to carry him over the portages, and he set out the same day, being\r\nthe 5th of May, about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, in the afternoon. Mr. Pinot also\r\ndeparted the same day. Bras Casse and his wife departed about sun set.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sequel of this tale is briefly told. Mr. Kay reached Mackinac,\r\nwhere Capt. Robinson, then in command, had a second operation performed\r\non him by the post surgeon. He afterwards closed his business, and went\r\nto Montreal. A suppuration of his wound, however, took place at the\r\nLake of Two Mountains, which terminated his life on the 26th of August,\r\n1785, three months and twenty-four days after receiving the wound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  _General arrangements for the route of the expedition on the waters\r\n    of the Upper Mississippi.\xe2\x80\x94The width of this stream at Sandy Lake\r\n    ascertained.\xe2\x80\x94Notices of the ascent from that point by the Falls\r\n    of Peckagama and Lake Winnipec, to Cass Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Attack of a party\r\n    of Mandans on the Chippewas at Pembina.\xe2\x80\x94The route of the\r\n    Bogottowa Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Encamped at Winnipec House.\xe2\x80\x94Inquiries respecting\r\n    the opposition trade, and the traffic in ardent spirits.\xe2\x80\x94Reach\r\n    Cass Lake.\xe2\x80\x94The width of the Mississippi, at its outlet.\xe2\x80\x94Encamped\r\n    on an island in this lake.\xe2\x80\x94Yellow Head\xe2\x80\x99s town; its population and\r\n    hunting grounds.\xe2\x80\x94Remarks on the Fur Trade.\xe2\x80\x94North West, Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n    Bay, and American Fur Companies.\xe2\x80\x94Lord Selkirk\xe2\x80\x99s triumph.\xe2\x80\x94Murder\r\n    of Owen Keveny._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Sandy Lake the expedition made its general arrangements for the\r\nroute. Most of the Indians at that post being absent, with their\r\nprincipal Chief, on the plains near the junction of the Des Corbeau,\r\nit was determined to assemble them at that point, so as to meet the\r\nexpedition on its return down the Mississippi, and to deposit at Sandy\r\nLake House, the presents intended for distribution to this band,\r\ntogether with the supplies required for the home route. These were\r\nplaced in charge of a trusty person, with directions to proceed down\r\nthe river with them, to the Isle Des Corbeau, in season to meet the\r\nparty at that place on the 24th July. Relieved of this portion of the\r\nburthen of transportation, it was then settled that the expedition\r\nshould go up the Mississippi, through all its windings, to Cass Lake;\r\nthere make a final deposit of the remainder of its heavy baggage,\r\nand fit out a select exploring party, in light canoes, to ascend to\r\nits actual source. This point fixed, the party would again descend\r\nto Cass Lake, thence, cross the interior, by a route, represented\r\nto be practicable, to Leech Lake, and from the latter, strike\r\nsouth-westwardly, falling on a series of portages and lakes leading to\r\nthe head of the great Des Corbeau, or Crow Wing River. This river it\r\nwas proposed to follow down its entire length, to its entrance into the\r\nMississippi, the point fixed on, for assembling the Sandy Lake, Pine\r\nRiver, and Mille Lac Indians.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with these arrangements, the party left Sandy Lake House,\r\non the afternoon of the 4th of July, having previously ascertained the\r\nwidth of the Mississippi, at that place, to be 331 feet. The evening\r\nof this day and the two following days, were employed in reaching\r\nthe vicinity of the Peckagama Falls, against a brisk current, with\r\noccasional rapids. They made a portage on the 7th over the Granular\r\nQuartz ridge, producing the Falls, and encamped the same evening at\r\nPoint aux Chenes, in the savannahs above. The next day, being the\r\nSabbath, was passed at that point. While there, a French _engag\xc3\xa9_\r\narrived from Leech Lake, being on his way to Sandy Lake. Advantage was\r\ntaken of this opportunity, to send directions for the hastening the\r\nmeeting of the Indians at _Isle Des Corbeau_, by the space of two days,\r\nas the waters were found even more favorable, than had been anticipated.\r\n\r\nThis man, whose name was La Plante, confirmed reports which had\r\nbeen current at Fond du Lac and at Sandy Lake, of the going out of a\r\nstrong war party of the Leech Lake Indians against the Sioux. But he\r\nadded, that the party, which had been headed by the popular Chief,\r\nAishkibugikozh, or the Geulle Platte, had returned, bringing, as a\r\ntrophy of their victory, three Sioux scalps. He also reported the\r\nattack of a hostile party of Indians, supposed to be Sioux, on the\r\noutskirts of the Pembina settlement, where they scalped a girl, in\r\nopen day, but were pursued by a party of Chippewas, overtaken in the\r\nact of crossing a stream, and lost several men. It was found, by\r\nsubsequent information, of an authentic character, that the attacking\r\nparty, on this occasion, were Mandans, and that it consisted of forty\r\nmen. They crossed the river Pembina, at the point of its junction\r\nwith Red River, on a raft, went down the latter about four miles, and\r\nconcealed themselves in the vicinity of a trading house, at which there\r\nwere several lodges of Chippewas. After waiting a definite time, and\r\nfinding no opportunity to effect their purpose, they resolved to return\r\nto the raft at the crossing of the river, leaving a select party to\r\nmake a sally upon the Chippewas. This party met the girl, tore off\r\nher scalp in haste, and fled to rejoin their companions at the raft.\r\nBut as the girl was not killed, the alarm was immediately given. Nine\r\nChippewas started in the pursuit. They overtook and fired upon the\r\nMandans, killing one man, and driving them in to their main party. The\r\nlatter, in the mean time, had tied their guns together and laid them\r\non the raft, preparatory to crossing. Being suddenly roused by the war\r\nwhoop, in their midst, and without arms, they plunged into the Pembina,\r\nand swam across. During this effort, they were fired upon by their\r\npursuers, who killed two more of their number. One of these succeeded\r\nin gaining the opposite bank, and was carried a short distance by his\r\ncompanions before he expired. His body was left. The remainder of\r\nthe party pursued their flight. But they were without the means of\r\nsubsistence, for they had lost their arms. A new calamity overtook\r\nthem. The Sioux (who were also their enemies, as well as the enemies of\r\nthe Chippewas,) fell upon them, and, in their defenceless state, killed\r\nthirty-six men. The survivor reached his people on the Missouri to\r\nnarrate the disaster.\r\n\r\nThe expedition pursued its way on the 9th. The ascent of this part\r\nof the river, being through a series of savannahs, the guides availed\r\nthemselves of an intimate knowledge of the country, and the high state\r\nof the water, to avoid numerous curves, which would have consumed much\r\ntime in coursing around, and led the way through extensive fields of\r\nreeds and grass, assuming the character of semi-lakes. Not far above\r\nOak Point, a side route was taken, through a lake called the Bogottowa,\r\nor _Lac a le Crosse_. This lake, which is a clear and pleasant sheet of\r\nwater of some ten miles in extent, receives a small but narrow creek\r\nat its head, noted for its helices, which is ascended to a small lake\r\nterminating a few hundred yards east of the Little Winnipec Lake of the\r\nMississippi. The portage is through a fine forest. By taking this route\r\nthe circuitous south bend of the Mississippi, at the entrance of the\r\nLeech Lake branch, was avoided, and the better part of a day\xe2\x80\x99s travel\r\nsaved. Day light was still undiminished, when the party reached the\r\nminor trading post of Winnipec House, where they encamped.\r\n\r\nThe following queries were put to the Clerk in charge of this post,\r\nrespecting the opposition trade, and the traffic in ardent spirits.\r\n\r\n1st. Do the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Clerks cross the American lines from the post\r\nof Rainy Lake, for the purposes of trade? Ans. No. They furnish goods\r\nto Indians who go trading into the American territories.\r\n\r\n2d. Do the Partners, or Clerks of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company, present\r\nflags and medals to Indians? Ans. Yes.\r\n\r\n3d. Do they give such flags and medals to Indians living within the\r\nAmerican lines? Ans. No. I have heard that they took away an American\r\nflag given to an Indian on the United States\xe2\x80\x99 borders of Rainy Lake,\r\ntore it, and burnt it, and gave him a British flag instead.\r\n\r\n4th. Was the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company\xe2\x80\x99s post on Rainy Lake, supplied with\r\nardent spirits last season? (i. e. 1831 and 1832.) Ans. It was. They\r\nhad about sixty kegs of highwines, which were shewn to some of our\r\nIndians, who went there, and Mr. Cameron, the person in charge of the\r\npost, said to them, that although their streams were high, from the\r\nmelting of the snows, they should swim as high with liquor if the\r\nIndians required it.\r\n\r\n5th. What is the usual strength of the highwines? Ans. One keg is\r\nreduced to four.\r\n\r\n6th. Have the Indians sent on _derwin_ by the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company,\r\napproached near to your post? Ans. They have come very near\xe2\x80\x94having been\r\non the Turtle Portage, with goods.\r\n\r\n7th. Did they bring liquor thus far? Ans. No. The liquor is kept at\r\nRainy Lake, to induce the Indians to visit that place with their furs.\r\n\r\n8th. Did the disposition made of the liquor, which the Secretary of War\r\npermitted the principal Factor of the Fond du Lac Department, to take\r\nin last year, (1831,) embrace the post of Winnipec? Ans. It did not.\r\nIt was kept chiefly at Rainy Lake, and on the lines, to be used in the\r\nopposition trade.\r\n\r\nAnother trader, inquired of, in the country below, observed that five\r\nChiefs had been invested with medals and flags, by the British trader\r\nat _Lac le Pluie_.\r\n\r\nThe party traversed Lake Winnipec on the morning of the 10th, and\r\nentered and passed up the sand-hill bordered valley of the Mississippi,\r\nto Cass Lake, the entrance to which they reached about one o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nbeing eleven days earlier in the season than this lake had been\r\nvisited by the light canoes of Gov. Cass, twelve years previous. The\r\noutlet of this lake, was ascertained to be 172 feet in width, with an\r\nestimated depth of eight feet; being over half the width of the river,\r\nimmediately _below_ the inlet of the Sandy Lake branch.\r\n\r\nAt this point, being the _ultima Thule_ of previous discovery,\r\nour narrative may assume a more personal character. The day was\r\ncharacterised by the striking warmth of the month of July in this\r\nlatitude. The fore part of it had been spent in a diligent ascent\r\nof the Mississippi from Lake Winnipec; and the party reached the\r\npoint of entrance, with a feeling of gratification, arising from the\r\naccomplishment of one of its objects. We halted a few moments, to allow\r\nthe hindmost canoes to come up, so as to enter the Lake together. Oza\r\nWindib, or the Yellow Head, our Chippewa guide, had preceded the party\r\na little, as he often did, to get the first glance of little bays and\r\ninlets, where water fowl are usually found. He had put his canoe ashore\r\nbehind a small point, where he met a party of the Cass Lake band. Of\r\nthis he kept us ignorant till turning the same point, that he might\r\nsurprise us with an unexpected salute. The Indians then approached\r\nin their canoes in a body, with a welcome, which could hardly have\r\nbeen more cordial, had we been old friends. They represented their\r\nresidence to be on a large island, bearing south-west from the entrance.\r\nAnd for this island we set forward, with every appliance. The Indians\r\naccompanied us, imparting a spirit of emulation to the men, by shouts\r\nand firing. In making this traverse, we left the mouth of Turtle river,\r\n(the spot of Gov. Cass\xe2\x80\x99 landing in 1820,) on our right, and did not\r\ncome near enough to the shore, distinctly to recognise its features.\r\nWe were upwards of an hour in reaching the island, which is called\r\nGrand Island, or Colcaspi. On approaching it, a number of Indians\r\nwere observed, running across an elevation, and pointing, with wild\r\ngestures, to a bay beyond. It was the best place of landing. They were\r\nassiduous in directing the men to the spot. They ranged themselves\r\nalong the shore, fired a salute, and then came eagerly to the water\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nedge, giving each one a hand, as he alighted from the canoe. He, who\r\nhas formed his estimate of an Indian from the reading of books, in\r\nwhich he is depicted as cruel and morose, without any insight into his\r\nsocial character, need only to be ushered into a scene like this, to be\r\nconvinced that he has contemplated an overshadowed picture. We found\r\nthese Indians to be frank, cheerful, and confiding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASS LAKE\r\n  2978 miles above the Gulf of Mexico.]\r\n\r\nOn ascending the elevation before referred to, it was found to be the\r\nsite of an abandoned village, now covered partially with corn-fields,\r\nand overgrown, in other parts, with sumac and other shrubbery. The\r\ncutting down too much of the forest, and the consequent exposure to\r\nwinds, had probably been their reason for removing the village to\r\na more southerly and sheltered part of the island. An Indian town,\r\nall America over, is nothing but an assemblage of wigwams, built,\r\nexclusively to suit the particular convenience of the occupant, without\r\nright angled streets, for which (as they have no carts or waggons)\r\nthey have no occasion, and they get thereby the additional advantage\r\nof having no clouds of dust blown up from the denuded surface. There\r\nis (as we should say) a public _square_, or rather, an open grassy\r\nspot, where councils and dances are held, and the ceremonies of the\r\nwabeno and medicine society performed. Hillocks and elevated grounds\r\nare selected for erecting their lodges on; and clumps of small trees\r\nand shrubs are sought. Large trees are avoided, for the simple reason,\r\nthat they often loose a limb during windy weather, and are liable to be\r\nblown down by tempests. But the whole circular opening, constituting a\r\ntown plat, is surrounded with forest, to shelter them, in summer and\r\nwinter. Gardens are variously located, and generally without fences, as\r\nthere are no domesticated cattle. Such, at least, was the town of Oza\r\nWindib, situated nearly a mile from the spot of our landing, to which\r\nhe was welcomed, on his return, by groups of men, women, and children.\r\nThe total population, as counted during our stay, was 157, and it does\r\nnot, probably, at any time, exceed 200 or 250. They rely, in the main,\r\non hunting for a subsistence, deriving considerable aid, as the season\r\nshifts, from fishing, the gathering of wild rice, and the products of\r\nsmall fields of corn and potatoes, cultivated by the women. We were\r\nassured that the corn crop was always relied on, and that seed corn\r\nis preserved from year to year, and has not been known to fail. About\r\nsixty miles northwest, at Red Lake, corn is stated by the traders, to\r\nbe a profitable crop, and it is among the singularities of the fur\r\ntrade, that this article has, within a few of the last years, been\r\nfurnished in considerable quantity, from that lake, to the posts on the\r\nUpper Mississippi, and even as far east as Fond du Lac.\r\n\r\nThe hunting grounds of Yellow Head\xe2\x80\x99s band, embrace the extreme sources\r\nof the Mississippi, and his village is the last fixed location in the\r\nascent. Part of them go to Lac Travers, and encamp there, for the\r\npurpose of making the winter hunt. And from this point, they ascend\r\nsoutherly, which carries them still further into the red deer and stag\r\nand hind country of (the absolute head of the Mississippi,) Itasca\r\nLake. The furs and skins collected, are exchanged for goods with\r\ntraders, who visit them annually in the fall, and remain during the\r\nwinter. These goods are brought in canoes from Michilimackinac, an\r\nestimated distance, as travelled, of 1120 miles. Of this distance there\r\nare only 18\xc2\xbe miles land carriage, separated into five portages, at\r\ndistant points.\r\n\r\nWe may observe in this singular facility of internal water\r\ncommunication, one of the primary reasons of the heads of the\r\nMississippi, being supplied with Indian goods at first from Montreal,\r\nand afterwards from New-York. Not only were these facilities early\r\nfound to exist, but it was the track of interior discovery, while\r\nthe Mississippi itself opposed an obstacle to the trade, by its\r\ndifficult navigation, and the unhealthiness of the climate of its lower\r\nlatitudes. Political considerations, also, entered into the earlier\r\narrangements. Indeed, whoever is curious to examine into this matter,\r\nwill find the history of the fur trade in north-western America, to be\r\nintimately blended with the civil history of the country, for about\r\ntwo hundred and fifty years after its discovery. Dating this discovery\r\nfrom the arrival of Jaques Cartier in the gulf of St. Lawrence, in\r\n1534, (the first well settled era,) the traffic then commenced with\r\nthe natives, and, soon assuming an engrossing character, may be traced\r\nthrough various modifications, up to the surrender of the lake posts\r\nto the American government in 1796. This momentous interval of two\r\nhundred and sixty-two years, is fraught with incidents of a deeply\r\ninteresting character, which it will be sufficient here, to allude to.\r\nThrough every change of things the fur trade continued to be, not only\r\ncherished, but formed one of the cardinal interests in the policy of\r\nthe government which France and Great Britain successively exercised\r\nover this portion of North America. Under the French government the\r\nsystem was intimately connected with military and with missionary\r\nefforts, in a manner which was peculiar to that government. Licences\r\nto trade were granted by the governor general to superannuated\r\nofficers, and other servants of the crown, by whom they were sold out\r\nto enterprising individuals. These persons went inland to exchange\r\ntheir goods for furs, and first drew upon themselves the epithet of\r\n_Couriers du Bois_. Great irregularities, however, existed. Civil and\r\necclesiastic power were alternately exerted to restrain them. And an\r\norder to prohibit the traffic in the article of brandy was issued by\r\none of the French governors.\r\n\r\nUnder English rule, local agents were authorised, in the name of the\r\nking, to oversee Indian affairs, grant licences, and exercise a general\r\nsupervision over the trade. Serious difficulties arose in acquiring the\r\nconfidence of the northern Indians after the fall of Quebec. But, after\r\nan interruption of four or five years, (say from \xe2\x80\x9959 to \xe2\x80\x9964,) including\r\nthe period of Pontiac\xe2\x80\x99s war, the trade gradually resumed its healthful\r\naction. French enterprise had spread it through the region of Lake\r\nSuperior and the Upper Mississippi, to the banks of the Saskatchawine.\r\nScottish intrepidity carried it to the mouths of the Mackenzie, and the\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nThe date of American authority in the lake country, may be placed\r\nin 1796. It was, however, but feebly felt in its influence on the\r\nnorthwest fur trade, for several years. Congress first legislated on\r\nthe subject in 1802, but four years afterwards Lieut. Pike, on reaching\r\nthe Upper Mississippi, found it in the exclusive possession of the\r\nNorth West Company. The Indians were then as much attached to the\r\nEnglish, as they had been to the French, in 1759. It cost the British\r\ncrown the expenses of a war to gain this ascendancy, and the Americans\r\nwere not permitted to succeed them, as the sovereign power over Indian\r\nterritory, at a less hazard. The war of 1812, found all the northern\r\ntribes confederated with the English. Tecumseh had risen to re-act the\r\npart which Pontiac had failed to accomplish, fifty-two years before,\r\nnamely, driving back the infringing power. This happened, in 1759, to\r\nbe Great Britain; but in 1812, it was the United States. With less\r\nsterling capacity to organise and command, however, than his great\r\npredecessor had, and with the powerful resources of England to back\r\nhim, he utterly failed. It was not till after this failure, and the\r\nre-establishment of American garrisons at Detroit and Michilimackinac,\r\nthat the Jeffersonian Indian code of 1802, began to be put into effect\r\nin the north-west. In 1816, a law was passed by Congress to exclude\r\nforeigners from the trade. In 1819 St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s was established. In\r\n1820, Gov. Cass personally visited the tribes, and in 1822, a military\r\npost was advanced to St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s Falls, the most northern point occupied\r\nby the United States army.\r\n\r\nAlthough the North West Company had now transferred to an American\r\ncompany, organised by Mr. Astor, all their posts south and west\r\nof the lines of demarcation, they maintained, however, an active\r\ntrade along the lines, and waged one of the most spirited and hard\r\ncontested oppositions against the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company, which has ever\r\ncharacterised a commercial rivalry. Lord Selkirk had now placed himself\r\nat the head of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company, and staked his character and\r\nresources on the maintenance of its territorial and commercial rights.\r\nIt is no part of our object to go into details. Let it suffice, that\r\nhe took Fort William on the 13th of August, 1816, carried his power\r\nover the region of Red river, where he planted a colony, and, after\r\nlosing the lives of several of his most zealous agents and officers,\r\n(including the governor of his colony,) finally triumphed in asserting\r\nthe rights of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company, and quieted, by an amalgamation\r\nof stocks, the claims of his intrepid rivals.\r\n\r\nOne of the most painful atrocities which arose, in the course of this\r\nrivalry, was the murder of Owen Keveny. As the facts were subsequently\r\ndetailed in a court of justice, they may be succinctly narrated. Mr.\r\nKeveny, a gentleman in the service of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company, was\r\ntaken prisoner by the North West Company, in the summer of 1816; and\r\nordered to be sent out from Red river to Montreal. On ascending the\r\nriver Winnipec, (northwest of the Lake of the Woods,) he was finally\r\nput in charge of a couple of _engag\xc3\xa9s_, named Faye and La Point, in a\r\ncanoe, with an Indian guide, called Joseph, Son-of-the-White-Pratridge,\r\nwith directions to take him to Rainy Lake. By these he was landed on\r\nan island below the Dalles, where they slept. Next morning Keveny\r\ncomplained of being ill, and asked Faye to bring him some warm water.\r\nThe latter, on coming to the beach, found that La Pointe, and the\r\nIndian, had put out into the stream. On being called, they came ashore\r\nand took in Faye, and all then went down the river together, abandoning\r\nKeveny on the island. A few days afterwards one of the _engag\xc3\xa9s_ in\r\nthe canoe, quarrelled with the Indian, and the latter left them. They\r\nthen turned about and began to ascend the river, but, having lost their\r\nguide, could not find their way, and soon encamped on a small island,\r\nresolved to wait till some canoe should pass. Four or five days had\r\nelapsed, when their expectations were answered, by the arrival of a\r\nlight canoe, with two partners of the North West Company, and Charles\r\nde Reinhard, a clerk, and a _Boisbrul\xc3\xa8_, named Mainville, besides the\r\nIndian, Joseph, Son-of-the-White-Partridge, who had fled from Faye and\r\nLa Pointe, below. After a short halt, during which Mr. M\xe2\x80\x98Lellan, (a\r\npartner of the North West Company,) beat the two men with a canoe-pole,\r\nall embarked for Rainy Lake. The same day they met other canoes, from\r\nwhich they learned, that Keveny, whose life had been threatened by de\r\nReinhard and others, had left the island, where he was first abandoned,\r\nand gone up the river five or six leagues, to another island situated\r\nabove the Dalles. He was now the subject of engrossing interest and\r\nconversation. On reaching this, they found Keveny, as expected. Mr.\r\nGrant, one of the partners, landed, with others, and shook hands with\r\nhim. They then embarked, leaving de Reinhard, Mainville, and Joseph,\r\nSon-of-the-White-Partridge, on the island with Keveny. After going two\r\nor three leagues further up the river, they encamped. Some time after\r\nlanding, the report of a gun was heard in the direction they came from.\r\nIn half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time, a canoe came from the same direction, having\r\nin it de Reinhard, Mainville, and Joseph, Son-of-the-White-Partridge.\r\nIt had much blood in it, together with the trunks, and clothes worn by\r\nKeveny, but Keveny himself was not there. On examining the coat, there\r\nwas perceived to be a ball hole, and an incision, in different parts\r\nof it. Keveny\xe2\x80\x99s trunks were then landed, unlocked, and a division made\r\nof his clothes, linen, and other effects. De Reinhard wiped the blood\r\nfrom his sword, declaring in the hearing of the men, as if glorying in\r\nthe perpetration of the act, that he had killed him, and was entitled\r\nto the best apparel, which he accordingly appropriated to himself.\r\nMainville took the perforated coat.\r\n\r\nThe facts of this foul deed appeared to be these. Keveny, with the\r\nthree persons left with him, by the Northwest partners, embarked in\r\na small Indian canoe, to ascend the river. He complained of being\r\nunwell, and was landed at a certain spot. De Reinhard, Mainville, and\r\nJoseph, waited at the beach. De Reinhard stood near the canoe as Keveny\r\nre-embarked, and suddenly drawing a short sword, thrust it into his\r\nbody. Keveny doubled down under the blow, but being a tall and powerful\r\nman, (although weakened by disease,) he recovered himself, seized the\r\nblade of the sword, and would have wrenched it away and overpowered the\r\nassassin, had he not called to Mainville to fire. The latter obeyed.\r\nThe ball passed through Keveny\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and he instantly fell. It does\r\nnot seem that the Indian participated in the act. The body was stripped\r\nand left on shore, unburied. Two years after (i. e. 1818,) De Reinhard,\r\nwho had, it seems, been a subaltern officer in one of the disbanded\r\nforeign regiments, was tried for the murder at Quebec, proved guilty,\r\n(by his own confessions to the men at the encampment,) and sentenced to\r\nthe gallows. Mainville escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  _Brief detail of transactions at Cass Lake.\xe2\x80\x94A select exploring\r\n    party is organised here, for ascending to the actual source\r\n    of the Mississippi.\xe2\x80\x94Council with the Indians.\xe2\x80\x94Speech of Oza\r\n    Windib.\xe2\x80\x94The Indians furnish canoes and guides.\xe2\x80\x94Arrangement of the\r\n    party.\xe2\x80\x94Notice of a Warrior\xe2\x80\x99s widow.\xe2\x80\x94Scalp dance.\xe2\x80\x94Facts respecting\r\n    foreign interference in the trade of the Upper Mississippi.\xe2\x80\x94The\r\n    question of the use of ardent spirits in the trade.\xe2\x80\x94Act of\r\n    Congress of 1832, prohibiting it.\xe2\x80\x94Departure of the exploring\r\n    party.\xe2\x80\x94Ascent to Pamitchi Gumaug, or Lac Travers.\xe2\x80\x94Its elevation\r\n    and size.\xe2\x80\x94A Shingaba Wossin.\xe2\x80\x94Image worship.\xe2\x80\x94Bay.\xe2\x80\x94Ultimate forks\r\n    of the Mississippi.\xe2\x80\x94Ascend the east fork.\xe2\x80\x94Lake Marquette.\xe2\x80\x94Lake La\r\n    Salle.\xe2\x80\x94Kubbakunna Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Notices of the Natural History._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving determined to organise a select party at this lake, to explore\r\nthe source of the river, measures were immediately taken to effect\r\nit. A council of the Indians was assembled, and the object declared\r\nto them. They were requested to delineate maps of the country, and to\r\nfurnish the requisite number of hunting canoes and guides. Oza Windib,\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, the country you are going to see, is my hunting\r\nground. I have travelled with you many days.[4] I shall go with you\r\nfarther. I will myself furnish the maps you have requested, and will\r\nguide you onward. There are many rapids in the way, but the waters are\r\nfavorable. I shall consult with my band about the canoes, and see who\r\nwill step forward to furnish them. My own canoe, shall be one of the\r\nnumber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore night the maps were completed, and five different individuals,\r\nincluding Oza Windib, brought each a canoe of the proper size and laid\r\nit down. Two young men expressed their willingness to go, as additional\r\nguides. Seven _engag\xc3\xa9s_ and a cook, were added to this number, making,\r\nwith Lieut. J. Allen, (who declared he could push his men no farther,\r\nDoct. Douglass Houghton, the Reverend Wm. T. Boutwell, Mr. George\r\nJohnston, and myself,) sixteen persons. These, with their travelling\r\nbeds, were distributed among five canoes, with provisions for ten days,\r\na tent and poles, oil cloth, mess basket, tea-kettle, flag and staff,\r\na medicine chest, some instruments, an herbarium, fowling pieces, and\r\na few Indian presents. The detachment of infantry was left in their\r\nencampment on the island, under the command of their non-commissioned\r\nofficer. The remainder of the party, with the baggage and travelling\r\nequipment, was placed in charge of Mr. Le Default, a clerk of one of\r\nthe upper posts of trade, who was attached to the expedition from Fond\r\ndu Lac, and obligingly undertook the acquisition of certain points of\r\ninformation, during the contemplated absence.\r\n\r\nWhile these arrangements were in process, a mixed group of men,\r\nwomen, and children, from the Indian village, thronged our encampment.\r\nAmong them I observed the widow of a Chippewa warrior, who had been\r\nkilled some three or four weeks previous, in the foray of the Leech\r\nLake war party, in the Sioux country. She was accompanied by her\r\nchildren and appeared dejected. I asked one of the Indians the place\r\nof her residence. He replied, here; that her husband had been a brave\r\nwarrior, and went, on the call of the Leech Lake chief, with a number\r\nof volunteers, to join the party. I asked him, of what number the party\r\nconsisted? He replied, about one hundred. Who had led them? The Gueuile\r\nPlatte. Where they had met the enemy? South of the head of Leaf river.\r\nWhat had been the result of the action? They were victorious, having\r\ntaken three scalps on the field, and lost but one, being the husband\r\nof the widow referred to. The action had however, been at long shots,\r\nwith frequent changes of position, and the enemy had finally fled to\r\na village for reinforcement. The Chippewas took this opportunity to\r\nretreat, and, after consultation, returned, bringing back the three\r\nscalps, as memorials of their prowess. These trophies had, we learned,\r\nbeen exhibited in the customary dances at Leech Lake, after which one\r\nof them was forwarded to Oza Windib\xe2\x80\x99s band, to undergo a like ceremony.\r\nAnd it was finally presented to the widow.\r\n\r\nIt was now exhibited by the young men, in her behalf, for a purpose\r\nwhich was certainly new to me. Although I knew that this people were\r\ningenious in converting most circumstances, connected with both\r\nfortune and misfortune, into a means of soliciting alms, I had never\r\nbefore seen the scalp of an enemy employed as a means of levying\r\ncontributions. Such, however, was the purpose for which it was now\r\nbrought forward. It was exhibited with all the circumstances of\r\nbarbarian triumph. Shouts and dancing, intermingled with the sounds\r\nof the rattle, and Indian drum, form the conspicuous traits of such\r\na scene. Short harangues, terminated by a general shout, fill up the\r\npauses of the dance, and at this moment the drums cease. It was an\r\noutcry of this kind that first drew my attention to a neighboring\r\neminence. I observed some of the simple bark enclosures, which mark the\r\nlocality of a Chippewa burial ground. Near them, was erected a sort\r\nof triumphal arch, consisting of bent and tied saplings, from the arc\r\nformed by which, depended an object, which was said to be the remains\r\nof decaying scalps. Around this, was gathered a crowd of dancers,\r\nmoving in a circle. The fresh scalp was suspended from a rod. Every\r\ntime it waved, a new impulse seemed to be given to the shouting. The\r\nwidow and her children were present. And the whole group of spectators,\r\nCanadians as well as Indians, appeared to regard the ceremony with an\r\nabsorbing interest. In the brief pause, which separated each dance,\r\npresents were thrown in. And all that was given was deemed the property\r\nof the widow. This was the scalp dance.\r\n\r\nOther incidents of the sojourn of the expedition on this island will\r\nbe mentioned on the return of the party to it. A few may be added here.\r\n\r\nRepresentations having been made to the Department, on the subject of\r\nforeign interference in the trade of the Upper Mississippi, a number\r\nof queries were addressed to an American trader, well acquainted with\r\nits geography and resources. I inquired of him, whether the American\r\ntraders on that border, were strenuously opposed in their trade by the\r\ninhabitants of the Red river colony, or by the partners and clerks of\r\nthe Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company. He replied that the inhabitants of Pembina,\r\nwere in the habit of making temporary voyages of trade to Voleuse, or\r\nThief river, south of the parallel of forty-nine degrees, but that\r\nthey had not built or made a permanent stand there. He said, that\r\nthe open nature of the country about the Red river settlement, gave\r\ngreat facilities for making short excursions into the Indian country,\r\non horseback and in carts. But he did not know any place to which\r\npermanent outfits had been sent, except the river Souris, west of Red\r\nriver. He believed that this traffic was carried on, exclusively, by\r\nthe inhabitants of the colony and not by the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company.\r\n\r\nI asked him whether the Indians of the Lake of the Woods visited\r\nthe post of Red Lake, and whether our traders were annoyed in their\r\ntrade in that quarter by the servants of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company.\r\nHe replied, that the Lac du Bois Indians came across to Red Lake\r\nordinarily; that it is a three day\xe2\x80\x99s journey; but that no annoyance is\r\nexperienced in the trade of that part from the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay factors.\r\nHe was of opinion that they do not send outfits into any part of the\r\nterritory south or west of the national boundary, beginning at _Portage\r\ndes Rats_ on the Lake of the Woods.\r\n\r\nA quite different aspect was put upon the temper of this opposition\r\nby the Principal of this department of trade, who was met below. He\r\ncomplained of the influence which the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company exert across\r\nthe lines, and the moral character of the means which were resorted\r\nto, to induce the American Indians to go to their posts. He said that\r\nin 1831, (I think) one of his petty clerks had been induced to abscond\r\nwith his outfit, and had been well received by one of the partners\r\nof the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company. On inquiry, I found this clerk to be\r\nMainville, one of the murderers of Keveny. He said that high wines was\r\nthe great power of the supremacy of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company on the\r\nlines, and brought forward the usual arguments of those persons, who\r\neither deem ardent spirits essential to the success of the trade, or\r\njustify its temporary use on the principle of expediency.\r\n\r\nIt may here, in brief, be observed, that all such arguments plausible\r\nas they may appear, are founded on a false principle. They assume the\r\nexistence of an evil, which is alleged to be so fixed, that it is\r\nbetter to tolerate it, than to run the risk of uprooting it; as if it\r\nwere better to submit to a disease, than to attempt its cure, by a\r\nremoval of its causes. No trader, will however, deny the existence of\r\nthe _evil_, as an abstract question. Neither is it denied, that ardent\r\nspirits is a tax upon the trade, in the exact ratio of its entire cost,\r\ndoubled, and trebled, and quadrupled, as this cost is by the expense\r\nof interior transportation. But the question is, \xe2\x80\x9cWho shall begin to\r\ngive up its use?\xe2\x80\x9d This is a question internally, between trader and\r\ntrader, externally, between company and company. As such it has been\r\nbandied between New-York and London, the seats of commercial power.\r\nBut neither side has felt the requisite degree of confidence, to risk\r\nthe experiment of a voluntary arrangement for its entire exclusion\r\n_from the lines_.[5] Congress has terminated this question, so far\r\nas it respects American citizens, by an act of the 9th of July, of\r\nthe present year, (1832,) which contains this provision: \xe2\x80\x9cThat no\r\nardent spirits shall be hereafter introduced, under any pretence, into\r\nthe Indian country.\xe2\x80\x9d The enforcement of this act, has been rigidly\r\nenjoined, and it is in the process of successful execution. Posterity\r\nwill probably regard this measure as reflecting more honor upon our\r\nnational legislation, than if we had decreed a hundred monuments to\r\nfallen greatness. But we are writing a homily, where we intended to\r\noffer a few hints, and must hie to the labor of the journey before\r\nus. Every arrangement being completed on the evening of the 10th,\r\nwe embarked, at the island, at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning. Our\r\ncourse lay westward, through a strait, formed by the approach of a\r\npart of the island, to a part of the main shore. We then passed two\r\nislands, called Garden and Elm islands. The morning was too hazy to\r\ngive us any extensive prospect of the lake, or its shores. We had been\r\na little more than an hour in motion, when we found ourselves nearing\r\nthe western head of the lake, and the men soon shoved our canoes upon\r\na sandy beach, with the exclamation of _un portage_. We found this\r\nportage to extend about fifty yards, over a plain of sand, bearing\r\npine, and terminating on the banks of a small lake. Through this lake\r\nthe Mississippi has its course, and the two lakes are connected by a\r\ncircuitous channel, which might, perhaps, have occupied a half, or\r\nthree quarters of an hour, to ascend. The lake, for which we heard\r\nno name, is several miles in extent. We passed it transversely, and\r\nentered the channel of the river on its western border. It presents a\r\nstill current, with an edging of savannah, which, at no great distance\r\nabove, is again expanded around the margin of another lake, called\r\nTascodiac.[6] Hills of sand, covered with yellow pines, here present\r\nthemselves, and the river exhibits for several miles above, either a\r\nsand bank, or a savannah border. Time is the only measure of distance,\r\nwhich we had the means of referring to. About eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, rapid\r\nwater was encountered, and at this point, which may be fifteen miles\r\nabove Cass Lake, the meadow lands cease. Boulders, of a primitive\r\ncharacter, are found on the rapids. The rapids are such, in their force\r\nand inequality of depth, as to require the men frequently to wade, and\r\npull up the canoes. There are, say, ten of these principal rapids, in\r\nthe ensuing twenty or twenty-five miles, at which distance, we reach\r\nthe most northern point of the Mississippi, which is marked by the\r\nfine expanse of the Pamitchi Gumaug, or Lac Travers. This lake may be\r\nfifty feet above the level of Cass Lake. It is about 12 miles long,\r\nfrom north to south, and six or seven broad, with elevated shores,\r\npresenting to the eye a beautiful vista of hard wood groves.\r\n\r\nWe landed a few moments, on the right hand shore in entering it,\r\nto examine an object, which the men had been conversing of on the\r\nway, namely, a Shingaba Wossin. It proved to be a boulder of gneiss\r\nrock, water worn, so as to present the figure of a rude shaft, with\r\nan entablature, but not exceeding in weight, the maximum of a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstrength. One of the canoe-men lifted it. It had been set up, on its\r\nbase, and was decorated with a ring of red paint. The name may be\r\nfreely translated Image Stone, and has no reference to the composition\r\nof the mass, any farther than that the name is usually found to be\r\napplied to rocks of the primitive kind, both from the liability of\r\nthis class of rocks to assume these forms, and from their hardness,\r\nwhich has enabled them to endure the power of attrition. Offerings are\r\nusually left at such rude altars, and they afford, perhaps, the nearest\r\napproach to idol worship, in its grosser forms, which an examination\r\nof our Indian customs, present. The soil, at this spot, appeared to be\r\nrather rich, bearing a growth of elm, soft maple and white ash.\r\n\r\nWe were an hour in crossing the lake south-westwardly, and were\r\nimpressed with the extent and beauty of the prospect. On gaining the\r\nopposite shore, we found the Mississippi flowing with a brisk and\r\ndeep current into it, and exhibiting a width of, perhaps one hundred\r\nand fifty feet. In landing, a few moments, at this point, we found\r\nthe beach strewed with small shells, both uniones, and helices. A\r\nlog house, used as a winter trading camp, stood a few hundred yards\r\nnorthwardly. And this may be referred to, as the most advanced trading\r\nlocation on the main waters of this river.\r\n\r\nLac Travers is separated by a short channel, from a bay or lake\r\nof moderate dimensions, which is, from its proximity, considered\r\na part of the main lake, although the current of the separating\r\nchannel, indicates the latter to be rather a _river_ than a strait.\r\nIt will be convenient to refer to it, as it is from this point that\r\nthe Mississippi, which has now been pursued to its utmost northing,\r\nis ascended directly south. About four miles above this bay, the\r\nMississippi has its ultimate forks, being formed of an east and\r\nwest branch, of which the west branch is decidedly the largest, and\r\nconsiderably the longest. Reasons indicated by our guide, induced him\r\nto conduct us up the east branch, which we soon found expanded into a\r\nsmall lake, denoted Marquette, and not far above, into another, denoted\r\nLa Salle. We were twenty-four minutes in passing through the last, and\r\non leaving it, found the stream strikingly diminished in volume, with a\r\nlimited depth, and a vegetation of a more decidedly alpine character.\r\nAbout four miles above the latter, the stream expands into a lake some\r\nsix or seven miles in length, and about half that distance in width.\r\nThis lake, which is called Kubbakunna, The Rest in the Path, presented\r\na pleasing aspect, after the sombre vegetation, we had passed below.\r\nRushes, however, were abundant toward its head, and we found the\r\nground too low and wet for encamping. After ascending the river, for a\r\ndistance, we put ashore for the night, at a point of woods extending\r\ninto the marsh-land, constituting the river margin. The soil at this\r\nplace, appeared to be of the most frigid character. A carpet of moss\r\ncovered it, which the foot sank deep into, at every step. The growth\r\nwas exclusively small grey pine, with numerous dead branches below, and\r\nstrikingly festooned with flowing moss. Nearer the margin of the river,\r\nalder, tamarack, and willow, occupied the soil. As night approached it\r\ncommenced raining, which served to add to the natural gloom of the spot.\r\n\r\nNotices of the natural history of the country, during this day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njourney are meagre. The principal growth of forest trees, out of the\r\nimmediate valley, is pine. The plants appear to present little variety,\r\nand consist of species peculiar to moist, cold, or elevated situations.\r\nWater fowl are abundant, and were frequently shot. Among the number\r\nbrought in from the different canoes, in the evenings, were the duck\r\nand mallard, wood-duck, and saw-bill. One of the latter species, had a\r\nunio firmly attached to its lower mandible, having been in the act of\r\nopening it when shot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  _Ascent of the east fork of the Mississippi, from Kubbakunna Lake\r\n    to the Naiwa rapids.\xe2\x80\x94Its productions.\xe2\x80\x94Indians kill a deer; their\r\n    mode of dissecting it.\xe2\x80\x94Reach the foot of Naiwa rapids.\xe2\x80\x94The\r\n    Naiwa portage.\xe2\x80\x94Copper-head snake.\xe2\x80\x94Zoned agate.\xe2\x80\x94Journey from\r\n    thence to Ossowa Lake, the source of this branch of the\r\n    Mississippi.\xe2\x80\x94Mistake in the latitude.\xe2\x80\x94Portage from the east to\r\n    the west branch.\xe2\x80\x94Hauteur des Terres.\xe2\x80\x94The height of land between\r\n    the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay and Gulf of Mexico waters.\xe2\x80\x94Geographical notices\r\n    of its extent.\xe2\x80\x94Its natural productions.\xe2\x80\x94Its geology.\xe2\x80\x94Arrival at\r\n    Itasca Lake._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe resumed the ascent at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, (12th.) The\r\ncourse of this branch of the river, above the Kubbakunna Lake,\r\nresembles a thread wound across a savannah valley. A species of coarse\r\nmarsh-land grass, covers the valley. Clumps of willow fringe this\r\nstream. Rushes and Indian reed are gathered in spots most favorable\r\nto their growth. The eye searches in vain, for much novelty in the\r\nvegetation. Wherever the stream touches the solid land, grey pine,\r\nand tamarack are conspicuous, and clumps of alder here take the place\r\nof willow. Moss attaches itself to almost every thing. And there is\r\na degree of dampness and obscurity in the forest, which is almost\r\npeculiar to the region. Water fowl seem alone to exult in their\r\nseclusion, and evince the infrequency of intrusion by flying a short\r\ndistance, and frequently alighting within gun-shot.\r\n\r\nAfter we had gone on a little more than an hour, the Indian in the\r\nbow of the forward canoe, fired at, and killed a deer. We all landed\r\nto look at the animal. Although fairly shot through the fore part of\r\nthe body, it ran several hundred yards before it fell. The Indian\r\ntraced it by its blood, and found it quite dead. He brought it to the\r\nbanks of the river, before skinning it. We stood in astonishment at\r\nthe dexterity with which this operation was performed. In a very few\r\nminutes it was disrobed of its skin, quartered and dissected. The owner\r\npresented me the quarters. He gave the _moze_ to our guide. This term\r\ncomprehends all parts of the carcass except the four quarters, head\r\nand entrails. Nothing was, however, thrown away; and we had occasion,\r\nat night to observe, that the aid of fire enables them, with very\r\nlittle of the culinary art, to despatch those parts of the animal,\r\nwhich, it might be inferred, were most in need of preparation. Signs of\r\nthis animal were frequently seen, and had the objects of the journey\r\npermitted delay, it might have been often killed.\r\n\r\nOur progress through the savannahs, was rendered more unpleasant than\r\nit would otherwise have been, by frequent showers of rain, which gave,\r\nas is usual, a peculiar activity and virulence to the musquito. When\r\nthe usual hour of landing for breakfast had arrived, the banks were too\r\nmarshy to admit of it, and we went on until a quarter past twelve. We\r\nthen again renewed a labor with little variety of incident.\r\n\r\nAt half past five we came to an elevated sand-hill on the right shore,\r\ncovered with yellow pine, and presenting a naked face towards the\r\nriver. As one of the canoes required mending, I directed the men to\r\nland at this spot, for that purpose. Oza Windib, who was a little in\r\nthe rear, at the moment, said, on coming up, that we were within a few\r\nhundred yards of the junction of the Naiwa, the principal tributary\r\nof this fork; that a series of rapids commenced at that point, which\r\nwould render it necessary to make a portage the whole extent of them,\r\nand that it was better to commence the portage at this place, as the\r\nriver so ran, that we might go directly back through the forest, and\r\nstrike its channel. He said that the Naiwa, which came in on the left,\r\nwas a stream of considerable length, and originated in a lake which\r\nwas infested by copper-head snakes, to which its name has reference. I\r\nobserved that the soil at this place was of a diluvian character, and\r\nembraced pebbles, and small boulders of syenite, trap rock, and quartz,\r\nand other debris of primitive and secondary rocks. One of the party\r\npicked up a well characterised piece of zoned agate.\r\n\r\nWhile the mending of the canoes was in progress, the baggage was put\r\nin portable order, and as soon as all was ready, the men moved on\r\nwith the canoes and effects, which were so arranged that all could be\r\ncarried at one load, and it did not require them to go back. This was\r\na point originally kept in view, in the curtailment of the baggage\r\nat the island, and it was an object of the highest importance to the\r\nspeed and success of the trip. Each canoe and its apparatus, with some\r\nof the lighter pieces was carried by one man. The guide led off the\r\nmen, with no slight burden on his own shoulders, first scrambling up\r\nthe sandy acclivity, and then striking through a growth of scrub oak\r\nand pines. The showers of the morning had so thoroughly wet the grass\r\nand shrubbery, that a few moments walking through it, was sufficient\r\ncompletely to saturate both pantaloons and stockings. I walked out a\r\nfew hundred yards from the trail, towards the left which brought me\r\ninto the curve of the river, in view of the rapids. There appeared\r\nto be a series of small rapids, with intervening shallows. The noise\r\nof falling water and the white wreaths of foam, induced me to think\r\nthere might be distinct falls, but I could discern nothing entitled to\r\nthe name. The average descent of the river, at this series of rapids,\r\nappeared to be, however, considerable, and might perhaps be estimated\r\nat forty-eight feet. I rejoined the party at the spot they had selected\r\nfor their first pause, somewhat to their relief, probably, as guns\r\nhad been fired by them, under the belief of my having missed the way.\r\nWe first came in sight of the river again, on the brow of an elevated\r\nsand-hill, precipitous towards the water. The guide halted to inquire\r\nwhether it would not be preferable to encamp at this spot, as we\r\nshould suffer less from insects than if we encamped in the valley of\r\nthe river, at the termination of the portage. As the day light was not\r\ngone, and some distance still remained, I deemed it better to go on,\r\nthat we might have nothing to do in the morning, but to put our canoes\r\nin the water. On reaching the bank of the stream, we found its current\r\nplacid, and our guide informed us that we had now surmounted the last\r\nrapids.\r\n\r\nA fog prevented our embarking until five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning,\r\n(13th) and it was then impossible to discern objects at a distance. We\r\nfound the channel above the Naiwa, diminished to a clever brook, more\r\ndecidedly marshy in the character of its shores, but not presenting\r\nin its plants or trees, any thing particularly to distinguish it from\r\nthe contiguous lower parts of the stream. The water is still and\r\npond-like. It presents some small areas of wild rice. It appears to be\r\na favorite resort for the duck and teal, who frequently rose up before\r\nus, and were aroused again and again by our progress. An hour and a\r\nhalf diligently employed, brought us to the foot of Ossowa Lake. We\r\nhalted a moment to survey it. It exhibits a broad border of aquatic\r\nplants, with somewhat blackish waters. Perch abound in it. It is the\r\nrecipient of two brooks, and may be regarded as the source of this fork\r\nof the Mississippi. We were precisely twenty minutes in passing through\r\nit. We entered one of the brooks, the most southerly in position. It\r\npossessed no current and was filled with broad leaved plants, and a\r\nkind of yellow pond-lily. We appeared to be involved in a morass, where\r\nit seemed equally impracticable to make the land, or proceed far by\r\nwater. In this we were not mistaken; Oza Windib soon pushed his canoe\r\ninto the weeds and exclaimed, _Oma, mikunna_, (here is the portage.) A\r\nman who is called on for the first time, to debark, in such a place,\r\nwill look about him to discover some dry spot to put his feet upon. No\r\nsuch spot however existed here. We stepped into rather warm pond water,\r\nwith a miry bottom. After wading a hundred yards, or more, the soil\r\nbecame firm, and we soon began to ascend a slight elevation, where the\r\ngrowth partakes more of the character of a forest. Traces of a path\r\nappeared here, and we suddenly entered an opening affording an eligible\r\nspot for landing. Here our baggage was prepared for the portage. The\r\ncarbonaceous remains of former fires, the bones of birds, and scattered\r\ncamp poles, proved it to be a spot which had previously been occupied\r\nby the Indians. The prevailing growth at this place, is spruce, white\r\ncedar, tamarack and grey pine. We here breakfasted.\r\n\r\nHaving followed out this branch of the Mississippi to its source, it\r\nmay be observed, that its existence, as a separate river, has hitherto\r\nbeen unknown in our geography. None of the maps indicate the ultimate\r\nseparation of the Mississippi, above Cass Lake, into two forks. Little\r\nsurprise should therefore be manifested that the latitude of the head\r\nof this stream, is found to be incorrect. It was not however to be\r\nexpected that the inaccuracy should be so great as to place the actual\r\nsource, an entire degree south of the supposed point. Such however is\r\nthe conclusion established by present observations.\r\n\r\nThe portage from the east to the west branch of the river, is\r\nestimated to be six miles. Beginning in a marsh, it soon rises into a\r\nlittle elevation of white cedar wood, then plunges into the intricacies\r\nof a swamp matted with fallen trees, obscured with moss. From this,\r\nthe path emerges upon dry ground. It soon ascends an elevation of\r\noceanic sand, having boulders, and bearing pines. There is then\r\nanother descent, and another elevation. In short, the traveller now\r\nfinds himself crossing a series of deluvial sand ridges, which form\r\nthe height of land between the Mississippi Valley and Red River. This\r\nridge, is locally denominated Hauteur des Terres where it is crossed\r\nin passing from Lac Plaie to Ottertail Lake, from which point it\r\nproceeds northward, separating the tributaries of the River des Corbeau\r\nfrom those of Red River. It finally subtends both branches of the\r\nMississippi, putting out a spur between the east and west fork, which\r\nintersects the portage, crosses the west or Itascan fork about the\r\npoint of the Kak\xc3\xa1bikonce, or Little Rock Falls, and joining the main\r\nridge, passes northeastwardly of Lac Travers and Turtle Lake, and is\r\nagain encountered in the noted portage path from Turtle Lake to Red\r\nLake. It is, in fine, the table land between the waters of Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay\r\nand the Mexican Gulf. It also gives rise to the remotest tributaries of\r\nthe river St. Louis, which, through Lake Superior and its connecting\r\nchain, may be considered as furnishing the head waters of the St.\r\nLawrence. This table land, is probably, the highest in North-western\r\nAmerica, in this longitude.\r\n\r\nIn crossing this highland, our Indian guide, Oza Windib, led the way,\r\ncarrying one of the canoes, as his portion of the burden. The others\r\nfollowed, some bearing canoes, and others baggage. The whole party\r\nwere arranged in Indian file, and marched rapidly a distance\xe2\x80\x94then put\r\ndown their burthens a few moments, and again pressed forward. Each of\r\nthese stops is called a _pos\xc3\xa8_ by the voyageurs, and is denominated\r\nOpugid-jiwunon, or a place of putting down the burthen, by the Indians.\r\nThirteen of these rests, are deemed the length of the portage. The\r\npath is rather blind, and requires the precision of an Indian eye to\r\ndetect it. Even the guide was sometimes at a loss, and went forward\r\nto explore. We passed a small lake occupying a vale, about midway of\r\nthe portage, in canoes. The route beyond it, was more obstructed with\r\nunderbrush. To avoid this, we waded through the margins of a couple\r\nof ponds, near which we observed old camp poles, indicating former\r\njournies by the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe weather was warm and not favorable to much activity in bird or\r\nbeast. We saw one or two species of the falco, and the common pigeon,\r\nwhich extends its migrations over the continent. Tracks of deer were\r\nnumerous, but travelling without the precaution required in hunting,\r\nwe had no opportunity of seeing this animal on the high grounds. It\r\nwas observed in the valleys of the river, on both branches. Ripe straw\r\nberries were brought to me, by the men, at one of the resting places.\r\nI observed a very diminutive species of the raspberry, with fruit, on\r\nthe moist grounds. Botanists would probably deem the plants few, and\r\ndestitute of much interest. Parasitic moss is very common to the forest\r\ntrees, and it communicates a peculiar aspect to the grey pine, which is\r\nthe prevailing growth on all the elevations.\r\n\r\nTo the geologist, the scene is one of interest. The boulders of\r\ngranite, and other primitive strata, occurring on the surface, remind\r\nhim of the original position of these masses, in the system of nature\r\nand indicate revolutions affecting the earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface, which have\r\nwidely changed both the position and form of these solid materials.\r\nWhen the soil itself is examined, it adds further evidences of such\r\nchanges. We may refer its sand to consolidated strata of this mineral\r\nwhich have been broken down by oceanic action, and distributed in\r\nthe remarkable ridges and elevations, which now characterise the\r\nface of the country. In whatever light the subject is viewed, it\r\nseems difficult to resist the conclusion, that water has been the\r\ncause, under providence, in effecting these changes, and that the\r\nhighest grounds in this region, have been subjected to the peculiar\r\ninfluence which this element alone exerts in the work of attrition\r\nand deposition of strata, solid or diluvial. It might be interesting\r\nto inquire, in what manner this agent of change was withdrawn, and\r\nwhether a current was created toward either of the cardinal points. It\r\nwould aid this inquiry to observe, in which direction the debris and\r\nsoils were deposited in the heaviest masses? How far granite boulders\r\nhad been carried from their beds? And whether wood, bones, and other\r\norganic remains had been subjected to like removals? We think these\r\naccumulations are abundantly witnessed in casting the eye down the\r\nMississippi valley, with a measured decrease in the size and weight\r\nof the pulverised masses, in proceeding from the head to the mouth of\r\nthis river. It is thus evident, that the heaviest boulders are found\r\non its upper branches, while they become rare in its central plains,\r\nand disappear altogether, long before its entrance into the deltas at\r\nits mouth. And this remark may be coupled with the accounts given by\r\ntravellers of the bleak, and denuded, and sterile character of the\r\nnorthern rock formations.\r\n\r\nBut we have no leisure to devote to this investigation, and must\r\nproceed with the narrative that is before us. Every step we made in\r\ntreading these sandy elevations, seemed to increase the ardor with\r\nwhich we were carried forward. The desire of reaching the actual source\r\nof a stream so celebrated as the Mississippi\xe2\x80\x94a stream which La Salle\r\nhad reached the mouth of, a century and a half (lacking a year) before,\r\nwas perhaps predominant; and we followed our guide down the sides\r\nof the last elevation, with the expectation of momentarily reaching\r\nthe goal of our journey. What had been long sought, at last appeared\r\nsuddenly. On turning out of a thicket, into a small weedy opening, the\r\ncheering sight of a transparent body of water burst upon our view. It\r\nwas Itasca Lake\xe2\x80\x94the source of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ITASCA LAKE\r\n\r\n(the source of the Mississippi River, 3160 miles from the Balize.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  _Outlines of Itasca Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Its scenery and productions.\xe2\x80\x94Forest\r\n    trees, deer, fish, shells.\xe2\x80\x94Width of its outlet.\xe2\x80\x94Altitude above\r\n    the ocean.\xe2\x80\x94Length of the Mississippi.\xe2\x80\x94Its course above Cass\r\n    Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Its origin south of latitude 47 deg. 16 minutes.\xe2\x80\x94General\r\n    observations on the Mississippi.\xe2\x80\x94Erect a flag on the island\r\n    in Itasca Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Commence the descent of the West, or Itascan\r\n    branch of the Mississippi.\xe2\x80\x94Character of its channel.\xe2\x80\x94Rapids and\r\n    plateaux.\xe2\x80\x94Falls of Kak\xc3\xa1bikons.\xe2\x80\x94Portage.\xe2\x80\x94Encamp at Pine Banks._\r\n\r\n\r\nItasca Lake, the _Lac la Biche_ of the French, is, in every respect,\r\na beautiful sheet of water, seven or eight miles in extent, lying\r\namong hills of diluvial formation, surmounted with pines, which\r\nfringe the distant horizon, and form an agreeable contrast with the\r\ngreener foliage of its immediate shores. Its greatest length, is from\r\nsouth-east to north-west, with a southern prolongation, or bay, which\r\nreceives a brook. The waters are transparent and bright, and reflect\r\na foliage produced by the elm, lynn, maple, and cherry, together with\r\nother species more abundant in northern latitudes. The lake itself is\r\nof irregular form, which will be best illustrated by the accompanying\r\nsketch. It has a single island, upon which we landed, after an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npaddling from the spot of our arrival and embarkation. We found here,\r\nthe forest trees above named growing promiscuously with the betula and\r\nspruce. The bones of fish and of tortoise, found at the locality of\r\nformer Indian camp fires, indicate the existence of these species in\r\nthe lake. We observed a deer, standing in the margin of the lake. And,\r\nhere, as well as throughout the lakes of the region, found the duck,\r\nteal and loon, in possession of their favorite seclusions. Innumerable\r\nshells, (a species of small helix,) were driven up on the head of the\r\nisland. Other parts of the lake yield small species of the unio, which\r\nwere found strewing the bed of the outlet. And it may here be remarked,\r\nthat this shell exists, in the largest and heaviest species heretofore\r\nknown, in the lower parts of this stream\xe2\x80\x94the Mississippi having its\r\norigin here.\r\n\r\nThe outlet of Itasca Lake, is perhaps ten to twelve feet broad, with\r\nan apparent depth of twelve to eighteen inches. The discharge of water\r\nappears to be copious, compared to its inlet. Springs may, however,\r\nproduce accessions which are not visible, and this is probable both\r\nfrom the geological character of the country, and the transparency and\r\ncoolness of the water.\r\n\r\nThe height of this lake, above the sea, is an object of geographical\r\ninterest, which, in the absence of actual survey, it may subserve\r\nthe purposes of useful inquiry, to estimate. From notes taken on the\r\nascent, it cannot be short of one hundred and sixty feet above Cass\r\nLake. Adding the estimate of 1330 feet, submitted in 1820, as the\r\nelevation of that lake, the Mississippi may be considered to originate\r\nat an altitude of 1490, say 1500 feet, above the Atlantic. Its length,\r\nassuming former data as the basis, and computing it, through the\r\nItascan, or west fork, may be placed at 3160 miles, one hundred and\r\neighty-two of which, comprises an estimate of its length above Cass\r\nLake. Its general course, in _ascending_, above the latter point, is\r\nnorth of west, as far as Lac Travers. Then south to its primary forks\r\nwhich is continued, following up the east fork to Kubbakunna Lake,\r\nand for some distance further. It then varies a short distance, north\r\nand north-west, then south-west and south, and finally south-west, to\r\nits main source in Ossowa Lake. The portage thence to Itasca Lake,\r\nis west south-west. Both these lakes appear to rise in springs, on\r\nthe height of land. They are separated by about six miles of country.\r\nTheir latitude, we had no means of accurately determining. From daily\r\nnotes of the courses and distances, kept by Lieut. J. Allen, as\r\nindicated by a compass and watch, their position is, however, shown to\r\nbe _south-west_, and not, as heretofore supposed, _northwest_, of Cass\r\nLake. They are, in fact, a little south of west from Leech Lake, which\r\nis placed, on our best maps, in forty-seven degrees sixteen minutes.\r\nThe highest northing attained by the Mississippi, is on the great\r\ndiluvial plateau, containing the contiguous waters of Lakes La Salle,\r\nMarquette and Travers, which cannot vary more than a few minutes, from\r\nforty-eight degrees. These facts will explain the error of the elder\r\ngeographical writers, who supposed that the parallel of forty-nine\r\ndegrees would intersect the Mississippi. Its origin in the remote and\r\nunfrequented area of country between Leech Lake and Red river, probably\r\nan entire degree of latitude south of Turtle Lake, which still figures\r\non some of our maps as its _source_, throws both the forks of this\r\nstream out of the usual route of the fur trade, and furnishes, perhaps\r\nthe best reason why its actual sources have remained so long enveloped\r\nin obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi river traverses more degrees of latitude than any\r\nother river in America, and the remark might, perhaps, be extended\r\nto the habitable globe. The extremes of its changes in climate and\r\nvegetable productions, are, consequently, very great. It occupies more\r\nthan three thousand miles of the distance between the arctic circle\r\nand the equator. Long as it is, however, it has a tributary longer\r\nthan itself, (the Missouri.) Like the Niger, its mouth was discovered\r\nby expeditions down its current, but unlike that stream, which has so\r\nlong held the geographical world in suspense, its sources have been\r\nalso sought from its central parts. Its entire course is, at length,\r\nknown. And we may now appeal with full certainty to the Balize and to\r\nItasca Lake, as its most extreme points. At the latter, it is a placid\r\nbasin of transparent spring water. At the former, it is as turbid as\r\nearth in suspension can make it, and carries a forest of floating trees\r\non its bosom. Below the junction of its primary forks, it expands at\r\nvery unequal distances, into eight sheets of clear water, each of which\r\nhas features worthy of admiration. Four of these, Lac Travers, Cass\r\nLake, Winnepec, and Lake Pepin, are lakes of handsome magnitude, and\r\nstriking scenery. The number of its tributaries of the first, and the\r\nsecond and the third class, is so large, that it would furnish a labor\r\nof some research, to determine it. The Missouri, the Ohio, and the\r\nArkansas, are of the noblest class. Whoever has stood at the junction\r\nof these streams, as the writer has done, must have been impressed with\r\nan idea of magnitude and power, which words are incapable of conveying.\r\nThe broadest parts of its channel lie in the central portions of its\r\nvalley. Its depth is great in all its lower parts, and increases as it\r\nflows on to the Gulf, and its general descent and velocity are such\r\nas to appear very striking characteristics.[7] Noble views arrest\r\nthe eye of the observer, in every part of its diversified course.\r\nOriginating in a heavy and extensive bed of diluvial soil, superimposed\r\nupon primitive strata, it soon wears its channel down to the latter,\r\nand after running over them for several hundred miles, plunges at\r\nlength, at the Falls of St. Anthony, over the carboniferous limestone\r\nformation, which is so prevalent and so valuable for its mineral\r\ndeposits, below that point. This is finally succeeded by diluvial and\r\nalluvial banks, the latter of which are semi-annually enriched by fresh\r\ndeposits, and exhibit a delta as broad and as exuberant as the Nile.\r\nLike the latter, it has its cataracts in the Falls of St. Anthony and\r\nPukaigama, and in numerous lesser leaps and cascades, where its current\r\nis tossed into foam and threatens destruction to the navigation.\r\nSuch are its physical traits, and there is enough in their character,\r\nmagnitude, and variety to lead our contemplations irresistibly \xe2\x80\x9cthrough\r\nnature up to nature\xe2\x80\x99s God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving gratified our curiosity in Itasca Lake, we prepared to leave\r\nthe island, but did not feel inclined to quit the scene without leaving\r\nsome memorial, however frail, of our visit. The men were directed to\r\nfell a few trees at the head of the island, thereby creating an area,\r\nfor the purpose of erecting a flag staff. This was braced by forked\r\nstakes, and a small flag hoisted to its place. Taking specimens of the\r\nforest growth of the island, of a size suitable for walking canes, and\r\nadding its few species to our collections of plants and conchology, we\r\nembarked on our descent. The flag which we had erected continued to be\r\nin sight for a time, and was finally shut out from our view by a curve\r\nof the lake. We found this curve drawn out in such a manner as to form,\r\nwith the opposite shore, the channel of the outlet. We soon felt our\r\nmotion accelerated by a current, and began to glide, with velocity,\r\ndown a clear stream with a sandy and pebbly bottom, strewed with\r\nshells and overhung by foliage. Ten feet would, in most places, reach\r\nfrom bank to bank, and the depth would probably average over a foot.\r\nThe water was not, however, equally distributed. A strong and winding\r\nchannel, made it a labor of active watchfulness for the canoe-men, to\r\nkeep our frail vessels from being dashed against boulders, or torn in\r\npieces by fallen timber or overhanging trees. Chopping with the axe,\r\nwas frequently necessary to clear the passage, and no small labor was\r\nimposed by getting through the drift wood, piled up at almost every\r\nsudden bend. We were almost imperceptibly drawn into a series of\r\nrapids and petty falls where the stream was more compressed, and the\r\nwater deepened; but the danger rendered tenfold greater by boulders of\r\nblackened rocks, and furious jets of the stream. We were rather hurled\r\nthan paddled through these rapid passes, which increased in frequency\r\nand fury as we advanced. After being driven down about twelve miles of\r\nthis species of navigation, during which the turns are very abrupt,\r\nthe river displays itself, so to say, in a savannah valley, where the\r\nchannel is wider and deeper, but equally, or more circuitous, and\r\nbordered with sedge and aquatic plants. This forms the first plateau.\r\nIt extends eight or nine miles. The river then narrows and enters\r\nanother defile, beset with an almost continued series of rapids. The\r\nsensation, in going down these, where the channel is free from stones,\r\ncan be compared to nothing so aptly, as the emotion which every one has\r\nfelt as the enterprise of youth has buoyed him up, in directing his\r\ntiny sled down a snow covered declivity. The brevity of the emotion\r\ntakes away nothing from the truth of the comparison. The frowing rock,\r\noften rears its dark head to dispute the passage, and calls for the\r\nexertion of every muscle, in the canoe-men, to avoid, by dexterity of\r\nmovement, a violent contact. Often it became necessary for them to step\r\ninto the channel, and lead down the canoes, where the violence of the\r\neddies made it impracticable otherwise to guide them. At a place called\r\nKak\xc3\xa1bikons, or the Little-rock falls, we made a short portage. Two of\r\nthe canoes, however, made the descent, but not without imminent peril,\r\nand a delay eventually greater, than if they had been carried across\r\nthe portage. We descended this second series of rapids a distance of\r\nabout nine miles, and encamped, at a late hour, on a high fine bank,\r\nhaving come altogether about thirty-two miles below Itasca Lake.\r\nWearied with the continued exertion, the frequent wettings, and the\r\nconstant anxiety, sleep soon overshadowed the whole party, \xe2\x80\x9cwith his\r\ndowny pinions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  _Continuation of the descent.\xe2\x80\x94Velocity of the rapids.\xe2\x80\x94One of the\r\n    canoes is upset, and its contents carried over the falls.\xe2\x80\x94Notices\r\n    of the vegetation and zoology.\xe2\x80\x94Fork-tailed hawk.\xe2\x80\x94A novel species\r\n    of lizard.\xe2\x80\x94The Yellow Head\xe2\x80\x99s failure in hunting.\xe2\x80\x94Instinct\r\n    of the saw-billed duck in preserving its young.\xe2\x80\x94The river\r\n    continues to exhibit a succession of rapids and plateaux, during\r\n    its passage through the alpine region.\xe2\x80\x94Purity and frequency\r\n    of springs on its banks.\xe2\x80\x94Influx of the Cano and Piniddiwin\r\n    rivers.\xe2\x80\x94Notice of an inroad and murder committed by the Sioux\r\n    in former years.\xe2\x80\x94A night descent.\xe2\x80\x94Some of its incidents.\xe2\x80\x94Reach\r\n    the junction of the east and west forks.\xe2\x80\x94Return to Cass\r\n    Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Observance of the Sabbath.\xe2\x80\x94Missionary field of labor in the\r\n    northwest.\xe2\x80\x94Superstitions and idolatry of the Indians.\xe2\x80\x94Their name\r\n    for the Deity.\xe2\x80\x94Its probable derivation._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were in motion again a little before five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, in the morning,\r\n(14th.) The rapids continued. The branches of large trees often hung\r\nso near to the water, that if we were not in peril of being entangled,\r\nlike the jewish rebel king, we were in a more continual danger of\r\nhaving every moveable article swept from the canoes. An accident\r\noccurred to one of the canoes, about six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, which\r\nmight have had a fatal termination. My men had paused a few moments at\r\nthe head of a formidable rapid, to determine the best place of going\r\ndown it. Lieut. Allen, who, with his canoe, was behind at the moment,\r\nsoon came up. His bowsman caught hold of my canoe to check his own\r\nvelocity. It produced that effect, but the stern of his canoe swung\r\nacross the stream, so that the steersman caught hold of a branch to\r\nprevent its being carried broadside over the rapid. Being thus rendered\r\ntense between bank and bank, the velocity of the water poured over\r\nthe gunnel, and it was instantly reversed, with all its contents.\r\nThis whole occurrence could not have occupied half a minute. It was\r\nimpossible to render assistance, and Mr. Allen was hardly conscious\r\nof the matter, till he found himself in the stream. With no little\r\nexertion, he recovered himself, so as to be able to keep his feet,\r\nagainst the pressure of the current. The water was breast high. The\r\ncanoe-compass was irrecoverably lost. He fetched up his fowling piece\r\nhimself. Other articles went over the falls.\r\n\r\nThe character of the stream, made this part of our route a most rapid\r\none. Willing or unwilling we were hurried on. But we had every reason\r\nto desire rapidity. Less time was given to the examination of objects\r\nthan might otherwise have been devoted. Yet I am not aware that any\r\nimportant object was neglected. Where there is much sameness in natural\r\nfeatures, frequent landings are unnecessary, and whoever has devoted\r\nhis time in going thus far up the Mississippi, will have made himself\r\nso familiar with its plants, soil and productions, that \xe2\x80\x9che who runs\r\nmay read.\xe2\x80\x9d The pine, in its varieties, is the prevailing tree; and\r\nwhenever we get out of the narrow alluvions of the valley, arenaceous\r\nplains appear. Among the plants that border the river, the wild rose,\r\nwhich is so conspicuous on all the streams northwest of Lake Superior,\r\nis very often seen. The salix, so common to the lower Mississippi, and\r\nso uniformly infested with mosquitoes, presents itself on the first\r\nplateau, and is afterwards one of the constant shrubs on the savannahs.\r\n\r\nThe Indian reed first shews itself distinctly, about the mouth of the\r\nPiniddiwin, and is here associated with wild rice. The stag and hind\r\nappear to be the species of deer, which were most frequently seen, and\r\nwere several times fired at by the party, along this branch of the\r\nriver. We also observed the _falco furcatus_, or swallow tailed hawk,\r\na species not heretofore, thought to inhabit the continent, so far\r\nnorth. A small animal of the amphibious kind was here brought to our\r\nnotice, under the name of _Ocaut Ekinabic_, or legged snake, a species\r\nof lizard, striped blue, black, and white, with a disproportionate\r\nlength of tail. It is thus readily distinguished from ordinary species.\r\nIts most striking peculiarity of habit, is its extreme activity and\r\nswiftness of motion.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Head landed, during the morning, to fire at a deer,\r\nwhich was seen grazing on a meadow, at some distance. He approached\r\ncautiously, but was unsuccessful in the shot he fired. What most\r\nexcited our surprise, was the rapidity with which he reloaded and\r\nfired again, before the deer had got without the range of his shot.\r\nThis was effected without the use of wadding to separate the powder\r\nfrom the ball. It did not, however, arrest the deer, who pursued\r\nhis flight. The Indian returned to his canoe with a look of marked\r\ndisappointment. Frequent opportunity was given in the course of the\r\nday, for firing at the various species of water fowl which resort to\r\nthis stream. The saw-billed duck,[8] which is a common species, has an\r\nart of protecting its young, which we had frequent opportunities of\r\nobserving. When the mother is surprised with a brood, she affects to\r\nhave a wing broken, and flaps awkwardly on the water, as if unable to\r\nrise. By thus attracting notice to herself, the young, who are unable,\r\nat this season, to fly, have an opportunity to screen themselves: and\r\nthe mother then boldly rises from the stream, and puts an end to the\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nThe river continues to descend in steps. The second series of rapids\r\nwas followed by a second level, or plateau, in which the channel\r\nassumes a width nearly, or quite, double to that which it presents on\r\nthe rapids. On this level, the Cano river comes in, as a tributary\r\non the right shore. The volume of water is perceptibly increased by\r\nit. This plateau may extend nine miles. It is succeeded by rapids\r\nof a milder character, below which the river again displays itself\r\nin savannahs, with a comparatively wide, winding channel. These are\r\nfinally terminated by short and easy rapids, which bring the river\r\nout of what, we may designate as its alpine passes. We landed for\r\nthe purpose of breakfast, on an open pine bank, (left shore,) near\r\nthe termination of the third plateau. Several beautifully clear and\r\ncool springs were observed running from its base into the river. It\r\nrequires, indeed, but a bare recollection of observed facts, to make\r\nit evident that the waters of both branches of the Mississippi, have\r\ntheir origin in springs of bright and pure water. It may be farther\r\nobserved, that although the Upper Mississippi receives a number of\r\ncolored tributaries, all its larger rivers are pure, and it is itself\r\nessentially a clear stream, when not in flood, as far as its junction\r\nwith the Missouri.\r\n\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, we came to the junction of the Piniddiwin, a\r\ntributary from the left, having its origin in a lake, and entering the\r\nMississippi amidst an extensive marsh of rice, reeds, and rushes, which\r\ngive it rather the appearance of a marsh than a lake. It is, however,\r\ncalled _Lac la Folle_. This spot was estimated to be one hundred and\r\nfour miles below Itasca Lake. The name of the river employed above,\r\nis an abbreviation of the phrase _Tah-pinuniddewin_, the place of\r\nviolent deaths, in allusion to an inroad and murder committed at this\r\nplace, in former times, by the Sioux. A party of this tribe, had\r\npreviously entrenched themselves on the river above, at a spot which\r\nconcealed their position and gave them command of the river channel.\r\nAfter waiting here for a time, without success, they proceeded lower,\r\nand discovered a Chippewa lodge, not far below the entrance of this\r\nriver. It was cautiously approached, assaulted, and all its inmates\r\nkilled, without distinction of age or sex. This event happened at an\r\nearly period. No persons are now living who were contemporary with the\r\nvictims. And it may be regarded as one of the occurrences which marked\r\nthe Chippewa conquest of this portion of the country.\r\n\r\nAbout eighteen miles below the junction of the Piniddiwin, we debarked\r\nfor the purpose of cooking supper, and preparing our canoes for a\r\nnight descent, as the channel of the river was now sufficiently broad,\r\ndeep, and equable to justify it. An _Ocaut Ekinabic_, was killed at\r\nthis place. Lieut. Allen, wishing day light, to finish tracing the\r\nriver to its junction with the east fork, encamped here. By the time\r\nwe were ready to embark, clouds had overcast the moon, which afforded\r\na clear light before. But we trusted to our experienced guide, on a\r\npart of the river familiar to him, and we had no cause to repent of our\r\nconfidence. Several shots were fired during the night at deer, standing\r\nin the edge of the water. The men landed at one spot, and pursued\r\nan animal, supposed to have been wounded. We found ourselves at the\r\njunction, about half past one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, (15th.) Having\r\ngiven notices of our ascent of the river thus far, it is unnecessary\r\nto add to them. We were borne along with the double force of current\r\nand paddles, and with no care of topographical observation to delay\r\nour progress. The night air became very damp and chilly. To defend\r\nourselves from it, we disposed of our travelling cloaks and blankets\r\nin the best manner possible. Neither sleep nor rest were, however,\r\ntruly attainable, in a confined position where there was not room\r\nenough to extend the body, and every limb was so hampered as to make\r\nit impracticable to afford the relief of a change of position. Day\r\nlight broke upon us in our descent from Lac Travers, and we reached our\r\npermanent encampment on the island in Cass Lake, at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nmorning. We had been eleven hours and a half in our canoes. Mr. Allen\r\ndid not rejoin us till four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe day being the Sabbath, the Reverend Mr. Boutwell, devoted a part\r\nof it, as he had done on the previous Sabbaths of our route, in giving\r\nreligious instruction. As three of the soldiers of the party were\r\nchristians, and two of our canoe-men could sing Indian hymns; singing,\r\nboth in English and in Indian, became practicable. Mr. Johnston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreadiness in scripture translation, put it in the power of Mr. B. to\r\naddress them on the leading doctrines of the gospel. With what effects\r\nthese exhortations were listened to, on this, or on other occasions,\r\ncannot be fully stated. Strict attention appeared to be paid by the\r\nIndians, during these little forest meetings, which were generally held\r\nunder some spreading tree, or on the grassy area of some sheltered\r\nglade, contiguous to the camp. Incredulity and bold cavilings, were\r\nmore observable, I think, at the most remote points of our route; and\r\nmost interest manifested in the subject, in the villages situated\r\nnearest the frontier posts. Whatever were the results, it is to be\r\nhoped that no circumstances will prevent Mr. B. from communicating his\r\nobservations to the christian public, at an early period.\r\n\r\nThe field for missionary labor, in all the region northwest of St.\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s and Michilimackinac, is certainly a very extensive and important\r\none. And the incitements to its occupancy, at the present era, may be\r\nsaid to be decidedly greater, than they have been at any time, since\r\nthe discovery of the country. No very strong barriers appear to stand\r\nin the way of the introduction of christianity among the northern\r\ntribes. Their institutions, moral and political, are so fragile, as to\r\nbe ready to tumble on the application of the slightest power. They are\r\nnot worshippers of the sun, or the moon. They have no list of imaginary\r\ngods, of the horrid character, which belong to the idolatrous nations\r\nof Asia and Africa. A Hindoo worshipper would hardly be able to impose\r\nhis tale of multiform incarnations, and transmigratory existence,\r\nupon their belief. And a votary of Juggernaut, would verily be looked\r\non by them, as little better than a mad man. It is not, however, to\r\nbe inferred that because these gross forms of idolatry do not exist,\r\nthey have no idolatry at all. Their _medicinism_, is nothing more\r\nnor less than a species of idolatry. They impute supernatural powers\r\nto certain material substances, which are preserved and guarded with\r\nreligious care. These objects, which are often taken from the mineral\r\nkingdom, are carried about in sacks, and are appealed to under every\r\nform of solemnity, to perform cures, and to grant deliverances, which\r\nwould require a miracle. Their lesser _monedos_, of which the number\r\nis endless, are expected to operate through these idol-medicines. And\r\nalthough they do not bow down to them, nor appear to place an implicit\r\nconfidence in them, they remain in a state of mental alarm, which often\r\nimpels them to resort to their influence. Nothing is more common,\r\nhowever, on conversing with them, than to find individuals, who are\r\nready to acknowledge, the insufficiency of these means, and who appear\r\nto be prepared to abandon them, and embrace the doctrine of the Savior,\r\nthe moment the fear of popular opinion among _their own people_, can\r\nbe removed. No dead man has been deified by them, and they have not\r\na name or word in their language, so far as known, which represents\r\na god, but that of \xe2\x80\x9cMonedo.\xe2\x80\x9d This word, I am inclined to think, is\r\nitself, a derivative from one of the forms of the active verb, Momo,\r\nto take. But, like other Chippewa verbs, it is so buried and clogged\r\nwith adjuncts, in the nature of prefix and suffix, that it might often\r\nrequire a Champollion to decipher it. And here, it may be observed,\r\nthat Indian verbs, have not only the active and passive forms, but\r\nthese forms are indicated by separate words. Thus, momo, verb active\r\nto take. Od\xc3\xa1pin, verb passive, to take. Each verb has the animate and\r\ninanimate forms. As most verbs are transitives, and their simplest\r\nforms indicate the third person singular of the imperative mood, the\r\nfollowing conjugations of the verb, to take, result:\r\n\r\n    Momih, verb active, animate, take him.\r\n    Momon, verb active, inanimate, take it.\r\n    Od\xc3\xa1pin, verb passive, animate, take him.\r\n    Odapinun, verb passive, inanimate, take it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  _Council with the Chippewas at Cass Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Speeches of Oza\r\n    Windib, Neezh Opinais, and Wai Wain Jeegun.\xe2\x80\x94Distribution\r\n    of presents.\xe2\x80\x94Geographical and Geological notices of Cass\r\n    Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Colcaspi Isle.\xe2\x80\x94Allen\xe2\x80\x99s Bay.\xe2\x80\x94Pike\xe2\x80\x99s Bay.\xe2\x80\x94Heights and\r\n    distances.\xe2\x80\x94Tributary of Turtle River.\xe2\x80\x94Turtle Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Portage from\r\n    Cass Lake to Leech Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Hieroglyphic marks.\xe2\x80\x94Moss Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Reach\r\n    Lake Shiba.\xe2\x80\x94The source of the River Shiba flowing into Leech\r\n    Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Traverse Leech Lake at night, and encamp at Guelle Plat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n    village.\xe2\x80\x94Received by the Indians with respect.\xe2\x80\x94Description\r\n    of Leech Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Its population and principal Chiefs.\xe2\x80\x94Warlike\r\n    character of the Pillagers.\xe2\x80\x94Efforts made by them to defend the\r\n    Chippewa frontiers.\xe2\x80\x94Their warfare defensive._\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth, and a peaceable intercourse with the natives, had, under\r\nProvidence, preserved our party at the island in Cass Lake, and we\r\nrejoined them in their encampment, with mutual pleasure. The day\r\nfollowing our arrival, being Monday, was devoted to the formalities of\r\na council with the Indians. I stated to them the objects of my visit\r\nto the region, so far as these related to them\xe2\x80\x94the desire felt by\r\nthe Government for their welfare, and its anxiety to cultivate their\r\nfriendship\xe2\x80\x94and endeavored to impress upon their minds, the importance\r\nof terminating their warfare with their hereditary enemies, the Sioux.\r\n\r\nOza Windib spoke in reply. Thanks, he said, were all they had to\r\noffer me, and through me, to the Great Chief of America, for the\r\ncharitable feelings which had led to my visit, and the good counsels\r\nhe had received. He should remember these counsels. They would be\r\nkept in his heart. He would endeavor to act by them. And although not\r\nhimself a Chief, or the son of a Chief, he would exert the influence\r\nhe possessed, to induce his people to live in peace, and to listen to\r\nthe voice of counsel. He rejoiced to see the American flag displayed\r\nat this remote point, and should the master of life preserve him\r\ntill another year, it was his fixed purpose to visit the Agency at\r\nMichilimackinac.\r\n\r\nThe son of Neezh Openais, or the Twin Birds, followed him. He said\r\nhis father had received his medal from the American Chief, (the\r\npresent Secretary of War, Hon. Lewis Cass.) who had visited, this\r\nlake, thirteen summers before. His father was now at Red Lake, but in\r\ngoing there, he had carried with him his friendship for the American\r\nGovernment, and he had directed him to express it to me, and to unite\r\nin the promotion of any good measure proposed. He assented to the\r\nsentiments uttered by Oza Windib. He approved of the advice. He would\r\nact by it. He thanked me, as being the bearer of it, and he looked to\r\nme to direct the Chippewas in their affairs, and to make them prosper.\r\n\r\nA deputy from the band at Red Lake, then delivered a peace pipe, with\r\nits garnished stem, decked with feathers, from Wai Wain Jeegun, a War\r\nChief of that lake. He had sent it, it was declared, as a token of\r\nhis friendship\xe2\x80\x94his remembrance of the power that permitted traders to\r\ncome into their country to supply them with goods, and his hope and\r\nexpectation, that his remote position, and limited authority, might not\r\noperate, to render his present unwelcome. It had been prepared by his\r\nown hand. Although he had wielded the war club, it was in self defence,\r\nand to prevent others from saying he is a coward. The peace pipe he\r\noffered, he smoked, however, with his heart.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of presents to the promiscuous assembly of men,\r\nwomen, and children, the payment of those who had furnished canoes,\r\nand the rewarding of the guides, closed the business of the council. I\r\ninvested Oza Windib with a flag and the President\xe2\x80\x99s medal, delivered\r\na flag into the hands of Neezh Openais, for his father, and sent a\r\nmessage, with an acknowledgment and presents, to Wai Wain Jeegun. These\r\nthings dispatched, we prepared to embark for the portage to Leech Lake.\r\nBut previous to quitting this lake, it may be proper to subjoin a few\r\nparticulars respecting it, which, from a desire to gain a more perfect\r\nknowledge of it, were omitted, on first entering it.\r\n\r\nCass Lake occupies a position on the American continent, and\r\nparticularly in relation to the Upper Mississippi, which makes it\r\ndesirable to acquire more accurate details and observations than it\r\nfell to our lot to be enabled to make. But in the absence of such\r\ndata, such facts as our means permitted, may be substituted. We were\r\nimpressed with its extent, the picturesque character of its islands,\r\nand the diversified appearance of its very irregular woodland shores.\r\nIts geological features are similar to those of Leech Lake and Lake\r\nWinnipec, being a basin of diluvial formation, spotted with islands,\r\noccupying a position on the great marine sand district of the Upper\r\nMississippi. This district abounds in pure springs, and is so\r\nimpervious in its lower strata, that it has probably retained to the\r\npresent day, more water in the character of lakes, large and small,\r\nthan any other part of the world. The greatest expanse of the lake\r\nappears to lie in the direction from north to south. Its length is from\r\nnortheast to south-west. From the time consumed in passing through it,\r\nit cannot fall short of sixteen miles. It has four islands, the largest\r\nof which Colcaspi or Grand Island, which is itself of a most striking\r\nshape, occupying a large area in its centre and presenting its green\r\nforests of elm and oak in striking contrast with the bright expanse of\r\nwaters. Allen\xe2\x80\x99s Bay[9] is, properly the head of this lake, receiving\r\nthe Mississippi from the west. Nothing, however, in the mere figure of\r\nthe lake, is so characteristic as the noble bay which puts out from its\r\nsouthern shore, presenting an expanse of clear and deep water which\r\nwe were an hour, with every exertion, in crossing transversely. This\r\nbay was visited on the ice by the late General Pike, in his search\r\nof the sources of the Mississippi in the winter of 1806, and it may\r\nbe appropriately named after a man, who, both as a traveller and a\r\nsoldier, has so fair a claim to remembrance.\r\n\r\nCass Lake has been estimated to be within a few miles of 3,000 from the\r\nGulf of Mexico, and to lie at an elevation of 1,330 feet above that\r\npoint of the Atlantic waters; its distance northwest of Sandy Lake, is\r\nabout two hundred and seventy miles, and of Fond du Lac, four hundred\r\nand twenty miles. Estimates make it one hundred and eighty-two miles\r\nbelow the true source of the Mississippi in Itasca Lake, and sixty\r\nsouth of Red Lake. It receives Turtle River on its northern shore.\r\nThis river is ascended through eleven small lakes, a distance of about\r\nthirty-eight to forty miles to its origin in Turtle Lake, once deemed\r\nto be the source of the Mississippi.[10] There is a portage from the\r\nlake, for light packages of goods, across the summit level of the\r\nMississippi valley into Red Lake, and the fertile valley of Red river.\r\nThe latter embraces the settlements planted by the Earl of Selkirk,\r\nthe inhabitants of which maintained their existence for several years\r\nagainst the strenuous opposition of the North West Company, and they\r\nappear now to be in a state of comparative prosperity under the\r\ndirection of a local governor, council, and clergy.\r\n\r\nThe portage from Pike\xe2\x80\x99s Bay, (where we arrived at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock in\r\nthe morning, after a two hours journey from the island,) commences\r\non the edge of an open pine forest, interspersed with shrub oak. The\r\npath is deeply worn, and looks as if it might have been used by the\r\nIndians, for centuries. It lies across a plain presenting the usual\r\naridity of similar formations, and exhibiting the usual growth of\r\nunderbrush and shrubbery. I observed the alum root, harebell and sweet\r\nfern, scattered through the more prevalent growth of wortle berry, L.\r\nlatifolia, &c. Markings and hieroglyphic characters were pointed out to\r\nus on the pines, some of which were said to be so ancient as to have\r\nbeen made by the people who occupied the country before the Ojibwais.\r\nOf the truth of this assertion there did not appear to be any certain\r\nmeans of judging. A blaze on the pinus resinosa, if made upon a matured\r\ntree, may be considered as comparatively permanent, from the fact that\r\nthe outer bark is not apt to close over it, while the gum that exudes\r\nover the wounded surface, has some of the properties of a varnish. How\r\nlong the rude drawings of birds and animals, made with charcoal would\r\nthus be preserved, is mere matter of conjecture, and must depend upon\r\nobservations which we had no means of making.\r\n\r\nA portage of nine hundred and fifty yards brought us to the banks\r\nof a small lake, called Moss Lake, which we were but a short time in\r\ncrossing. The water being clear, large masses appeared to rise from\r\nthe bottom, which had very much the aspect of boulders. On reaching\r\ndown, however, the men brought up on their paddles, a species of moss\r\nof a coarse fibrous character. And this moss seemed to be quite a\r\ncharacteristic trait of the lake. There is a slight relief, to both\r\nmind and body, in these changes from land to water transportation,\r\neven where the distance is very short; and the men resume their labor,\r\nin carrying, with greater alacrity. We found it so on the present\r\noccasion. No change however appeared in the general character of the\r\ncountry. We crossed a bog of perhaps fifty or sixty yards in extent,\r\nwhere the water appeared to have some motion towards the left. All the\r\nrest of the way consists of an unvaried sand plain, which is sometimes\r\nbrushy, but generally open, presenting facilities for travelling. A\r\nwalk of four thousand and one hundred yards, or about two and a half\r\nmiles brought us out to the edge of Lake Shiba,[11] a body of clear\r\nwater, of moderate dimensions, which has its outlet into an arm of\r\nLeech Lake. There is a portage path from its southern side which the\r\nIndians use when they are passing with light canoes.\r\n\r\nThe day was well nigh spent, by the time the men brought up all the\r\nbaggage to the banks of this lake. And the fatigue of the route itself\r\nmight have justified our encamping. But whoever has a definite point\r\nto reach in a given time, will find that the loss of a single hour, or\r\nhalf hour of an evening\xe2\x80\x99s journey, on sundry days, will soon combine\r\nto waste an entire day, which may be the exact time necessary to\r\naccomplish the route. Besides, when the question of going on, is at a\r\nspot where a _land_ is to be exchanged for a _water_ journey, there\r\nis a sensible relief to the men, in the position of sitting and being\r\nfreed from the pressure of the head-strap, or _apicun_, by which they\r\ncarry. And north-men thus embarked, in a state of fatigue, will soon\r\nresume their strength and gaiety. I felt this, on the present occasion,\r\nand directed them not to lose a moment in getting afloat. We crossed\r\nthe lake, with but little effort, and entered its thread-like outlet,\r\nso tangled and wound about, in a shaking savannah, covered with sedge,\r\nthat every point of the compass seemed to be alternately pursued. In\r\nthis maze it was joined, from the right by a tributary of its own size,\r\nvery welcome for its accession of waters, but not aiding to straighten\r\nthe channel. Another tributary flows in directly opposite the Indian\r\nportage before referred to. This tributary appears to be the outlet of\r\na contiguous, narrow and long lake, which can be, in part observed. The\r\nchannel is suddenly enlarged by it, and it is soon after still further\r\nswelled by a similar inlet. Both these inlets are referred to by the\r\nIndians, by the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cKapucka Sagitowag.\xe2\x80\x9d The stream is so enlarged\r\nby them, as not only to assume the character of a river, but it is a\r\nriver of handsome magnitude, broad and deep but without strong current.\r\nIts shores assume a low and marshy character, and they are fringed\r\nwith extensive fields of wild rice. Amidst these, the river opens\r\ninto an arm of Leech Lake. The last glimpses of day light here left\r\nus. We pursued our way by moonlight for a time. The sky was overcast\r\nbefore we effected our first traverse. Sometime previous to landing\r\nit became quite dark. Even with the knowledge of an Indian guide, it\r\nwas necessary to fire guns, to ascertain the position of the principal\r\nvillage. It was ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, on our landing, and it was an hour later\r\nbefore the military canoes came up. Salutes were separately fired by\r\nthe Indians through the top openings of their lodges. In the morning,\r\n(17th,) a more formal salute was given. Fresh fish and wortle-berries\r\nwere brought in: and an invitation to breakfast sent from the presiding\r\nchief.\r\n\r\nLeech Lake is one of the most irregular shaped bodies of water that\r\ncan be conceived of. It is neither characteristically long, spherical,\r\nor broad, but rather a combination of curves, in the shape of points,\r\npeninsulas, and bays, of which nothing short of a map can convey an\r\naccurate idea. The Indians, whom I requested to draw a sketch of it,\r\nbegan by tracing an oblong as large as half a sheet of foolscap would\r\nadmit of. They filled it up by projecting points inwardly, or extended\r\nit by tracing bays outwardly. Ten islands were drawn in different\r\nparts of it, and seven rivers and creeks made to enter it. Its outlet\r\nis called by them the great river, and is towards the northeast. The\r\nlake cannot be less than twenty miles across the extreme points of\r\nthe waters. Its principal peninsula resembles in shape the letter\r\nT. Ottertail Point is a part of its northern shore. Its waters are\r\ndeep and clear in all its central parts, and yield the white-fish and\r\nother species. Its numerous and extensive bays abound in wild rice,\r\nand attract in the proper season, a great variety of water fowl. The\r\npelican, swan, brant, and cormorant, are the largest of the species\r\nthat annually visit it. Its shores yield the deer and bear. Beavers\r\nwere formerly abundant, but they have, in a great measure, disappeared.\r\nThe muskrat and marten are now the principal items of its fine furs.\r\nThe subjoined sketch is from the notes of Lieut. Allen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEECH LAKE]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy intercourse with the Indians at this lake occupied the day\r\nafter my arrival. The population was reported at eight hundred and\r\nthirty-two souls. Seven eights of this number, are of the band called\r\nMukkundwais, or Pillagers, a term derived from occurrences in their\r\nearly history. The remainder are locally denominated the Bear Island\r\nIndians. The principal chiefs are Aish Kibug Ekozh, or The Gueule\r\nPlat, and The Elder Brother, and Chianoquot. This band appear to have\r\nseparated themselves from the other Chippewas, at an early day, and to\r\nhave taken upon themselves the duty which Reuben, Gad, and Menasseh\r\nassumed, when they crossed the Jordan. They have \xe2\x80\x9cpassed armed before\r\ntheir brethren,\xe2\x80\x9d in their march westward. Their geographical position\r\nis one, which imposes upon them the defence of this portion of the\r\nChippewa frontier. And it is a defence in which they have distinguished\r\nthemselves as brave and active warriors. Many acts of intrepidity are\r\nrelated of them which would be recorded, with admiration, had white men\r\nbeen the actors. Perfectly versed in the arts of the forest, they have\r\nenjoyed the advantage of concealment in the progress of a war, which\r\nhas been directed against the Sioux, a powerful assemblage of tribes,\r\nwho live essentially in plains, but who aim to make up the disadvantage\r\nof this exposure, by moving habitually in larger bodies. It seems,\r\nhowever, indisputable, that, with fewer numbers, the Chippewas have not\r\nhesitated to fall upon their enemies, and have routed them, and driven\r\nthem before them, with a valor and resolution, which in any period of\r\nwritten warfare, would have been stamped as heroic. It is not easy, on\r\nthe part of government, to repress the feelings of hostility, which\r\nhave so long existed, and to convince them, that they have lived into\r\nan age when milder maxims furnish the basis of wise action. Pacific\r\ncounsels fall with little power upon a people situated so remotely\r\nfrom every good influence, and who cannot perceive in the restless\r\nspirit of their enemies, any safeguard for the continuance of a peace,\r\nhowever formally it may have been concluded. This fact was adverted to\r\nby one of their chiefs, who observed that they were compelled to fight\r\nin self defence. Although the Sioux had made a solemn peace with them\r\nat Tipisagi in 1825, they were attacked by them that very year, and\r\nhad almost yearly since, sustained insidious or open attacks. He said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chis own son, his only son,\xe2\x80\x9d was among the number, who had been basely\r\nkilled, without an opportunity to defend himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  _Transactions at Leech Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Notice of the Pillager band.\xe2\x80\x94Their\r\n    chief, Aish Kibug Ekozh, or the Flat Mouth.\xe2\x80\x94He invites the agent\r\n    and his interpreter to breakfast.\xe2\x80\x94His address on concluding\r\n    it.\xe2\x80\x94Vaccination of the Indians.\xe2\x80\x94A deputation from the Rainy Lake\r\n    band is received, and a flag presented to their leader, The Hole\r\n    in the Sky.\xe2\x80\x94Council with the Pillagers.\xe2\x80\x94Speech of Aish Kibug\r\n    Ekozh, in which he makes an allusion to Gen.

There\r\nis indeed a remarkable conformity in the external habits of all our\r\nnorthern Indians. The necessity of changing their camps often, to\r\nprocure game or fish, the want of domesticated animals, the general\r\ndependence on wild rice, and the custom of journeying in canoes, has\r\nproduced a general uniformity of life. And it is emphatically a life of\r\nwant and vicissitude. There is a perpetual change between action and\r\ninanity, in the mind, which is a striking peculiarity of the savage\r\nstate. And there is such a general want of forecast, that most of their\r\nmisfortunes and hardships, in war and peace, come unexpectedly. None\r\nof the tribes who inhabit this quarter, can be said to have, thus far,\r\nderived any peculiarities from civilized instruction. The only marked\r\nalteration which their state of society has undergone, appears to be\r\nreferable to the era of the introduction of the fur trade, when they\r\nwere made acquainted with, and adopted the use of, iron, gunpowder,\r\nand woollens. This implied a considerable change of habits, and of the\r\nmode of subsistence; and may be considered as having paved the way\r\nfor further changes in the mode of living and dress. But it brought\r\nwith it the onerous evil of intemperance, and it left the mental\r\nhabits essentially unchanged. All that related to a system of dances,\r\nsacrifices, and ceremonies, which stood in the place of religion,\r\nstill occupies that position, presenting a subject which is deemed the\r\npeculiar labor of evangelists and teachers. Missionaries have been\r\nslow to avail themselves of this field of labor, and it should not\r\nexcite surprise, that the people themselves are, to so great a degree,\r\n_mentally_ the same in 1832, that they were on the arrival of the\r\nFrench in the St. Lawrence in 1532.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cUnknown the measured joys of peaceful art,\r\n     Love, hatred, pity, storm, by turns, the heart,\r\n     And all the evils of the savage state,\r\n     Arise from false conceits of being great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPartial exceptions in the acquisition of civil information, are to be\r\nfound; and the incident I am about to relate, is the more remarkable\r\nas connected with the history of a chief, who has passed his life in\r\nso very unfrequented a part of the continent, with only the advantages\r\nof occasional short visits to the posts of St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s, St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nMichilimackinac. Aish Kibug Ekozh, or the Guelle Plat, is the ruler\r\nof the Pillager band, exercising the authority of both a civil and\r\nwar chief. And he is endowed with talents which certainly entitle him\r\nto this distinction. Complying with European customs, he directed his\r\nyoung men to fire a salute on the morning of my arrival. Soon after he\r\nsent one of his officials to invite me to breakfast. I accepted the\r\ninvitation. But not knowing how the meal could be suitably got along\r\nwith, without bread, I took the precaution to send up a tin dish of\r\npilot bread. I went to his residence at the proper time, accompanied by\r\nMr. Johnston. I found him living in a comfortable log building of two\r\nrooms, well floored, and roofed, with a couple of small glass windows.\r\nA mat was spread upon the centre of the floor, which contained the\r\nbreakfast. Other mats were spread around it, to sit on. We followed\r\nhis example in sitting down after the eastern manner. There was no\r\nother person admitted to the meal but his wife, who sat near him, and\r\npoured out the tea, but ate or drank nothing herself. Tea cups, and tea\r\nspoons, plates, knives and forks, of plain manufacture, were carefully\r\narranged, and the number corresponding exactly with the expected\r\nguests. A white fish, cut up and boiled in good taste, occupied a dish\r\nin the centre, from which he helped us. A salt cellar, in which pepper\r\nand salt were mixed in unequal proportions, allowed each the privilege\r\nof seasoning his fish with both or neither. Our tea was sweetened\r\nwith the native sugar, and the dish of hard bread seemed to have been\r\nprecisely wanted to make out the repast. It needed but the imploring of\r\na blessing, to render it essentially a christian meal.\r\n\r\nThis chief brought me a letter from the interior some years ago,\r\nat St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s, in which he is spoken of as \xe2\x80\x9cthe most respectable\r\nman in the Chippewa country.\xe2\x80\x9d And if the term was applied to his\r\nmental qualities, and the power of drawing just conclusions from\r\nknown premises, and the effects which these have had on his standing\r\nand influence with his own band, it is not misapplied. Shrewdness\r\nand quickness most of the chiefs possess, but there is more of the\r\ncharacter of common sense and practical reflection, in the Guelle\r\nPlat\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, than, with a very extensive acquaintance, I recollect\r\nto have noticed in most of the chiefs now living, of this tribe.[12] He\r\nis both a warrior and a counsellor, and these distinctions he holds,\r\nnot from any hereditary right, for he is a self-made man, but from the\r\nforce of his own character. I found him ready to converse on the topics\r\nof most interest to him. And the sentiments he uttered on the Sioux\r\nwar, the fur trade, and the location of trading posts and agencies,\r\nwere such as would occur to a mind which had possessed itself of facts,\r\nand was capable of reasoning from them. His manners were grave and\r\ndignified, and his oratory such as to render him popular with his tribe.\r\n\r\nDuring the repast, the room became filled with Indians, apparently the\r\nrelatives and intimate friends of the chief, who seated themselves\r\norderly and silently around the room. When we arose, the chief assumed\r\nthe oratorical attitude, and addressed himself to me.\r\n\r\nHe expressed his regret that I had not been able to visit them the\r\nyear before, when I was expected.[13] He hoped I had now come, as I\r\ncame by surprise, to remain some days with them. He said, they lived\r\nat a remote point, and were involved in wars with their neighbors, and\r\nwished my advice. They were not insensible to advice, nor incapable of\r\nfollowing it. They were anxious for counsel, and desirous of living at\r\npeace, and of keeping the advice which had heretofore been given them.\r\nThey had been told to sit still on their lands, but their enemies would\r\nnot permit them to sit still. They were compelled to get up, and fight\r\nin self defence. The Sioux continued to kill their hunters. They had\r\nkilled his son, during the last visit he had made to my office. They\r\nhad never ceased to make inroads. And he believed there were white men\r\namong them, who stirred them up to go to war against the Chippewas. He\r\nnamed one person particularly.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, he continued, to take some decisive steps to put a\r\nstop to these inroads. This was the reason why he had led out the war\r\nparty, which had recently returned. This was the reason why I saw the\r\nstains of blood before me.\r\n\r\nHe alluded, in the last expression, to the flags, war clubs, and\r\nmedals, which decorated one end of the room, all of which had vermilion\r\nsmeared over them to represent blood. I replied, that I would assemble\r\nthe Indians at a general council, at my camp, as soon as preparations\r\ncould be made; that notice would be given them by the firing of the\r\nmilitary, and that I should then lay before them the advice I came to\r\ndeliver from their Great Father, the President, and offer, at the same\r\ntime, my own counsel, on the subjects he had spoken of.\r\n\r\nDuring the day constant accessions were made to the number of Indians,\r\nfrom neighboring places. And before the hour of the council arrived,\r\nthere could have been but little short of a thousand souls present.\r\nMost of the warriors carried their arms, and were painted and drest\r\nin their gayest manner. And they walked through the village with a\r\nbold and free air, in striking contrast with the subdued and cringing\r\naspect, which is sometimes witnessed in the vicinity of the posts\r\nand settlements. Many applications were made for the extraction of\r\ndecayed teeth, and for blood letting, the latter of which appears to\r\nbe a favorite remedy among the northern Indians. Most of the time of\r\nthe surgeon, (Dr. Houghton,) was however employed in the application\r\nof the vaccine virus, which constituted one of the primary objects\r\nof the visit. Among the number vaccinated by him, one was past the\r\nage of eighty, several between sixty and eighty, and a large number\r\nunder the age of ten. Little difficulty was found in getting them to\r\nsubmit to the process, and wherever there was hesitancy or refusal, it\r\nseemed to arise from a distrust of the protective power of the disease.\r\nNone had been previously vaccinated. Of the younger classes, it was\r\nremarked here, as at other places, that the boys evinced no fear on the\r\ndisplay of the lancet, but nearly every female child, either came with\r\nreluctance and entreaty of the parents, or was absolutely obliged to\r\nbe held, during the process. The ravages made by the small pox in this\r\nquarter, about the year 1782, were remembered with the distinctness\r\nof recent tradition, and had its effects in preparing their minds,\r\ngenerally, not only to receive the vaccine virus, but in imparting a\r\nsolicitude that all might be included, so as to ensure them from the\r\nrecurrence of a pestilence, which they regard with horror. Their name\r\nfor this disease, of Ma Mukkizziwin, suggests the disfiguration of the\r\nflesh and skin produced by it.\r\n\r\nAmong the number of Indians who arrived here, during the day, were a\r\nparty of nine Rainy Lake Indians under the leadership of a man named\r\nWai Wizhzhi Geezhig, or The Hole in the Sky. He represented himself and\r\nparty as part of a small band residing at Springing-bow-string Lake,\r\nin the middle grounds between Lake Winnipec and Rainy Lake. He said,\r\nthey had heard of my passing the post of Winnipec, with an intention\r\nof returning through Leech Lake. This was the cause of his visit.\r\nThey lived off from the great lake, and seldom saw Americans. He came\r\nto express his good will, hoping to be remembered, as he now saw his\r\nfather, among his children, &c. I presented him, publicly, with my own\r\nhand, with a flag, and directed to be laid before him an amount of\r\npresents, committing to him, at the same time, a short address to be\r\ndelivered to the American portion of the Rainy Lake Indians.\r\n\r\nThe hour for the council having arrived, and the Mukkundwa, or\r\nPillagers, being present with their chiefs and warriors, women and\r\nchildren, I caused the presents intended for this band, to be displayed\r\nin bulk, on blankets spread on the grass, in front of my tent. I\r\ncalled their attention to the subjects named in my instructions,\r\nthe desire of the government for the restoration of peace, and its\r\npaternal character, feelings, and wishes in relation, particularly, to\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94reminded them of their solemn treaty of peace and limits with the\r\nSioux, at Prairie du Chien in 1825, enforcing the advantages of it,\r\nin its bearings on their hunting, trade, and well being. The presents\r\nwere then delivered to the chiefs, as an earnest of good will and\r\nsincerity on the part of the government, and were by them directed to\r\nbe immediately divided and distributed.\r\n\r\nAish Kibug Ekozh, or the Guelle Plat, was their speaker in reply. He\r\ncalled the attention of the warriors to his words. He thanked me for\r\nthe presents, which reminded him, in amount, of the times when the\r\nBritish held possession in that quarter. He pointed across an arm of\r\nthe lake, in front, to the position formerly occupied by the North West\r\nCompany\xe2\x80\x99s fort. He said many winters had now passed since the Americans\r\nfirst sent one of their chiefs to that post, (alluding to the visit of\r\nPike.) He remembered that visit. I had now come, it appeared, to remind\r\nthem that the American flag was flying in the land, and to offer them\r\ncounsels of peace. He thanked me for them. He had hoped that I was to\r\nspend more time with them, that they might consult on a reply, but as\r\nthey must speak on the instant, (orders had been given for embarking\r\nthat evening) they would not lose the opportunity of declaring their\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nHe had before heard the Americans say, peace, peace! But he thought\r\ntheir advice resembled a rushing wind. It was strong and went soon.\r\nIt did not abide long enough to choke up the road. At the treaty of\r\nTipisagi,[14] it had been promised that the aggressors should be\r\npunished; but that very year they were attacked by the Sioux; and\r\nalmost yearly since, some of their nation had been killed. They had\r\neven been fired on by the Sioux, under the walls of the fort at Ishki\r\nBuggi Seebi,[15] and four of their number had been killed. He had,\r\nhimself, been present. He here asked one of his subordinates for a\r\nbundle of sticks, which he handed to me saying, it is the number of\r\nthe Leech Lake Chippewas who have been killed by the Sioux, since they\r\nsigned the treaty of Tipisagi. The number was forty-three.\r\n\r\nHe then lifted up four silver medals, attached by a string of wampum,\r\nand smeared with vermilion. Take notice, he said they are bloody. I\r\nwish you to wipe off the blood. I am unable to do it. I find myself\r\nirretrievably involved in a war with the Sioux. I believe it has been\r\nintended by the creator that we should be at war with this people. I\r\nam not satisfied with the result of the last war party. My warriors\r\nare not satisfied. They are brave men. It is to them I owe success,\r\nand not to myself. Both they, and I, have heretofore looked for help\r\nwhere we did not find it. (He alluded to the American government.) We\r\nare determined to revenge ourselves. If the United States does not aid\r\nus, I have it in mind to apply for aid elsewhere. (He alluded to the\r\nBritish government.) My warriors are in a restless state. I have sent\r\nmy pipe and invitations to my friends around, to continue the war.\r\nCircumstances control me. I cannot avoid it. My feelings are enlisted\r\ndeeply in the contest. When the enemy killed my son, I resolved never\r\nto lay down the war club. I have sought death in battle but have not\r\nmet it. All I now can say is this, that perhaps I shall not lead out\r\nthe next war party.\r\n\r\nOther parts of his speech on the war are omitted. This is, however, the\r\nthread, although a broken thread of his argument, omitting frequent and\r\nglowing appeals to his warriors, who expressed their approbation at\r\nevery pause.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to accuse persons on the waters of the Upper Mississippi,\r\nof giving advice to the Sioux to go to war against the Chippewas. He\r\nsaid it was the interest of persons in the trade to induce the Sioux\r\nto extend their hunting grounds across the boundary lines. He evinced\r\na familiarity with persons and places. He boldly accused, not only\r\ntraders, but even some persons holding offices under government, of\r\nparticipating in this course of mal-advice.\r\n\r\nHe complained of the traders. He criticised their conduct with\r\nseverity. He declared their prices to be exorbitant, and said they were\r\nso intent on getting furs, that they did not deem it necessary to use\r\nmuch formality in their dealings. He complained of the exclusion of\r\nardent spirits, but at the same time admitted, that formerly it was\r\nbrought in to buy up their wild rice\xe2\x80\x94a practice which left them at the\r\nbeginning of cold weather, in a destitute situation.\r\n\r\nMuch of the sentiment of this address appeared to be uttered for\r\npopular effect. There was a marked difference between the tone of his\r\nprivate conversation, and his public address, of which more will appear\r\nin the sequel. Such parts of it, as required it, were replied to, and\r\nthe simple truths, political and moral, dictating the visit to them,\r\nbrought clearly before their minds, so as to leave definite impressions.\r\n\r\nSo far as related to the traders withdrawing the article of whiskey\r\nfrom the trade, I felt it due to say, that no hard feelings should be\r\nentertained towards them. That it was excluded by the Indian Office.\r\nThey should, therefore, in justice, blame me or blame the government,\r\nbut not the traders. I was satisfied, I added, that the use of whiskey\r\nwas very hurtful to them, in every situation of life, and felt\r\ndetermined to employ every means which the control of the agency of the\r\nnorthwest gave me, to exclude the article wholly, and rigidly from the\r\nChippewas, and to set the mark of disapprobation upon every trader who\r\nshould make the attempt to introduce it.\r\n\r\nIt was near the hour of sunset when the council closed. Minor duties\r\nemployed some time after. And while these were in the progress of\r\nexecution, the Guelle Plat, who had been the principal actor during\r\nthe day, gave us occasion to observe, that if he had studied effect in\r\nspeaking, he was also a judge of propriety in dress. At a dinner to\r\nwhich I invited him, at my tent, and also during the public council\r\nfollowing it, he appeared in his native costume. But after the close\r\nof the council and before we embarked, he came down to the lake shore,\r\nto bid us fare well, dressed in a blue military frock coat, with red\r\ncollar and cuffs, with white underclothes, a linen ruffled shirt, shoes\r\nand stockings, and a neat citizen\xe2\x80\x99s hat. To have uttered his speeches\r\nin this foreign costume, might have been associated in the minds of\r\nhis people, with the idea of servility; but he was willing afterwards\r\nto let us observe, by assuming it, that he knew we would consider it a\r\nmark of respect.\r\n\r\nThis chief appears to be turned of sixty. In stature he is about\r\nfive feet nine or ten inches, erect and stout, somewhat inclined to\r\ncorpulency. He is a native of this lake, of the _totem_[16] of the\r\nOw\xc3\xa1sissi, a kind of fish. He observed at my table, at St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s, four\r\nyears ago, that he had been twenty-five times on war parties, either\r\nas leader or follower, and had escaped without a wound. He was once\r\nsurrounded by a party of Sioux, with only three companions. They cut\r\ntheir way out killing two men. He was early drawn into intercourse with\r\nthe British at Fort William, on Lake Superior, where he received his\r\nfirst medal. This medal was taken from him by Lieut. Pike, in 1806. I\r\nrenewed it, by the largest class of solid silver medals, July 19th,\r\n1828.\r\n\r\nReciprocating the customary compliment in parting, we embarked and\r\nencamped on a contiguous part of the coast, where we could procure fire\r\nwood, and be sure of making an early start on the morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  _Observations on the Leech Lake Chippewas.\xe2\x80\x94Data respecting\r\n    the former state of the fur trade.\xe2\x80\x94Their turbulent\r\n    character.\xe2\x80\x94Assassination of Relle by Puganoc.\xe2\x80\x94Causes of the\r\n    emigration of the North-western Indians.\xe2\x80\x94The unsatisfactory\r\n    character of their traditions.\xe2\x80\x94Their language.\xe2\x80\x94Brief synopsis of\r\n    its grammatical structure._\r\n\r\n\r\nLeech Lake has been one of the principal posts of trade in the\r\nnorthwest since the region was first laid open to the enterprise of\r\nthe fur trade, and it has probably yielded more wealth in furs and\r\nskins, than one of the richest mines of silver would have produced.\r\nEuropean goods were extremely high at the period referred to, at the\r\nsame time, that furs were abundant, and the ability of the Indians to\r\npay, consequently, ample. The standard of value and computation in\r\nthis trade, is an abiminikwa, or prime beaver, called _plus_ by the\r\nFrench. A plus, tradition states, was given for as much vermilion as\r\nwould cover the point of a case knife, and the same price was paid\r\nrespectively for four charges of powder, or four charges of shot, or\r\nfifteen balls, or two branches of wampum. It is related that an outfit\r\nof six bales of goods, worth, say $2000, brought from Athabasca,\r\nninety-six packs of beaver, each of which would weigh ninety pounds,\r\nat a time when prime beaver was worth four dollars per pound. A fine\r\ngun, worth ten guineas, was sold to a chief at one of the northern\r\nposts, for one hundred and twenty pounds of beaver, say four hundred\r\nand eighty dollars. The post of the Pic, alone, is said to have yielded\r\none hundred packs of beaver, during a single season. From the MSS.\r\nof M. Perrault, now before us, referred to in a previous part of our\r\nnarrative, the rates at which furs were reduced to the plus, at this\r\nlake, in 1784, were the following. A bear was estimated to be one plus,\r\nan otter, three martens, a lynx, fifteen muskrats, respectively, one\r\nplus. A buffalo robe, two plus. A keg of mixed rum, which was then\r\nthe kind of spirits used in the trade, was sold at thirty plus, and\r\nthe Indians, when they commenced trading, first put out the furs they\r\nintended as pay for their liquor.\r\n\r\nThe Leech Lake Indians were then stated to be numerous, although, in\r\ncommon with other northern bands, they had also suffered from the\r\ngeneral ravages of the small pox, in this region, two years previous.\r\nThey were, however, then, as now, deemed a turbulent band, and such was\r\nthe fear of giving additional excitement to their passions, that the\r\nliquor which was sold to them, was put in _cache_ at the entrance of\r\nthe river, that it might not be delivered to them, until the traders\r\nhad finished their traffic, (which on that occasion, occupied but\r\na _single_ day,) and embarked on their return for Michilimackinac.\r\nBesides the original robbery of a principal trader, which drew upon\r\nthem the name of Pillagers, their intercourse with the traders has been\r\nof a character to require perpetual caution to avoid the recurrence\r\nof serious difficulties. It is but two years ago that they confined\r\na trader to his lodge, and threatened him, in such a manner, that he\r\nwas happy to escape from the country with his life, and has not since\r\nreturned to it.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1821-22, a man named Relle, who was employed at\r\nLeech Lake, to collect credits, as it is termed, entered the lodge\r\nof a hunter named Puganoc i. e. Nutwood, and without much ceremony,\r\nobtained the Indian\xe2\x80\x99s furs. He had as he conceived, got consent which\r\nthe Indian afterwards withdrew. Relle, however, whose business it was\r\nto collect furs for his employer, and who had, from long usage, become\r\nexpert in that employment, did not pay that deference to the Indian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwishes, which he probably would have done, could we suppose that he\r\nconsidered them to indicate any more, than a mere reluctance to part\r\nwith the furs. On this point we are without particular information.\r\nBe this as it may, Relle took up the furs, and proceeded homewards.\r\nPuganoc followed him but without any demonstrations of anger. It might\r\nbe supposed that he intended in make a friendly visit to the post, for\r\nthe purpose of further trading, and Relle evidently so considered the\r\ncircumstance of his accompanying him, for he was wholly unsuspicious of\r\nlatent revenge. Silent as this passion was kept, it burned, however, in\r\nthe Indian\xe2\x80\x99s breast, and, in crossing a lake, on the ice, the Indian\r\ntreading in the hindmost step, (a practice in walking with snow shoes,)\r\nhe suddenly discharged his piece. The ball entered his victim\xe2\x80\x99s back\r\nbelow the shoulders. He fell dead. Puganoc then drew his knife, cut\r\noff two of the voyageur\xe2\x80\x99s fingers, to make it appear that he had been\r\nstruggling with an adversary, then threw down the knife on the snow,\r\nand returned with a report that the man had been killed by the Sioux.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to notice the fate of Puganoc. Attempts for his\r\nsurrender to the civil authorities were made, but without success.\r\nMeantime he was regarded as having forfeited his life by a young\r\nChippewa of his own band, a relative, perhaps, of the deceased\r\nvoyageur\xe2\x80\x99s Indian wife. While assembled to amuse themselves by firing\r\nat a mark, this young man, as it became his turn to fire, saw Puganoc\r\nlifting the cloth door of his tent, and wheeling half a circle in his\r\naim, fired his ball through the neck of the assassin, and killed him on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nPride, and the desire of personal distinction, as in other tribes\r\nwhich have not the light of christianity to guide them, may be\r\nconsidered as lying at the foundation of the Indian character. For\r\nthere are no tribes so poor and remote as not to have pride. And this\r\npassion seems always to be coupled with a desire of applause, and with\r\nthe wish on the part of its possessors to be thought better than they\r\nreally are. We have found pride in the remotest Indian lodge we ever\r\nvisited, and have hardly ever engaged in ten minutes conversation with\r\na northern Indian, without discovering it not only to exist, but, where\r\nthere was moral energy at all, as constituting the primary motive to\r\naction. It has always been found, however, unaccompanied by one of its\r\nmost constant concomitants, in civilised life\xe2\x80\x94namely, the desire of\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nThe workings of this principle may, indeed, be looked upon as the\r\nchief motive of Indian emigration, and as causing tribe to secede\r\nfrom tribe, and leading to that multiplication of petty nations, each\r\nwith some peculiarities of language, which marks the face of the\r\nnorthern regions. Did we possess any thing like a clear and connected\r\ntradition of these migrations, even for a few hundred years, we should\r\nperhaps have cause to blush that so many blunders had been committed\r\nin assigning so many primitive stocks, when, in fact, there is great\r\nreason to believe, that the primitive stocks are few.\r\n\r\nTradition does not reach far, where there is neither pen nor pencil\r\nto perpetuate the memory of events. People who are constantly and\r\nhabitually concerned, how they shall subsist, and what they shall wear,\r\nwill soon forget, in the realities before them, occurrences which can\r\nno longer produce fear or excite hope. And were it otherwise,\xe2\x80\x94were\r\nthey as prone to reflect as they are to act, the very misery in which\r\nthey live, would take away the pleasure of historical reminiscence.\r\nOral history is very uncertain at best. Every repetition varies the\r\nlanguage at least, and it must be a very stoical people, indeed,\r\nwho, in repeating their own story, do not add to the coloring, if\r\nnot the number of circumstances, which serve to give pleasure or to\r\nflatter pride. Unfortunately such appears to have been the state of\r\nthe north-western Indians, as far as we know any thing of them, that\r\nthey could not, in strict truth, repeat very little of their history,\r\nwithout giving pain, or exciting feelings, often of pity, and often\r\nof humiliation. The few favorable points would naturally grow by the\r\nprocess of repetition, out of all proportion. And fiction would often\r\nbe called on, to supply lapses. Hence it is, perhaps, that in looking\r\nover our printed materials for Indian history, we are so apt to find\r\nthat every tribe arrogates to itself the honor of being original,\r\ngreat, brave, magnanimous, above its neighbors. Indeed we regard all\r\nunrecorded Indian tradition, referring to events beyond the close of\r\nthe sixteenth century, as entitled to no confidence.\r\n\r\nThe names the Indians bestowed upon themselves, contain no clue to\r\ntheir early history. They were, for the most part purely accidental, as\r\nthey are at this day. They do not refer to their origin. They do not\r\nin some cases, even signify their peculiarities. This is, we think,\r\nemphatically true of the various tribes of Algonquins. To part of the\r\npeople composing this stock, who were settled in a country abounding\r\nin lakes and streams, they gave the local name of Nipissings, i. e.\r\nPeople of the Place of Waters. Part, who lived on the north shore of\r\nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence, subsisting on fish, they called Popinoshees,\r\nalluding to a kind of fish. Those who dwelt in swampy grounds, (as\r\nbetween that point and Lake Superior,) were called Mushkeegos, from the\r\nname for swamp. Those who lived in plains, south-west of Lake Michigan,\r\nMuscotins, from plain. Others having a peculiarity of intonation, were\r\ncalled Ojibwas, or Chippewas; a band who lit up a council fire for\r\nthemselves, Pottawattomies; another band, given to trading. Ottawas;\r\nanother who inflicted cruelties in their northern wars, Kenistonos;\r\nanother who lived inland, Nopimings. Others might be added to the list.\r\nThese were all identical people; but not one of the name referred to\r\ntheir origin. The French, on their arrival increased the confusion,\r\nby bestowing a new name upon each, rendering the thread of history\r\nmore entangled, and utterly confounding all attempts to trace their\r\naffiliation by etymology. They called the first band whom they found\r\nspeaking this language, on the St. Lawrence, Algonquins, probably\r\nbecause they subsisted on the oga. This term has become generic. But\r\nthere is no light thrown by it on the history of the race. Nay, there\r\nis not a particle of proof that the Indians had bestowed it upon\r\nthemselves, or that it was not given like all their other appellations,\r\nas a mere _nom de guerre_. No wonder should therefore be expressed,\r\nthat classifications founded on etymological proofs should have been\r\nfound defective.\r\n\r\nBut we shall not pursue the subject. The Leech Lake Indians, like\r\nothers of the stock, derive their distinctive appellation from a\r\nmere accident. They are not, however, separated by any distinctive\r\nfeature, from the rest of the more favorably located Chippewas. Their\r\nprominent manners and customs, ceremonies and opinions, are the same.\r\nThey migrated by the same track, adopted the same means of living,\r\nsought the attainment of the same general objects, and speak the same\r\nlanguage. There are minor peculiarities of speech in most of the bands\r\nof this nation, separated by a few hundred miles. But they consist\r\nmostly in accent, with some interchanges of the labial and liquid\r\nconsonants. The vowel sounds are identical. Whatever remarks could be\r\nmade, therefore, on the principles of the language, would be equally\r\napplicable to the current language of other Chippewa bands.\r\n\r\nThis language covers an extensive area in the west, and the\r\nnorth-west. It is emphatically the _court language_ of the Indians,\r\nbeing the medium of communication, in all general councils. Its\r\ncopiousness and freedom from the barbarities which disfigure many of\r\nthe native languages, were remarked at an early day, and have led\r\nto its being more studied and spoken, than perhaps any other native\r\nAmerican language. The regret has been expressed, that where so many\r\ngood points exist, there should be found any defects to mar them. In\r\nits grammatical structure, it exhibits some peculiarities, which do\r\nnot, perhaps, admit of being strictly classed with other transpositive\r\nlanguages, although it has most features in coincidence with them.\r\nOriginally, simple in its character, and consisting of scarcely any\r\ndistinctions of speech, beyond the verb and substantive, and the\r\npronominal and other primary particles, the tendency of usage and\r\ninvention has been, to increase the length of words by combination,\r\nrendering them formidable to the eye, and pompous to the ear. These\r\ncombinations assume almost every shape, in which words can be made\r\nto coalesce. And the primitives when thus united, are still further\r\ncompounded by inflections for time and person, for number and quality,\r\nand sometimes to indicate other circumstances, as if it were the chief\r\nscope of the speaker to concentrate all the offices of speech in a\r\nsingle word, or a single expression. But in this process of accretion,\r\nas might be expected, clearness and simplicity are often sacrificed to\r\nsound, and the distinctions of person, and number, and tense, are not,\r\nperhaps, always accurately preserved. So many letters, and even whole\r\nsyllables, are also dropped, to effect the purposes of a harmonious\r\ncoalescence, agreeably to the Indian ear, that it becomes extremely\r\ndifficult to trace analogies, and one of the usual helps to comparison,\r\nis thus withdrawn. Number is entirely wanting in the third person of\r\nthe declension of their pronouns and nouns, and in the conjugation\r\nof their verbs. Nor is there any distinction to mark the sex of the\r\nthird person, although the first and second persons, are uniformly and\r\nscrupulously thus marked. He and she, him and her, are expressed by the\r\nsame word, or the same pronominal sign. Although there is a positive\r\nand a conditional future, in the conjugation of their verbs, the\r\ncompound tenses, are generally thought to be defective.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these deficiencies, the language admits of many fine\r\nturns of expression, and pointed terms of irony, and in its general\r\nsimplicity, and nervous brevity, will admit of a comparison with some\r\nterms of scripture phraseology. Among its grammatical forms, there\r\nare several, which exhibit beautiful and succinct modes of conveying\r\nthought. All its active verbs can be multiplied as often as there\r\nare distinct objects of their action, and they are conjugated both\r\nnegatively, as well as positively. Substantives admit of adjective\r\nterminations, and adjectives of substantive terminations. Both can\r\nbe turned into verbs, and both are endowed with number. Pronouns are\r\ninflected for time, and in this shape, supply the want of our auxiliary\r\nverbs. The verb, to be, may be said to characterize this language,\r\nas differing from some of the Indian languages, although its use is\r\nrestricted, and there is no declarative existence indicated in the\r\nordinary conjugation of verbs. As all nouns assume verbal terminations,\r\nthey undergo all the modifications of other verbs. Possession is\r\nindicated by an inflection analogous to, but differing from case.\r\nLocality, diminution, and derogation, may be, either separately, or\r\nall together, denoted by inflections of the noun. Particles, are very\r\ncopiously used. And this part of speech is very important, making\r\nthe use of words definite or exact, which without these adjuncts,\r\nwould often lack both coherence and exactitude. Adverbs are liberally\r\nemployed, and by their help, the degrees of comparison are formed.\r\nThere is but one degree of comparison formed by an inflection of the\r\nsubstantive. There is a numerous list of prepositions, which are not,\r\nhowever, disjunctively used, but always as the prefixed syllable or\r\nsyllables, to substantives. Conjunctions, of which the language has\r\na number, are not thus restricted, and cannot thus be used. The most\r\nimportant distinction, however, which belongs to the language, and\r\nthat which most rigidly pervades its forms, is the separation of words\r\ninto two classes, distinguished as _animate_ and _inanimate_, or\r\npersonal and impersonal, carrying also, the idea of noble and ignoble.\r\nThis principle, merges the ordinary distinctions of gender, and\r\nimparts a two-fold character to the verb, substantive, and adjective,\r\nand consequently creates the necessity of double conjugations and\r\ndeclensions. This results from the transitive character of the whole\r\nlanguage, and its habitual application to material objects. The verb\r\nwhich would be used to imply vision, is made to indicate the presence\r\nor absence of vitality, creating the distinction of the _animate_ and\r\n_inanimate_ forms. The same principle interdicts the promiscuous use\r\nof adjectives. A strong man and a strong house, require different\r\nmodifications of the word strong. All its concords are directed to the\r\nupholding of this rule. This novel and curious principle, appears to\r\nlie at the foundation of the syntax, and imparts to the language its\r\nmost marked characteristic feature. Whatever modifications other rules\r\nrequire, they all coincide in this. It is a point which every good\r\nspeaker pays attention to. And as the rule may be arbitrarily employed,\r\nit enables him to invest the whole inanimate creation with life, and\r\nthus to throw a charm over the most barren waste; an advantage which is\r\nvery freely resorted to, in their oral tales and mythological fables.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating such a language, it is impossible to avoid the\r\nobservation of many beauties and many defects. But its beauties do\r\nnot appear to be of a character to entitle them to the enthusiastic\r\nencomiums which have been bestowed upon some of our Indian languages;\r\nnor do its defects and barbarisms merit the depreciating terms\r\nwhich have been applied to others. Truth, in this, as in many other\r\nmetaphysical investigations, will be found to lie in a mean. If there\r\nare forms and expressions suited to call forth the applause of the\r\nspeculative philologist, there are also many features for him to\r\nrectify or condemn. Like the character of the people by whom it is\r\nspoken, its principles are perpetually verging to extremes. There is\r\neither a redundancy of forms creating distinctions, not, in all cases,\r\nof very obvious utility, or an absolute want of them. And the inquirer\r\nis often led to wonder, how a people who require the nice distinctions\r\nin the one case, should be able to dispense with distinctions\r\naltogether in the other.\r\n\r\nFrom this vacillation between barbarism and refinement, poverty and\r\nredundance, a method strictly philosophical or purely accidental,\r\nthere might be reason to infer that the people themselves, by whom the\r\nlanguage is spoken, were formerly in a more advanced and cultivated\r\nstate. And that a language once copious and exact, partaking of the\r\nfortunes of the people, degenerated further and further into barbarism\r\nand confusion, as one tribe after another separated from the parent\r\nstock. Change of accent would alone produce a great diversity of sound.\r\nAccident would give some generic peculiarities: and that permutation\r\nof the consonants, which we see among the Algonquin bands, would, in\r\nthe end, leave little besides the vowel sounds, and the interchangeable\r\nconsonants, to identify tribes long separated by time and by distance,\r\nwithout means of intercommunication, without letters, and without\r\narts. If compared by these principles there is reason to believe,\r\nphilologists would find the primitive languages of America extremely\r\nfew, and their grammatical principles, either identical or partaking\r\nlargely of the same features. And to this result, the tendency of\r\ninquiry on this side the Atlantic is slowly verging, however it may\r\ncontravene the theories of learned and ingenious philologists in\r\nEurope. The inquiry is fraught with deep interest to the philosophical\r\nmind; and it offers a field for intellectual achievement, which it\r\nmay be hoped will not be left uncultivated by the pens of piety,\r\nphilosophy, or genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  _Encampment on a peninsula in Leech Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Departure for the\r\n    portage to the source of the De Corbeau river.\xe2\x80\x94Traverse a\r\n    bay.\xe2\x80\x94Commencement of the portage.\xe2\x80\x94The mode of passing it.\xe2\x80\x94First\r\n    portage to Warpool Lake.\xe2\x80\x94Pass successively Little Long Lake,\r\n    the Four Lakes, Lake of the Mountain, Lake of the Island, and\r\n    encamp at the Kagi Nogumaug or Longwater, the source of the\r\n    De Corbeau.\xe2\x80\x94Are visited by the Chief of the Pillagers, who\r\n    performs a journey for that purpose.\xe2\x80\x94Recognize in his attendant\r\n    the murderer of Gov.

Allen\xe2\x80\x99s command, were left behind to complete the\r\nvaccination of the Indians, while the rest of the party went forward a\r\ncouple of leagues, to form the night\xe2\x80\x99s encampment. It was after seven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock before they came up, and we waited some time after supper,\r\nwhich is generally a late meal in voyaging, for the arrival of the\r\nIndian guides, who had been promised to conduct us next day, to the\r\nlanding of the portage to the river De Corbeau. Morning, however,\r\ncame without them, and we embarked, (18th,) and proceeded towards the\r\nsouthern shore of the lake, under the hope of being able to find the\r\nportage, from the descriptions which had been given of it. Our course\r\nlay, for a distance, along the peninsula, on which we had encamped.\r\nIts trending too far to the east, induced us to hold a southerly\r\ncourse across a spacious bay. On gaining its centre, doubts arose,\r\nas to the proper course. A separation of the party was made. Part of\r\nthe canoes took a south, and part, a south-east course, having agreed\r\nto concentrate on the firing of a gun, a signal which was eventually\r\ngiven, by the southern canoes under Mr. Johnston and Lieut. Allen.\r\nThey had discovered a path, having every appearance of a portage,\r\nbeing in the required direction. Examination served to confirm this\r\nopinion. The baggage was immediately landed, the loose articles put\r\nin a portable shape, and the order of march on a portage, taken up.\r\nFor this purpose, every article of the outfit, is originally put up\r\nin the most compact and convenient form, not exceeding ninety pounds\r\nweight. Pork is packed in kegs, flour in sail cloth bags, groceries\r\nin wooden or tin canisters, goods in corded bales. These are carried\r\non the back, by a strong strap of leather passed around the forehead,\r\nand tied by its tapering ends, to the bag, or other article, forming\r\nthe first, or lower piece. This is swung over the shoulders, and other\r\npieces laid on, to the number of two, or sometimes three, according to\r\nthe carrier\xe2\x80\x99s strength. He then bends strongly forward, and proceeds\r\nat a half trot. He goes on the length of a _pause_, say half a mile,\r\nwhere the burden is put down, the strap untied, and the carrier, after\r\na few moments rest, briskly returns, for another load. This process is\r\ncontinued till all the goods, are brought up to the first _pause_. The\r\ncanoe and its apparatus, are then brought up, when the men commence\r\nmaking the second _pause_, and this order is repeated at every _pause_.\r\nThis is a severe labor, and requires able bodied men, well practiced.\r\nAnd where the ground is low or swampy and often travelled, it soon\r\nbecomes a perfect bed of mire.\r\n\r\nThe present portage, however, was found to lie across a pine plain,\r\noffering a clean beach of sand to debark on, and a dry smooth path to\r\ntravel. A portage of 1,078 yards, brought us to the banks of a small\r\nlake, after crossing which we came to the entrance of a small clear\r\nbrook, having not over two or three inches depth of water, spread over\r\na bed of yellow sand. It seemed impossible to ascend it, especially\r\nwith the larger canoe, but by the men\xe2\x80\x99s first carrying the lading, by\r\nwidening the channel in cutting down the banks with paddles, and then\r\nby walking in the stream and lifting the canoe by its gunnels, they\r\nsucceeded in getting it up to another lake, called Little Long Lake. We\r\nwere twenty-four minutes in crossing this latter lake, and found its\r\ninlet to be connected with four other small lakes of a pondy character,\r\nredolent with nymph\xc3\xa6 odorata, through which we successively passed,\r\nand debarked at the head of the last lake on a shaking bog, being the\r\ncommencement of portage _Ple_. This portage is quite short and dry,\r\nlies over a hill-prairie, and terminates on the banks of a transparent,\r\nbowl-shaped lake, with elevated shores, where we made our breakfast,\r\nat twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock. This lake, which we may refer to as the Lake of the\r\nMountains, notwithstanding the liveliness and purity of its waters, has\r\nno visible outlet, a characteristic of which it partakes in common with\r\na very great number of the small lakes of this quarter, which may be\r\nsupposed to lie in aluminous strata. Next, in the order of travelling\r\nsouth of it, is the Mountain Portage, appropriately so called. Its\r\nextent is nine hundred and ten yards. The elevation is considerable,\r\nbut no rock strata appear in situ. The soil is diluvial, with boulders.\r\nThe growth, yellow pine, with small maples and underbrush. It\r\nterminates on the Lake of the Island. There is then a portage of two\r\npauses, or 1,960 yards into another lake, quite pond-like, where it is\r\nfirst entered, but assuming a clear and bright surface after turning a\r\nprominent point. There is then a further portage of one pause, a part\r\nof it, through a morass, but terminating on highlands, surrounding\r\nthe head and shores of a handsome and comparatively extensive sheet\r\nof water called Kagi Nogumaug, or The Long Water, where we encamped\r\nfor the night. This day\xe2\x80\x99s journey was a hard and fatiguing one, to\r\nthe men. The Gueule Plat, who with one of the minor chiefs from Leech\r\nLake, overtook us on the banks of the Lake of the Island, expressed his\r\nsurprise that, with all our baggage and heavy canoes, we had pushed\r\non so far. It was, however, a definite point in the journey. We were\r\nnow on the source of the Kag\xc3\xa1gi, or De Corbeau river. To have stopped\r\nshort of it, would have seriously broken in on the labors of the\r\nfollowing day; and the knowledge that the series of portages terminated\r\nthere, and the downward passage commenced, buoyed up the men to make\r\nexertions. The day was particularly severe upon the soldiers, who were\r\nless accustomed to this species of fatigue. Never were the shadows\r\nof night more grateful to men, who had employed the morning, and the\r\nnoon, and the evening of the day, in hard labor. We had now reached\r\nthe _fourth_ source of the primary rivers of the Mississippi, and all\r\nheading on the elevation of the Hauteur des Terres, within a circle\r\nof perhaps seventy miles. These sources are Itasca Lake, its primary,\r\nOssowa, east fork, Shiba Lake and river, source of Leech Lake, and the\r\npresent source, The Long Water, being the source of the De Corbeau, or\r\nCrow-wing river.\r\n\r\nGueule Plat, with his Indian secretary, so to call him, or Mishinowa,\r\nand their families, came and encamped with us. The chief said that he\r\nhad many things to speak of, for which he had found no time during my\r\nvisit. I invited him to sup with the party. Conversation on various\r\ntopics ensued, and the hour of midnight imperceptibly arrived, before\r\nhe thought of retiring to his own lodge. I was rather confirmed in the\r\nfavorable opinions I have before expressed of him, and particularly\r\nin the ordinary, sober routine of his reflections, and the habitual,\r\neasy manner, which he evinced of arriving at correct conclusions. I\r\ncould not say as much for his companion and pipe-lighter, Maji Gabowi,\r\na very tall, gaunt, and savage looking warrior, who appeared to be\r\nmade up, body and mind, of sensualities. And although he appeared to\r\nbe quiet and passive, and uttered not a single expression that implied\r\npassion or vindiction, I could not divest my mind of the recollection\r\nthat I was in company with the murderer of Gov. Semple. Whoever has\r\ngiven much attention to north-western affairs, will recollect that\r\nthis event occurred in the fierce strife carried on between the North\r\nWest and Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company. And that, in the desperate struggles\r\nwhich these corporations made for the possession of the fur trade, the\r\nIndians often became the dupes of whichever party appeared, at the\r\nmoment, to possess the power of influencing them. The event referred\r\nto, took place near the close of a long struggle in which the spirit of\r\nopposition had reached its acme, in which company was furiously arrayed\r\nagainst company, charter against charter, and agent against agent. A\r\nperiod, at which, like the increasing energies of two powerful bodies\r\nmoving towards each other, they were destined to come into violent\r\ncontact, and the destruction of one, or both, seemed inevitable. The\r\ndispute respecting territory which imbittered the strife, appeared to\r\nbe carried on, not so much from political ambition or the intrinsic\r\nvalue of the soil, as to decide which party should have the exclusive\r\nright of gleaning from the lodges of the unfortunate natives, the only\r\ncommodity worth disputing for\xe2\x80\x94their furs and peltries. A question, in\r\nwhich the Indians, in reality, had no other interest, but that which a\r\nserf may be supposed to feel on an exchange of masters, in which he has\r\nneither the right to choose nor the power to reject. Whichever party\r\nprevailed, they were sure to loose or gain nothing, if they kept aloof\r\nfrom the contest, or if they had any hopes from its effects upon their\r\ncondition, they arose more from a prolongation, than a termination of\r\nthe rivalry, as they were sure to fare better, both \xe2\x80\x9cin script and\r\nstore,\xe2\x80\x9d so long as they possessed the option of rival markets.\r\n\r\nSemple had accepted a governorship, which the late John Johnston, Esq.\r\nhad the forecast to refuse. He appeared to be a man zealously devoted\r\nto the objects of the company (the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay) whose interests were\r\ncommitted to him. But he does not appear clearly to have perceived\r\nthe great difference which circumstances had interposed between a\r\nmagistracy in an English or Scottish county, and the naked solitudes\r\nof Red River. He sallied forth himself, with a considerable retinue,\r\nto read the riot act, to a disorderly and threatening assembly of all\r\nkinds of a northwest population, on the plains. The agents and factors\r\nof the North West Fur Company, were accused of being at the bottom\r\nof this uproar, and it is certain that some of their servants were\r\nengaged, either as actors or abettors. It is among the facts recorded\r\nin a court of justice, that when certain of the clerks or partners of\r\nthe North West Company heard of the tragic result of this sally, they\r\nshouted for joy.[17]\r\n\r\nWhile the act was in the process of being read, one of the rioters\r\nfired his piece. This was taken as a signal. A promiscuous and\r\nscattering firing commenced. Semple was one of the first who received a\r\nwound. He was shot in the thigh, and fell from his horse. He was unable\r\nto sit up. At this moment a rush was made by the Indians in the North\r\nWest interest, and a total and most disastrous route of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBay party ensued. Panic, in its wildest forms, seized upon Semple\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmen. He was himself one of the first victims despatched. Maji Gabowi,\r\n(one of our guests this evening) coming up, struck his tomahawk in his\r\nhead. He was then scalped.\r\n\r\nWe embarked at sunrise, on the 19th, bidding adieu to the Leech Lake\r\nchief and his companion, who returned from this point, after having\r\nrequested, and received a lancet, with directions from Dr. Houghton,\r\nfor vaccinating such of his people as had not been present on the 17th.\r\nWe were forty minutes in passing the Kagi Nogumaug, which is a handsome\r\nsheet of pure water presenting a succession of sylvan scenery. Its\r\noutlet is a narrow brook overhung with alders. It may average a width\r\nof six feet, but the bends are so extremely abrupt, and the channel so\r\nnarrowed with brushwood, that it became necessary to dig down the acute\r\npoints, and to use the axe in cutting away branches, to veer about a\r\ncanoe thirty-two feet in length. We were just half an hour in clearing\r\nthis passage, when the stream opened into another lake, denominated on\r\nour travelling map, Little Vermillion Lake. The growth on the banks\r\nof this lake is birch and aspen, with pines in the distance. We were\r\ntwenty minutes in passing it. The outlet is full doubled in width, and\r\nfree from the embarrassments encountered above. Tamarack is a frequent\r\ntree on the shores, and the pond lily, flag and Indian reed, appear in\r\nthe stream. This outlet is followed about eight miles, where it expands\r\ninto a small lake, called Birch Lake, which we were only thirteen\r\nminutes in passing. Its outlet exhibits a pebbly bottom, interspersed\r\nwith boulders, which produce so much inequality in the depth, that the\r\nmen were obliged often to wade. Not more than seven or eight minutes\r\nwere thus occupied, in the course of which we passed through a broken\r\nfish-dam, when we entered another expanse called _Lac Ple_.\r\n\r\nLac Ple is about three and a half, or four miles long. Vegetation here\r\nappears to show a more southerly character. Part of its shores are\r\nprairie, interspersed with small pines. It is particularly deserving\r\nof notice, as being the point, from which a series of portages is made\r\nto Ottertail Lake. A map of these furnished by the traders, who often\r\nuse this route, exhibits the following features. First, a portage of\r\nfour pauses, to Island Lake, then a portage of one pause, into a small\r\nlake, which has an outlet, through another small lake into Lake Lagard,\r\nhaving a transverse position. Thence half a pause, into a small lake, a\r\npause and a half into another small lake, and thence four pauses into\r\nMigiskun Aiaub, or Fish-line Lake. Thence one pause into Pine Lake, and\r\nfive into a small river which falls into Scalp Lake. The latter has\r\nan outlet which expands into three lakes, at nearly equal distances\r\napart, and is finally received by Lac Terrehaut, on the Height of Land.\r\nThe outlet of the latter is twice expanded into the form of a Lake,\r\nthe last of which is, from its peculiarities called the Two Lakes,\r\nand is finally discharged west of the Height of Land, into Ottertail\r\nLake. I had designed to come down this route, or down Leaf river, had\r\ncircumstances favored my going into Red river, from the sources of the\r\nMississippi. But these sources were found so much further south, than\r\nit had been supposed, and so considerably removed from any practicable\r\nroute into Red river that I found it would be a consumption of time\r\naltogether disproportionate to the anticipated results; and it was,\r\ntherefore, given up.\r\n\r\nOn going out of Lac Ple, the channel exhibits numerous fresh water\r\nshells driven up against the shore, or lodged against inequalities\r\nin the bottom.[18] And these productions are afterwards seen in all\r\nthe subsequent outlets which connect the numerous lakes of this\r\nriver. But little variety was, however, noticed among the species,\r\nalthough greater attention than we could bestow, might elicit new\r\ncharacteristics. Generally, they were small, or middle sized, often\r\ndecorticated and broken. Soon after entering this channel, one of my\r\nmen fired at, and brought down, a fork-tailed hawk, a species which\r\nhad before been noticed on the wing, but we had now an opportunity of\r\ncloser scrutiny. We did not observe any characteristics in which it\r\ndiffered from the described species. And if we except the numerous\r\nspecies of duck, the colomba migratoris, catbird, and some other land\r\nspecies almost equally common, this constitutes the substance of our\r\nobservations, on the birds of this river. We saw the deer, of which\r\nthere are apparently two species. And we had frequent occasion to\r\nobserve the antlers and bones of these animals around deserted camps,\r\nevincing their abundance in this part of the country.\r\n\r\nWe had been three fourths of an hour in descending this outlet,\r\nwhen we entered a lake called Boutwell, with banks of rather sombre\r\nvegetation, which we were nineteen minutes in passing. Its outlet, of\r\na spreading, sandy, shelly character, is about a mile and a half in\r\nextent, at which distance it expands into Lac Vieux Desert, or the Lake\r\nof the Old Wintering Ground, where we halted long enough to prepare\r\nbreakfast. This lake we were twenty-six minutes in passing through.\r\nIts outlet is about two miles long, where it again expands into a lake\r\nof about two and a quarter miles extent, which may, from its position,\r\nbe denominated Summit Lake. The course, which, from the Kagi Nogumaug,\r\nis thus far generally south-west, here suddenly veers to the east and\r\nnortheast, and after a striking circuit, comes round to the south-east,\r\nand eventually again to the south-west, before its junction with Shell\r\nRiver. And the stream which thus far seems to have its course on a\r\nlevel or summit, is here deflected into a valley, and is beset with\r\nrapids, and by the flood wood lodged upon its banks, and their partial\r\ndenudation, puts on the appearance of a stream which must sometimes\r\nassume the fury of a torrent. It probably, at such times, is a turbid\r\nstream, but was now clear with a gravelly bottom. We were hurried along\r\nthrough this channel for the space of two hours and fifteen minutes,\r\nwhen it expanded into Long-rice Lake. We were thirty-five minutes in\r\npassing this lake. Shortly below it, the channel expands again into a\r\nlake, which from Lieut. Allen\xe2\x80\x99s exploring it, we called Allen\xe2\x80\x99s Lake.\r\nIt is probably the largest of the series below the Kagi Nogumaug. It\r\nreceives a tributary from the northwest, which was visited by Lieut.\r\nAllen.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere had for some time admonished us of a storm, and it\r\nbroke upon us, on entering this lake. Dark clouds rolled over each\r\nother, until the light of day was sensibly and suddenly obscured. We\r\nhave seldom known an equal quantity of the electric fluid discharged\r\nin so short a space of time, or with the incessant repetition of an\r\nelectric light, so subtle and painful to be endured. The rain fell in\r\na heavy and continued torrent, and it began with gusts of wind which\r\nthrew the canoe-men into alarm. They veered the canoe for the nearest\r\nshore, but before reaching it, the tempest settled, and the rain fell\r\nless violently. We therefore, continued our way without landing, and\r\npassed out of the lake. A short channel, on the banks of which the\r\nelm and oak appeared conspicuously, terminated in a moderate sized\r\nlake of handsomely elevated hard wood and pine shores, for which, as\r\nour maps afforded neither Indian nor French name, we made use of the\r\ncircumstance of Mr. Johnston\xe2\x80\x99s landing to fire at a deer, to name it\r\nafter him. On going out of this lake, we had our attention excited\r\nby an unextinguished fire, on the banks of the outlet. But no person\r\nappeared, nor was there any canoe ashore, nor lodge-poles, which there\r\nwould have been, in the case of a travelling Chippewa family. These\r\nevidences were deemed conclusive by the canoe-men, of the presence of\r\nSioux, who, it is supposed, perceiving the character of the party,\r\nhad concealed themselves. And the circumstance was suited to alarm\r\na class of men, who, being of the Gallic-Chippewa race, retain very\r\nstrong attachments to the Chippewas, and have imbibed with very little\r\nabatement, all the prejudices which this people feel for a powerful\r\nhereditary enemy.\r\n\r\nAn hour\xe2\x80\x99s voyage from this spot brought us to the entrance and merely\r\nto the entrance of the eleventh, and last lake of the series called\r\nKaichibo Sagitowa, or the Lake which the River passes through one End\r\nof, or Lake Leelina. Not many miles below this point, the river forms\r\nits first forks, by the junction of Shell river, a considerable stream\r\nof nearly equal size with itself. Below this point, there is always\r\nwater enough, although the channel exhibits numerous rapids, and is\r\noften spread over a wide bed, giving rise to shallows. We descended\r\nabout fourteen miles below the junction, and encamped. It was after\r\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock when we put ashore. The rain had fallen, with steadiness\r\nfor some hours previous. And the flashes of lightning, which lit up the\r\nsombre channel of the stream, excited a feeling of no very pleasant\r\nkind. We landed wet, cold and cheerless. The rain continued to fall.\r\nBut the cheerfulness and activity of our canoe-men did not desert them.\r\nThey searched among the prostrate vegetation, to discover dry fibres,\r\nor the unwetted parts that could be pulled from the nether rind of\r\nfallen trees. They ignited the mass with spunk, and soon sent up the\r\ngladdening flames of an ample camp fire. To pitch the tent, arrange\r\nits interior furniture, and place the heavy baggage under oil-cloths,\r\nsecure from rain, or night dews, is the work of a few moments with\r\nthese people\xe2\x80\x94and he who would travel fast over an intricate interior\r\nroute and be well served on the way, should not fail to prepare himself\r\nwith a canoe _all\xc3\xa9ge_ and a crew of _voyag\xc3\xa8urs_. They will not only\r\ngo, when they are bid to go, but they will go unmurmuringly. And after\r\nsubmitting to severe labor, both of the night and day, on land and\r\nwater, they are not only ready for further efforts, but will make them\r\nunder the enlivening influence of a song.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  _Further descent of the De Corbeau.\xe2\x80\x94Remarks on its general\r\n    course and character.\xe2\x80\x94Junction of Leaf and Long Prairie\r\n    Rivers.\xe2\x80\x94The latter pursued by the Pillagers in their wars\r\n    against the Sessitons and Yanktons.\xe2\x80\x94Cause of the appellation of\r\n    Mukkundwa.\xe2\x80\x94Their robbery of Berti, and assertion of a belligerent\r\n    principle.\xe2\x80\x94Forest trees of the De Corbeau.\xe2\x80\x94Monotony of its\r\n    scenery.\xe2\x80\x94Meeting with a Chippewa hunter.\xe2\x80\x94Arrival at the mouth\r\n    of the river, and entrance of the Mississippi.\xe2\x80\x94Concourse of\r\n    Indians assembled at that point.\xe2\x80\x94Council with them.\xe2\x80\x94Sketch of the\r\n    speeches of Grosse Gueule, Soangikumig, and White Fisher.\xe2\x80\x94Arrival\r\n    of the Pierced Prairie.\xe2\x80\x94First intelligence of the breaking out of\r\n    the Sauc War.\xe2\x80\x94Close of the Narrative.\xe2\x80\x94Notice of the effects of\r\n    the disuse of ardent spirits by the men, and the observance of\r\n    the Sabbath._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ensuing portion of our voyage down this stream, occupied a day and\r\na half, during which we probably descended a hundred and twenty miles.\r\nIts general course, from the forks, is south-east. It is swelled by\r\ntwo principal tributaries from the west, called Leaf and Long Prairie\r\nrivers, each of which brings in an ample volume, and both bear the\r\nimpress of draining an extensive area. On the other bank, it is joined\r\nby the Kioshk, or Gull River, a stream of inferior size. Lesser streams\r\nor creeks, were noticed at several points, on either shore, by which\r\nthe mass of water is considerably augmented. Altogether it is a stream\r\nof noble size, and is driven on through a diluvial formation, with a\r\nvelocity indicating no small ratio of descent. There is no part of it,\r\nwhich can be called still water; much of it is rapid. For about seventy\r\nmiles below the junction of Shell River, there is a regular series of\r\ndistinct rapids, in each of which, the descent is several feet, and\r\nit requires dexterity to avoid running against the boulders, or \xe2\x80\x9clost\r\nrocks,\xe2\x80\x9d which shew themselves above the water. Below the junction\r\nof Leaf River, this characteristic becomes less noticeable, and it\r\ndisappears entirely, below the entrance of the Long Prairie branch.\r\nIts banks are elevated, presenting to the eye, a succession of pine\r\nforests, on the one hand, and an alluvial bend, bearing elms and soft\r\nmaple, on the other. There is a small willow island about eighteen\r\nmiles below the junction of Shell river, and several small elm islands\r\nin its central parts; but nothing at all comparable, in size, soil and\r\ntimber, with the large and noted island, called _Isle De Corbeau_,\r\nwhich marks its junction with the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nLong Prairie River is the avenue through which the Chippewas ascend, in\r\ntheir war excursions against the Sessitons and Yanktons. And many tales\r\nare related of mishaps and adventures on this stream, and the plains\r\ncontiguous to it. Some of these it may be supposed, are _tales_ merely.\r\nOthers are the events of Indian history. But truth and fiction appear\r\nto be so blended in the accounts, that the separation of the one, from\r\nthe other, must be often difficult, if not impossible. The recent war\r\nparty, of which we saw one of the trophies, while encamped on the\r\nisland of Colcaspi, went up this river in canoes. They encountered the\r\nSioux, as they affirm, coming out against them. A fight ensued in the\r\nprairies, and was continued with changes of position throughout the\r\nday. Three Sioux and one Chippewa fell. The Sioux withdrew to a more\r\nremote position near their village. And the Chippewas returned to exult\r\nover the scalps of their enemy, and to meditate another blow. We saw\r\nseveral traces of this war party in our descent of the De Corbeau, in\r\ntheir places of hasty encampment, and also in remains of very small\r\nfires, tracks in landing on an open sand bank, and abandoned canoes,\r\nstranded and partly sunk, on the shores.\r\n\r\nThis war, between the Chippewas and Sioux, appears to be of ancient\r\norigin. It is at least coeval with the discovery of the country.\r\nAlthough the Chippewas are confessedly conquerors of the country they\r\npossess on this border, the conquests are of remote date. For the\r\nFrench, in exploring northward, found them already seated here. The\r\npart the Leech Lake Indians have played in this war, has rendered\r\nthem conspicuous in their nation, and as before indicated, led to\r\nthe appellation of Mukkundwais, or Pillagers, by which they are\r\ndistinctively known. The circumstances which imposed upon them this\r\nname, are these.\r\n\r\nTradition asserts that in the interval which happened between\r\nthe first attack on the French power in Canada, and the final\r\nacknowledgment of English supremacy, great irregularities existed\r\nin the fur trade in this quarter. The French were loved by the\r\nIndians, and naturally retained their influence to the last. And when\r\nthe English entered the field of the trade, they were essentially\r\ndependent upon French clerks, and wholly so, on French or Canadian\r\nboatmen. During this era, a Mr. Berti entered the country, with a\r\nlarge assortment of goods. He took his station at the mouth of the De\r\nCorbeau, where he carried on a lucrative trade with the Chippewas. He\r\nhad, however, more goods than these had furs to purchase, and among\r\nthem, guns and ammunition, which he very well knew would find a ready\r\nsale among the Sioux. But, the Leech Lake Indians, forbid his going\r\ninto the Sioux country, alleging that the Sioux were their enemies, and\r\nthat the putting of guns and powder in their hands, would be to join\r\ntheir cause. Mr. Berti did not probably consider these declarations\r\nas absolutely final, for he proceeded towards the mouth of the Long\r\nPrairie River, in order to go to the Sioux. The result, however, was\r\nmost disastrous to him. This band arrested his progress, and with arms\r\nin their hands, robbed him of all his goods without discrimination, but\r\nspared his own life and the lives of his men, who were suffered to go\r\nback, with their private effects. Mr. Berti was probably overwhelmed by\r\nthis misfortune, for he never returned from the country, but soon after\r\nthis event, died a natural death, and was buried in the region about\r\nSandy Lake.\r\n\r\nThe forest of this fork of the Mississippi, abounds in almost every\r\nvariety of the pine family. We observed the sugar maple less frequently\r\non our whole route, than would be inferred from the knowledge,\r\nthat this tree is spread over the sources of the Mississippi, and\r\nflourishes, even in its most northern latitudes; and that the sugar\r\nmade from it, is relied on by the Indians, as one of the regular of the\r\nminor means of their subsistence. This may be accounted for, perhaps\r\nsatisfactorily, from knowing that river alluvions, and low grounds\r\ngenerally, are unfavorable to its growth. Its true position is the\r\nuplands, to which the Indians are known to resort, in the season of\r\nsugar making. Other species of the maple, frequently exhibited their\r\nsoft foliage, over the stream, together with the elm, and the ash, and\r\nsome varieties of the oak. Pine is, however, by far the most abundant\r\nand valuable timber tree, disclosed along the immediate banks of this\r\nriver, and it affords a repository of this species, which will be\r\nmuch resorted to, when the agricultural plains above the falls of St.\r\nAnthony, shall teem with their destined population.\r\n\r\nThe mere exhibition of woods and waters, however inspiring in their\r\neffects, is not sufficient to keep the attention from flagging, if\r\nthere be no striking succession of variety in their character. It\r\nseems not less a physical, than a moral truth, that \xe2\x80\x9cuniformity will\r\ntire, though it be uniformity of excellence.\xe2\x80\x9d The eye is perpetually\r\nsearching for something new, and however it may have been with other\r\nexplorers, I think we may venture to say, that with us, novelty has\r\nbeen a far more constant or immediate passion, than utility. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clightning splintered\xe2\x80\x9d pine, which raises its dead arms, amid the\r\nliving foliage, is suited to call forth a remark. The waterfowl with a\r\ntuft, or the shell with a deep cicatrice or a pearly interior, gives\r\noccasion for interrupting the silence, that plainer species would have\r\nleft unbroken. And it is this search for something distinctive or\r\npeculiar, that gives an edge to the zeal of discovery.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of our voyage down this river, towards noon the\r\nmonotony of its incidents, was relieved by descrying an Indian canoe,\r\nascending the channel before us. A simultaneous yell of recognition,\r\nboth from it, and from our men, shewed the accuracy, with which each\r\ncould identify, on a first glance, and at a distance, the approach of\r\nfriends, for it proved to be a Chippewa with his family. Our flag-staff\r\nwas instantly placed in its socket, in the stern of the canoe, and the\r\ndistance between us and them, made to appear less, under the influence\r\nof _un chanson du voyageur_. The Indian, who, on reaching him, seemed\r\npleased, informed us that we were at no great distance from the mouth\r\nof the river, where the Sandy Lake and Mille Lac bands were assembled,\r\nawaiting our arrival. And that the count, by which they were assured of\r\nthe day appointed for meeting them, would be finished with the setting\r\nof this day\xe2\x80\x99s sun. We had pushed forward to attain the object, and were\r\nhighly gratified, that it had pleased a favoring Providence, to enable\r\nus to keep our word, with them. Every face in this canoe, appeared to\r\nwear a smile, and the _maja! maja!_ which the owner of it uttered on\r\nparting, conveyed with a truth, which could hardly be mistaken, the\r\nequivalent English sentiment of \xe2\x80\x9cGod speed you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the distance was easily despatched. We reached\r\nthe parting of the channels, which encloses the large island of _De\r\nCorbeau_, about twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock. On issuing out of the upper channel,\r\nand entering the broad current of the majestic Mississippi, we beheld\r\nthe opposite shore lined with Indian lodges, with the American flag\r\nconspicuously displayed. The Indians commenced firing a salute the\r\ninstant we hove in sight, and continued it, with yells of joy, to the\r\nmoment of our landing. A throng then crowded the banks, among whom I\r\nrecognized the two principal chiefs, who, with their retinue, evinced,\r\nboth by word and act, the gratification they felt; not only at the\r\nmeeting, but the punctuality with which it had been observed. We were\r\ngratified on being told, within a few hours of our arrival, that our\r\ncanoe, with the goods and supplies from Sandy Lake, was in sight; and\r\nsoon found the event verified, in the safe arrival of the men, and the\r\nlanding of the packages.\r\n\r\nBeing thus enabled to proceed with the council, it was determined\r\nimmediately to assemble the Indians, and state to them, in a more full\r\nand formal manner than had been done at Sandy Lake, the objects of the\r\nvisit. On closing the address, the presents and provisions designed\r\nfor these bands, were issued to them. Kwiwizainsish, or the Grosse\r\nGueule, Soangikumig, or the Strong Ground, White Fisher, and the son of\r\nPugusainjigun, were the principal speakers in reply. The peculiarities\r\nin the speech of each, may be adverted to.\r\n\r\nThe Grosse Gueule, observed, that, as the line was a question between\r\nthe Chippewas and Sioux, a firm peace could never exist, until the line\r\nwas surveyed and marked, so that each party could see where it ran.\r\nThis was wanted in the section of country, immediately west of them.\r\nThe Sioux, were in the habit of trespassing on it. And when their own\r\nhunters went out, in the pursuit of game, they did not like to stop\r\nshort of the game, and they saw no marked line to stop them. He said\r\nthat it had been promised at the treaty at Prairie du Chien, that\r\nthe line should be run, and he wished me to convey his words on the\r\nsubject, to the President. He was in favor of peace now as he had been,\r\nwhen he had met the Government in council at Tipisagi, and at Fond du\r\nLac.\r\n\r\nSoangikumig,[19] said, through his brother, that he had taken a part in\r\ndefending the lines. He hoped that they might be made plain, so that\r\neach party could see them. As it was, a perpetual pretence was given,\r\nfor crossing the path, (or lines.) It must be expected that the peace\r\nwould often be broken, when it could be, so easily.\r\n\r\nWabojeeg, or the White Fisher, stated that he had given his influence\r\nto peace counsels. He had been present at the treaty of Fond du Lac.\r\nThe Sandy Lake Indians had been lately reproached, as it were, for\r\ntheir pacific character, by hearing the Leech Lake war party passing\r\nso near to them. (This party went up Long Prairie River.) He hoped the\r\nsame advice given to Chippewas, would be given to Sioux. If the Sioux\r\nwould not _come_ over the lines, they, (the Chippewas,) would not\r\n_go_ over them. He thought the lines might have been differently run.\r\nTheir hunters always came out of Sauc river, which had been given up\r\nto the Sioux. But as they had been agreed to, by their old Chiefs, who\r\nwere now gone, (he referred particularly to the late Katawabida, and\r\nBabisikundadi,) it would be best to let them remain.\r\n\r\nNittum Egabowa, or the Front Standing Man, confined his speech to\r\npersonal topics. He said the medal he wore, and by virtue of which, he\r\nclaimed the Chieftainship, had been presented to his deceased father,\r\nat the treaty of Prairie du Chien. He presented a pipe.\r\n\r\nAscertaining the trading house of a Mr. Baker to be near our\r\nencampment, after closing the council, we embarked and descended the\r\nMississippi about eighteen miles to _Prairie Pierc\xc3\xa9e_. Intelligence had\r\nreached this place a few days before, by way of St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s, of open\r\nhostilities among the Saucs and Foxes, and we here saw a western paper,\r\ngiving an account of an action with the militia on River Rock, the\r\nmurder of St. Vrain, the agent for these tribes, and other particulars\r\nindicating the frontier to be irretrievably plunged into an Indian war.\r\n\r\nAt this point, (i. e. the mouth of the De Corbeau) a remote point\r\nin our north-western geography, the route, of which the preceeding\r\nsketches give an outline, intersects that of the expedition to the\r\nsources of the Mississippi, under the direction of the present\r\nSecretary of War, Gov. Cass, in 1820. And in order that no part of the\r\npresent volume may be considered as going over grounds pre-occupied by\r\nthe details embraced in our \xe2\x80\x9cNarrative Journal of Travels,\xe2\x80\x9d the account\r\nof the present expedition is here terminated.\r\n\r\nIn submitting it to the public, it is conceived suitable to remark,\r\nthat it has been accomplished, from beginning to end, without the use\r\nof so much as a drop of ardent spirits, of any kind, either by the\r\nmen upon whom the fatigues of the labor fell, or by the gentlemen who\r\ncomposed the exploring party. This fact itself might be deemed an empty\r\nannunciation, were it not in my power to add the gratifying result,\r\nthat no diminution of the strength or capacity of the men to perform\r\ntheir labor has been, at any time experienced; nor has any sickness\r\nat all supervened. At no stage of the journey, have the men, who were\r\noriginally engaged with a distinct understanding on this point, asked\r\nfor or required any liquor, or evinced any murmuring that it had been\r\nexcluded from the supplies. But even, where the labor was most severe,\r\non portages, in morasses, or in crossing highlands, they have evinced\r\na readiness, a cheerfulness, and an ability for sustaining continued\r\nfatigue, which has often been the subject of remark and commendation by\r\nthe party. Often when the day\xe2\x80\x99s work was done, when they had labored\r\nhard at the paddle or carrying-strap, and sometimes when even a portion\r\nof the night had been added to it, they showed a joyful spirit in\r\nthe encampment. And they frequently went to gather wood, after such\r\nfatigues, for supplying the night fires, with the boatman\xe2\x80\x99s song.\r\n\r\nAnother fact, may, with equal pleasure, be recorded, and it seems\r\nintimately connected, in its influence with the preceeding. No Sabbath\r\nday was employed in travelling. It was laid down as a principle, to\r\nrest on that day, and wherever it overtook us, whether on the land,\r\nor on the water, the men knew that their labor would cease, and\r\nthat the day would be given them for rest. Such of them as felt the\r\ninclination, had the further privilege of hearing a portion of the\r\nscriptures read, or expounded, or uniting in other devotional rites.\r\nThere were but a few hours of a single morning and a few hours of a\r\nsingle evening, of separate Sabbaths, at distant points, which were\r\nnecessarily employed in reaching particular places. And the use of\r\nthese appeared to be unavoidable under the particular circumstances of\r\nour local position. It may, perhaps, be thought, that the giving up of\r\none seventh part of the whole time, employed on a public expedition\r\nin a very remote region, and with many men to subsist, must have, in\r\nthis ratio, increased the time devoted to the route. But the result\r\nwas far otherwise. The time devoted to recruit the men, not only gave\r\nthe surgeon of the party an opportunity to heal up the bruises and\r\nchafings they complained of, but it replenished them with strength;\r\nthey commenced the week\xe2\x80\x99s labor with renewed zest, and this zest was,\r\nin a measure, kept up by the reflection, that the ensuing Sabbath\r\nwould be a day of rest. It was found by computing the whole route,\r\nand comparing the time employed, with that which had been devoted on\r\nsimilar routes, in this part of the world, that an equal space had been\r\ngone over, in less time, than it had ever been known to be performed,\r\nby loaded canoes, or (as the fact is) by light canoes, before. And the\r\nwhole expedition, its incidents and results, have been of a character\r\nfurnishing strong reasons for uniting in ascriptions of praise to that\r\nEternal Power, who hath been our shield from \xe2\x80\x9cthe pestilence that\r\nwalketh in darkness, and from the destruction that wasteth at noon-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           EXPLORATORY TRIP\r\n                              THROUGH THE\r\n                        ST. CROIX AND BURNTWOOD\r\n                          (OR BRUL\xc3\x89) RIVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _S\xe1\xb5\x97. CROIX AND MISACODA OR BURNTWOOD RIVERS._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        INTRODUCTORY MEMORANDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The principal points at which the waters of the Mississippi river\r\n  communicate, by interlocking rivers and portages, with the lakes,\r\n  are the following, proceeding from south to north, namely,\r\n\r\n  1. By the Illinois and Chicago Creek, (with Lake Michigan.)\r\n\r\n  2. By the Wisconsin and Fox Rivers, (with Green Bay.)\r\n\r\n  3. By the Chippewa and Mushkee (or Mauvais) Rivers, (with Lake\r\n  Superior.)\r\n\r\n  4. By the St. Croix and Burntwood (or Brul\xc3\xa9) Rivers, (do.)\r\n\r\n  5. By the Savanne and St. Louis Rivers, (do.)\r\n\r\n  The routes by the Illinois, and by the Wisconsin, were first\r\n  laid open by French enterprise, and have been used for canoes\r\n  and flat-bottomed boats in their natural state, and without any\r\n  practical improvement which as yet, facilitates the communication,\r\n  about a hundred and sixty years. They are so familiar in our\r\n  geography, have been so much explored, and are so well appreciated,\r\n  as prominent points for effecting canal and railroad routes, that\r\n  it is only to be desired that early and efficient measures should\r\n  be taken for opening them.\r\n\r\n  The route of the Chippewa (or Sauteaux) River, is imperfectly\r\n  known, and has never been fully and accurately delineated and\r\n  described. It is a long river, having a number of fingered\r\n  branches, which spread over a large area of interior midland\r\n  country. They are connected, at distant points, with the principal\r\n  sources of the St. Croix and the Wisconsin of the Mississippi; with\r\n  the Mushkee, the Montreal, and the Ontonagon of Lake Superior; and\r\n  with the Monomonee, and the North Branch of Fox River of Green Bay.\r\n  The portages are of no great length, but being at considerable\r\n  altitudes above both the Mississippi and the lakes, and remote from\r\n  either, they are impracticable for boats.\r\n\r\n   In 1766 or \xe2\x80\x9967, J. Carver ascended the Chippewa River to the\r\n  Ottawa Fork. He ascended it no higher, and his delineations of\r\n  it, on the map which accompanied his original work, published in\r\n  London, cannot now be referred to. Dr. Douglass Houghton, and\r\n  Lieut. Robert E. Clary, U. S. A. delineated this stream, in 1831,\r\n  to the junction of the Red Cedar Fork, and up that fork to its\r\n  source in Lac Chetac; they continued the delineation of the route\r\n  thence, by portages, into the Ottawa Fork of the Chippewa, up that\r\n  river to Lac Courtorielle, or Ottawa Lake, and thence by a series\r\n  of short portages, to the Namakagon Branch of the St. Croix, and up\r\n  that branch, to the commencement of the series of portages, which\r\n  connect it with the Mushkee or Mauvais River of Lake Superior.\r\n  The latter river was delineated in its entire length. These\r\n  topographical observations, were commenced at the most easterly\r\n  point of the route. They remain in manuscript. Duplicates of them\r\n  have been communicated to the government.\r\n\r\n  The route of the St. Croix and Brul\xc3\xa9, describes a shorter line\r\n  between Lake Superior and the Mississippi, than the preceeding; and\r\n  it is one, that has been, and continues to be, much used by the\r\n  traders and by the resident Indian population. We cannot refer,\r\n  however, to any accurate delineation of it, or to any printed\r\n  account of the country. Carver, in his way to the Kiministiquoia,\r\n  or Grand Portage, visited the upper forks of the St. Croix, and\r\n  descended the Burntwood, or Brul\xc3\xa9, to which he gave the name of\r\n  Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s River.\r\n\r\n  The channel of communication which exists through the Savanne and\r\n  St. Louis Rivers, was delineated by Capt. D. B. Douglass, as a\r\n  member of the expedition sent into that quarter by the government\r\n  in 1820. But the result of his observations, has not been given to\r\n  the public. The route has been again delineated with care, in its\r\n  whole extent, from Fond du Lac to Sandy Lake, during the present\r\n  year, by Lieut. James Allen, of the U. S. Army, and will with his\r\n  other delineations, be transmitted for the use of the Topographical\r\n  Bureau at Washington.\r\n\r\n  Lieut. Allen\xe2\x80\x99s delineations, also, embrace the St. Croix and\r\n  Burntwood Rivers, in their whole length; and exhibit the first\r\n  actual survey of these streams, which the topographical history of\r\n  the region, presents.\r\n\r\n   Portions of these surveys have been prepared by the officer\r\n  making them, to illustrate the present volume, together with the\r\n  octavo sketches, which accompany the Narrative to Itasca, Cass and\r\n  Leech Lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EXPLORATION\r\n                                OF THE\r\n                    ST.

It is difficult in passing it, to\r\nresist the idea, that it will, at some future day, sustain a dense\r\npopulation. It is so elevated above the bed of the Mississippi, as to\r\nbe out of the reach of its periodical floods. The banks are rendered\r\npermanent by resting upon a basis of fixed rocks, (the primitive,)\r\nwhich appear in the channel of the river. The soil is arable upland,\r\napparently light, but of that ferruginous character, which has\r\nturned out so durable and fertile in Michigan. Like the prairies of\r\nthe latter, the plough might be set in motion, without the labor of\r\nclearing and grubbing, and a farm reclaimed with no additional labor\r\nbut that of fencing. Wood is often wanting on the immediate margin\r\nof the river. It is not always so; and when thus wanting, forests\r\nmay be observed on the hilly grounds, at a distance. Wild hay might\r\nbe cut in any quantity. It is among the facts which mark the natural\r\nhistory of the region, that the buffalo, or more strictly speaking,\r\nthe bison, which fed on these plains, in 1820, has not appeared here\r\nsince. The Virginia deer and the elk are, however, still abundant. The\r\nabsence of lime stone will probably prove the most formidable bar to\r\nits settlement. Nothing of this kind is found except in its southern\r\nborders. There appears to be no formations of rock elevated above the\r\nsoil, but the limited district called the _P\xc3\xa8tites Roches_. And the\r\nstrata here are exclusively referable to the primitive series.\r\n\r\nThe entrances of a small river called Nokassippi, about two hundred\r\nmiles above St. Anthony\xe2\x80\x99s Falls, may be considered as the termination\r\nof this tract. Above this point, although the Mississippi has some rich\r\nalluvions, as at the mouth of Sandy Lake River, its vegetation assumes\r\ngenerally an alpine character, and a large portion of the wide area of\r\nits valley, is traversed by pine ridges, with innumerable intervening\r\nlakes, and extensive tracts of, what the natives denominate, mushkeegs.\r\n\r\nOn crossing through the forty-fifth parallel of latitude, the\r\nMississippi exhibits a change in the materials of its banks preparatory\r\nto its entering the limestone region. This is first rendered strikingly\r\nvisible on the rapids immediately above the Falls of St. Anthony. The\r\nfall itself is an imposing exhibition of geological scenery. The river\r\nhere sinks its level about forty feet, in the distance of, say 1,500\r\nyards.[20] Sixteen feet of this has been estimated to consist of a\r\nperpendicular fall, reaching, with irregularities from shore to shore.\r\nDebris is accumulated in rude masses below, and the rapids are filled\r\nwith fallen or rolled rocks which impart a character of wildness to the\r\nscene. We made a portage of 1,250 yards, having descended nearer to\r\nthe brink of the fall than is common. Fort Snelling is situated at the\r\nestimate distance of nine miles below the falls, at the junction with\r\nthe river St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s. It occupies a commanding position, and exercises\r\nit may be inferred, an important influence over the contiguous Indian\r\ntribes, and the Indian trade. We reached this post on the 24th of\r\nJuly. Capt. Jouett, the commanding officer, promptly afforded every\r\nfacility for communicating the object of the visit to the Sioux, and\r\nrequesting their concurrence, which was promised by the chiefs, in a\r\ncouncil convened at the Agency House. We refer to the subjoined report\r\nfor its results. No recent details of the progress of the Sauc war, had\r\nbeen received. Having accomplished the object we proceeded down the\r\nMississippi, and reached the mouth of the St. Croix, at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nin the afternoon of the 26th, five days before the decisive action of\r\nGen. Atkinson with the combined Saucs and Foxes below.\r\n\r\nThe River St. Croix has one peculiarity, to distinguish it from all\r\nother American rivers. It has its source and its termination in a\r\nlake, and each of these bears the same name with itself. The lake at\r\nits mouth is not less than thirty miles in length, and is, probably,\r\nno where, much over a mile wide. Its banks are high and afford a\r\nseries of picturesque views, which keep the eye constantly on the\r\nstretch. The country is an upland prairie, interspersed with groves\r\nand majestic eminences. The waters are beautifully transparent, and\r\nthe margin exhibits a pebbly beach, so cleanly washed, that it would\r\nscarcely afford earth enough to stain the fairest shoe. If \xe2\x80\x9cLoch\r\nKatrine\xe2\x80\x9d presents a more attractive outline of sylvan coast, it must be\r\nbeautiful indeed. We went up it, turning point after point, with the\r\npleasure that novelty imparts, aided by the chanting of our canoe-men.\r\nWe were in hourly expectation of reaching its head for our night\r\nencampment; but we saw the sun set, casting its golden hues and its\r\ndeep shadows over the water, and going down in a gorgeous amphitheatre\r\nof fleecy clouds. The moon almost imperceptibly shone out, to supply\r\nits place, creating a scene of moonlight stillness, which was suited to\r\nfix a living impression of\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe silence that is in the starry sky,\r\n     The sleep that is among the lonely hills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing could present a greater contrast, to the noisy scene of horses\r\nand horsemen, war and bloodshed, which, we were then unconscious,\r\nwas about being acted, so near to us. We allude to the pursuit and\r\ndestruction of the Black Hawk\xe2\x80\x99s army.\r\n\r\nWe encamped at a late hour, near a lofty eminence, which exhibited\r\non its summit, a number of small mounds or barrows strongly relieved\r\nby the moonlight, which shone across the eminence, and left us in\r\nthe shade. We resumed our way again, before the hour of five in the\r\nmorning, (27th) and were still something more than two hours in\r\nreaching the head of the lake. In going out of this beautiful sheet\r\nof water, we would revert to some traits in its natural productions\r\nwhich serve to distinguish it, as well as its prominent scenery,\r\nalthough there are none equally distinctive. The great carboniferous\r\nlimestone formation,[21] which fills the Mississippi valley, also\r\nreaches here, although there is now reason to believe that it reaches\r\nbut little farther north. Its vegetation has little that is peculiar.\r\nThe red cedar is found, hanging from some of its craggy shores on the\r\nlower part. Some fresh water shells, generally thin and small, with\r\nprimary and lateral teeth wanting, characterize the sandy portions of\r\nits shore. There are some willow islands at the point where the River\r\nSt. Croix enters it. And this point of the ingress of a large stream,\r\npresents the characteristics of what have been, not inaptly, called\r\n_drowned lands_, i. e. land bearing trees permanently standing in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe St. Croix above this point exhibits the appearance of a wide,\r\ndeep, ample river, with prominent banks, and forests of hard wood, and\r\npine species. Its islands consist of rich alluvions, heavily timbered\r\nand subject to inundations. About two o\xe2\x80\x99clock we passed the \xe2\x80\x9cStanding\r\nCedars,\xe2\x80\x9d a point called so, in the treaty of limits between the Sioux\r\nand Chippewa tribes, and described in the inexact phraseology of the\r\nIndians, to be \xe2\x80\x9cabout a day\xe2\x80\x99s paddle, in a canoe, above the lake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHowbeit, we were but a few minutes over nine hours, in performing the\r\ndistance, with a strong crew of _engag\xc3\xa9s_, however, in light canoes,\r\nand with every appliance in pushing forward.\r\n\r\nAs evening approached, we encountered a man descending the river,\r\nhaving four canoes in company, with several Frenchmen and their Indian\r\nfamilies. It turned out to be a Mr. B. who had been engaged in trade,\r\nin the Chippewa country. We examined his papers to determine whether\r\nhe had been legally licensed, and caused a search of his canoes in\r\nquest of whiskey. None of this article, or strong drink of any kind was\r\ndiscovered. Little doubt had been felt, from information, which was\r\nnot, however proved, of his having used this article in the course of\r\nhis trade; whether with or without permission, could not be determined.\r\nWe revoked his license for the unexpired part of the time specified in\r\nit, and permitted him to proceed out of the country, with the canoes\r\nand the very trifling property which he possessed, which seemed,\r\nindeed, to be essential to the mere subsistence of the numerous persons\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nThe narrowing of the valley, and increased rapidity of the current,\r\nhad, for some time, admonished us of our approach to the falls. About\r\nsix o\xe2\x80\x99clock we entered through a defile, formed by perpendicular walls\r\nof rock on either shore. Its seamed and mossy surface did not permit us\r\nto determine its character, without getting a fresh fracture. It proved\r\nto be greenstone. We were in the midst of a formation of this rock, and\r\nfor two hours, urged our way up rapids and swift channels, made by the\r\nbroken and angular character of this stratum. We reached the foot of\r\nthe falls, and encamped there at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe word \xe2\x80\x9cfalls,\xe2\x80\x9d as applied here, is but another name for\r\nimpracticable rapids. The river tears its way through a vast bed of\r\ngreenstone, whose black and square masses, stand on either side, and\r\nin the bed of the stream. Common quartz, imperfectly chrystalized, is\r\nseen in the mass, and is the sole mineral apparent, although a more\r\nattentive search may disclose others. A portage of four hundred yards\r\nis made to avoid the falls. But there is still a series of rapids,\r\nextending, with short interruptions, several miles above.\r\n\r\nThe physical character of this spot is such as to arrest a passing\r\nattention; but it is inferior to the moral interest arising out of it.\r\nIt is the battle ground of Wahb Ojeeg, a celebrated Chippewa war chief\r\nof the last century, and testifies to an event in Indian tradition,\r\nwhich is not so remote as to be added to the events of the oblivious\r\nyears of their residence upon this continent. We have neither time nor\r\nspace to enter into details of this kind, and can merely advert to the\r\nincident we have named. Like most of the incidents of Indian warfare\r\nin the region, it is connected with the restless spirit, erratic\r\nadventure, and ambitious daring of the tribes who are, this season,\r\n(1832,) arrayed in hostility to the settlements on the Wisconsin. It\r\nis one of the links of the curious chain of history, of the Sauc and\r\nFox tribes, who have fought their way from the St. Lawrence, thus\r\nfar across the continent, and been successively embroiled, with each\r\nof the white powers, and, perhaps with some exceptions, with each of\r\nthe Indian tribes of the north. They appear, by their language and\r\ntraditions, to be Algonquins, and may be traced, as a starting point,\r\nto the north shores of Lake Ontario. They appear to have been driven\r\nthence for perfidy. They attacked the fort of Detroit, unsuccessfully.\r\nThey lived long at, and gave name to Sagana. They went to the Fox\r\nRiver of Green Bay which is named after them, and here embroiled\r\nthemselves with the Monomonees, the Chippewas and the French. They were\r\nfinally driven thence by force of arms. They fled to the Wisconsin\r\nwhere Carver speaks of their villages in 1766, thence to their recent\r\nresidence on Rock River, and by the last tragic act in their history,\r\nare confined to a limit commencing west of the Mississippi. We speak\r\nof the Saucs and Foxes as connected, in the gauntlet-like warfare they\r\nhave maintained, for they appear to have been intimate allies from the\r\nearliest times. The Indian name of the one tribe signifies, Those who\r\nwent out of the land, (Osaukee,) and the other, Redearths, (Miskwakee,)\r\nknown by the _nom de guerre_, of Foxes.\r\n\r\nWhile resident at Green Bay, they occupied also Lac du Flambeau, and\r\nextended themselves to Lake Superior, and south-west of its shores, to\r\nthe Sauc and Little Sauc Rivers, above the Falls of St. Anthony. While\r\nthus located, they appear to have fallen out with the Chippewas, their\r\ncousins-german, and leagued with the Sioux, whom they have, of late,\r\nso strenuously fought. With the aid of the latter, at first covertly\r\ngiven, they maintained the possession of the rice lakes and midland\r\nhunting grounds. But they were finally overthrown in a general defeat,\r\nat these falls, by the combined Chippewa bands of Lake Superior.\r\nThe latter came down the St. Croix, by its Namakagon branch. They\r\nwere led by Wahb Ojeeg. Their spies reached the falls without having\r\nencountered an enemy, but they unexpectedly found the Foxes, (whom\r\nthey call Ootaigahmees,) with their allies, encamped at the other end\r\nof the portage. A partial action ensued. It was rendered general by\r\nthe arrival of the whole Chippewa force. It was a fierce and bloody\r\naction. The Foxes made a resolute stand. But they were overpowered and\r\nfled. And they have not since re-appeared in the region. Among the\r\nslain several Sioux were found, and this is said to be the first actual\r\ntestimony of the Sioux being leagued with them, in the war against the\r\nChippewas. But this assertion is hardly reconcileable with the date of\r\nthe war in other places.\r\n\r\nWahb Ojeeg, or the White Fisher, who is noticed as the leader on this\r\noccasion, is said to have led out seven other expeditions against the\r\nFoxes and Sioux. He died at Chegoimegon, in Lake Superior, in 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  _Ascent of the St. Croix above the falls.\xe2\x80\x94Direct the burning\r\n    of illegal trading houses.\xe2\x80\x94Snake River.\xe2\x80\x94Its chief,\r\n    Pezhicki.\xe2\x80\x94Notices of Snake River.\xe2\x80\x94Its population and trade.\xe2\x80\x94A\r\n    foreign trading company formerly located here.\xe2\x80\x94Effects upon\r\n    the Indian intercourse of the present day.\xe2\x80\x94Anecdote of the\r\n    former mode of using rum and tobacco.\xe2\x80\x94Kettle Rapids.\xe2\x80\x94Shell\r\n    River.\xe2\x80\x94A hunting party of Chippewa boys.\xe2\x80\x94Pokanokuning, or\r\n    Yellow River.\xe2\x80\x94Its population and trade.\xe2\x80\x94Notices of its natural\r\n    history.\xe2\x80\x94Shells.\xe2\x80\x94Prairie squirrel.\xe2\x80\x94Widow of a murdered Indian,\r\n    called the Little Frenchman, declines having her son put to\r\n    school.\xe2\x80\x94Reach the forks of the St. Croix.\xe2\x80\x94Notice of the Namakagon\r\n    Branch.\xe2\x80\x94The chief, Kabamappa.\xe2\x80\x94Women\xe2\x80\x99s Portage.\xe2\x80\x94The Sturgeon\r\n    Dam.\xe2\x80\x94Kabamappa\xe2\x80\x99s village.\xe2\x80\x94Upper St. Croix Lake._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe pursued our way as early on the morning (28th) as the clearing up\r\nof the fog would permit. Soon after reaching the head of the series of\r\nrapids, we observed a couple of buildings of logs, upon the left shore,\r\nand landed to examine them. They proved to be deserted cabins which had\r\nbeen occupied by traders, with their doors open, and containing nothing\r\nof value. As these had been erected contrary to decisions of the Indian\r\noffice, made under the law of Congress regulating trading posts, and at\r\na point where the Sioux and Chippewas are thus improperly brought into\r\ncontact, we directed them to be burned. The remainder of the day was\r\ndiligently employed in the ascent. The following day being the Sabbath,\r\nwas devoted to rest. The water in the river appeared to be very low,\r\nand was momently falling. We removed our place of encampment in the\r\nevening, about ten miles. A Chippewa whom we met with his family, in a\r\ncanoe, informed us that Snake River was baishoo, a term denoting near\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, (30th,) after about three hours paddling, we reached\r\nthe mouth of the Kin\xc3\xa1bic, or Snake River. We found Pezhicki, (or the\r\nBuffalo,) the principal chief of that place, and his band, encamped\r\non the small peninsula which is formed by the junction. They fired a\r\nsalute, and crowded down to the shore, to welcome us. This chief was\r\none of a delegation who visited Washington, some years ago. He came\r\nback with a profusion of ornaments, and a sword and tassels. These were\r\nof no real utility, and have long since disappeared. The visit had\r\nthe effect to shew him the strength and resources of the Americans.\r\nWith little force of character, he has been pacific, so far at least,\r\nas relates to white men. He was present at the treaties of Prairie du\r\nChien, and Fond du Lac. He is not the war chief of the Snake River\r\nband. We know not, that he encountered in his journey, any teacher or\r\npreacher to inform him that there was a savior.\r\n\r\nOfficial business occupied a part of the morning. We found not the\r\nslightest evidence of any participation, or disposition to participate,\r\nin the hostile schemes of the Saucs and Foxes. Pezhicki approved of the\r\nrequests made by the Chippewas of the Upper Mississippi, for having\r\ntheir lines surveyed, and united strongly in the measure. He said that\r\nthe Sioux had manifested a disposition to claim the country above the\r\nStanding Cedars, and that they had, and still continued to trespass on\r\nit. He said, that they had this season, crossed through the Chippewa\r\nhunting grounds on the St. Croix to go against the band at Rice Lake\r\non the Red Cedar Fork of the Chippewa River. He cheerfully promised to\r\nassist the military canoes, in their ascent and immediately sent three\r\nyoung men for that purpose.\r\n\r\nSnake River is an important tributary of the St. Croix. It constitutes\r\nan established post of trade, for which licences are granted by the\r\nIndian department. Its Indian population is reported at three hundred\r\nand one souls. Persons of the mixed cast, thirty-eight. This river is\r\nconnected, by an easy portage, with Rum River, a route much used by\r\nIndians going to the Mille Lac and Sandy Lake borders. Masses of native\r\ncopper have been brought out of its bed by the Indians, who report\r\nthe existence of further indications of its presence. The North West\r\nCompany formerly held a post on this river, and it remained for several\r\nyears, a central place of trade for the Indians of the lower St. Croix.\r\nThe influence of this company over the Indians was every where visible,\r\nand so far as this influence was connected with political feelings, it\r\nwas, as a matter of course, exerted in favor of the British government.\r\nAs not more than twenty years have elapsed, since the authority of the\r\nAmerican government began at all to be exercised in this quarter, and\r\na much shorter period must be assigned for any active influence from\r\nits posts and agencies, it should not excite surprise that the elder\r\nIndians should, as they do, feel an attachment for that government.\r\nNor is it strange, that ambitious and designing men among them, should\r\noccasionally form combinations for open resistance, of the character of\r\nthat which has recently been witnessed among the Saucs and Foxes. Time,\r\nand judicious counsels, will afford the surest corrective.\r\n\r\nIn looking back to the condition of the trade, as it existed here,\r\nfifty years ago, some striking changes have supervened. A Mr. Harris,\r\nwho is still living at the age of about eighty-four, informed me, that\r\nabout the close of the American war, when he first came to this river,\r\nrum was an article in high request among the Indians. When they had\r\npurchased a keg of it, it was customary to pour it out into a large\r\nkettle and place it over a fire. A hand of tobacco was then put in.\r\nAfter being heated and stirred about for a time, the mixture was drank.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Snake River to Yellow River is about thirty-five\r\nmiles. We employed the 30th, from about eleven in the morning till\r\neight at night, and the 31st until eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, in\r\nperforming this distance. The water was very low, and it frequently\r\nrequired the men to get out and wade. The Kettle Rapids, nine miles\r\nin extent, are, however, the most formidable obstacle. The St. Croix\r\nreceives, in this distance, the Akeek or Kettle River, from the left,\r\nand the Aissippi, or Shell River, from the right. The latter takes\r\nits rise in a lake, which is noted for the number and large size of\r\nits fresh water shells. Hence its name. We met a number of Indians,\r\non this day\xe2\x80\x99s journey who evinced a friendly feeling. We encamped at\r\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, with a party of Indian boys, who had come down the river\r\nhunting. They were rejoiced on seeing us approach, and spent much of\r\ntheir ammunition in saluting us, which a colder feeling of foresight,\r\nmight have induced them to reserve for the chase. And they offered us\r\nsome of the scanty products of their evening\xe2\x80\x99s labour, thus evincing\r\nthe truth of the remark,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYet is he free; a morsel though his fare,\r\n     That morsel will he, unrepining, share;\r\n     A kind companion, and a liberal friend,\r\n     Not prone to hoard, nor cautious to expend,\r\n     Thence, often poor; but not that craven kind,\r\n     The low-born meanness of a stingy mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the canoe-men lacerated his foot on the angular masses of\r\ngreenstone, which form a shore of angular pebbles, near Snake River.\r\nAnd this rock appeared again distinctly, in place, on the Kettle\r\nrapids. Masses of it, were frequently seen in the bed of the river\r\nand incumbering its shores, below that point. They were observed to\r\ndecrease in size and frequency above these rapids, from which it may be\r\ninferred, that the rapids themselves are situated near the limits of\r\nthe formation.\r\n\r\nAt Yellow River, we found a considerable assembly of Indians, who, as\r\nthey saw our approach for some distance, ranged themselves along the\r\nshore, and fired a formal salute. I had visited this place, the same\r\nmonth and nearly the same day, in 1831, and then entered the mouth of\r\nthe river to form my encampment. But on attempting again to reach the\r\nsame spot, the water was found so low, that it was impracticable, and\r\nI came to the landing in front of a naked eminence, which, the Indians\r\ncall Pokonokuning, of Place or the Hip Bone,[22] a term by which the\r\nriver itself is (by them) designated.\r\n\r\nThis river is a post of trade, containing a population estimated at\r\nthree hundred and eighty-two souls. The lands are fertile, and afford\r\nin connection with Ottawa Lake, and the adjacent country, a good\r\nlocation for a mission and school. The river originates near the head\r\nof Long River of the Red Cedar Fork of the Chippewa, to which there\r\nis a canoe portage. It expands at unequal distances, beginning at its\r\nsource, into Lac Vaseux, Rice Lake, and Yellow Lake. Wild rice is one\r\nof its productions, and is among the means of subsistence on which the\r\nnatives rely. Its natural history is further deserving of remark, as\r\nyielding abundantly, univalve shells of a fine size. The purple winged\r\nunio is found in abundance; and the natives make use of this species,\r\nfor spoons, by rubbing off the alat\xc3\xa6 and rounding the margin\xe2\x80\x94a process\r\nby which they are rendered of no value as specimens of the species.\r\nThe copper-head snake is said to exist in the waters of this river.\r\nIts banks afford much of the open grounds which are favorable to the\r\nthirteen striped, or prairie squirrel, (S. tredecem, of Mitchill.)\r\nThe Indians exhibited to me the skin of this little animal, which is\r\npeculiarly marked with alternations of stripes and spots.\r\n\r\nWe observed among the group of Indians at this place, the widow and\r\nchildren of Waimit-Egozhains, a Chippewa, having an admixture of\r\nwhite blood, who, with three others, was murdered by the Sioux while\r\ndescending the lower part of the St. Croix, in a canoe, in the fall of\r\n1830. We directed the interpreter to say to her, that as providence\r\nhad removed her natural protector, and her means of subsistence must\r\nbe small, the elder of her boys, who was present, would be taken and\r\nsent to school, and also taught the arts of an industrious life, if she\r\nwould direct him to embark in one of our canoes. She appeared to be\r\npleased but at the same time embarrassed. She consulted with a brother\r\nwho was one of the Indians present, and then replied that the boy was\r\nnot altogether useless in aiding her to get a support, as he could fish\r\nand kill partridges. She did not feel willing thus suddenly to part\r\nwith him, but observed that she would send him out in the spring.\r\n\r\nWe were five hours and a half in going from Yellow River to the Forks\r\nof the St. Croix. The distance is probably not over thirteen miles.\r\nThese data will show how slowly we proceeded, with every exertion,\r\nagainst the obstacles of a very low state of water. And at this spot we\r\nknew that we were to lose, at least, one half of the entire volume. The\r\nloss is indeed greater, for the Namak\xc3\xa1gon, or right hand fork, which we\r\nwere here to leave, is decidedly the largest of the two.\r\n\r\nThe Namak\xc3\xa1gon Branch has its rise in a lake, which the Indians call\r\nMattedhair Lake, very near the source of the Mushkee or Mauvais River\r\nof Lake Superior. Neither of these streams can, however, be ascended\r\nto their sources. There is a portage across the intervening grounds,\r\ninterspersed with small lakes which is practicable for canoes and\r\npackages of goods, carried after the northwest manner. The Namak\xc3\xa1gon\r\nhas another portage, at a lower point to Ottawa Lake, the source of\r\none of the navigable branches of the Chippewa River. This river, after\r\nrunning about one hundred and seventy miles, joins the northwest branch\r\nat the Forks of the St. Croix, and from this point, the joint volume,\r\nincreased by a number of tributaries is carried on, to swell the mass\r\nof the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nWe found the chief Kabamappa, with others, encamped at the Forks. They\r\nevinced the same feeling of welcome, and pleasure we had met from the\r\nChippewas on the lower part of the stream. Kabamappa said that nothing\r\nhad been very recently heard from the direction of Lac du Flambeau and\r\nthe borders of the Sauc disturbances. He readily communicated many\r\nfacts respecting the existing difficulties, and the means taken to\r\nenlist the Indians in a general war. He said, that the confederacy, as\r\nit is, had been reported to consist of nine tribes, whom he named.[23]\r\nWith respect to a permanent peace with the Sioux, he cordially\r\napproved it. He had, he observed, given much of his thoughts and his\r\ntime to that object, and particularly so since our previous visit. It\r\nwas, primarily, through the influence of this chief that a general\r\npeace-council had been held by the Sioux and Chippewas, during the fall\r\nof 1831, on Snake River.\r\n\r\nAs to the state of the water his expression was, \xe2\x80\x9ciscutta! iscutta!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nindicating an exhausted state. He added, that though we had encountered\r\ndifficulties on the stream below, they would be multiplied on the\r\nbranch we were about to ascend. Even within sight of his lodge, he\r\npointed to shallows, where it would be impossible to ascend without\r\nwading in the stream and carrying all the baggage. The river, he\r\nsaid, was uncommonly low for the season, and was daily getting lower.\r\nUnder these circumstances, we had no time to lose. We employed the\r\nremainder of the day in going about seven miles, and encamped after\r\ndark at a place called the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Portage. Just before encamping,\r\nand when we were seeking a spot along the thick brushy shore, to\r\ndebark at, Kabamappa suddenly appeared standing on the bow of his\r\ncanoe, and pointing onwards, guided us to the spot of our encampment.\r\nDaylight had completely disappeared and it was barely possible, in a\r\ndark atmosphere, to discern contiguous objects. As the tall and gaunt\r\nform of the chief glided by, with his spear-pole elevated in the\r\ndirection we were to go, it might have needed but little power of the\r\nimagination, to transform him into a spirit of supernatural power.\r\nOwing to the darkness we found it difficult to procure fire-wood for\r\nthe night. It was sought with torches. The chief joined us at our\r\nevening meal. We were pleased with his urbanity.\r\n\r\nA fog detained us at our encampment until after daylight, (1st Aug.)\r\nWe were enabled to proceed at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Our first labor was\r\nthe ascent of a rapid, our _second_, our _third_, and our _fourth_\r\nlabors, were also rapids. In short, rapid succeeded to rapid, and with\r\nsuch short intervals, that it would be impracticable from any notes\r\npreserved of the route, to speak of this part of the stream, in any\r\nother light than as a continued series of rapids. We often thought\r\nourselves above them but we as often found, in the language of our\r\ncanoe-men, \xe2\x80\x9c_encore un_.\xe2\x80\x9d About two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon we came to\r\nstill waters with sedgy shores, and at seven in the evening reached and\r\nlanded at Kabamappa\xe2\x80\x99s village. The distance may be twenty-five miles\r\nabove the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Portage. We encamped here.\r\n\r\nThe village is situated on a part of the river called Namai Kowagon,\r\nor Sturgeon Dam. It occupies an eligible prairie bank, and exhibits in\r\nthe style of the lodges and gardens, considerable industry and regard\r\nto comfort. It would seem to be no difficult effort to induce Indians,\r\nwho had proceeded thus far in fixed industry, to labor on their lands\r\nmore extensively and effectually. The lodges represent, on the ground\r\nplan, oblongs enclosed with strong elm bark, sustained on a frame\r\nwork of saplings, tied on posts firmly set in the ground. They have a\r\nmoveable piece or door, at each end, and an opening in the centre of\r\nthe lodge, in the place of a chimney. Corn and potatoe fields, covered\r\nthe surrounding grounds. The corn was in tassel, but the wilting of\r\nits blades, indicated, that they had been touched by a slight frost.\r\nIts effects were particularly apparent in some vines near one of the\r\nlodges. Although the lodges had been carefully closed, the chief said\r\nduring his absence, a wolf had broken into his lodge and committed\r\ndepredations. He observed, in speaking of game, that the red deer was\r\nfound on the adjoining plains. In order to hunt the moose an animal\r\nformerly abundant in the region, he observed that it was necessary\r\nto go to one of the remote forks of the Burntwood or Brul\xc3\xa9 River. He\r\nrepresented the population of his village at eighty-eight souls, of\r\nwhom twenty-eight were men, This estimate was understood to include the\r\nminor chief Blackbird and his followers, who are sometimes referred to\r\nas a distinct band. We asked the chief, while sitting at the camp-fire\r\nin the evening, whether he did not feel tired, having observed that\r\nduring the day, he had alone, with the aid only of his wife, poled up\r\nhis canoe and managed to keep ahead, so as to guide, our canoe with\r\nseven men. He was evidently fatigued, but replied, smiling, no.\r\n\r\nWe parted with this chief, who has become respectable for his\r\ninfluence in this part of the country, at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the next\r\nmorning, (2d.) We had now got above all the strong rapids, and attained\r\nvery nearly the height of land. The river, above this point, receives\r\nthe Clearwater and Buffalo Rivers, as tributaries on the right bank. It\r\nis finally traced to Lake St. Croix, a handsome sheet of clear water,\r\nabout six miles long. This lake has an island[24] which is the site of\r\na small village. Its head is perhaps ten or eleven leagues distant from\r\nthe Namai Kowagon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  _Character of the St. Croix.\xe2\x80\x94Its productiveness in wild\r\n    rice.\xe2\x80\x94Population and trade.\xe2\x80\x94Condition of the Indians, and their\r\n    prospect.\xe2\x80\x94Portage to the Burntwood.\xe2\x80\x94Marine sand formation.\xe2\x80\x94Bass\r\n    lake.\xe2\x80\x94Character of the Burntwood river.\xe2\x80\x94Arrival at its discharge\r\n    into Fond du Lac of Lake Superior.\xe2\x80\x94Indian friends.\xe2\x80\x94Close of\r\n    the Narrative.\xe2\x80\x94Brief general remarks on the condition of the\r\n    Chippewas.\xe2\x80\x94Traits of character and government.\xe2\x80\x94The institution of\r\n    the Totem.\xe2\x80\x94Tale of the origin of White Fish._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn entering lake St. Croix we were favored with a fair wind, and made\r\nuse of our sails in passing it. As we approached its head, we found the\r\nswell formidable, but were able, nevertheless, to keep the lake. We\r\ndebarked, on a marshy margin at its head, being the commencement of the\r\nportage to the Brul\xc3\xa9. As the river St. Croix has its origin here, a few\r\ngeneral remarks on its geographical features, may be subjoined.\xe2\x80\x94This\r\nstream is an important tributary to the Upper Mississippi, originating\r\non elevated grounds, and consequently, having a rapid mean descent.\r\nAlthough not remarkable for its length, its waters spread in a lateral\r\nline, an unusual distance. It has many tributaries, connecting it,\r\non the north, with Rum river, on the south, with Chippewa river,\r\nand towards the east with the Mauvais and the Brul\xc3\xa9 rivers of Lake\r\nSuperior. The main channel may be estimated, by its windings, at two\r\nhundred miles. The length of its Namakagon fork, is estimated to be\r\none hundred and seventy miles, while that of its northern branch does\r\nnot probably exceed sixty-five miles. Both branches, together with its\r\nlower tributaries, and their numerous lakes, yield the northern rice\r\nplant. The abundance of the plant, has led to the local term of the\r\nFolle Avoine country, a name by which it is particularly known in the\r\ntransactions of the Fur Trade.\r\n\r\nIt has a comparatively mild climate, and rich soil, and in addition to\r\nthe small fur bearing animals, on the sale of which the Indians rely\r\nfor their woollens, arms, and ammunition; it affords the spontaneous\r\nmeans of subsistence, more fully, perhaps, than most other parts of\r\nthe northwest regions. Its present aggregate population has been\r\nestimated the present year, at eight hundred and ninety-five, say nine\r\nhundred souls, numbering those only who are permanently located in\r\nits valley.\xe2\x80\x94What quantity of furs and peltries is annually got from\r\nit, and what amount of Indian goods are required to pay for them,\r\nare questions which might be ascertained, with general accuracy, by\r\nconsulting official records. But it is sufficient for the purposes of\r\nmoral enquiry, to remark, that both the supplies and the returns, are\r\nless than they were in former years, and that there is a declension in\r\nthe trade, which must at length produce a migration of the Indians, or\r\ninduce them to become agriculturists. The fate that has overtaken other\r\ntribes, enjoying a more southerly position, must inevitably overtake\r\nthese bands. And the period will probably arrive earlier, than it might\r\nbe anticipated. They occupy a portion of the Mississippi valley, which\r\nis adapted for agriculture. Many parts of it, possess a rich soil,\r\nand are well timbered. Other portions are prairie land, suited for\r\npasturage. Its most arid tracts abound in pine, and there is hardly a\r\nstream, of its many tributaries which does not afford numerous eligible\r\nseats for saw and grist mills. Hunting seems the only occupation, which\r\ncannot be a permanent one. But,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWhile thus the chase declines, and herds depart,\r\n     And heaven in prospect, dooms his favorite art,\r\n     No care of lands or flocks prepares his mind,\r\n     To mend his fortunes, and to save his kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe portage from the St. Croix to the Burntwood, begins at the head\r\nof (the Upper) lake St. Croix. It lies over an elevated sandy pine\r\nridge, which divides the two streams. The distance which the canoes and\r\npackages require to be carried, is 3,350 yards, or nearly two miles. On\r\nthe left hand, in carrying from the St. Croix, there is a deep tamerac\r\nvalley, which is said to afford the head springs of both streams. On\r\nthe right, is seen, at some distance, a small lake, which is stated\r\nto yield the black bass, and to have no outlet. Its existence in a\r\nsand formation, indicates perhaps, coral rag, hardpan, or some firmer\r\nmaterial below. This sand is apparently of marine deposition, and\r\nagrees, in this respect, with the extensive formations at the sources\r\nof the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe goods after being carried this distance, are put down, on the\r\nbanks of a sandy bottomed brook of very clear cold water, overhung\r\nwith alders. Any other person, but one who had become familiar with\r\nnorthwest portages, would be apt to say, on being ushered to this\r\nsecluded spot, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, this is certainly an eligible spot to quench\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s thirst at, but as for embarking on this rill, with a canoe and\r\nbaggage, the thing seems to be preposterous.\xe2\x80\x9d And so it certainly\r\nappeared, on our arrival.\xe2\x80\x94There was not an average depth of water of\r\nmore than two to four inches. But by going some distance below, and\r\ndamming the stream, it rose in a short time, high enough to float a\r\ncanoe, with a part of its lading. The men walking in the stream, then\r\nled the canoes, cutting away the brush to veer them, and carrying such\r\nparts of the lading as could not, from time to time, be embarked. We\r\ndid not begin the descent, till six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, in the evening, and went\r\nabout a mile during the first hour and a half. It then became so dark,\r\nthat it was necessary to encamp. And to encamp in such a place, seemed\r\nimpossible. We could not, however, hesitate. There was no alternative,\r\nwe could neither advance nor recede, and we were surrounded with a\r\nshaking bog. We slept on a kind of bog, which the men, call _t\xc3\xaates\r\ndes femmes_. Some rain fell during the night, but we were happily\r\nrelieved from the fear of inundation, by the showers passing off.\r\nThe next morning brought with it, a resumption of the toil of the\r\nevening. Tho canoes were sent on entirely empty. All the baggage was\r\ncarried about a mile, at which distance the stream is perhaps doubled\r\nin width, and more than doubled in depth. The next mile rendering the\r\ngoing quite easy. At this point, say three miles from the portage, we\r\nembarked all our baggage, and after this, found no want of water, till\r\nwe came to the rapids. These, commence about twenty-four miles below\r\nthe portage, and they extend with intervals of smooth water, \xe2\x80\x9cfew\r\nand far between,\xe2\x80\x9d to within three or four miles of the point of the\r\nentrance of the river, into Lake Superior. The entire length of this\r\nriver may be estimated at one hundred miles, more than eighty miles of\r\nthis distance consists of rapids. It has been said that there are two\r\nhundred and forty distinct rapids. At most of these, there is several\r\nfeet fall. At some of them eight to ten feet. Four of them require\r\nportages of short extent. Six or seven hundred feet would not appear to\r\nbe an extravagant estimate for the entire fall. The river itself is a\r\nperfect torrent; often on looking down its channel, there are wreaths\r\nof foam constituting a brilliant vista, overhung with foliage. It would\r\nnever be used at all, for the purposes of the trade, were it not, that\r\nthere is much water on the rapids, so that experienced men can conduct\r\nloaded canoes both up and down them. The river might appropriately\r\nbe called Rapid, or Mad River, or almost any thing else, but by its\r\npopular name of _Brul\xc3\xa9_. This is, in fact, rather a departure, than a\r\nderivative from the Indian, Wis\xc3\xa1koda, i. e. burnt-pines, or burnt-wood,\r\nin allusion to a signal destruction of its pine forests, by fire. We\r\nwere two days, and part of an evening, in effecting the descent, and\r\nregained our outward track, at the point of its discharge into the Fond\r\ndu Lac of lake Superior. We reached this point on the fourth of August,\r\nlate at night, having gone later than usual, from the fact of finding\r\nourselves below the rapids, and consequently knowing that we must be\r\nnear the lake. Our first certain indication of our proximity to it,\r\nwas, however, given by hearing the monotonous thump of an Indian drum.\r\nWe soon after came in sight of camp fires, with Indian forms passing\r\nbefore them.\xe2\x80\x94And we found ourselves, on landing, in the midst of former\r\nIndian acquaintances. Among them were Mongazid (Loon\xe2\x80\x99s Foot,) the\r\nsecond Chief of Fond du Lac, and Chamees, (Pouncing Hawk,) a young man\r\nwho had first recommended himself to notice in 1820, by guiding a part\r\nof Governor Cass\xe2\x80\x99 expedition above the Knife Portage, and who evinced\r\nthe same disposition, during the forepart of the present summer, by\r\nacting as a guide to the party, between Fond du Lac and Sandy Lake. We\r\nwere pleased on observing the military boat, used by Lieutenant Allen\r\non the lake, safely moored, with its sails and tackle, within the\r\nmouth of the river, having been brought down, agreeably to promise, by\r\nMongazid, who had faithfully remained in charge of it.\r\n\r\nThe day following, being the Sabbath, was spent at this place. And the\r\nnarrative of our route from the Mississippi, may here be appropriately\r\nclosed. Some remarks arising from observations on the condition of the\r\nIndians, among whom we have passed, it may be proper to add; but from\r\nthe little leisure we can command, they are necessarily few and brief.\r\n\r\nThe Chippewas are spread over a very large area in the north, divided\r\ninto local bands, and separated by extensive tracts which are, in great\r\npart, sterile. They are not fixed in their habitations at any point,\r\nduring the whole of the year, being compelled to go in search of the\r\ngame, fish, and other spontaneous productions, on which they depend.\r\nThe space which each band periodically traverses, in this effort, is\r\nextensive, and subjects them to casualties, which they would otherwise\r\nescape. Their condition is still further imbittered by hostilities\r\nwith the Sioux tribes, who occupy the whole line of their western\r\nfrontier. They cover the entire north-western angle of the United\r\nStates, extending down the Mississippi valley on both banks, as low\r\nas the Wadub, being the first stream above Sac river. At this point\r\ntheir territorial line crosses from the west to the east banks of the\r\nMississippi, pursuing a southerly course, at the distance of about\r\nforty miles from it, until it intersects the lands of the Winnebagoes,\r\nnorth of the Wisconsin. This portion of the territory affords decidedly\r\nthe largest and best body of farming lands in their possession, and\r\nwill, probably, hereafter yield them, either by the proceeds of its\r\nsale, or cultivation, a more sure reliance at a period when the land\r\nbecomes divested of game. The climate of this area is comparatively\r\nmild, and the Indians who inhabit it, notwithstanding their partial\r\nlosses from wars, have evidently increased in population. They might\r\nbe concentrated here, could the agricultural be substituted for the\r\nhunter life\xe2\x80\x94a result which may be expected to follow, but cannot in\r\nany reasonable estimate be expected to precede, their conversion to\r\nchristianity.\r\n\r\nThis tribe offer no prominent obstacles to the introduction of the\r\ngospel. We have before adverted to the slender frame work of their\r\nnative religion, which seems to be made up, primarily of certain\r\nsuperstitious ceremonies, winding themselves about the subject of\r\nmedicine. It appears to occupy that void in the barbaric mind, which\r\nthe soothsayers and magii of other lands, pressed forward, in the\r\nabsence of revelation, to fill. But we do not know that the ritual\r\nhas any striking features in common. The principal obstacle which\r\nmissionaries will have to contend with, is a want of the knowledge\r\nof their language. And to surmount this is a labor which they cannot\r\ntoo early begin nor too zealously persevere in. The language itself,\r\nas we have before indicated, (vide Chap. X.) presents a copious\r\nvocabulary, and is capable of being made the medium of religious\r\ninstruction. It has some defects which will require to be supplied, and\r\nsome redundancies which will demand curtailment, when it comes to be\r\nwritten. But they offer very slight obstacles to oral communication.\r\nIt is obviously better suited to convey narrative than disquisitive\r\nmatter. And has been so long applied to corporeal objects, that it\r\nrequires caution and a familiar knowledge of its idioms, in the\r\nconveyance of intellectual and still more of spiritual conceptions.\r\n\r\nIn mere externals, the Chippewas are not essentially different from\r\nother tribes of the Algonquin stock in the western country. And the\r\npoints in which a difference holds, may be supposed to have been, for\r\nthe most part, the effects of a more ungenial climate. They are, to a\r\nless extent than most of the tribes, cultivators of the soil, and more\r\nexclusively hunters and warriors. Living in a portion of the continent,\r\nremarkable for the number of its large and small lakes, they find a\r\ncommon resource in fish, and along with this, enjoy the advantage of\r\nreaping the wild rice.\r\n\r\nTheir government has been deemed a paradox, at the same time\r\nexercising, and too feeble to exercise power. But it is not more\r\nparadoxical than all patriarchal governments, which have their tie in\r\nfilial affection, and owe their weakness to versatility of opinion.\r\nWar and other public calamities bring them together, while prosperity\r\ndrives them apart. They rally on public danger, with wonderful\r\nfacility, and they disperse with equal quickness. All their efforts are\r\nof the partizan, popular kind. And if these do not succeed they are\r\ndispirited. There is nothing in their institutions and resources suited\r\nfor long continued, steady exertion.\r\n\r\nThe most striking trait in their moral history is the institution\r\nof the Totem\xe2\x80\x94a sign manual, by which the affiliation of families is\r\ntraced, agreeing, more exactly, perhaps, than has been supposed, with\r\nthe armorial bearings of the feudal ages. And this institution is kept\r\nup, with a feeling of importance, which it is difficult to account for.\r\nAn Indian, as is well known, will tell his specific name with great\r\nreluctance, but his generic or family name\xe2\x80\x94in other words, his _Totem_,\r\nhe will declare without hesitation, and with an evident feeling of\r\npride.\r\n\r\nNone of our tribes have proceeded further than the first rude steps\r\nin hieroglyphic writing. And it is a practice in which the Chippewas\r\nare peculiarly expert. No part of their country can be visited without\r\nbringing this trait into prominent notice. Every path has its blazed\r\nand figured trees, conveying intelligence to all who pass, for all\r\ncan read and understand these signs. They are taught to the young\r\nas carefully as our alphabet, with the distinction, however, that\r\nhieroglyphic writing, is the prerogative of the males. These devices\r\nare often traced on sheets of birch bark attached to poles. They are\r\ntraced on war-clubs, on canoe paddles, bows or gun stocks. They are\r\noften drawn on skins, particularly those used as back dresses, by\r\nwarriors. They have also other hieroglyphic modes of communicating\r\ninformation, by poles with knots of grass attached to them, or rings of\r\npaint. and often by antlers, or animals\xe2\x80\x99 heads suspended by the banks\r\nof rivers.\r\n\r\nThe following tale is added as an example of the kind of imaginative\r\nlore indicated by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ORIGIN OF THE WHITE-FISH.\r\n\r\n  In ancient times when the Indians were better than they now are,\r\n  when their laws were enforced by the chiefs, and when every crime\r\n  was promptly punished, there lived a noted hunter and a just man,\r\n  at a remote point on the north shore of Lake Superior. He had a\r\n  wife and two sons, who were usually left in the lodge, while he\r\n  went out in quest of the animals upon whose flesh they subsisted.\r\n  As game was then abundant, his exertions were well rewarded, and\r\n  he lived in the enjoyment of every blessing. But there was at\r\n  this time a venom preparing for his heart, which was not the less\r\n  poisonous, because it was for a time kept in secret. His two little\r\n  sons had observed the visits of a neighboring hunter, during the\r\n  absence of their father, and they ventured to remonstrate with\r\n  their mother on the propriety of receiving clandestine visits,\r\n  but she was in no temper to be reasoned with. She rebuked them\r\n  sharply, and finally, on their intimation of disclosing the\r\n  secret, threatened to kill them if they made any disclosure They\r\n  were frightened into silence. But observing the continuance of an\r\n  improper intercourse, kept up by stealth as it were, they resolved\r\n  at last to disclose the whole matter to their father. The result\r\n  was such as might be anticipated. The father being satisfied with\r\n  the infidelity of his wife, took up a war club at a moment when he\r\n  was not perceived, and with a single blow despatched the object of\r\n  his jealousy. He then buried her under the ashes of his fire, took\r\n  down his lodge, and removed to a distant position.\r\n\r\n  But the spirit of the woman haunted the children who were now\r\n  grown up to the estate of young men. She appeared to them in the\r\n  shadows of evening. She terrified them in dreams. She harassed\r\n  their imaginations wherever they went, so that their life was a\r\n  life of perpetual terrors. They resolved to leave the country, and\r\n  commenced a journey of many days towards the south. They at length\r\n  came to the Poiwateeg falls. (St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s.) But they had no sooner\r\n  come in sight of these falls, than they beheld the skull of the\r\n  woman (their mother) rolling along the beach after them. They were\r\n  in the utmost fear, and knew not what to do, to elude her, when one\r\n  of them observed a large crane sitting on a rock in the rapids.\r\n  They called out to the bird. \xe2\x80\x9cSee, Grandfather, we are persecuted\r\n  by a spirit. Come and take us across the falls so that we may\r\n  escape her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  This crane was a bird of extraordinary size and great age. And\r\n  when first descried by the two sons, sat in a state of stupor, in\r\n  the midst of the most violent eddies of the foaming water. When he\r\n  heard himself addressed, he stretched forth his neck, with great\r\n  deliberation, and then raising himself on his wings flew across to\r\n  their assistance. \xe2\x80\x9cBe careful\xe2\x80\x9d said the crane, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you do not\r\n  touch the back part of my head. It is sore, and should you press\r\n  against it, I shall not be able to avoid throwing you both into\r\n  the rapids.\xe2\x80\x9d They were, however, attentive on this point, and were\r\n  both safely landed on the south side of the river. The crane then\r\n  resumed its former position in the rapids.\r\n\r\n  But the skull now cried out. \xe2\x80\x9cCome Grandfather and carry me over,\r\n  for I have lost my children, and am sorely distressed.\xe2\x80\x9d The aged\r\n  bird flew to her assistance, but carefully repeated his injunction,\r\n  that she must by no means touch the back part of his head, which\r\n  had been hurt, and was not yet healed. She promised to obey, but\r\n  she soon felt a curiosity to know, where the head of her carrier\r\n  had been hurt, and how so aged a bird could have acquired such\r\n  a bad wound. She thought it strange, and before they were half\r\n  way over the rapids, could not resist the inclination she felt\r\n  to touch the affected part. Instantly the crane threw her into\r\n  the rapids. The skull floated down from rock to rock, striking\r\n  violently against their hard edges, until it was battered to\r\n  fragments, and the sons were thus happily and effectually relieved\r\n  from their tormentor. But the brains of the woman, when the skull\r\n  was dashed against the rocks, fell into the water, in the form of\r\n  small white roes, which soon assumed the shape of a novel kind\r\n  of fish, possessing a whiteness of color peculiar to itself; and\r\n  these rapids have ever since been well stocked with this new and\r\n  delicious species of fish.\r\n\r\n  The sons meantime took up their permanent abode at these Falls,\r\n  becoming the progenitors of the present tribe, and in gratitude to\r\n  their deliverer adopted the Crane[25] as their Totem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n                          I.

SCHOOLCRAFT, IN THE WESTERN\r\n                      AND NORTH-WESTERN TERRITORY.\r\n\r\n                          BY WILLIAM COOPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HELIX.\r\n\r\n1. HELIX ALBOLABRIS, _Say_. Near Lake Michigan.\r\n\r\n2. HELIX ALTERNATA, _Say_. Banks of the Wabash, near and above the\r\nTippecanoe. Mr. Say remarks, that these two species, so common in the\r\nAtlantic states, were not met with in Major Long\xe2\x80\x99s second expedition,\r\nuntil their arrival in the secondary country at the eastern extremity\r\nof Lake Superior.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PLANORBIS.\r\n\r\n3. PLANORBIS CAMPANULATUS, _Say_. Itasca (or La Biche) Lake, the source\r\nof the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n4. PLANORBIS TRIVOLVIS, _Say_. Lake Michigan. These two species were\r\nalso observed by Mr. Say, as far east as the Falls of Niagara.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LYMNEUS.\r\n\r\n5. LYMNEUS UMBROSUS, _Say_. Am. Con. iv. pl. xxxi. fig. 1. Lake\r\nWinnipec, Upper Mississippi, and Rainy Lake.\r\n\r\n6. LYMNEUS REFLEXUS, _Say_. 1. c. pl. xxxi. fig. 2. Rainy Lake, Seine\r\nRiver, and Lake Winnipec.\r\n\r\n7. LYMNEUS STAGNALIS. Lake a la Crosse, Upper Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PALUDINA.\r\n\r\n8. PALUDINA PONDEROSA, _Say_. Wisconsin River.\r\n\r\n9. PALUDINA VIVIPARA, _Say_. Am. Con. i. pl. x. The American specimens\r\nof this shell are more depressed than the European, but appear to be\r\nidentical in species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MELANIA.\r\n\r\n10. MELANIA VIRGINICA, _Say_. Lake Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ANODONTA.\r\n\r\n11. ANODONTA CATARACTA, _Say_. Chicago, Lake Michigan. This species,\r\nMr. Lea remarks, has a great geographical extension.\r\n\r\n12. ANODONTA CORPULENTA, _Nobis_. Shell thin and fragile, though\r\nless so than others of the genus; much inflated at the umbones,\r\nmargins somewhat compressed; valves connate over the hinge in perfect\r\nspecimens; surface dark brown, in old shells; in younger, of a pale\r\ndingy green, and without rays, in all I have examined; beaks slightly\r\nundulated at tip. The color within is generally of a livid coppery hue,\r\nbut sometimes, also, pure white.\r\n\r\nLength of a middling sized specimen, four and a half inches, breadth,\r\nsix and a quarter. It is often eighteen inches in circumference, round\r\nthe border of the valves, with a diameter through the umbones of three\r\ninches. Inhabits the Upper Mississippi, from Prairie du Chien to Lake\r\nPepin.\r\n\r\nThis fine shell, much the largest I have seen of the genus, was first\r\nsent by Mr. Schoolcraft, to the Lyceum, several years ago. So far as I\r\nam able to discover, it is undescribed, and a distinct and remarkable\r\nspecies. It may be known by its length being greater in proportion to\r\nits breadth than in the other American species, by the subrhomboidal\r\nform of the posterior half, and, generally, by the color of the nacre,\r\nthough this is not to be relied on. It appears to belong to the genus\r\nSYMPHYNOTA of Mr. Lea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ALASMODONTA.\r\n\r\n13. ALASMODONTA COMPLANATA, _Barnes_. SYMPHYNOTA COMPLANATA, _Lea_.\r\nShell Lake, River St. Croix, Upper Mississippi. Many species of shells\r\nfound in this lake grow to an extraordinary size. Some of the present\r\ncollected by Mr. Schoolcraft, measure nineteen inches in circumference.\r\n\r\n14. ALASMODONTAB RUGOSA, _Barnes._ St. Croix River, and Lake Vaseux,\r\nSt. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s River.\r\n\r\n15. ALASMODONTA MARGINATA, _Say_. Lake Vaseux, St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s River: very\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n16. ALASMODONTA EDENTULA? _Say._ ANODON AREOLATUS? _Swainson._ Lake\r\nVaseux. The specimens of this shell are too old and imperfect to be\r\nsafely determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 UNIO.\r\n\r\n17. UNIO TUBERCULATUS, _Barnes_. Painted Rock, Upper Mississippi.\r\n\r\n18. UNIO PUSTULOSUS, _Lea_. Upper Mississippi, Prairie du Chien, to\r\nLake Pepin.\r\n\r\n19. UNIO VERRUCOSUS, _Barnes_, _Lea_. St. Croix River of the Upper\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\n20. UNIO PLICATUS, _Le Sueur_, _Say_. Prairie du Chien, and River St.\r\nCroix.\r\n\r\nThe specimens of U. PLICATUS sent from this locality by Mr. Schoolcraft\r\nhave the nacre beautifully tinged with violet, near the posterior\r\nborder of the shell, and are also much more ventricose them those found\r\nin more eastern localities, as Pittsburgh, for example; at the same\r\ntime, I believe them to be of the same species. Similar variations\r\nare observed in other species; the specimens from the south and west\r\ngenerally exhibiting a greater development.\r\n\r\n21. UNIO TRIGONUS, _Lea_. From the same locality as the last, and like\r\nit unusually ventricose.\r\n\r\n22. UNIO EBENUS, _Lea_. Upper Mississippi, between Prairie du Chien and\r\nLake Pepin.\r\n\r\n23. UNIO GIBBOSUS, _Barnes_. St. Croix River, Upper Mississippi.\r\n\r\n24. UNIO RECTUS, _Lamarck_. U. PR\xc3\x86LONGUS, _Barnes_. Upper Mississippi,\r\nfrom Prairie du Chien to Lake Pepin, and the River St. Croix. The\r\nspecimens collected by Mr. Schoolcraft, vary much in the color of the\r\nnacre. Some have it entirely white, others, rose purple, and others\r\nentirely of a very fine dark salmon color. This species inhabits the\r\nSt. Lawrence as far east as Montreal.\r\n\r\n25. UNIO SILIQUOIDEUS, _Barnes_, and U. INFLATUS, _Barnes_. Upper\r\nMississippi, between Prairie du Chien and Lake Pepin. Large, ponderous,\r\nand the epidermis finely rayed.\r\n\r\n26. UNIO COMPLANATUS, _Lea_. U. PURPUREUS, _Say_. Lake Vaseux, St.\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s River. Lake Vaseux is an expansion of the River St. Mary, a\r\ntributary of the upper lakes. This shell does not appear to exist in\r\nany of the streams flowing into the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n27. UNIO CRASSUS, _Say_. Upper Mississippi, Prairie du Chien.\r\n\r\n28. UNIO RADIATUS, _Barnes_. Lake Vaseux. The specimen is old and\r\nimperfect, but I believe it to be the U. RADIATUS of our conchologists,\r\nwhich is common in Lake Champlain and also inhabits the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\n29. UNIO OCCIDENS, _Lea_. U. VENTRICOSUS, _Say_, Am. Con. U.\r\nVENTRICOSUS, _Barnes_? Wisconsin and St. Croix Rivers, and Shell Lake.\r\nEpidermis variously colored, and marked with numerous rays.\r\n\r\n30. UNIO VENTRICOSUS, _Barnes_. Upper Mississippi, from Prairie du\r\nChien to Lake Pepin and Shell Lake. The varieties of this, and the\r\npreceding pass insensibly into each other. Those from Shell Lake are of\r\nextraordinary size.\r\n\r\n31. UNIO ALATUS, _Say_. SYMPHYNOTA ALATA, _Lea_. Upper Mississippi, and\r\nShell Lake. Found also in Lake Champlain, by the late Mr. Barnes.\r\n\r\n32. UNIO GRACILIS, _Barnes_. SYMPHYNOTA GRACILIS, _Lea_. Upper\r\nMississippi, and Shell Lake. The specimens brought by Mr. Schoolcraft\r\nare larger and more beautiful than I have seen from any other locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 2. LOCALITIES OF MINERALS OBSERVED IN THE NORTHWEST IN 1831 AND 1832.\r\n\r\n                       BY HENRY R. SCHOOLCRAFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n          CLASS I. _Bodies not metallic, containing an acid._\r\n\r\n1. CALCAREOUS SPAR. Keweena Point, Lake Superior. Imbedded in small\r\nglobular masses, in the trap rock; also forming veins in the same\r\nformation. Some of the masses break into rhombic forms, and possess\r\na certain but not perfect degree of transparency; others are opaque,\r\nor discolored by the green carbonate of copper. Also in the trap rock\r\nbetween Fond du Lac and Old Grand Portage, Lake Superior, in perfect,\r\ntransparent rhombs, exhibiting the property of double refraction. Also,\r\nat the lead mines, in Iowa county, in the marly clay formation, often\r\nexhibiting imperfect prisms, variously truncated.\r\n\r\n2. CALCAREOUS TUFA. Mouth of the River Brul\xc3\xa9, of Lake Superior. In\r\nsmall, friable, broken masses, in the diluvial soil. Also, in the gorge\r\nbelow the Falls of St. Anthony. In detached, vesicular masses, amidst\r\ndebris.\r\n\r\n3. COMPACT CARBONATE OF LIME. In the calcareous cliffs of horizontal\r\nformation, commencing at the Falls of St. Anthony. Carboniferous.\r\n\r\n4. SEPTARIA. In the reddish clay soil, between Montreal River, and\r\nLapointe, Lake Superior.\r\n\r\n5. GYPSUM. In the sandstone rock at the Point of Grand Sable West, Lake\r\nSuperior. In orbicular masses, firmly imbedded. Not abundant. Granular,\r\nalso imperfectly foliated.\r\n\r\n6. CARBONATE OF MAGNESIA. Serpentine rock, at Presque Isle, Lake\r\nSuperior. Compact.\r\n\r\n7. HYDRATE OF MAGNESIA? With the preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n        CLASS II. _Earthy compounds, amorphous or crystalline._\r\n\r\n8. COMMON QUARTZ. Huron Islands, Lake Superior, also the adjoining\r\ncoast. In very large veins or beds. White, opaque.\r\n\r\n9. GRANULAR QUARTZ. Falls of Peckagama, Upper Mississippi. In situ.\r\n\r\n10. SMOKY QUARTZ. In the trap rock Keweena Point, Lake Superior,\r\ncrystallized. In connection with amethystine quartz.\r\n\r\n11. AMETHYST. With the preceding. Also, at the Pic Bay, and at\r\nGargontwa, north shore of Lake Superior, in the trap rock, in perfect\r\ncrystals of various intensity of color.\r\n\r\n12. CHALCEDONY. Keweena Point, Lake Superior. In globular or orbicular\r\nmasses, in amygdaloid rock. Often, in detached masses along the shores.\r\n\r\n13. CARNELIAN. With the preceding.\r\n\r\n14. HORNSTONE. In detached masses, very hard, on the shores of Lake\r\nSuperior. Also, at Dodgeville, Iowa county, Mich. Ter. in fragments or\r\nnodular masses in the clay soil.\r\n\r\n15. JASPER. In the preceding locality. Common and striped, exceedingly\r\ndifficult of being acted on, by the wheel. Not observed in situ.\r\n\r\n16. AGATE. Imbedded in the trap rocks of Lake Superior, and also\r\ndetached, forming a constituent of its detritus. Variously colored.\r\nOften made up of alternate layers of chalcedony, carnelian, and\r\ncacholong. Sometimes zoned, or in fortification points. Specimens not\r\ntaken from the rock are not capable of being scratched by quartz or\r\nflint, and are incapable of being acted on by the file; consequently\r\n_harder_ than any of the described species.\r\n\r\n17. CYANITE. Specimens of this mineral, in flat, six-sided prisms\r\nimbedded in a dark primitive rock, were brought out from Lac du\r\nFlambeau outlet, where the rock is described as existing in situ. The\r\nlocality has not been visited, but there are facts brought to light\r\nwithin the last two or three years, to justify the extension of the\r\nprimitive to that section of country.\r\n\r\n18. PITCHSTONE. A detached mass of this mineral, very black and\r\nlava-like, was picked up in the region of Lake Superior, where the\r\nvolcanic mineral, trachyte, is common among the rolled masses. Neither\r\nof these substances have been observed in situ.\r\n\r\n19. MICA. Huron Islands, Lake Superior. In granite.\r\n\r\n20. SCHORL. Common. Outlet of Lac du Flambeau. Also, in a detached mass\r\nof primitive rock at Green Bay.\r\n\r\n21. FELDSPAR. Porcupine mountains, Lake Superior.\r\n\r\n22. BASALT. Amorphous. Granite Point, Lake Superior.\r\n\r\n23. STILBITE. Amygdaloid rock, Keweena Point, Lake Superior.\r\n\r\n24. ZEOLITE. Mealy. With the preceding.\r\n\r\n25. ZEOLITE. Radiated. Lake Superior. This mineral consists of fibres,\r\nso delicate and firmly united as to appear almost compact, radiating\r\nfrom a centre. Some of the masses produced by this radiation, measure\r\n2.5 inches in diameter. They are of a uniform, pale, yellowish red.\r\nThis mineral has not been traced in situ, being found in detached\r\nmasses of rock, and sometimes as water-worn portions of radii. Its true\r\nposition would seem to be the trap rock.\r\n\r\n26. ASBESTOS. Presque Isle, Lake Superior. In the serpentine formation.\r\n\r\n27. HORNBLENDE. Very abundant as a constituent of the primitive rocks\r\non the Upper Mississippi, and in the basin of Lake Superior. Often in\r\ndistinct crystals.\r\n\r\n28. DIALLAGE, GREEN. Lake Superior. In detached masses, connected with\r\nprimitive boulders. _Harder_ than the species.\r\n\r\n29. SERPENTINE, COMMON. Presque Isle, Lake Superior.\r\n\r\n30. SERPENTINE, PRECIOUS. With the preceding. Color a light pistachio\r\ngreen, and takes a fine polish. Exists in veins in the common variety.\r\n\r\n31. PSEUDOMORPHOUS SERPENTINE. With the preceding. This beautiful green\r\nmineral constitutes a portion of the veins of the precious serpentine.\r\nIts crystalline impressions are very distinct.\r\n\r\n32. ARGILLITE. River St. Louis, northwest of Lake Superior. Nearly\r\nvertical in its position.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CLASS III. _Combustibles._\r\n\r\n33. PEAT. Marine sand formation composing the shore of Lake Superior,\r\nbetween White-fish Point and Grand Marrais. Also, on the island of\r\nMichilimackinac.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CLASS IV. _Ores and Metals._\r\n\r\n34. NATIVE COPPER. West side of Keweena Point, Lake Superior. Imbedded\r\nin a vein with carbonate of copper, and copper black, in the trap rock.\r\n\r\n35. COPPER BLACK. With the preceding.\r\n\r\n36. CARBONATE OF COPPER, GREEN. With the preceding.\r\n\r\nThese two minerals (35 and 36) characterize the trap rock of the\r\npeninsula of Keweena, Lake Superior, from Montreal Bay, extending to,\r\nand around its extremity, west, to Sand-hill Bay. The entire area may\r\nbe estimated to comprise a rocky, serrated coast of about seventy-five\r\nmiles in length, and not to exceed seven or eight miles in width. The\r\nprincipal veins are at a point called _Roche Verd_, and along the coast\r\nwhich we refer to as the Black Rocks. At the latter, native copper is\r\none of the constituents of the vein.\r\n\r\nGreen and blue carbonate of copper, was also observed in limited\r\nquantity, in small rounded masses at one of the lead diggings near\r\nMineral Point, Iowa county.\r\n\r\n38. CHROMATE OF IRON. Presque Isle, Lake Superior.\r\n\r\n39. SULPHURET OF LEAD. Lead mines of Iowa county, Michigan Territory.\r\n\r\n40. EARTHY CARBONATE OF LEAD.

INDIAN LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\n[The following observations are part of a course of lectures on the\r\ngrammatical structure of the Indian languages, delivered before the St.\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s Committee of the Algic Society.\xe2\x80\x94H. R. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n               I. LECTURES ON THE CHIPPEWA SUBSTANTIVE.\r\n\r\n                              LECTURE I.\r\n\r\n  _Observations on the Ojibwai Substantive. 1. The provision of the\r\n    language for indicating gender\xe2\x80\x94Its general and comprehensive\r\n    character\xe2\x80\x94The division of words into animate and inanimate\r\n    classes. 2. Number\xe2\x80\x94its recondite forms, arising from the terminal\r\n    vowel in the word. 3. The grammatical forms which indicate\r\n    possession, and enable the speaker to distinguish the objective\r\n    person._\r\n\r\nMost of the researches which have been directed to the Indian\r\nlanguages, have resulted in elucidating the principles governing the\r\nuse of the verb, which has been proved to be full and varied in its\r\ninflections. Either, less attention has been paid to the other parts\r\nof speech, or results less suited to create high expectations of\r\ntheir flexibility and powers, have been attained. The Indian verb has\r\nthus been made to stand out, as it were in bold relief as a shield\r\nto defects in the substantive and its accessories, and as, in fact,\r\ncompensating, by its multiform appendages of prefix and suffix\xe2\x80\x94by\r\nits tensal, its pronominal, its substantive, its adjective, and its\r\nadverbial terminations; for barrenness and rigidity in all other parts\r\nof speech. Influenced by this reflection, I shall defer, in the present\r\ninquiry, the remarks I intend offering on the verb, until I have\r\nconsidered the substantive, and its more important adjuncts.\r\n\r\nPalpable objects, to which the idea of sense strongly attaches, and\r\nthe actions or condition, which determine the relation of one object\r\nto another, are perhaps, the first points to demand attention in the\r\ninvention of languages. And they have certainly imprinted themselves\r\nvery strongly, with all their materiality, and with all their local,\r\nand exclusive, and personal peculiarities upon the Indian. The noun and\r\nthe verb not only thus constitute the principal elements of speech, as\r\nin all languages; but they continue to perform their first offices,\r\nwith less direct aid from the auxiliary parts of speech, than would\r\nappear to be reconcileable with a clear expression of the circumstances\r\nof time and place, number and person, quality and quantity, action and\r\nrepose, and the other accidents, on which their definite employment\r\ndepends. But to enable the substantives and attributives to perform\r\nthese complex offices, they are provided with inflections, and undergo\r\nchanges and modifications, by which words and phrases become very\r\nconcrete in their meaning, and are lengthened out to appear formidable\r\nto the eye. Hence the polysyllabic, and the descriptive character of\r\nthe language, so composite in its aspect and in its forms.\r\n\r\nTo utter succinctly, and in as few words as possible the prominent\r\nideas resting upon the mind of the speaker, appear to have been\r\nthe paramount object with the inventors of the language. Hence\r\nconcentration became a leading feature. And the pronoun, the adjective,\r\nthe adverb and the preposition, however they may be disjunctively\r\nemployed in certain cases, are chiefly useful as furnishing materials\r\nto the speaker, to be worked up into the complicated texture of the\r\nverb and the substantive. Nothing, in fact, can be more unlike,\r\nthan the language, viewed in its original, elementary state,\xe2\x80\x94in a\r\nvocabulary, for instance, of its primitive words, so far as such a\r\nvocabulary can now be formed, and the same language as heard under its\r\noral, amalgamated form. Its transpositions may be likened to a picture,\r\nin which the copal, the carmine and the white lead, are no longer\r\nrecognized as distinct substances, but each of which has contributed\r\nits share towards the effect. It is the painter only who possesses the\r\nprinciple, by which one element has been curtailed, another augmented,\r\nand all, however seemingly discordant, made to coalesce.\r\n\r\nSuch a language may be expected to abound in derivatives and\r\ncompounds; to afford rules for giving verbs substantive, and\r\nsubstantives verbal qualities; to concentrate the meaning of words upon\r\na few syllables, or upon a single letter, or alphabetical sign; and to\r\nsupply modes of contraction and augmentation, and, if I may so say,\r\n_short cuts_, and _by paths_ to meanings, which are equally novel and\r\ninteresting. To arrive at its primitives, we must pursue an intricate\r\nthread, where analogy is often the only guide. We must divest words of\r\nthose accumulated syllables, or particles, which, like the molecules\r\nof material matter, are clustered around the primitives. It is only\r\nafter a process of this kind, that the _principle of combination_\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nsecret wire, which moves the whole machinery can be searched for, with\r\na reasonable prospect of success. The labor of analysis is one of\r\nthe most interesting and important, which the subject presents. And\r\nit is a labor which it will be expedient to keep constantly in view,\r\nuntil we have separately considered the several parts of speech, and\r\nthe grammatical laws by which the language is held together; and thus\r\nestablished principles and provided materials wherewith we may the more\r\nsuccessfully labor.\r\n\r\n1. In a general survey of the language as it is spoken, and as it\r\nmust be written, there is perhaps no feature which obtrudes itself\r\nso constantly to view, as the principle which separates all words,\r\nof whatever denomination, into animates and inanimates, as they are\r\napplied to objects in the animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdom.\r\nThis principle has been grafted upon most words, and carries its\r\ndistinctions throughout the syntax. It is the gender of the language;\r\nbut a gender of so unbounded a scope, as to merge in it the common\r\ndistinctions of a masculine and feminine, and to give a two-fold\r\ncharacter to the parts of speech. The concords which it requires,\r\nand the double inflections it provides, will be mentioned in their\r\nappropriate places. It will be sufficient here to observe, that animate\r\nnouns require animate verbs for their nominatives, animate adjectives\r\nto express their qualities, and animate demonstrative pronouns to\r\nmark the distinctions of person. Thus, if we say, I see a man; I see\r\na house, the termination of the verb must be changed. What was in the\r\nfirst instance w\xc3\xa2b im\xc3\xa2, is altered to w\xc3\xa2b ind\xc3\xa2n. W\xc3\xa2b, is here the\r\ninfinitive, but the root of this verb is still more remote. If the\r\nquestion occur, Is it a good man, or a good house, the adjective,\r\nwhich, in the inanimate form is onishish-\xc3\xad, is, in the animate\r\nonishish-in\xc2\xb4. If the question be put, Is it this man, or this house,\r\nthe pronoun this, which is m\xc3\xa2 bum, in the animate, is changed to m\xc3\xa2\r\nndun, in the inanimate.\r\n\r\nNouns animate embrace the tribes of quadrupeds, birds, fishes,\r\ninsects, reptiles, crustace\xc3\xa6, the sun and moon and stars, thunder and\r\nlightning, for these are personified; and whatever either possesses\r\nanimal life, or is endowed, by the peculiar opinions and superstitions\r\nof the Indians, with it. In the vegetable kingdom, their number is\r\ncomparatively limited, being chiefly confined to trees, and those only\r\nwhile they are referred to, as whole bodies, and to the various species\r\nof fruits, and seeds, and esculents. It is at the option of the speaker\r\nto employ nouns, either as animates or inanimates: but it is a choice\r\nseldom resorted to, except in conformity with stated exceptions. These\r\nconventional exceptions are not numerous, and the more prominent of\r\nthem, may be recited. The cause of the exceptions it is not always\r\neasy to perceive. It may, however, generally be traced to a particular\r\nrespect paid to certain inanimate bodies, either from their real\r\nor fancied properties,\xe2\x80\x94the uses to which they are applied, or the\r\nceremonies to which they are dedicated. A stone, which is the altar of\r\nsacrifice to their Manitoes; a bow, formerly so necessary in the chase;\r\na feather, the honored sign of martial prowess; a kettle, so valuable\r\nin the household; a pipe, by which friendships are sealed and treaties\r\nratified; a drum, used in their sacred and festive dances; a medal, the\r\nmask of authority; vermillion, the appropriate paint of the warrior;\r\nwampum, by which messages are conveyed, and covenants remembered. These\r\nare among the objects, in themselves inanimates, which require the\r\napplication of animate verbs, pronouns, and adjectives, and are thereby\r\ntransferred to the animate class.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked, however, that the names for animals, are only\r\nemployed as animates, while the objects are referred to, as whole and\r\ncomplete species. But the gender must be changed, when it becomes\r\nnecessary to speak of separate numbers. Man, woman, father, mother, are\r\nseparate nouns, so long as the individuals are meant; but hand, foot,\r\nhead, eye, ear, tongue, are inanimates. Buck, is an animate noun, while\r\nhis entire carcass is referred to, whether living or dead; but neck,\r\nback, heart, windpipe, take the inanimate form. In like manner, eagle,\r\nswan, dove, are distinguished as animates, but beak, wing, tail, are\r\narranged with inanimates. So oak, pine, ash, are animate; branch, leaf,\r\nroot, inanimates.\r\n\r\nReciprocal exceptions, however, exist to this rule,\xe2\x80\x94the reasons for\r\nwhich, as in the former instance, may generally be sought, either\r\nin peculiar opinions of the Indians, or in the peculiar qualities\r\nor uses of the objects. Thus the talons of the eagle, and the claws\r\nof the bear, and of other animals, which furnish ornaments for the\r\nneck, are invariably spoken of, under the animate form. The hoofs and\r\nhorns of all quadrupeds, which are applied to various economical and\r\nmystic purposes; the castorum of the beaver, and the nails of man,\r\nare similarly situated. The vegetable creation also furnishes some\r\nexceptions of this nature; such are the names for the outer bark of all\r\ntrees, (except the birch,) and the branches, the roots, and the resin\r\nof the spruce, and its congeners.\r\n\r\nIn a language, which considers all nature as separated into two\r\nclasses of bodies, characterized by the presence or absence of life;\r\nneuter nouns, will scarcely be looked for, although such may exist\r\nwithout my knowledge. Neuters are found amongst the verbs and the\r\nadjectives, but it is doubtful whether they render the nouns to which\r\nthey are applied, neuters, in the sense we attach to that term. The\r\nsubject in all its bearings, is interesting, and a full and minute\r\ndescription of it, would probably elicit new light respecting some\r\ndoubtful points in the language, and contribute something towards a\r\ncurious collateral topic\xe2\x80\x94the history of Indian opinions. I have stated\r\nthe principle broadly, without filling up the subject of exceptions,\r\nas fully as it is in my power, and without following its bearings\r\nupon points, which will more properly come under discussion, at other\r\nstages of the inquiry. A sufficient outline, it is believed, has been\r\ngiven, and having thus met, at the threshold, a principle deeply laid\r\nat the foundation of the language, and one which will be perpetually\r\nrecurring, I shall proceed to enumerate some other prominent features\r\nof the substantive.\r\n\r\n2. No language is perhaps so defective, as to be totally without\r\nnumber. But there, are, probably, few which furnish so many modes of\r\nindicating it, as the Ojibwai. There are as many modes of forming\r\nthe plural, as there are vowel sounds, yet there is no distinction\r\nbetween a limited and unlimited plural; although there is, in the\r\npronoun, an _inclusive_ and an _exclusive_ plural. Whether we say man\r\nor men, two men or twenty men, the singular, inin\xc2\xb4i, and the plural\r\ninin\xc2\xb4iwug, remains the same. But if we say we, or us, or our men, (who\r\nare present,) or we, or us, or our Indians, (in general,) the plural\r\nwe, and us, and our\xe2\x80\x94for they are rendered by the same form\xe2\x80\x94admit of\r\na change to indicate whether the objective person be _included_ or\r\n_excluded_. This principle, of which full examples will be given under\r\nthe appropriate head, forms a single and anomalous instance of the use\r\nof particular plurals. And it carries its distinctions, by means of the\r\npronouns, separable and inseparable, into the verbs and substantives,\r\ncreating the necessity of double conjugations and double declensions,\r\nin the plural forms of the first person. Thus, the term for Our Father,\r\nwhich, in the inclusive form, is K\xc3\xb4sin\xc3\xa2n, is, in the exclusive, N\xc3\xb4sin\xc3\xa2n.\r\n\r\nThe particular plural, which is thus, by the transforming power of the\r\nlanguage, carried from the pronoun into the texture of the verb and\r\nsubstantive, is not limited to any fixed number of persons or objects,\r\nbut arises from the operations of the verb. The general plural is\r\nvariously made. But the plural, making inflections take upon themselves\r\nan additional power or sign, by which substantives are distinguished\r\ninto animate and inanimate. Without this additional power, all nouns\r\nplural, would end in the vowels a, e, i, o, u. But to mark the gender\r\nthe letter g, is added to animates, and the letter n, to inanimates,\r\nmaking the plurals of the first class, terminate in \xc3\xa2g, eeg, ig, \xc3\xb4g,\r\nug, and of the second class in \xc3\xa2n, een, in, \xc3\xb4n, un. Ten modes of\r\nforming the plural are thus provided, five of which are animate, and\r\nfive inanimate plurals. A strong and clear line of distinction is thus\r\ndrawn between the two classes of words, so unerring indeed, in its\r\napplication, that it is only necessary to inquire how the plural is\r\nformed, to determine whether it belong to one, or the other class. The\r\ndistinctions which we have endeavored to convey, will perhaps, be more\r\nclearly perceived, by adding examples of the use of each of the plurals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Animate Plural.\r\n\r\n  a. Ojibw\xc3\xa2i,    a Chippewa.           Ojibwaig,    Chippewas.\r\n  e. Ojee,       a Fly.                Ojeeg,       Flies.\r\n  i. Kos\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa2n,      Our father, (in.)   Kosen\xc3\xa2n-ig,  Our fathers, (in.)\r\n  o. Ahm\xc3\xb4,       a Bee.                Ahm-\xc3\xb4g,      Bees.\r\n  u. Ais,        a Shell.              Ais-ug,      Shells.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Inanimate Plural.\r\n\r\n  a. Ishk\xc3\xb4dai,    Fire.    Ishk\xc3\xb4dain,    Fires.\r\n  e. Wadd\xc3\xb4p,      Alder.   Wadd\xc3\xb4p-een,   Alders.\r\n  i. Adetaig,     Fruit.   Adetaig-in,   Fruits.\r\n  o. N\xc3\xb4din,       Wind.    N\xc3\xb4din-\xc3\xb4n,     Winds.\r\n  u. Meen,        Berry,   Meen-un,      Berries.\r\n\r\nWhere a noun terminates with a vowel in the singular, the addition\r\nof the g, or n, shows at once, both the plural and the gender. In\r\nother instances, as in peenai, a partridge\xe2\x80\x94seebi, a river\xe2\x80\x94it requires\r\na consonant to precede the plural vowel, in conformity with a rule\r\npreviously stated. Thus, peenai, is rendered peenai-wug\xe2\x80\x94and seebi,\r\nseebi-wun. Where the noun singular terminates in the broad, instead\r\nof the long sound of a, as in \xc3\xb4gim\xc3\xa2, a chief ishpatin\xc3\xa2, a hill, the\r\nplural is ogim-ag, ishpatin\xc3\xa2n. But these are mere modifications of two\r\nof the above forms, and are by no means entitled to be considered as\r\nadditional plurals.\r\n\r\nComparatively few substantives, are without number. The following may\r\nbe enumerated.\r\n\r\n  Missun\xc2\xb4,       Fire wood.\r\n  Pinggwi,       Ashes.\r\n  M\xc3\xa9jim,         Food.\r\n  K\xc3\xb4n,           Snow.\r\n  Mishk\xc2\xb4wi,      Blood.\r\n  Ukkukkuzhas,   Coals.\r\n  Uss\xc3\xa1im\xc3\xa2,       Tobacco.\r\n  Naigow,        Sand.\r\n  Ahioun,        Mist.\r\n  Kimmiwun,      Rain.\r\n  Oss\xc3\xa2kumig,     Moss.\r\n  Unitshimin,    Peas.\r\n\r\nOthers may be found, and indeed, a few others are known. But it\r\nis less an object, in this lecture to pursue exceptions into their\r\nminutest ramifications, than to sketch broad rules, applicable, if not\r\nto every word, to at least a majority of words in the language.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one exception from the general use of number, so\r\npeculiar in itself, that not to point it out, would be an unpardonable\r\nremissness, in giving the outlines of a language, in which it is an\r\nobject, neither to extenuate faults, nor to overrate beauties. This\r\nexception consists in the want of number in the _third person_ of\r\nthe declensions of animate nouns, and the conjugation of animate\r\nverbs. Not, that such words are destitute of number, in their simple\r\nforms, or when used under circumstances requiring no change of these\r\nsimple forms\xe2\x80\x94no prefixes and no inflections. But it will be seen, at\r\na glance, how very limited such an application of words must be, in a\r\ntranspositive language.\r\n\r\nThus mang and k\xc3\xa2g (loon and porcupine) take the plural inflection wug,\r\nbecoming mang wug and kag wug (loons and porcupines.) So, in their\r\npronominal declension\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  My loon         Ni mang   oom\r\n  Thy loon        Ki mang   oom\r\n  My porcupine    Ni g\xc3\xa2g    oom\r\n  Thy porcupine   Ki g\xc3\xa2g    oom\r\n  My loons        Ni mang   oom  ug\r\n  Thy loons       Ki mang   oom  ug\r\n  My porcupines   Ni g\xc3\xa2g    oom  ug\r\n  Thy porcupines  Ki g\xc3\xa2g    oom  ug\r\n\r\nBut his loon, or loons, (o mang oom un) his porcupine or porcupines,\r\n(o g\xc3\xa2g oom un) are without number. The rule applies equally to the\r\nclass of words, in which the pronouns are inseparable. Thus, my father\r\nand thy father, n\xc3\xb4s and k\xc3\xb4s, become my fathers and thy fathers, by\r\nthe numerical inflection ug, forming n\xc3\xb4sug and k\xc3\xb4sug. But \xc3\xb4sun, his\r\nfather or fathers is vague, and does not indicate whether there be\r\none father or twenty fathers. The inflection un, merely denotes the\r\n_object_. The rule also applies equally to sentences, in which the\r\nnoun is governed by, or governs the verb. Whether we say, I saw a\r\nbear\xe2\x80\x94ningi w\xc3\xa2bum\xc3\xa2 mukwah, or a bear saw me\xe2\x80\x94mukwah ningi w\xc3\xa2bumig, the\r\nnoun, itself, undergoes no change, and its number is definite. But ogi\r\nw\xc3\xa2bum-\xc3\xa2n muk-wun, he saw bear, is indefinite, although both the verb\r\nand the noun have changed their endings. And if the narrator does not\r\nsubsequently determine the number, the hearer is either left in doubt,\r\nor must resolve it by a question. In fine, the whole acts of the third\r\nperson are thus rendered questionable. This want of precision, which\r\nwould seem to be fraught with so much confusion, appears to be obviated\r\nin practice, by the employment of adjectives, by numerical inflections\r\nin the relative words of the sentence, by the use of the indefinite\r\narticle, paizhik, or by demonstrative pronouns. Thus, paizhik mukw_un_\r\nogi w\xc3\xa2bum_\xc3\xa2n_, conveys with certainty the information\xe2\x80\x94he saw _a_ bear.\r\nBut in this sentence both the noun and the verb retain the objective\r\ninflections, as in the former instances. These inflections are not\r\nuniformly un, but sometimes een, as in ogeen, his mother, and sometimes\r\n\xc3\xb4n, as in odakeek-\xc3\xb4n, his kettle, in all which instances, however, the\r\nnumber is left indeterminate. It may hence be observed, and it is a\r\nremark which we shall presently have occasion to corroborate, that the\r\nplural inflection to inanimate nouns, (which have no objective form,)\r\nforms the objective inflection to animate nouns, which have no number\r\nin the third person.\r\n\r\n3. This leads us to the consideration of the mode of forming\r\npossessives, the existence of which, when it shall have been indicated\r\nby full examples, will present to the mind of the inquirer, one of\r\nthose tautologies in grammatical forms, which, without imparting\r\nadditional precision, serve to clothe the language with accumulated\r\nverbiage. The strong tendency to combination and amalgamation,\r\nexisting in the language, renders it difficult, in fact to discuss\r\nthe principles of it, in that elementary form which, could be wished.\r\nIn the analysis of words and forms we are constantly led from the\r\ncentral point of discussion. To recur, however, from these collateral\r\nunravelings, to the main thread of inquiry, at as short and frequent\r\nintervals as possible, and thus to preserve the chain of conclusions\r\nand proofs, is so important that without keeping the object distinctly\r\nin view, I should despair of conveying any clear impressions of those\r\ngrammatical features, which impart to the language its peculiar\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that the distinctions of number, are founded\r\nupon a modification of the five vowel sounds. Possessives are likewise\r\nfounded upon the basis of the vowel sounds. There are five declensions\r\nof the noun to mark the possessive, ending in the possessive in \xc3\xa2m,\r\neem, im, \xc3\xb4m, um, oom. Where the nominative ends with a vowel, the\r\npossessive is made by adding the letter m, as in maimai, a woodcock, ni\r\nmaimaim, my woodcock, &c. Where the nominative ends in a consonant, as\r\nin ais, a shell, the full possessive inflection is required, making nin\r\ndais-im, my shell. In the latter form the consonant d, is interposed\r\nbetween the pronoun and noun, and sounded with the noun, in conformity\r\nwith a general rule. Where the nominative ends in the broad, in lieu\r\nof the long sound of a, as in ogim\xc3\xa2, a chief\xe2\x80\x94the possessive is \xc3\xa2m. The\r\nsound of i, in the third declension, is that of i in pin, and the sound\r\nof u, in the fifth declension, is that of u in bull. The latter will be\r\nuniformly represented by oo.\r\n\r\nThe possessive declensions run throughout both the animate and\r\ninanimate classes of nouns, with some exceptions in the latter\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nknife, bowl, paddle, &c.\r\n\r\nInanimate nouns are thus declined.\r\n\r\nNominative, Ishk\xc3\xb4dai, Fire.\r\n\r\n                { My,     Nin  Dishkod-aim.\r\n                { Thy,    Ki   Dishkod-aim.\r\n                { His,    O    Dishkod-aim.\r\n  Possessive.   { Our,    Ki   Dishkod-aim-in\xc3\xa2n. (in.)\r\n                { \xe2\x80\x94       Ni   Dishkod-aim-in\xc3\xa2n. (ex.)\r\n                { Your,   Ki   Dishkod-aim-iw\xc3\xa2.\r\n                { Their,  O    Dishkod-aim-iw\xc3\xa2.\r\n\r\nThose words which form exceptions from this declension, take the\r\nseparable pronouns before them, as follows.\r\n\r\n  M\xc3\xb4koman,      A Knife.\r\n  Ni m\xc3\xb4koman,   My Knife.\r\n  Ki m\xc3\xb4koman,   Thy Knife.\r\n  O m\xc3\xb4koman,    His Knife, &c.\r\n\r\nAnimate substantives are declined precisely in the same manner as\r\ninanimate, except in the third person, which takes to the possessive\r\ninflections, aim, eem, im, \xc3\xb4m, oom, the objective particle un, denoting\r\nthe compound inflection of this person, both in the singular and\r\nplural, aimun, eemun, imun, \xc3\xb4mun, oomun, and the variation of the\r\nfirst vowel sound, \xc3\xa2mun. Thus, to furnish an example of the second\r\ndeclension, pizhik\xe2\x80\x99i, a bison, changes its forms to nim, bizhik-im, my\r\nbison\xe2\x80\x94ke bizhik-im, thy bison, O bizhik-imun, his bison, or bisons.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this double inflection in the third person, may be left\r\nfor future inquiry. But we may add further examples in aid of it. We\r\ncannot simply say, The chief has killed a bear, or, to reverse the\r\nobject upon which the energy of the verb is exerted, The bear has\r\nkilled a chief. But, ogim\xc3\xa2 ogi niss\xc3\xa2n mukwun, literally, _Chief he has\r\nkilled him bear_, or, mukwah ogi niss\xc3\xa2n ogim\xc3\xa2n, _Bear he has killed\r\nhim chief_. Here the verb and the noun are both objective in _un_,\r\nwhich is sounded \xc3\xa2n, where it comes after the broad sound of a, as in\r\nniss\xc3\xa2n, objective of the verb to kill. If we confer the powers of the\r\nEnglish possessive, (\xe2\x80\x99s) upon the inflections aim, eem, im, \xc3\xb4m, oom,\r\nand \xc3\xa2m respectively, and the meaning of _him_, and of course he, her,\r\nhis, hers, they, theirs, (as there is no declension of the pronoun,\r\nand no number to the third person) upon the objective particle un, we\r\nshall then translate the above expression, o bizhik-eemum, _his bison\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhisn_. If we reject this meaning, as I think we should, the sentence\r\nwould read, His bison\xe2\x80\x94him\xe2\x80\x94a mere tautology.\r\n\r\nIt is true, it may be remarked, that the noun possessed, has a\r\ncorresponding termination, or pronominal correspondence, with the\r\npronoun possessor, also a final termination indicative of its being\r\nthe _object_ on which the verb exerts its influence\xe2\x80\x94a mode of\r\nexpression, which, so far as relates to the possessive, would be deemed\r\nsuperfluous, in modern languages; but may have some analogy in the\r\nLatin accusatives am, um, em.\r\n\r\nIt is a constant and unremitting aim in the Indian languages to\r\ndistinguish the actor from the object, partly by prefixes, and partly\r\nby inseparable suffixes. That the termination _un_, is one of these\r\ninseparable particles, and that its office, while it confounds the\r\nnumber, is to designate the object, appears probable from the fact,\r\nthat it retains its connexion with the noun, whether the latter follow\r\nor precede the verb, or whatever its position in the sentence may be.\r\n\r\nThus we can, without any perplexity in the meaning say,\r\n_Waimittig\xc3\xb4zhiwug ogi sagi\xc3\xa2n Pontiac-un_, Frenchmen they did love\r\nPontiac him. Or to reverse it, _Pontiac-un Waimittig\xc3\xb4zhiwug ogi\r\nsagi\xc3\xa2n_, Pontiac, he did Frenchmen he loved. The termination un in both\r\ninstances, clearly determines the object beloved. So in the following\r\ninstance, _Sagunoshug ogi sagi\xc3\xa2n Tecumseh-un_, Englishmen, they did\r\nlove Tecumseh, or _Tecumseh-un Sagunoshug oji sagi\xc3\xa2n_, Tecumseh, he did\r\nEnglishmen he loved.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the operation of this rule, through the doublings of the\r\nlanguage, it is necessary to distinguish every modification of sound,\r\nwhether it is accompanied, or not accompanied by a modification of\r\nthe sense. The particle un, which thus marks _the third person and\r\npersons_, is sometimes pronounced _wun_, and sometimes _yun_, as the\r\nharmony of the word to which it is suffixed, may require. But not the\r\nslightest change is thereby made in its meaning.\r\n\r\nW\xc3\xa2bojeeg ogi meeg\xc3\xa2n-\xc3\xa2n n\xc3\xa2dowaisi-wun.\r\n\r\nW\xc3\xa2bojeeg fought his enemies. L. W. he did fight them, his enemy, or\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nO s\xc3\xa2gi-\xc3\xa2n inini-wun.\r\n\r\nHe, or she loves a man. L. He, or she, loves him-man, or men.\r\n\r\nKigo-yun waindji pimm\xc3\xa2dizziw\xc3\xa2d.\r\n\r\nThey subsist on fish. L. Fish or fishes, they upon them, they live.\r\n\r\nOntwa o sagi\xc3\xa2n odi-yun.\r\n\r\nOntwa loves his dog. L. O. he loves him, his dog, or dogs.\r\n\r\nIn these sentences the letters w and y are introduced before the\r\ninflection un, merely for euphony\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and to enable the speaker\r\nto utter the final vowel of the substantive, and the inflective\r\nvowel, without placing both under the accent. It is to be remarked in\r\nthese examples, that the verb has a corresponding inflection with the\r\nnoun, indicated by the final consonant n, as in sagi\xc3\xa2-n, objective\r\nof the verb to love. This is merely a modification of un, where it\r\nis requisite to employ it after broad a (aw,) and it is applicable\r\nto nouns as well as verbs whenever they end in that sound. Thus, in\r\nthe phrase, he saw a chief, O w\xc3\xa2bum\xc3\xa2-n O gim\xc3\xa2-n, both noun and verb\r\nterminate in n. It is immaterial to the sense, which precedes. And this\r\nleads to the conclusion, which we are, in some measure, compelled to\r\nstate, in anticipation of our remarks on the verb. That verbs must not\r\nonly agree with their nominatives in number, person and _gender_ (we\r\nuse the latter term for want of a more appropriate one,) but also with\r\ntheir objectives. Hence the objective sign n, in the above examples.\r\nSometimes this sign is removed from the ending of the verb, to make\r\nroom for the plural of the nominative person, and is subjoined to the\r\nlatter. Thus,\r\n\r\n    O sagi\xc3\xa2(w\xc3\xa2)n.\r\n    They love them, him or them.\r\n\r\nIn this phrase the interposed syllable (w\xc3\xa2) is, apparently, the\r\nplural\xe2\x80\x94it is a reflective plural\xe2\x80\x94of _he_\xe2\x80\x94the latter being, indicated\r\nas usual, by the sign O. It has been observed, above, that the\r\ndeficiency in number, in the third person, is sometimes supplied \xe2\x80\x9cby\r\nnumerical inflections in the relative words of the sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d and this\r\ninterposed particle, (w\xc3\xa2) affords an instance in point. The number of\r\nthe nominative pronoun appears to be thus rendered precise, but the\r\nobjective is still indefinite.\r\n\r\nWhen two nouns are used without a verb in the sentence, or when two\r\nnouns compose the whole matter uttered, being in the third person, both\r\nhave the full objective inflection. Thus,\r\n\r\n  Os-(un.) Odi-(yun.)\r\n\r\nHis father\xe2\x80\x99s dog. L.

If the expression\r\nNin Dy or N\xe2\x80\x99 Dy, is sometimes applied to the horse, it is because it\r\nis thereby intended to call him, my dog, from his being in a state of\r\nservitude similar to that of the dog. It must be borne in mind, as\r\nconnected with this subject, that the dog, in high northern latitudes,\r\nand even as far south as 42 deg. is both a beast of draught and of\r\nburden. He is compelled during the winter season to draw the _od\xc3\xa0ban_,\r\nor Indian sleigh; and sometimes to support the burden upon his back, by\r\nmeans of a kind of drag constructed of slender poles.\r\n\r\nA review of the facts which have been brought together respecting the\r\nsubstantive, will show that the separable or inseparable pronouns under\r\nthe form of prefixes, are throughout required. It will also indicate,\r\nthat the inflections of the first and second persons which occupy\r\nthe place of possessives, and those of the third person, resembling\r\nobjectives, pertain to words, which are either primitives, or denote\r\nbut a single object, as moose, fire. There is, however another class of\r\nsubstantives, or substantive expressions, and an extensive class\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nit embraces a great portion of the compound descriptive terms\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nuse of which, no pronominal prefixes are required, The distinctions\r\nof person are, exclusively, supplied by pronominal suffixes. Of this\r\ncharacter are the words descriptive of country, place of dwelling,\r\nfield of battle, place of employment, &c. The following example will\r\nfurnish the inflexions applicable to this entire class of words.\r\n\r\nAind\xc3\xa2d: Home, or place of dwelling.\r\n\r\n    _S. singular._\r\n  Aind\xc3\xa2-y\xc3\xa2n.

Mode in which the latter are employed\r\n    to denote the disease of individuals, and to indicate the past\r\n    and future seasons. Restricted or sexual terms. Conversion of\r\n    the substantive into a verb, and the reciprocal character of the\r\n    verb, by which it is converted into a substantive. Derivative and\r\n    compound substantives. Summary of the properties of this part of\r\n    speech._\r\n\r\nIn the view which has been taken of the substantive in the preceding\r\nlecture, it has been deemed proper to exclude several topics,\r\nwhich, from their peculiarities, it was believed, could be more\r\nsatisfactorily discussed in a separate form. Of this character are\r\nthose modifications of the substantive by which locality, diminution, a\r\ndefective quality, and the past tense are expressed; by which various\r\nadjective and adverbial significations are given; and finally, the\r\nsubstantives themselves converted into verbs. Such are also the mode\r\nof indicating the masculine and feminine (both merged, as we have\r\nshown, in the animate class) and those words which are of a strictly\r\n_sexual_ character, or are restricted in their _use_ either to males\r\nor females. Not less interesting is the manner of forming derivatives,\r\nand of conferring upon the derivatives so formed, a _personality_,\r\ndistinguished as either animate or inanimate, at the option of the\r\nspeaker.\r\n\r\nMuch of the flexibility of the substantive is derived from these\r\nproperties, and they undoubtedly add much to the figurative character\r\nof the language. Some of them have been thought analogous to case,\r\nparticularly that inflection of the noun which indicates the locality\r\nof the object. But if so, then there would be equally strong reasons\r\nfor establishing an _adjective_, and an _adverbial_, as well as a\r\n_local_ case, and a plurality of forms in each. But it is believed\r\nthat no such necessity exists. There is no regular declension of\r\nthese forms, and they are all used under limitations and restrictions\r\nincompatible with the true principles of case.\r\n\r\nIt is under this view of the subject, that the discussion of these\r\nforms has been transferred, together with the other accidents of the\r\nsubstantive just adverted to, and reserved, as the subject matter of a\r\nseparate lecture. And in now proceeding to express the conclusions at\r\nwhich we have arrived touching these points, it will be an object so to\r\ncompress and arrange the materials before us, as to present within a\r\nsmall compass, the leading facts and examples, upon which each separate\r\nposition depends.\r\n\r\n1. That quality of the noun, which, in the shape of an inflection,\r\ndenotes the relative situation of the object, by the contiguous\r\nposition of some accessory object, is expressed in the English\r\nlanguage, by the prepositions _in_, _into_, _at_, or _on_. In the\r\nIndian they are denoted by an inflection. Thus the phrase, In the box,\r\nis rendered in the Indian by one word, _mukukoong_. Of this word,\r\nmukuk, simply, is box. The termination _oong_, denoting the locality,\r\nnot of the box, but of the object sought after. The expression appears\r\nto be precise, although there is no definite article in the language.\r\n\r\nThe substantive takes this form, most commonly, after a question has\r\nbeen put, as, Anindl ni m\xc3\xb4koman-ais? where is my penknife? Mukukoong,\r\n(in the box,) add\xc3\xb4powin-ing, (on the table,) are definite replies\r\nto this question. But the form is not restricted to this relation.\r\nChim\xc3\xa2n-ing n\xe2\x80\x99guh p\xc3\xb4z, I shall embark in the canoe; wakyigun n\xe2\x80\x99guh izh\xc3\xa2,\r\nI shall go into the house, are perfectly correct, though somewhat\r\nformal expressions, when the canoe or the house are present to the\r\nspeaker\xe2\x80\x99s view.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of these inflections has been restricted to _in_,\r\n_into_, _at_, and _on_. But they are the more appropriate forms of\r\nexpressing the three first senses, there being other modes beside\r\nthese of expressing the preposition _on_. These modes consist in\r\nthe use of prepositions and will be explained under that head. The\r\nchoice of the one, or the other, is, however, with the speaker.\r\nGenerally, the inflection is employed, when there is some circumstance\r\nor condition of the noun, either concealed, or not fully apparent.\r\nThus, Muzzinyigun-ing, is the appropriate term for _in the book_, and\r\n_may_ also be used to signify _on the book_. But if it is meant only\r\nto signify _on_ the book, something visible being referred to, the\r\npreposition _ogidj_ would be used, that word indicating with certainty\r\n_on_, and never _in_. Wakyigun-ing indicates with clearness, _in\r\nthe house_; but if it is necessary to say _on the house_, and it be\r\nmeant at the same time to exclude any reference to the interior, the\r\nexpression would be changed to _ogidj wakyigun_.\r\n\r\nIt will be proper further to remark, in this place, in the way of\r\nlimitation, that there is also a separate preposition signifying\r\n_in_. It is _pinj_. But the use of this word does not, in all cases,\r\nsupersede the necessity of inflecting the noun. Thus the expression\r\n_pindigain_, is literally _walk in_, or enter. But if it is intended\r\nto say, walk in the house, the local, and not the simple form of house\r\nmust be used; and the expression is\xe2\x80\x94Pindigain waky\xc2\xb4igun-ing, _Enter in\r\nthe house_,\xe2\x80\x94the verbal form which this preposition pinj puts on, having\r\nno allusion to the act of _walking_, but merely implying position.\r\n\r\nThe local inflection, which in the above examples, is _ing_ and _oong_,\r\nis further changed to _aing_ and _eeng_, as the ear may direct\xe2\x80\x94changes\r\nwhich are governed chiefly by the terminal vowel of the noun. Examples\r\nwill best supply the rule, as well as the exceptions to it.\r\n\r\n      SIMPLE FORM.                   LOCAL FORM.\r\n\r\n  a.

And here another conclusion presses upon us\xe2\x80\x94that where these\r\nlocal terminations, in all their variety, are added to the names of\r\nanimated beings, when such names are the nominatives of adjectives or\r\nadjective-nouns, these words are converted into terms of qualification,\r\nindicating _like_, _resembling_, _equal_. Thus, if we wish to say to\r\na boy, he is like a man, the expression is, Inin-ing izzhin\xc3\xa2gozzi;\r\nor if to a man, he is like a bear, Mukk-oong izzhin\xc3\xa2gozzi; or to a\r\nbear, he is like a horse, Pabaizhikog\xc3\xa2zh-ing izzhin\xc3\xa2gozzi. In all\r\nthese expressions the word _izzhi_, is combined with the pronominal\r\ninflection _\xc3\xa2_ (or n\xc3\xa2) and the animate termination _gozzi_. And the\r\ninflection of the nominative is merely an adjective correspondence\r\nwith _izzhi_:\xe2\x80\x94a term indicative of the general qualities of persons\r\nor animated beings. Where a comparison is instituted or a resemblance\r\npointed out between inanimate instead of animate objects, the\r\ninflection _gozzi_, is changed to _gwud_, rendering the expression,\r\nwhich was, in the animate form, izzhin\xc3\xa2_gozzi_, in the inanimate form,\r\nizzhin\xc3\xa2_gwud_.\r\n\r\nThere is another variation of the local form of the noun, in\r\naddition to those above instanced, indicative of locality in a more\r\ngeneral sense. It is formed by _ong_ or _nong_\xe2\x80\x94frequent terminations\r\nin geographical names. Thus from Ojibwai, (Chippewa), is formed\r\nOjibwai_nong_, Place of the Chippewas. From Wamittigozhiwug, Frenchmen,\r\nis formed Wamittigozhi_nong_, Place of Frenchmen. From Ishpatin\xc3\xa2 hill,\r\nIshpatinong, Place of the hill, &c. The termination _ing_, is also\r\nsometimes employed in this more general sense, as in the following\r\nnames of places.\r\n\r\n  Monomonik\xc3\xa2n_ing_. In the place of wild rice.\r\n  Moninggwunik\xc3\xa2n_ing_. In the place of Sparrows.\r\n  Ongwashagoosh_ing_. In the place of the fallen tree.  &c.\r\n\r\n2. The diminutive forms of the noun are indicated by ais, eas, \xc3\xb4s,\r\nand aus, as the final vowel of the word may require. Thus Ojibwai,\r\na Chippewa, becomes Ojibw-ais, a little Chippewa: Ini\xe1\xb9\x85\xc2\xb4i, a man,\r\ninin-ees, a little man: Amik, a beaver, amik-\xc3\xb4s, a young beaver: Ogim\xc3\xa2,\r\na chief, ogim-\xc3\xa2s, a little chief, or a chief of little authority.\r\nFurther examples may be added.\r\n\r\n          SIMPLE FORM.

As far as they can be employed they supersede the use\r\nof adjectives, or prevent the repetition of them. And they enable\r\nthe speaker to give a turn to the expression, which is often very\r\nsuccessfully employed in producing ridicule or contempt. When applied\r\nto the tribes of animals, or to inorganic objects, their meaning,\r\nhowever, is, very nearly, limited to an inferiority in size or age.\r\nThus, in the above examples, pizhik-ees, signifies a calf, omim-ees, a\r\nyoung pigeon, and ossin-ees, a pebble &c. But inin-ees, and ogim-\xc3\xa2s,\r\nare connected with the idea of mental or conventional as well as bodily\r\ninferiority.\r\n\r\n1. I saw a little chief, standing upon a small island, with an inferior\r\nmedal about his neck.\r\n\r\nOgim\xc3\xa2s n\xe2\x80\x99gi w\xc3\xa2bum\xc3\xa2 nibowid minnisainsing on\xc3\xa2bikow\xc3\xa2n shoni\xc3\xa2sun.\r\n\r\n2. Yamoyden threw at a young pigeon.\r\n\r\nOgi pukkitalwun omimeesun Yamoyden.\r\n\r\n3. A buffalo calf stood in a small stream.\r\n\r\nPizhikees ki nibowi sibeesing.\r\n\r\n4.

Thus the word\r\nminnisainsing, signifies literally, _in the little island_; seebees\r\ning, _in the little stream_; add\xc3\xb4powinais ing, _on the small table_.\r\n\r\n3. The preceeding forms are not the only ones by which adjective\r\nqualities are conferred upon the substantive. The syllable _ish_\r\nwhen added to a noun indicates a bad or dreaded quality, or conveys\r\nthe idea of imperfection or decay. The sound of this inflection is\r\nsometimes changed to eesh oosh, or aush. Thus, Chim\xc3\xa2n, a canoe, becomes\r\nChim\xc3\xa2nish, a bad canoe; Ekwai, a woman, Ekwaiwish, a bad woman; nibi,\r\nwater, becomes nibeesh, turbid or strong water; mittig, a tree, becomes\r\nmittigoosh, a decayed tree; akkik, a kettle, akkikoosh, a worn-out\r\nkettle. By a further change, wibid, a tooth, becomes wibid_\xc3\xa2sh_, a\r\ndecayed or aching tooth, &c. Throughout these changes the final sound\r\nof _sh_ is retained, so that this sound alone, at the end of a word, is\r\nindicative of a faulty quality.\r\n\r\nIn a language in which the expressions bad-dog, and faint-heart are\r\nthe superlative terms of reproach, and in which there are few words\r\nto indicate the modifications between positively good, and positively\r\nbad, it must appear evident, that adjective inflections of this kind,\r\nmust be convenient, and sometimes necessary modes of expression. They\r\nfurnish a means of conveying censure and dislike, which though often\r\nmild, is sometimes severe. Thus if one person has had occasion to\r\nrefuse the offered hand of another\xe2\x80\x94for it must be borne in mind, that\r\nthe Indians are a hand-shaking people, as well as the Europeans\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nimplacable party has it at his option in referring to the circumstance,\r\nto use the adjective form of hand, not _onindj_, but oninj_eesh_,\r\nwhich would be deemed contemptuous in a high degree. So also, instead\r\nof od\xc3\xa2wai winini, a trader, or man who sells, the word may be changed\r\nto od\xc3\xa2wai winini-_wish_, implying a bad or dishonest trader. It is\r\nseldom that a more pointed, or positive mode of expressing personal\r\ndisapprobation or dislike is required, for, generally speaking, more is\r\nimplied by these modes than is actually expressed.\r\n\r\nThe following examples are drawn from the inorganic as well as organic\r\ncreation, embracing the two classes of nouns that the operation of\r\nthese forms may be fully perceived.\r\n\r\n                      SIMPLE FORM.

More attention has, perhaps, been bestowed upon these points, than\r\ntheir importance demanded, but in giving anything like a comprehensive\r\nsketch of the substantive, they could not be omitted; and if mentioned\r\nat all, it became necessary to pursue them through their various\r\nchanges and limitations. Another reason has presented itself. In\r\ntreating of an unwritten language of which others are to judge chiefly\r\nfrom examples, it appeared desirable that the positions advanced\r\nshould be accompanied by the data upon which they respectively rest\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nleast, by so much of the data employed, as to enable philologists to\r\nappreciate the justice or detect the fallacy of our conclusions. To the\r\nfew, who take any interest in the subject at all, minuteness will not\r\nseem tedious, and the examples will be regarded with deep interest.\r\n\r\nAs much of our time as we have already devoted to these lesser points\r\nof inquiry, it will be necessary, at this place, to point out other\r\ninflections and modifications of the substantive, to clear it from\r\nobscurities, that we may go into the discussion of the other parts of\r\nspeech, unencumbered.\r\n\r\nOf these remaining forms, none is more interesting than that, which\r\nenables the speaker by a simple inflection, to denote that the\r\nindividual named has ceased to exist. This delicate mode of conveying\r\nmelancholy intelligence, or alluding to the dead, is effected by\r\nplacing the object in the past tense.\r\n\r\nAiekid-\xc3\xb4pun aieko Garrangula-bun.\r\n\r\nSo the deceased Garrangula spoke.\r\n\r\nThe syllable _bun_, in this sentence, added to the noun, and _\xc3\xb4pun_\r\nadded to the verb, place both in the past tense. And although the death\r\nof the Indian orator is not mentioned, that fact would be invariably\r\ninferred.\r\n\r\nNames which do not terminate in a vowel sound, require a vowel prefixed\r\nto the tensal inflection, rendering it _\xc3\xb4bun_, or _ebun_. Inanimate, as\r\nwell as animate nouns take these inflections.\r\n\r\n    PRESENT.                PAST FORM.\r\n  Tecumseh,               Tecumsi-bun.\r\n  Tammany,                Tamani-bun.\r\n  Skenandoah,             Skenandoa-bun.\r\n  N\xc3\xb4s, (my father)        Nos-\xc3\xaabun.\r\n  Pontiac,                Pontiac-ibun.\r\n  Waub Ojeeg,             Waub Ojeeg-ibun.\r\n  Tarhe,                  Tarhi-bun.\r\n  Mittig, (a tree)        Mittig-\xc3\xb4bun.\r\n  Akkik, (a kettle)       Akkik-\xc3\xb4bun.\r\n  M\xc3\xb4z, (a moose)          M\xc3\xb4z-\xc3\xb4bun.\r\n\r\nBy prefixing the particle _Tah_ to these words, and changing the\r\ninflection of the animate nouns to _iwi_, and the inanimates to _iwun_,\r\nthey are rendered future. Thus Tah Pontiac-iwi: Tah Mittig-iwun, &c.\r\n\r\nThe names for the seasons only come under the operation of these rules,\r\nwhen the year before the last, or the year after the next, is referred\r\nto. The last, and the ensuing season, are indicated as follows.\r\n\r\n            _Present._      _Last._        _Next._\r\n  Spring,    Seegwun,    Seegwun-oong,    Segwun.\r\n  Summer,    Neebin,     Neebin-oong,     Neebing.\r\n  Autumn,    Tahgw\xc3\xa2gi,   Tahgw\xc3\xa2g-oong,    Tahgw\xc3\xa2gig.\r\n  Winter,    Peeb\xc3\xb4n,     Peeb\xc3\xb4noong,      Peeb\xc3\xb4ng.\r\n\r\n              I spent last winter in hunting.\r\n              Ning`i nunda-wainjigai peeb\xc3\xb4noong.\r\n              I shall go to Detroit next spring.\r\n              Ninjah izh\xc3\xa2 W\xc3\xa2wi\xc3\xa2\xc2\xb4tunong seegwung.\r\n\r\n5. Sexual nouns. The mode of indicating the masculine and feminine,\r\nhaving been omitted in the preceding lecture, as not being essential to\r\nany concordance with the verb or adjective, is nevertheless connected\r\nwith a striking peculiarity of the language\xe2\x80\x94the exclusive use of\r\ncertain words by one or the other sex. After having appeared to the\r\nfounders of the language, a distinction not necessary to be engrafted\r\nin the syntax, there are yet a limited number of words, to which the\r\nidea of sex, so strongly attaches, that it would be deemed the height\r\nof impropriety in a female to use the masculine, and in male to use the\r\nfeminine expressions.\r\n\r\nOf this nature are the words _Neeji_, and _Nindongwai_, both signifying\r\nmy friend, but the former is appropriated to males, and the latter\r\nto females. A Chippewa cannot therefore say to a female my friend,\r\nnor a Chippewa woman to a male, my friend. Such an interchange of\r\nthe terms would imply arrogance or indelicacy. Nearly the whole of\r\ntheir interjections\xe2\x80\x94and they are numerous\xe2\x80\x94are also thus exclusively\r\nappropriated; and no greater breach of propriety in speech could\r\nbe committed, than a woman\xe2\x80\x99s uttering the masculine exclamation of\r\nsurprise _Ty\xc3\xa2!_ or a man\xe2\x80\x99s descending to the corresponding female\r\ninterjection _N\xe2\x80\x99y\xc3\xa2!_\r\n\r\nThe word _neenimoshai_, my cousin, on the contrary, can only be\r\napplied, like husband and wife, by a male to a female, or a female to a\r\nmale. If a male wishes to express this relation of a male, the term is\r\n_Neetowis_: and the corresponding female term _Neendongwooshai_.\r\n\r\nThe terms for uncle and aunt, are also of a two-fold character, though\r\nnot restricted like the preceding in their use. Neemishomai is my\r\nuncle by the father\xe2\x80\x99s side: Neezhishai, my uncle by the mother\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\nNeezigwoos is my paternal aunt, neewishai my maternal aunt.\r\n\r\nThere are also exclusive words to designate elder brother, and younger\r\nbrother: But what would not be expected after the foregoing examples,\r\nthey are indiscriminately applied to younger brothers and sisters.\r\nNeesgai, is my elder brother, and neemissai my elder sister. Neeshemai,\r\nmy younger brother, or younger sister, and may be applied to any\r\nbrother or sister except the eldest.\r\n\r\nThe number of words to which the idea of sex is attached, in the usual\r\nacceptation, is limited. The following may be enumerated.\r\n\r\n          _Masculine._                       _Feminine._\r\n  Irin\xc2\xb4i,        A man.           Ekwai\xc2\xb4,          A woman.\r\n  Kwee\xc2\xb4wizais,   A boy.           Ekwa\xc2\xb4zais,       A girl.\r\n  Oskinahwai,    A young man.     Oskineegakwai,   A young woman.\r\n  Akiwaizi,      An old man.      Mindim\xc3\xb4\xc2\xb4ed,      An old woman.\r\n  N\xc3\xb4sai,         My father.       Nin Gah,         My mother.\r\n  Ningwisis,     My son.          Nin d\xc3\xa2nis,       My daughter.\r\n  Ni ningwun,    My son-in-law.   Nis sim,         My daughter-in-law.\r\n  Ni n\xc3\xa2baim,     My husband.      Nimindim\xc3\xb4imish,  My wife.\r\n  Nimieshomiss,  My grandfather.  N\xc3\xb4k\xc3\xb4miss,        My grandmother.\r\n  Ogim\xc3\xa2,         A chief.         Ogem\xc3\xa2kw\xc3\xa2,        A chiefess.\r\n  Addik,         A reindeer.      Neetsh\xc3\xa2ni,       A doe.\r\n  Annimoosh,     A dog.           Kiskissh\xc3\xa2i,      A bitch.\r\n\r\nThe sex of the brute creation is most commonly denoted by prefixing the\r\nwords _I\xc3\xa2bai_, male; and _n\xc3\xb4zhai_, female.\r\n\r\n6. Reciprocal changes of the noun. The pronominal particles with which\r\nverbs as well as substantives, are generally encumbered and the habit\r\nof using them in particular and restricted senses, leaves but little\r\noccasion for the employment of either the present or past infinitive.\r\nMost verbs are transitives. A Chippewa does not say, I love, without\r\nindicating, by an inflection of the verb, the object beloved; and thus\r\nthe expression is constantly, I love him, or her, &c. Neither does the\r\ninfinitive appear to be generally the ultimate form of the verb.\r\n\r\nIn changing their nouns into verbs, it will not therefore be expected,\r\nthat the change should uniformly result in the infinitive, for which\r\nthere is so little use; but in such of the personal forms of the\r\nvarious moods as circumstances may require. Most commonly the third\r\nperson singular of the indicative, and the second person singular of\r\nthe imperative, are the simplest aspects under which the verb appears;\r\nand hence these forms have been sometimes mistaken for, and reported\r\nas the present infinitive. There are some instances, in which the\r\ninfinitive is employed. Thus, although an Indian cannot say, I love,\r\nthou lovest, &c. without employing the objective forms of the verb\r\nto love: yet he can say I laugh, I cry, &c. expressions in which the\r\naction being confined to the speaker himself, there is no transition\r\ndemanded. And in all similar instances the present infinitive, with the\r\nproper pronoun prefixed, is employed.\r\n\r\nThere are several modes of transforming a substantive into a verb. The\r\nfollowing examples will supply the rules, so far as known, which govern\r\nthese changes.\r\n\r\n                             Indicative.             Imperative.\r\n  Chim\xc3\xa2n, a canoe.        Chimai, he paddles.      Chimain, paddle thou.\r\n  Pashkizzigun, a gun.    Pashkizzigai, he fires.  Pashkizzigain, fire thou.\r\n  Jeesidyigun, a broom.   Jeesidyigai, he sweeps.  Jeesidyigain, sweep thou.\r\n  Weedjeeagun, a helper.  Weed\xc3\xb4kagai, he helps.    Weedjeei-wain, help thou.\r\n  Ojibw\xc3\xa2i, a Chippewa.    Ojibw\xc3\xa2moo, he    }       Ojibw\xc3\xa2moon, speak }\r\n                          speaks Chippewa. }          thou Chippewa. }\r\n\r\nAnother class of nouns is converted into the first person, indicative\r\nof a pseudo declarative verb, in the following manner.\r\n\r\n  Monido,    A spirit.         Ne Monid\xc3\xb4w,     I (am) a spirit.\r\n  Wassai\xc3\xa2,   Light.            Ne Wassai\xc3\xa2w,    I (am) light.\r\n  Ishkodai,  Fire.             Nin Dishkodaiw, I (am) fire.\r\n  Weendig\xc3\xb4,  A monster.        Ni Weendig\xc3\xb4w,   I (am) a monster.\r\n  Addik,     A deer.           Nin Daddikoow,  I (am) a deer.\r\n  Wakyigun,  A house.          Ni Wakyiguniw,  I (am) a house.\r\n  Pinggwi,   Dust, ashes.      Nim Pinggwiw,   I (am) dust, &c.\r\n\r\nThe word am, included in parentheses, is not in the original, unless we\r\nmay suppose the terminals, ow, aw, iw, oow, to be derivatives from Iaw.\r\nThese changes are reciprocated by the verb, which, as often as occasion\r\nrequires, is made to put on a substantive form. The particle _win_\r\nadded to the indicative of the verb, converts it into a substantive.\r\nThus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  Keegido,         He speaks.       Keegidowin,         Speech.\r\n  P\xc3\xa2shkizzigai,    He fires.        Pashkizzigaiwin,    Ammunition.\r\n  Agindasoo,       He counts.       Agindasoowin,       Numbers.\r\n  Wahyi\xc3\xa2zhinggai,  He cheats.       Wahyiazhinggaiwin,  Fraud.\r\n  Minnikw\xc3\xa2i,       He drinks.       Minnikw\xc3\xa2iwin,       Drink.\r\n  Kubb\xc3\xa2shi,        He encamps.      Kubb\xc3\xa2ishiwin,       An encampment.\r\n  Meeg\xc3\xa2zoo,        He fights.       Meeg\xc3\xa2zoowin,        A fight.\r\n  Ojeengai,        He kisses.       Ojeendiwin,         A kiss.\r\n  Ann\xc3\xb4ki,          He works.        Ann\xc3\xb4kiwin,          Work.\r\n  P\xc3\xa2pi,            He laughs.       P\xc3\xa2piwin,            Laughter.\r\n  Pim\xc3\xa2dizzi,       He lives.        Pim\xc3\xa2dizziwin,       Life.\r\n  Onw\xc3\xa2ibi,         He rests.        Onw\xc3\xa2ibiwin,         Rest.\r\n  Annami\xc3\xa2,         He prays.        Annami\xc3\xa2win,         Prayer.\r\n  Nib\xc3\xa2,            He sleeps.       Nib\xc3\xa2win,            Sleep.\r\n  Od\xc3\xa2wai,          He trades.       Od\xc3\xa2waiwin,          Trade.\r\n\r\nAdjectives are likewise thus turned into substantives.\r\n\r\n  Keezhaiw\xc3\xa2dizzi,   He generous.       Keezhaiw\xc3\xa2dizziwin,   Generosity.\r\n  Minwaindum,       He happy.          Minwaindumowin,      Happiness.\r\n  Keezhaize\xc3\xa2wizzi,  He industrious.    Keezhaizh\xc3\xa2wizziwin,  Industry.\r\n  Kittim\xc3\xa2gizzi,     He poor.           Kittim\xc3\xa2gizziwin,     Poverty.\r\n  Aukkoossi,        He sick.           Aukkoossiwin,        Sickness.\r\n  Kittimishki,      He lazy.           Kittimishkiwin,      Laziness.\r\n  Nishk\xc3\xa2dizzi,      He angry.          Nishk\xc3\xa2dizziwin,      Anger.\r\n  Baik\xc3\xa2dizzi,       She chaste.        Baik\xc3\xa2dizziwin,       Chastity.\r\n\r\nIn order to place the substantives thus formed, in the third person,\r\ncorresponding with the indicative from which they were changed, it is\r\nnecessary only to prefix the proper pronoun. Thus, Ogeezhaiw\xc3\xa2dizziwin,\r\nhis generosity, &c.\r\n\r\n7. Compound substantives. The preceding examples have been given\r\npromiscuously from the various classes of words, primitive and\r\nderivative, simple and compound. Some of these words express but\r\na single idea, as, \xc3\xb4s, father\xe2\x80\x94gah, mother\xe2\x80\x94m\xc3\xb4z, a moose\xe2\x80\x94k\xc3\xa2g, a\r\nporcupine\xe2\x80\x94mang, a loon\xe2\x80\x94and appear to be incapable of further division.\r\nAll such words may be considered as primitives, although some of them\r\nmay be contractions of dissyllabic words. There are also a number of\r\ndissyllables, and _possibly_ some trisyllables, which, in the present\r\nstate of our analytical knowledge of the language, may be deemed both\r\nsimple and primitive. Such are neebi, water; ossin, a stone; geezis,\r\nthe sun; nodin, wind. But it may be premised, as a principle which our\r\ninvestigations have rendered probable, that all polysyllabic words, all\r\nwords of three syllables, _so far as examined_, and most words of two\r\nsyllables, are compounds.\r\n\r\nThe application of a syntax, formed with a view to facilitate the\r\nrapid conveyance of ideas by consolidation, may, it is presumable, have\r\nearly led to the coalescence of words, by which all the relations of\r\nobject and action, time and person, were expressed. And in a language\r\nwhich is only spoken, and not written, the primitives would soon become\r\nobscured and lost in the multiform appendages of time and person,\r\nand the recondite connexion of actor and object. And this process of\r\namalgamation would be a progressive one. The terms that sufficed in\r\nthe condition of the simplest state of nature, or in a given latitude,\r\nwould vary with their varying habits, institutions and migrations. The\r\nintroduction of new objects and new ideas would require the invention\r\nof new words, or what is much more probable, existing terms would be\r\nmodified or compounded to suit the occasion. No one who has paid much\r\nattention to the subject, can have escaped noticing a confirmation\r\nof this opinion, in the extreme readiness of our western Indians to\r\nbestow, on the instant, names, and appropriate names\xe2\x80\x94to any new object\r\npresented to them. A readiness not attributable to their having at\r\ncommand a stock of generic polysyllables\xe2\x80\x94for these it would be very\r\nawkward to wield\xe2\x80\x94but as appears more probable, to the powers of the\r\nsyntax, which permits the resolution of new compounds from existing\r\nroots, and often concentrates, as remarked in another place, the entire\r\nsense of the parent words, upon a single syllable, and sometimes upon a\r\nsingle letter.\r\n\r\nThus it is evident that the Chippewas possessed names for a living\r\ntree _mittig_, and a string _ai\xc3\xa2b_, before they named the bow\r\n_mittigw\xc3\xa2b_,\xe2\x80\x94the latter being compounded under one of the simplest\r\nrules from the two former. It is further manifest that they had named\r\nearth _akki_, and (any solid, stony or metallic mass) _\xc3\xa2bik_, before\r\nthey bestowed an appellation upon the kettle, _akkeek_, or _akkik_,\r\nthe latter being derivatives from the former. In process of time these\r\ncompounds became the bases of other compounds, and thus the language\r\nbecame loaded with double and triple, and quadruple compounds, concrete\r\nin their meaning and formal in their utterance.\r\n\r\nWhen the introduction of the metals took place, it became necessary to\r\ndistinguish the clay from the iron pot, and the iron, from the copper\r\nkettle. The original compound, _akkeek_, retained its first meaning,\r\nadmitting the adjective noun _piw\xc3\xa2bik_ (itself a compound) iron,\r\nwhen applied to a vessel of that kind, piw\xc3\xa2bik akkeek, iron kettle.\r\nBut a new combination took place to designate the copper kettle,\r\n_miskw\xc3\xa2keek_, red-metal kettle; and another expression to denote the\r\nbrass kettle, _ozaw\xc3\xa2bik akkeek_, yellow metal kettle. The former is\r\nmade up from misk\xc3\xb4w\xc3\xa2bik, copper (literally _red-metal_\xe2\x80\x94from miskw\xc3\xa2,\r\nred, and _\xc3\xa2bik_, the generic above mentioned) and _akkeek_, kettle.\r\nOzaw\xc3\xa2bik, brass, is from _ozaw\xc3\xa2_ yellow, and the generic _\xc3\xa2bek_\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nterm akkeek, being added in its separate form. It may, however, be\r\nused in its connected form of wukkeek, making the compound expression\r\n_ozaw\xc3\xa2bik wukkeek_.\r\n\r\nIn naming the horse paib\xc3\xa2izhik\xc3\xb4gazhi, i. e. the animal with solid\r\nhoofs, they have seized upon the feature which most strikingly\r\ndistinguished the horse, from the cleft-footed animals which were\r\nthe only species known to them at the period of the discovery. And\r\nthe word itself affords an example, at once, both of their powers\r\nof concentration, and brief, yet accurate description, which it may\r\nbe worth while to analyse. Paizhik, is one, and is also used as the\r\nindefinite article\xe2\x80\x94the only article the language possesses. This word\r\nis further used in an adjective sense, figuratively indicating, united,\r\nsolid, undivided. And it acquires a plural signification by doubling,\r\nor repeating the first syllable, with a slight variation of the second.\r\nThus, Pai-baizhik, denotes not _one_, or _an_, but several; and when\r\nthus used in the context, renders the noun governed, plural. Oskuzh, is\r\nthe nail, claw, or horny part of the foot of beasts, and supplies the\r\nfirst substantive member of the compound _gauzh_. The final vowel is\r\nfrom _akwaisi_, a beast; and the marked o, an inseparable connective,\r\nthe office of which is to make the two members coalesce, and harmonize.\r\nThe expression thus formed becomes a substantive, specific in its\r\napplication. It may be rendered plural like the primitive nouns, may be\r\nconverted into a verb, has its diminutive, derogative and local form,\r\nand in short, is subject to all the modifications of other substantives.\r\n\r\nMost of the modern nouns are of this complex character. And they\r\nappear to have been invented to designate objects, many of which were\r\nnecessarily unknown to the Indians in the primitive ages of their\r\nexistence. Others, like their names for a copper-kettle and a horse,\r\nabove mentioned, can date their origin no farther back than the period\r\nof the discovery. Of this number of nascent words, are most of their\r\nnames for those distilled or artificial liquors, for which they are\r\nindebted to Europeans. Their name for water, _neebi_, for the fat of\r\nanimals, _weenin_, for oil or grease, _pimmidai_, for broth, _n\xc3\xa2b\xc3\xb4b_,\r\nand for blood, _miskwi_, belong to a very remote era, although all but\r\nthe first appear to be compounds. Their names for the tinctures or\r\nextracts derived from the forest, and used as dyes, or medicines, or\r\nmerely as agreeable drinks, are mostly founded upon the basis of the\r\nword _\xc3\xa2bo_, a liquid, although this word is never used alone. Thus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  Shomin-\xc3\xa2bo      Wine        From Shomin, a grape, \xc3\xa2bo, a liquor.\r\n  Ishkodai-\xc3\xa2bo    Spirits     From Ishk\xc3\xb4d\xc3\xa2i, fire, &c.\r\n  Mishimin-\xc3\xa2bo    Cider       From Mishimin, an apple, &c.\r\n  T\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xb4sh-\xc3\xa2bo      Milk        From T\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xb4sh, the female breast, &c.\r\n  Sheew-\xc3\xa2bo       Vinegar     From Sheewun, sour, &c.\r\n  Annibeesh-\xc3\xa2bo               From Annibeeshun, leaves, &c.\r\n  Ozhibiegun-aubo             From Ozhibi\xc3\xaagai, he writes, &c.\r\n\r\nIn like manner their names for the various implements and utensils\r\nof civilized life, are based upon the word _Jeegun_, one of those\r\nprimitives, which, although never disjunctively used, denotes, in its\r\nmodified forms, the various senses implied by our words instrument,\r\ncontrivance, machine, &c. And by prefixing to this generic, a\r\nsubstantive, verb, or adjective, or parts of one or each, an entire new\r\nclass of words is formed. In these combinations, the vowels e, and o,\r\nare sometimes used as connectives.\r\n\r\n  Keeshkeeb\xc3\xb4-jeegun   A saw              From Keeshkeezhun, v. a. to cut.\r\n  Seeseeb\xc3\xb4-jeegun     A file             From Seesee, to rub off, &c.\r\n  Wassakoonen-jeegun  A candle           From Wassakooda, bright, biskoona, flame, &c.\r\n  Beeseeb\xc3\xb4-jeegun     A coffee-mill      From Bees\xc3\xa2, fine grains, &c.\r\n  Minnikw\xc3\xa2d-jeegun    A drinking vessel  From Minnekw\xc3\xa2i, he drinks, &c.\r\n  T\xc3\xa2shkeeb\xc3\xb4d-jeegun   A saw mill         From Taushk\xc3\xa2, to split, &c.\r\n  Mudw\xc3\xa2iabeed-jeegun  A violin           From Mudw\xc3\xa2w\xc3\xa2i, sound, \xc3\xa2i\xc3\xa2b, a string, &c.\r\n\r\nSometimes this termination is shortened into _gun_, as in the following\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\n  On\xc3\xa2-gun           A dish.\r\n  Tikkina-gun       A cradle.\r\n  Neeba-gun         A bed.\r\n  Puddukkyi-gun     A fork.\r\n  Puggimm\xc3\xa2-gun      A war-club.\r\n  Opw\xc3\xa2-gun          A pipe.\r\n  Wass\xc3\xa2itshie-gun   A window.\r\n  Wakkyi-gun        A house.\r\n  P\xc3\xb4dahw\xc3\xa2-gun       A fire-place.\r\n  Sheema-gun        A lance.\r\n\r\nAnother class of derivatives is formed from _wy\xc3\xa2n_, indicating,\r\ngenerally, an undressed skin. Thus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  Muk-wy\xc3\xa2n      A bear skin     From Mukwah, a bear, and wyaun, a skin.\r\n  Wazhusk-wy\xc3\xa2n  A muskrat skin  From Wazhusk, a muskrat, &c.\r\n  Wab\xc3\xb4s-wy\xc3\xa2n    A rabbit skin   From Wab\xc3\xb4s, a rabbit, &c.\r\n  Neegik-wy\xc3\xa2n   An otter skin   From Neegih, an otter, &c.\r\n  Ojeegi-wy\xc3\xa2n   A fisher skin   From Ojeeg, a fisher, &c.\r\n  Wabizhais-ewy\xc3\xa2n, a martin skin, from wabizhais, a martin, &c.\r\n\r\nW\xc3\xa2biwyan, a blanket, and bubbuggiwyan, a shirt, are also formed\r\nfrom this root. As the termination _wy\xc3\xa2n_, is chiefly restricted to\r\nundressed skins, or peltries, that of _waigin_, is, in like manner,\r\ngenerally applied to dressed skins, or to cloths. Thus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  Monido-waigin  Blue cloth, strouds  From Monido, spirit, &c.\r\n  Misk-waigin    Red cloth            From Miskw\xc3\xa2, red, &c.\r\n  Nond\xc3\xa2-waigin       Scarlet.\r\n  Peezhiki-waigin    A buffalo robe    From Peezhiki, a buffalo, &c.\r\n  Addik-waigin       A cariboo skin    From Addik, a cariboo, &c.\r\n  Ozhauwushk-waigin  Green cloth       From Ozh\xc3\xa2wushkw\xc3\xa2, green.\r\n\r\nAn interesting class of substantives is derived from the third person\r\nsingular of the present indicative of the verb, by changing the\r\nvowel sound of the first syllable, and adding the letter d to that\r\nof the last, making the terminations in aid, \xc3\xa2d, eed, id, ood. Thus,\r\nPimmooss\xc3\xa2, he walks, becomes p\xc3\xa2mooss\xc3\xa2d, a walker.\r\n\r\n  aid\xe2\x80\x94 Munnissai        He chops       M\xc3\xa2nissaid         A chopper.\r\n        Ozhibeigai       He writes      W\xc3\xa2zhibeigaid      A writer.\r\n        Nundowainjeegai  He hunts       N\xc3\xa2ndowainjeegaid  A hunter.\r\n  \xc3\xa2d\xe2\x80\x94  Neeb\xc3\xa2            He sleeps      N\xc3\xa2b\xc3\xa2d             A sleeper.\r\n        Kw\xc3\xa2bahw\xc3\xa2         He fishes }    Kwy\xc3\xa2bahw\xc3\xa2d        A fisher,  }\r\n                  (with scoop net) }                (with scoop net.)}\r\n        Puggidow\xc3\xa2        He fishes }    P\xc3\xa2gidow\xc3\xa2d         A fisher,  }\r\n                        (with sein)}                     (with sein.)}\r\n  eed\xe2\x80\x94 Annokee          He works       Anokeed           A worker.\r\n        Jeessakea        He juggles     Jossakeed         A juggler.\r\n        Munnigobee       He pulls bark  Mainigobeed       A bark puller.\r\n  id\xe2\x80\x94  Neemi            He dances      N\xc3\xa2mid             A dancer.\r\n        Weesinni         He eats        W\xc3\xa2ssinid          An eater.\r\n        Pim\xc3\xa2dizzi        He lives       Paimaudizzid      A living being.\r\n  ood\xe2\x80\x94 Nugamoo          He sings       Naigumood         A singer.\r\n        Keegido          He speaks      K\xc3\xa2gidood          A speaker.\r\n        Keewonimoo       He lies        K\xc3\xa2wunimood        A liar.\r\n\r\nThis class of words is rendered plural in ig,\xe2\x80\x94a termination, which,\r\nafter d final in the singular, has a soft pronunciation, as if written\r\n_jig_. Thus, N\xc3\xa2mid, a dancer, n\xc3\xa2midjig, dancers.\r\n\r\nThe derogative form is given to these generic substantives by\r\nintroducing ish, or simply sh, in place of the d, and changing\r\nthe latter to _kid_, making the terminations in ai, aishkid, in\r\n\xc3\xa2, \xc3\xa2shkid, in e, eeshkid, in i, ishkid, and in oo, ooshkid. Thus,\r\nnaindowainjeegaid, a hunter, is changed to naindowainjeegaishkid, a bad\r\nor unprofitable hunter. Naib\xc3\xa2d, a sleeper, is changed to naib\xc3\xa2shkid, a\r\nsluggard. Jossakeed, a juggler, to jossakeeshkid, a vicious juggler.\r\nW\xc3\xa2sinnid, an eater, to w\xc3\xa2ssinishkid, a gormandizer. K\xc3\xa2gidood, a\r\nspeaker, k\xc3\xa2gidooshkid, a babbler. And in these cases the plural is\r\nadded to the last educed form, making k\xc3\xa2gidooshkidjig, babblers, &c.\r\n\r\nThe word nitt\xc3\xa2, on the contrary, prefixed to these expressions, renders\r\nthem complimentary. For instance, nitt\xc3\xa2 naigumood, is a fine singer,\r\nnitt\xc3\xa2 k\xc3\xa2gidood, a ready speaker, &c.\r\n\r\nFlexible as the substantive has been shown to be, there are other forms\r\nof combination that have not been adverted to\xe2\x80\x94forms, by which it is\r\nmade to coalesce with the verb, the adjective, and the preposition,\r\nproducing a numerous class of compound expressions. But it is deemed\r\nmost proper to defer the discussion of these forms to their several\r\nappropriate heads.\r\n\r\nEnough has been exhibited to demonstrate its prominent grammatical\r\nrules. It is not only apparent that the substantive possesses number,\r\nand gender, but it also undergoes peculiar modifications to express\r\nlocality and diminution, to denote adjective qualities and to indicate\r\ntense. It exhibits some curious traits connected with the mode of\r\ndenoting the masculine and feminine. It is modified to express person\r\nand to distinguish living from inanimate masses. It is rendered\r\npossessive by a peculiar inflection, and provides particles, under the\r\nshape either of prefixes or suffixes, separable or inseparable, by\r\nwhich the actor is distinguished from the object\xe2\x80\x94and all this, without\r\nchanging its proper substantive character, without putting on the\r\naspect of a pseudo adjective, or a pseudo verb. Its changes to produce\r\ncompounds, are, however, its most interesting, its most characteristic\r\ntrait. Syllable is heaped upon syllable, word upon word, and derivative\r\nupon derivative, until its vocabulary is crowded with long and pompous\r\nphrases, most formidable to the eye.\r\n\r\nSo completely transpositive do the words appear, that like chessmen\r\non a board, their elementary syllables can be changed at the will of\r\nthe player, to form new combinations to meet new contingencies, so long\r\nas they are changed in accordance with certain general principles and\r\nconventional rules; in the application of which, however, much depends\r\nupon the will or the skill of the player.

On reaching the Mississippi I found\r\nthe state of the water favorable for ascending. No difficulty was\r\nexperienced in reaching the highest point, to which this stream has\r\nhitherto been explored. At this point, I procured canoes of the\r\nsmallest class, and ascended, with Indian guides, to its actual source\r\nin Itasca Lake.\r\n\r\nUpwards of two thousand Chippewas have been met in council, in\r\ntheir villages, or in detached parties on the way. At every point,\r\nvaccinations have been made, under the authority of the act of the\r\nlast session of Congress. No opportunity has been omitted to enforce\r\nthe objects of the instructions respecting their hostilities with each\r\nother, and to point out and make clear to their comprehension, their\r\ntrue relation to the United States. The efforts made to procure the\r\nassent of the Chippewas to the advice given them on this head, were\r\nstated to the Sioux in a council to which I invited them at the Agency\r\nof St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of data respecting the trade and population, and the\r\ngeographical distribution of the bands, has been, with other details,\r\nresulting from my instructions, at all times, kept in view. I shall\r\ndevote the earliest attention I can spare from the accumulated duties\r\nof the office, in drawing up a detailed report.\r\n\r\n                                    I am, Sir,\r\n                                        very respectfully,\r\n                                            your ob. serv\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\n                                                HENRY R.

Marie, August 15, 1832_.}\r\n\r\n  His Excellency GEORGE B. PORTER,\r\n    Governor of the Territory of Michigan,\r\n      and Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Detroit.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to inform you that I returned from my visit to\r\nthe Chippewa bands on the Upper Mississippi, yesterday evening. The\r\nstate of feeling among them, partakes of the excitement growing out of\r\na knowledge of the disturbances existing near their southern boundary.\r\nBut their friendly position with respect to the United States,\r\nis not altered by events, thus far. Such of them as had received\r\ninvitations to join in the Sauc league, have refused their assent.\r\nAnd notwithstanding the complacency with which some of the bands\r\nregard the hostile efforts of a people, with whom they are connected\r\nby the ties of language, and the decided preference others feel, and\r\nhave expressed, for the counsels and government of Great Britain,\r\nas exercised in the Canadas, I feel a confidence in pronouncing the\r\nnation, as a whole, uncommitted in any negotiations with the hostile\r\nIndians, and satisfied to remain in their present pacific attitude.\r\nSeveral of their most influential chiefs are quite decided in this\r\npolicy, and would view it as foolish and desperate in the extreme, to\r\nentertain propositions to give aid to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe only portion of them, of whom there were reasons to apprehend\r\nhostilities, are the villages of Torch Lake, comprising the Chippewa\r\npopulation on the heads of the Wisconsin, Ontonagon, and Chippewa\r\nrivers. These bands murdered four of our citizens at Lake Pepin, in\r\nthe spring of 1824. Several of the persons implicated were imprisoned\r\nat Mackinac, whence they escaped. And it has not been practicable to\r\ncarry into effect the measures of punishment, which were determined\r\non. Their position, on the head waters of remote streams, is an almost\r\ninaccessible one, and the offence has ceased to be the subject of any\r\nfurther efforts by the Department. They have never, however, been\r\nrelieved from the fears entertained on this account, and these fears\r\nhave confined them very much to their particular villages and hunting\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nA war message was transmitted to the Torch Lake (or du Flambeau)\r\nIndians by the Black Hawk, or his counsellors, in 1830. This message\r\nwas repeated in 1831, and again in 1832. They were reminded by it,\r\nof their affinity by blood, their ancient alliance, and their being\r\narrayed as common enemies of the Sioux. It was addressed to the\r\nwhole Chippewa nation, and they were invited to take up arms. It is\r\nnot known that this message has been accepted. The recent death of\r\nMozobodo, their first chief, and a man of understanding, has diminished\r\nmy confidence in his band. It has been stated to me, very lately,\r\nby neighboring chiefs, that the Lac du Flambeau Indians were not in\r\nalliance with the malcontent tribes. That section of country has not\r\nbeen within the track of my recent journey. I have seen and conversed\r\nwith some of the Indians, including one of the minor chiefs. Little, or\r\nno definite information has, however, been obtained.\r\n\r\nI feel convinced that should the Black Hawk pursue his flight thither,\r\nhe would, from obvious circumstances, be received with, at least,\r\nnegative friendship. He would be allowed to recruit his followers and\r\nsuccor himself upon their hunting grounds towards the Mississippi\r\nborders, where there is a comparative abundance of deer and elk. And it\r\nis not improbable that some of the young men would follow his fortunes.\r\nI think, however, the policy of Black Hawk has been to bend his course\r\nwestward after passing the Wisconsin, with the view of crossing the\r\nMississippi, at some point where this stream is wide and shallow, (say\r\nbetween the Painted Rock and Lake Pepin,) and withdrawing to the plains\r\nof the Des Moines, where he has resources.\r\n\r\nI have found the Chippewas, generally, not inclined to be communicative\r\non the subject of the disturbances. But in cases where information\r\nhas been obtained, it evinces a full knowledge of passing events.\r\nKabamappa, a decidedly friendly and respectable chief of the St. Croix,\r\ninformed me that the league consisted originally of nine tribes. I\r\nrequested him to name them. He commenced by mentioning Saucs, Foxes,\r\nand Iowas, and added cautiously, and with a pause that allowed\r\nhim to double down a finger at each count, Kickapoos, Flatheads,\r\nEarthlodges,[27] Pottawattomies, Winnebagoes, and after some inquiry of\r\nthe interpreter, Osages. Another Indian met on Lake Superior, said that\r\nthe hostile Indians claimed to have killed 200 persons, since the war\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nEvidence has been furnished to me, that the Saucs who appear to be\r\nthe principals, have taken much pains to form a league against the\r\ngovernment,\xe2\x80\x94that several tribes have assented to it, who have not\r\nboldly joined his standard, and that information favorable to their\r\nsuccess, has been rapidly spread by them, among the northern Indians.\r\nThis information they are prone to credit. Even the Sioux, whom I met\r\nin council at St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s, on the 25th of July, have been accused of\r\nbeing lukewarm in the contest, and rather favoring, than opposed to\r\ntheir active enemies. This, the Petite Corbeau, their venerable chief,\r\npointedly denied. He said the insinuation was untrue\xe2\x80\x94that the Sioux,\r\nwho went to the theatre of the war, had not returned from friendly\r\nfeelings to the Saucs; and that they stood ready to go again, if\r\nofficially called on.\r\n\r\nThe British band of Chippewas near this place were formally invited to\r\nunite in the war. A painted war club and pipe accompanied the message.\r\nIt was transmitted by the Saucs, and given, by one of their emissaries\r\nto one of the northern Chippewas at Penetanguishine. It was received\r\nhere (St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s) by the Little Pine, (alias Lavoire Bart) a chief\r\nwho co-operated with Tecumseh, in the late war, by leading a party\r\nof warriors from this quarter. He determined not to accept it, and\r\ncommunicated the fact to me in January last. He said the message was\r\nvery equivocal. It invited him to aid them in fighting their enemies.\r\nHe said he did not know whether the Sioux or Americans were intended.\r\n\r\nVisits from the Indians within our lines to the British posts in Upper\r\nCanada, continue to be made. The Ottawas of L\xe2\x80\x99arbre Croche, and the\r\nBritish band of the Chippewas of Lapointe, Lake Superior, have made\r\ntheir usual journey to Penetanguishine, during the present season. More\r\nthan the ordinary numbers from this vicinity, have joined them.\r\n\r\n                                  I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                                      very respectfully,\r\n                                          your ob\xe2\x80\x99t servant,\r\n                                              HENRY R.

Marie, November 21, 1832_. }\r\n\r\nSIR:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to such parts of the instructions of the third of May\r\nlast directing me to proceed to the country on the heads of the\r\nMississippi, as relates to the Indian population, and to the condition\r\nof the fur trade, I have the honor herewith to enclose a series of\r\nstatistical tables which exhibit the geographical distribution of the\r\nlands, the name of each village or permanent encampment, its course\r\nand distance from the seat of the agency, the number of men, women and\r\nchildren, expressed in separate columns, the number of the mixed blood\r\npopulation, and the total population of districts. Also, the names and\r\nposition of the trading posts established under the act of Congress of\r\nMay 26th, 1824, the number and names of the clerks, and the number of\r\ninterpreters and boatmen employed in the trade under licences from the\r\nIndian office, the amount of goods bonded for, agreeably to duplicates\r\nof the invoices on file, together with an estimate of the capital\r\nvested in boats and provisions, or paid out in men\xe2\x80\x99s wages, and an\r\nestimate of the returns in furs and peltries, based on the outfits of\r\n1832.\r\n\r\nAn examination of these tables will shew, that the entire Indian,\r\nmixed and trader population, embraced within the consolidated agency of\r\nSt. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s and Michilimackinac, is 14,279, of which number 12,467 are\r\nChippewas and Ottawas, 1553 persons of the mixed blood, and 259 persons\r\nof every description engaged in the fur trade. That this population is\r\ndistributed in 89 principal villages, or fixed encampments, extending\r\nby the route of Lakes Huron and Superior, through the region of the\r\nUpper Mississippi, to Pembina on Red River. That 302 of the whole\r\nnumber live in temporary encampments, or rather, migrate, along the\r\nbleak shores of Lake Huron west of the 2nd, or Boundary Line Detour;\r\n436 occupy the American side of the straits and river St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s; 1006\r\nare located on the southern shores of Lake Superior between the Sault\r\nof St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s and Fond du Lac; 1855 on the extreme Upper Mississippi,\r\nbetween Little Soc River, and the actual source of this stream in\r\nItasca Lake; 476 on the American side of the Old Grand Portage, to\r\nthe Lake of the Woods; 1174 on Red River of the North; 895 on the\r\nRiver St. Croix of the Mississippi; 1376 on the Chippewa River and its\r\ntributaries, including the villages of Lac du Flambeau and Ottawa Lake;\r\n342 on the heads of the Wisconsin and Monominee rivers; 210 on the\r\nnorthern curve of Green Bay; 274 on the north-western shores of Lake\r\nMichigan between the entrance of Green Bay, and the termination of the\r\nstraits of Michilimackinac, at Point St. Ignace; and 5,674, within the\r\npeninsula of Michigan, so far as the same is embraced within the limits\r\nof the Agency. The latter number covers an estimate of the Ottawa and\r\nChippewa population indiscriminately.\r\n\r\nFor the accommodation of these bands, there have been established\r\nthirty-five principal trading posts, exclusive of temporary trading\r\nstations, occupied only in seasons of scarcity. These posts are\r\ndistributed over six degrees of latitude, and sixteen degrees of\r\nlongitude, and embrace a larger area of square miles, than all the\r\nstates of central Europe. Much of it is covered with water, and such\r\nare the number and continuity of its lakes, large and small, that it\r\nis probable that this feature, constitutes by far, its most striking\r\npeculiarity. Its productions are fish, wild rice, and game. But such\r\nare the precariousness and dispersion of the supply as to keep the\r\nwhole population of men, women, and children, in perpetual vacillation,\r\nin its search. The time devoted in these migrations, is out of all\r\nproportion, to the results obtained by agriculture, or by any other\r\nstated mode of subsistence. And the supply is after all, inadequate.\r\nSeasons of scarcity and want are the ordinary occurrences of every\r\nyear; and a mere subsistence is the best state of things that is looked\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nTraders visit them annually with outfits of goods and provisions, to\r\npurchase the furs and peltries, which are gleaned in their periodical\r\nmigrations. These persons purchase their outfits from capitalists\r\nresident on the frontiers, and make their payments during the spring or\r\nsummer succeeding the purchase. They employ men who are acquainted with\r\nthe difficulties of the route, and with the character and resources of\r\nthe people amongst whom they are to reside. These men act as boatmen\r\nand canoe-men on the outward and inward voyage; they erect the wintering\r\nhouses, chop wood, fish, cook for the _bourgois_, and are employed on\r\n_durwin_, or as runners during the hunting season. Much of the success\r\nof a trading adventure depends on their efficiency and faithfulness.\r\n\r\nIn the prosecution of this trade, the laws which have been prescribed\r\nby Congress for its regulation, are substantially observed. I am of\r\nopinion, however, that more efficiency would be given to the system,\r\nif a general revision of all the acts pertaining to this subject, were\r\nmade. A legislation of thirty years, some of it necessarily of a hasty\r\ncharacter, has multiplied the acts, which it is made the duty of Indian\r\nAgents to enforce, and the number of clauses which are repealed and\r\nmodified, leave the original acts mutilated, and they do not, present\r\nas a whole, that clearness of intent, which is essential to their due\r\nand prompt execution. Some of the provisions have become obsolete;\r\nothers are defective. A thorough and careful digest of the entire\r\ncode, including the permanent treaty provisions, would present the\r\nopportunity for consolidation and amendment, and while leaving the laws\r\neasier of execution, adapt them more exactly to the present condition\r\nof the Indians, and to a just supervision of the trade.\r\n\r\nThe unconditional repeal by Congress, of every former provision\r\nrelating to the introduction of ardent spirits, is a subject of\r\nfelicitation to the friends of humanity. Of all the acts which it\r\nwas in the power of the government to perform, this promises, in\r\nmy opinion, to produce the most beneficial effects on the moral\r\ncondition of the north-western tribes: And its enforcement is an\r\nobject of the highest moral achievement. My recent visit, as well\r\nas former opportunities of remark, has afforded full proofs of the\r\nentire uselessness of ardent spirits as an article of traffic with the\r\nIndians, and I beg leave to add my voice, to the thousands which are\r\naudible on this subject, that the government may put into requisition\r\nevery practicable means to carry into effect the act.\r\n\r\n                              I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                                  very respectfully,\r\n                                      your obedient servant,\r\n                                             HENRY R.

They come into contact with the Winnebagoes\r\nand Monomonees, who are their neighbors on the south.\r\n\r\n(_V_) The Indian population of the peninsula of Michigan, consists of\r\nOttawas, Chippewas and Pottawattomies, who are not widely separated by\r\nlanguage and habits. The Ottawas are however the most agricultural. No\r\nPottawattomies are included in the estimate, and only that portion of\r\nOttawas and Chippewas living north of Grand River, and northwest of\r\nSagana, as the limits of the Mackinac and St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s joint agency, do\r\nnot extend south of these places.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x98\x9e The data respecting the fur trade, in the schedules, excludes the\r\nbusiness transacted on the Island of Michilimackinac, and the village\r\nSault Ste.

Marie, December 3, 1832_.}\r\n\r\n  ELBERT HERRING, ESQ.,\r\n      Office of Indian Affairs, Washington.\r\n\r\nSIR:\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Indians, situated in the area of country traversed\r\nby the St. Croix and Chippewa Rivers, has not essentially varied\r\nsince the date of the report, which I had the honor to address to the\r\nDepartment, on the 22nd of September, 1831.[28] I beg leave now to\r\nsolicit your attention to the observations made during my recent visit\r\nto the bands living northwest of that point in our geography.\r\n\r\nFrom a very early period, war has existed between the Chippewas and\r\nSioux, and although the condition of independent bands, separated by\r\nlocal position and local interests, has produced internal discord among\r\nthemselves, they have united as nations, in defending their respective\r\nfrontiers, and have not hesitated to make inroads, into the hunting\r\ngrounds of each other, whenever circumstances have favored them.\r\n\r\nThe Chippewas assert, that their warfare has been one of self defence,\r\nand that their inroads have been the inevitable consequence of the\r\ndetermination to maintain their territorial rights. The Sioux complain\r\nthat their hunting grounds have been intruded on, and that they cannot\r\nrestrain their warriors. Each party lays claim to forbearance and\r\ngenerosity. Neither appears to omit any opportunity of inflicting\r\ninjury on the other. Every blow is a fresh invitation to aggression. A\r\nstate of perpetual insecurity and alarm is the consequence. Time has\r\nexasperated their feelings. And much of the severity of their present\r\ncondition, is directly owing to the pertinacity with which the contest\r\nhas been kept up.\r\n\r\nIn this state, the Chippewas, who are particularly the object of this\r\nreport, were found by our government in 1806, who had, the year before,\r\ndirected the late General Pike, to visit the Upper Mississippi. Owing\r\nto their remote position, little attention was, however, bestowed\r\nupon them till the summer of 1820, when the present Secretary of\r\nWar, who then administered the government of Michigan, conducted an\r\nexpedition through the country. By his recommendation a military post\r\nand agency were established on the avenue of their trade, at the foot\r\nof Lake Superior, and the usual means adopted to regulate the trade\r\nand intercourse of our citizens with them. They were counselled to\r\nremain at peace, to intermit their visits to the Canadian posts, and to\r\npursue their usual occupations on their own lands. It was immediately\r\nfound, however, that the force of their hostilities fell upon their\r\nwestern frontiers, where they border on the Sioux, and where the\r\ndispute respecting territorial boundaries gave scope to continual and\r\nafflicting aggressions.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 the Chippewas were invited to meet the other tribes in a\r\ngeneral council at Prairie du Chien, which, after a full discussion,\r\nresulted in a treaty of territorial limits. This treaty was fully\r\nassented to, by the northern Chippewas convened at the treaty of\r\nFond du Lac in 1826. The following year, deputations of this nation\r\nattended, and became one of the parties at the treaty of Bude des\r\nMorts. At this treaty the subject of boundaries was finally carried and\r\nadjusted between themselves and the Monomonees and the Winnebagoes.\r\nWith the latter tribes there has been no subsequent controversy\r\nrespecting limits. But the delineation on paper of the extensive line\r\nbetween them and the Sioux, without an actual survey and marking of\r\nit, gave rise to further difficulties. What could not be plainly seen,\r\nmight be easily disputed, and the pretext was thus given for renewed\r\naggressions. Several instances of this have constituted the subject of\r\nspecific reports to the Department. The hardships of a people destitute\r\nof resources, were not only thus increased, but those of our citizens\r\nwho had been licensed to trade among them complained of losses and want\r\nof protection. Many of the Indians, and several of the traders fell,\r\neither in actual conflict, or the consequences deducible from them.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1830, I was directed by the Department personally\r\nto visit the Indians, to endeavour to restore peace. The instructions\r\nwere not, however, received until late in the year, and it was not\r\npracticable to carry them into effect until the following year. It\r\nwas employed in visiting the bands situated intermediate between Lake\r\nSuperior and the Mississippi, being south of St. Anthony falls. It was\r\nfound impracticable to visit the more northern bands. Instructions were\r\nhowever received for this purpose in the spring of 1832. I immediately\r\norganized an expedition, and employed the summer season in visiting\r\nthe remotest bands on the Upper Mississippi, and I will now proceed to\r\ndetail such of its results, not heretofore communicated, as pertain to\r\nthe present condition of the Indians.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that during the previous visit, general councils\r\nwere held with the Chippewas at Chegoimegon on Lake Superior, and at\r\nYellow River, Lac Courtorielle, and Rice Lake, in the region of St.\r\nCroix and Chippewa Rivers: that the subject of the treaty of peace and\r\nlimits of 1825 was distinctly brought home to the chiefs, and their\r\npromise obtained to use their influence in keeping their warriors at\r\npeace: that messages were despatched by them to the principal Sioux\r\nchiefs, expressive of these sentiments, accompanied by messages from\r\nmyself: that a Chippewa war party was encountered, and its object\r\nfrustrated: and the subject of limits on the Red Cedar fork presenting\r\nitself as an obstacle to a firm peace on this border, was amicably\r\nreferred by them to the President, with a request, by them, that\r\nhe would use his influence to keep the Sioux at peace. From which\r\nauspicious results were anticipated.\r\n\r\nI had the satisfaction to find, in the progress of this year\xe2\x80\x99s visits,\r\nthat these measures had been productive of good effects; that the fall\r\nand winter of 1831 had passed, without any war party\xe2\x80\x99s going out of\r\nthe region of the Chippewa and St. Croix, and that a peace-council had\r\nbeen held by the Chippewas of the Folle Avoine, and the Sioux of the\r\nPetite Corbeau\xe2\x80\x99s band, which was also attended by the Upper Snake River\r\nIndians, and by deputations of the Mille Lac and Fond du Lac Chippewas,\r\nand that my counsels and admonitions had been extensively spread.\r\n\r\nOther facts disclosed on my passing through Lake Superior may be\r\nadverted to. On casually meeting a party of Indians and traders at\r\nthe Portail (June 11th), I heard of the existence of a feud at Lac\r\nCourtorielle, which had, during the previous winter, resulted in the\r\nmurder of a Canadian named Brunet at Long Lake, and the murder of an\r\nIndian boy by the son of Mozojeed, the chief of the band. That the\r\nmurderer had been apprehended by the Chippewas and traders, and brought\r\nout as far as the carrying-place on the head of the Mauvais River,\r\nwhere he had escaped.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the trading post at Kewena Bay (14th), I met Pezhicki,\r\nthe chief of La Pointe, with several men going out to visit me at the\r\nsault. There was also, at this place, the speaker Mizi, being on his\r\nway, with a considerable retinue, to Penetanguishine, the British post\r\non Lake Huron. I here learned the death of Mozobodo, the chief of Lac\r\ndu Flambeau, and that his brother the White Crow, a man of inferior\r\nmerit, had succeeded to the chieftainship, and was forming a war-party\r\nto descend the Chippewa River against the Sioux.\r\n\r\nI reached the Ontonegon on the 19th, and found at this place\r\nMushcoswun, or the Moose\xe2\x80\x99s Tail, an elder brother of the White Crow of\r\nLac du Flambeau, and Mozojeed, the chief of Lac Courtorielle, encamped\r\nwith their followers, being all on their way to visit me at the sault.\r\nNo further information was obtained of the state of affairs at Lac du\r\nFlambeau, except that a trader had clandestinely visited that post from\r\nthe Mississippi with whiskey. Being nearest the theatre of the Sauc\r\ndisturbances, I felt much anxiety to be particularly informed of the\r\nstate of feeling in this numerous, warlike, and hitherto disaffected\r\nband. This I was, however, left to infer from the studied silence, or\r\naffected ignorance of Mushcoswun.\r\n\r\nMozojeed gave me reason to be satisfied that the Chippewas of his\r\nquarter were quite friendly, and that no disposition was felt to\r\nsanction, far less to aid, the confederated Saucs and Foxes in their\r\nschemes. He regretted, he said, the murders which had taken place in\r\nhis vicinity, during the winter, which, he affirmed, arose wholly from\r\nprivate jealousies and bickerings. He said, he lamented the folly of\r\nthe young men of his village who had committed the murders. He could\r\nnot prevent it. He could not see through the distant forests, alluding\r\nto the difficulty of foreseeing and governing the acts of people at\r\na distance. He could not absolutely govern those in his own village;\r\nbut these murders were committed at Long Lake, and not at Ottowa Lake,\r\nwhere he lived.\r\n\r\nHe said that the murderer of Brunet had been apprehended, by the\r\njoint advice of himself and those who had grown old in wearing medals\r\n(meaning the elder chiefs). But he had escaped on the Mauvais portage.\r\nFrom that point the chief called Misco Monedo, or the Red Devil, and\r\nhis people had returned, saying that they would punish the fugitive.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the murder committed by his son, he said that he had\r\ncome out to give himself up for it, to be dealt with as might be\r\ndictated. He stood ready to answer for it. And he awaited my decision\r\nrespecting it, as well as the other murder. He concluded his address by\r\npresenting a pipe.\r\n\r\nSoon after passing Presque Isle river (20th), we met Mr. Warren,\r\na trader, and his brigade of boats, on his annual return from his\r\nwintering ground. He confirmed the reports heard from the Indians,\r\nand added, that a trader from the Mississippi had entered the St.\r\nCroix River, and introduced ardent spirits among the Chippewas of\r\nSnake River. Mushcoswun followed me, with others, to Chagoimegon,\r\nor Lapointe, became a sharer in the presents distributed there, and\r\nexpressed himself during the council in a speech of decidedly friendly\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the River Broule I encountered Ozawondib, or the Yellow\r\nHead, and Mainotagooz, or the Handsome Enunciator, two Chippewas from\r\nthe Cassinian source of the Mississippi, being on their way to visit me\r\nat the seat of the agency. They reported that the Indians of Leech Lake\r\nhad raised a war-party, and gone out against the Sioux of the Plains.\r\nBoth these Indians returned with me to Cass Lake. The former afterward\r\nguided me from that remote point to the source of this river.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Fond du Lac (23d), I found the Indians of that post\r\nassembled, preparatory to the departure of the traders of the Fond du\r\nLac department. Mr. Aitkin represented that the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay clerks had\r\nbeen well supplied with high-wines, during the season of trade, which\r\nwere freely used to induce our Indians to cross the boundary in quest\r\nof it, and that if the American government did not permit a limited\r\nquantity of this article to be taken by their traders, that part of\r\ntheir hunts would be carried to their opponents. His clerks from Rainy\r\nLake presented me a pipe and ornamented stem, accompanying a speech\r\nof general friendship from Aissibun, or the Racoon, and another, with\r\nsimilar testimonials, from the son of the late chief Ainakumigishkung,\r\nboth of the Rainy Lake band.\r\n\r\nMongazid, or the Loon\xe2\x80\x99s Foot, the second chief and speaker of the Fond\r\ndu Lac band, confirmed what I had previously heard, of a peace council\r\nhaving been held on the St. Croix, with the Petite Corbeau\xe2\x80\x99s band of\r\nSioux. He said that Kabamappa was at the head of the Chippewa party,\r\nand had been the prime mover in this pacific attempt. That he had\r\nhimself been present, with a deputation of eleven men of the Fond du\r\nLac band, including the elder chief Chingoop.\r\n\r\nDr. Borup, a clerk in the A. F. Company\xe2\x80\x99s service, added, in relation\r\nto affairs on the Rainy Lake border, that five chiefs have been\r\ninvested with medals and flags, by the _British traders_ of Rainy Lake.\r\nThat eighty kegs of high-wines were exhibited to the Indians at that\r\npost during the last season\xe2\x80\x94that it was freely sent over the American\r\nlines, even within _a few hours\xe2\x80\x99 march_ of Leech Lake\xe2\x80\x94having been sent\r\n_west_ of the portage into Turtle Lake.\r\n\r\nWe had now reached the head of Lake Superior. Our route thence to the\r\nMississippi was up the river St. Louis, and across the Savanne portage.\r\nWe reached the trading-house at the junction of Sandy Lake River with\r\nthe Mississippi during the afternoon of the 3d of July, and remained\r\nat that place until 6 o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening of the 4th. The Indians\r\nhave confirmed the reports of a war-party\xe2\x80\x99s having gone out from Leech\r\nLake. All accounts from that quarter indicated a state of extreme\r\nrestlessness on the part of that band, and also among the Yanktons\r\nand Sessitons. Inineewi, or the Manly Man, acted as the speaker at\r\nthe council which I held on the west banks of the river. He mingled,\r\nas is common, his private affairs with his public business. He said\r\nthat he was not possessed of the authority of chieftainship, but that\r\nhis father Kabigwakoosidjiga, had been a chief under the English\r\ngovernment; that Chingoop, the chief of Fond du Lac, was his uncle,\r\nand Chamees, our guide, his nephew. He said that the Grosse Guelle,\r\nand most of the chiefs and hunters of the place, had dispersed from\r\ntheir encampment, and were now passing the summer months in the country\r\nnear the mouth of L\xe2\x80\x99aile de Corbeau, or Crow-wing River. That he would\r\nforthwith convey my message to them, &c.; confirming his words with the\r\npresent of a pipe.\r\n\r\nHaving determined to ascend the Mississippi from this point, and\r\nbeing satisfied from my Indian maps that I could make a portage from\r\nCass Lake into Leech Lake, and from the latter into the source of the\r\nCrow-wing river, so as to descend the latter to its junction with the\r\nMississippi, I transmitted a message to the Grosse Guelle to meet\r\nme, with the Sandy Lake Indians, at Isle de Corbeau, in twenty days,\r\ncounting from the 4th. I then deposited the provisions and goods\r\nintended for distribution at the council at Isle de Corbeau, with the\r\nperson in charge of Mr. Aitkin\xe2\x80\x99s house, making arrangements to have the\r\narticles sent down the Mississippi, in exact season to meet me there.\r\n\r\nRelieved of this portion of the burden of transportation, we proceeded\r\nwith more alacrity. We passed the falls of Pukaiguma on the 7th, and\r\nencamped at the trading-post at Lake Winnipec, above the savannas, on\r\nthe 9th, having pursued the side route through Bogotowa Lake. While\r\nencamped at Point aux Chenes, in the savannas, a Frenchman arrived from\r\nLeech Lake, on his way to the post at Sandy Lake. He reported that the\r\nwar-party had returned to Leech Lake, bringing three Sessiton scalps,\r\nhaving, in their engagement, lost one man, a brother-in-law of the\r\nGuelle Plat\xe2\x80\x99s. That the Guelle Plat had led the party, and encountered\r\nthe Sioux coming out against them. He also reported, that the Sioux\r\nhad scalped a Chippewa girl near Pembina. That they were immediately\r\npursued by a party of Chippewas, overtaken in the act of constructing a\r\nraft to cross a stream, and four of the number killed and scalped.[29]\r\n\r\nFinding the waters favourable for ascending, and that our progress had\r\nbeen much accelerated thereby, I sent a verbal message by this man, to\r\nhave the canoes with supplies destined for Isle de Corbeau set forward\r\ntwo days earlier than the time originally fixed.\r\n\r\nThe clerk in charge of the trading-post of Lake Winnipec, communicated\r\na number of facts respecting the location and number of the Indians\r\nliving in the middle grounds between that post and Rainy Lake. I\r\nproposed to him the following questions, to which I have annexed his\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\n1. Do the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay clerks cross the American lines from the post\r\nof Rainy Lake, for the purposes of trade? _Ans._ No. They furnish goods\r\nto Indians who go trading into the American territory.\r\n\r\n2. Do the partners or clerks of the H. B. Co. present flags and medals\r\nto Indians? _Ans._ Yes.\r\n\r\n3. Do they give such flags and medals to Indians living within the\r\nAmerican lines? _Ans._ No. I have heard that they took away an American\r\nflag given to an Indian on the U. S. borders of Rainy Lake, tore it,\r\nand burnt it, and gave him a British flag instead.\r\n\r\n4. Was the H. B. Co.\xe2\x80\x99s post on Rainy Lake supplied with ardent spirits\r\nlast season? _Ans._ It was. They had about 60 kegs of high-wines, which\r\nwere shown to some of our Indians, who went there, and Mr. Cameron, who\r\nwas in charge of the post, said to them, that, although their streams\r\nwere high from the melting of the snow, they should, swim as high with\r\nliquor, if the Indians required it.\r\n\r\n5. What is the strength of the high-wines? _Ans._ One keg is reduced to\r\nfour.\r\n\r\n6. Have the Indians sent out on _derwin_ by the H. B. Co. approached\r\nnear to your post? _Ans._ They have come very near, having been on the\r\nTurtle portage with goods.\r\n\r\n7. Did they bring liquor thus far? _Ans._ No. The liquor is kept at\r\nRainy Lake, to induce the Indians to visit that place with their furs.\r\n\r\n8. Did the disposition made of the liquor, which the Secretary of War\r\npermitted the principal factor of the Fond du Lac department, to take\r\nin last year, embrace the post of Winnipec? _Ans._ It did not. It\r\nwas kept chiefly at Rainy Lake, and on the lines, to be used in the\r\nopposition trade.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Cass Lake, or _Lac Cedar Rouge_ (July 10th), I found a\r\nband of Chippewas resident on its principal island. They confirmed\r\nthe reports of the murder and subsequent affray at Pembina, and of\r\nthe return of the war-party which went out from Leech Lake. Some of\r\nthe warriors engaged in the latter were from the island in Cass Lake,\r\nincluding the person killed. His widow and her children attended the\r\ncouncil, and shared in the distribution of presents which I made there.\r\nWhile encamped on this island, two of the Sioux scalps, which had been\r\nbrought in as trophies on the late excursion, were danced with the\r\nceremonies peculiar to the occasion, on an eminence adjacent to, and\r\nwithin sight of, my encampment. This painful exhibition of barbaric\r\ntriumph was enacted without consulting me.\r\n\r\nFinding it practicable, in the existing state of the waters, to visit\r\nthe principal and most remote source of the Mississippi, above this\r\nlake, I determined to encamp my men, and leave my heavy baggage and\r\nsupplies on the island, and to accomplish the visit in small canoes,\r\nwith the aid of Indian guides. As the details of this expedition afford\r\nno political information of a character required by my instructions,\r\nbeyond the observation of some evidences of a Sioux inroad in former\r\nyears, and the statistical facts heretofore given, they are omitted.\r\nIt will be sufficient to remark that the object was successfully\r\naccomplished, under the guidance of Oza Windib. I planted the American\r\nflag on an island in the lake, which is the true source of the\r\nMississippi, 149 years after the discovery of the mouth of this stream\r\nby La Salle. I was accompanied on this expedition by Mr. Johnston of\r\nthe Department; Dr. D. Houghton; Lieut. Allen, U. S. A.; and the Rev.\r\nW. T. Boutwell.\r\n\r\nOn returning to my encampment on the island in Cass Lake, I explained\r\nto the Indians, in a formal council, the object of my instructions\r\nfrom the Department, so far as these relate to their hostilities with\r\nthe Sioux. I invested Oza Windib with a flag and medal, finding him\r\nto be looked up to as the principal man in the band, and there being,\r\nat present, no one who claimed, or appeared to be as well entitled,\r\nto the authority of chieftainship. Neezh Opinais, or the Twin Birds,\r\nwho received a medal from Gov. Cass, through the intervention of his\r\nprincipal guide, in 1820, was formerly resident at this lake, but\r\nis now incorporated with the band at Red Lake. I sent him a flag,\r\naccompanied with a formal message, by his son, and acknowledged the\r\nreceipt of a peace pipe and stem, from Waiwain Jigun of Red Lake, sent\r\nout by him through another hand. These attentions to the ceremonial\r\nmessages of the Indians are of more importance, so far as respects\r\ntheir feelings and friendship, than might be inferred.\r\n\r\nCass Lake is about 15 miles long, in the direction that the\r\nMississippi passes through it, and may be estimated to be twelve miles\r\nwide, exclusive of a spacious prolongation or bay, in the direction\r\nto Leech Lake. It is the second large lake below the primary forks of\r\nthe Mississippi, and is decidedly the largest expanse assuming the\r\ncharacter of _a lake_, in its entire length, covering a greater square\r\nsuperficies than Lake Pepin.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi is but little used by traders going North West, and not\r\nat all beyond Lac Traverse. It is found to take its rise south of west\r\nfrom Cass Lake. In consequence, its source has seldom been visited,\r\neven by the traders, whose highest point of temporary location is\r\nPamitchi Gumaug, or Lac Traverse, estimated to be forty miles W.N.W. of\r\nCass Lake. And this point has been found to be the extreme N.W. point\r\nattained by its waters.\r\n\r\nRepresentations having been made to the Department, on the subject of\r\nforeign interference in the trade on this frontier, I have addressed a\r\nnumber of queries on the subject to a clerk[30] engaged in the American\r\ntrade, who has been many years a resident of Red Lake, and is well\r\nacquainted with the geography and resources of the adjacent country.\r\nI inquired of him, whether the American traders on that border were\r\nstrenuously opposed in their trade by the inhabitants of the Red River\r\ncolony, or by the partners and clerks of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company. He\r\nreplied, that the inhabitants of Pembina made temporary voyages of\r\ntrade to Voleuse, or Thief River, south of the parallel of 49\xc2\xb0, but\r\nthat they had not built, or made a permanent stand there. He said,\r\nthat the open nature of the country about the Red River settlements\r\ngave great facilities for making short excursions into the Indian\r\ncountry, on horseback and in carts. But he did not know any place where\r\npermanent outfits had been sent, except to Rivi\xc3\xa8re Souris, or Mouse\r\nRiver, west of Red River. He believes that this traffic was carried on\r\nexclusively by the inhabitants of the colony, and not by the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBay Company,\r\n\r\nI asked him, whether the Indians of the Lake of the Woods visited the\r\npost of Red Lake, and whether our traders were annoyed in their trade\r\nfrom that quarter, by the servants of the H. B. Company. He replied,\r\nthat the Lac du Bois Indians came across to Red Lake ordinarily; that\r\nit is a three days\xe2\x80\x99 journey, but that no annoyance is experienced in\r\nthe trade of that post from the H. B. Co. factors. He is of opinion,\r\nthat they do not send outfits into any part of the territory south of\r\nthe national boundary, beginning at Rat Portage, on the Lake of the\r\nWoods.\r\n\r\nAssurances being given by the Indians that the portages of the overland\r\nroute from Cass Lake to Leech Lake were not only practicable for my\r\ncanoes and baggage, but that by adopting it a considerable saving\r\nwould be made both in time and distance, I determined on returning\r\nby it. The first portage was found to be 950 yards. It lies over a\r\ndry sand plain. A small lake, without outlet, is then crossed; and a\r\nsecond portage of 4100 yards terminates at the banks of another small\r\nlake, which has a navigable outlet (for canoes) into an arm of Leech\r\nLake. We accomplished the entire route, from the island in Cass Lake\r\nto the Guelle Plat\xe2\x80\x99s village in Leech Lake, between ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock A.\r\nM. and ten P. M. of the 16th July. Although the night was dark, and\r\nthe Indians had retired to their lodges, a salute was fired by them,\r\nand an eligible spot for encampment pointed out. It was so dark as to\r\nrequire torches to find it. The next morning, I found myself in front\r\nof a village, numbering, when all present, upwards of 700 souls. They\r\nrenewed their salute. The chief, Guelle Plat, sent to invite me to\r\nbreakfast. During the repast, the room became filled with Indians, who\r\nseated themselves orderly around the room. When we arose, the chief\r\nassumed the oratorical attitude, and addressed himself to me.\r\n\r\nHe expressed his regret that I had not been able to visit them the\r\nyear before, when I was expected. He hoped I had now come, as I had\r\ncome by surprise, to remain some days with them. He said they lived\r\nremote, and were involved in wars with their neighbours, and wished my\r\nadvice. They were not insensible to advice, nor incapable of following\r\nit. They were anxious for counsel, and desirous of living at peace, and\r\nof keeping the advice which had heretofore been given to them. They\r\nhad been told to sit still on their lands. But their enemies would not\r\npermit them to sit still. They were compelled to get up and fight in\r\ndefence. The Sioux continued to kill their hunters. They had killed\r\nhis son during the last visit he had made to my office. They had never\r\nceased to make inroads. And he believed there were white men among the\r\nSioux who stirred them up to go to war against the Chippewas. He named\r\none person particularly.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, he continued, to take some decisive steps to put\r\na stop to their inroads. This was the reason why he had led out the\r\nwar-party which had recently returned. This was the reason why I saw\r\nthe stains of blood before me.\r\n\r\nHe alluded, in this expression, to the flags, war-clubs, &c. which\r\ndecorated one end of the room, all of which had vermilion smeared on\r\nthem, to represent blood. I replied succinctly, stating the reasons\r\nwhich would prevent my making a long visit, and notified him, that in\r\nconsequence of the length of my route yet to perform, I would assemble\r\nthem to a general council at my camp as soon as I could be prepared,\r\nthat notice would be given them by the firing of the military, and that\r\nI should then lay before them the advice I came to deliver from their\r\ngreat father the President, and offer them at the same time my own\r\ncounsel on the subjects he had spoken of.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, constant accessions were made to the number of Indians\r\nfrom neighbouring places. Among them were a party of nine Rainy Lake\r\nIndians, under the leadership of a man named Wai-Wizh-Zhe-Geezhig,\r\nor the Hole-in-the-Sky. He represented himself and party as resident\r\nat Springing-bowstring Lake; said that he had heard of my passing\r\nLake Winnipec, with an intention to return by Leech Lake, and came to\r\nexpress his good will, in the hope that he would not be overlooked,\r\n&c. I presented him publicly with a flag, and clothing and tobacco for\r\nhimself and party, committing to him a short address to be delivered to\r\nthe Rainy Lake Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Muk Kund Wai, or Pillagers, being present, with their chiefs and\r\nwarriors, women and children, I displayed the presents intended for\r\nthis band, on blankets spread out on the grass in front of my tent. I\r\ncalled their attention to the subjects named in my instructions, to the\r\ndesire of the government for the restoration of peace to the frontiers,\r\nand its paternal character, &c.; reminded them of their solemn treaty\r\nof peace and limits with the Sioux, signed at Prairie du Chien in 1825;\r\nenforced the advantages of it in relation to their hunting, their\r\ntrades, &c. &c. I presented the presents, in bulk, to the chiefs, who\r\nimmediately directed their distribution.\r\n\r\nAish Kee Buggi Kozh, or the Guelle Plat, was their speaker in reply.\r\nHe called the attention of the warriors to his words. He thanked me\r\nfor the presents, which reminded him, in amount, of the times when the\r\nBritish held possession in that quarter. He pointed across an arm of\r\nthe lake in front to the position occupied by the North-West Company\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfort. He said many winters had now passed since the Americans first\r\nsent a chief to that post to visit them\xe2\x80\x94alluding to Lieutenant Pike\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvisit in the winter of 1805-6. He remembered that visit. I had come to\r\nremind them that the American flag was flying in the land, and to offer\r\nthem counsels of peace, for which they were thankful. They had hoped\r\nI was to spend more time with them, to enter more fully into their\r\nfeelings, but as they must speak on the instant, they would not lose\r\nthe opportunity of declaring their sentiments.\r\n\r\nHe thought that the advice of the Americans resembled a rushing wind.\r\nIt was strong and went soon. It did not abide long enough to choke up\r\nthe road. He said, that at the treaty of Tipisagi, it had been promised\r\nthat the aggressor should be punished. But that they had even that very\r\nyear, and almost yearly since, been attacked by the Sioux, and some of\r\ntheir nation killed. He said that they had even been fired on under the\r\nwalls of the fort at Ishki Buggi Seepi,[31] and four of their party\r\nkilled. He had himself been present. He handed to me a small bundle of\r\nsticks, which, he said, exhibited the number of Leech Lake Chippewas\r\nwho had been killed by the Sioux since they had touched the quill[32]\r\nat Tipisagi. The number was forty-three.\r\n\r\nHe lifted up four American medals, attached by a string of wampum,\r\nand smeared with vermilion. He said they were bloody. He wished me to\r\nwipe off the blood. He said he was himself unable to do it. He found\r\nhimself irretrievably involved in a war with the Sioux. He said he\r\nbelieved that it had been intended by the Creator that they should be\r\nat war with this people. He was not satisfied with the result of the\r\nlate war-party. His warriors were not satisfied. He complimented their\r\nbravery. He disclaimed any merit himself. He said that they had looked\r\nfor help where they did not find it. They were determined to revenge\r\nthemselves. If the United States did not aid them, he had it in mind to\r\napply elsewhere for aid. He clearly referred to, but did not name, the\r\nEnglish government in Canada. His warriors were in a restless state.\r\nHe had sent out his pipe and invitations to the neighbouring bands to\r\ncontinue the war. Circumstances controlled him. He could not avoid it.\r\nHis own feelings were enlisted deeply in the contest. When the enemy\r\nkilled his son, he had resolved never to lay down the war-club. He had\r\nsought for death in battle, but had not met it. All he now could say\r\nwas, that perhaps he should not lead the next war-party. He thought\r\nsome other person would.\r\n\r\nHe accused persons on the waters of the Upper Mississippi, of giving\r\nadvice to the Sioux to go to war against the Chippewas. He said it was\r\nthe interest of persons in the trade to induce the Sioux to extend\r\nthe territorial boundary. He evinced a familiarity with persons and\r\nplaces. He did not exempt some persons officially connected with the\r\ngeneral government in that quarter, from participating in the course of\r\nmal-counsel.\r\n\r\nHe complained of the traders. He criticised their conduct with\r\nseverity. He thought their prices exorbitant, and said that they were\r\nso intent on getting furs, that they did not deem it necessary to use\r\nmuch formality in their dealings with the Indians. He complained of\r\nthe exclusion of ardent spirits, but at the same time admitted, that\r\nformerly it was brought in to buy up their wild rice\xe2\x80\x94a practice that\r\nleft them, at the beginning of cold weather, in a destitute situation.\r\n\r\nMuch of the sentiment of this address appeared to be uttered for\r\npopular effect on the young warriors, who stood an eager, gazing group\r\naround, and made loud responses of approbation at every pause. Such\r\nparts of it as were not given as a reply to my remarks, or contained\r\nallusions entitled to notice, I replied to, aiming to keep their\r\nattention fixed on the leading principles of the pacific policy which\r\ndictated my public instructions; and not meaning that they should\r\nforget them, nor mistake them, in any bursts of feeling, or appeals\r\nto the passions or prejudices of the young men, who only looked to\r\nthe war-path as the avenue of personal distinction. I brought these\r\nprinciples back to their minds, and enforced them by obvious appeals\r\nto facts. I told the chief that his political sentiments should be\r\nfaithfully reported to the government, whose object it was, in the\r\nemployment of subordinate officers, to accumulate facts, which might\r\nform the basis of future action.\r\n\r\nSo far as related to the traders withdrawing the article of whiskey\r\nfrom the trade, I felt it due to say that no hard feelings should be\r\nentertained towards them. That it was excluded by the office. That\r\nthe Indians should, in justice blame me, or blame the government, and\r\nnot the traders. I was satisfied that the use of whiskey was very\r\nhurtful to them in every situation, and felt determined to employ every\r\nmeans which the control of the Agency of the North-West gave to me,\r\nto exclude the article wholly and rigidly from the Chippewas, and to\r\nset the mark of disapprobation upon every trader who should make the\r\nattempt to introduce it.\r\n\r\nHaving an engagement to meet the Sandy Lake Indians on the 22d\r\n(after a lapse of five days), and an unknown route to explore, I\r\nterminated the council by the distribution of provisions to the\r\nRainy Lake Indians, guides, and chiefs, requested fresh guides for\r\nthe route into the Ka Ga Gee, or De Corbeau River, and immediately\r\nembarked. We encamped on the southern shore of Leech Lake. During the\r\nfollowing day (18th), we accomplished the whole route from this lake\r\nto the head waters of the De Corbeau. It consists of five portages of\r\nvarious length, separated by ten small lakes and ponds. The last of\r\nthe portages terminates on the handsomely elevated banks of a lake\r\ncalled Kagi Nogum Aug. This lake is the source of this fork of the\r\nMississippi. The Guelle Plat, with the secondary chief of his band,\r\novertook me at the commencement of the fourth portage, and accompanied\r\nme to my encampment. He said he had many things which he still wished\r\nto consult me on, and spent the evening, until twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, in\r\nconversation. I found him to possess a reflective intelligent mind.\r\nHe stated to me his opinions on the Sioux war, the boundary line, the\r\ntrade, location of trading-posts. &c. He evinced the gratified feelings\r\ncreated by the circumstances of my visit to his people, and said he\r\nshould visit me at the agency, next year, if his life and health were\r\nspared.\r\n\r\nWe commenced the descent of the De Corbeau on the 19th. The channel is\r\nat first small and winding. It expands successively into eleven lakes,\r\nof various dimensions, and acquires considerable breadth and velocity\r\nbefore it forms its upper forks, by the junction with Shell River. We\r\nencountered in this distance no Indians, but observed, as we had the\r\nprevious day, traces of the recent war-party. In passing out of the\r\ntenth of the series of lakes, the men observed a camp-fire on shore,\r\nbut no person appeared. It was conjectured to indicate the presence\r\nof Sioux, who, perceiving the character of the party, had fled and\r\nconcealed themselves.\r\n\r\nThe next day afforded no certain evidences of a fixed population. We\r\nobserved continued traces of the recent war-party, and other signs of\r\ntemporary occupancy, in the standing camp-poles and meat racks which\r\nfrequently met the eye in our descent. We passed the entrance of Leaf\r\nRiver, a large tributary from the right, having its source near the\r\nbanks of Otter Tail Lake; and the next day, had our attention directed\r\nto the entrance of Prauie River, on the same shore. The latter is\r\nalso a tributary of the first class. It is the war-road, so to say,\r\nbetween the Chippewas and Sioux, having its source in a lake, which is\r\ndesignated in the treaty of Prairie du Chien as one of the points in\r\nthe boundary line between these two nations.\r\n\r\nThe day following (21st), the monotony of vegetable solitude was\r\nbroken by meeting a Chippewa and his family in a canoe. He informed me\r\nthat we were within a few hours\xe2\x80\x99 journey of the mouth of the river\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nthe Sandy Lake and Mille Lac Indians were assembled there, awaiting my\r\narrival, and that they expected me this day. I found this information\r\nto be correct. We entered the Mississippi about noon, and saw the\r\nopposite shore lined with lodges, with the American flag conspicuously\r\ndisplayed. The long-continued firing and shouts of the Indians left me\r\nno reason to doubt that my arrival was both anticipated and desired. I\r\nwas gratified on being told, within three hours of my arrival, that the\r\ncanoe, with the goods and supplies from Sandy Lake, was in sight. And\r\nin a few moments found the event verified, in the safe arrival of the\r\nmen, and the landing of the packages.\r\n\r\nI determined to lose no time in assembling the Indians in council,\r\naddressed them on the objects of the expedition, and caused the\r\npresents to be prepared and distributed. I was addressed, in reply, by\r\nthe elder chief, Gross Guelle, and also by the brother of the Strong\r\nGround, by Waub Ojeeg, and by a young man called Nitum E\xe2\x80\x99gabo Wai.\r\nPeculiarities in the address of each only require to be adverted to.\r\n\r\nThe Gross Guelle deemed it important that the line between them and\r\nthe Sioux should be surveyed and marked. He said that much of it was a\r\nland line, and it could not be told by either party where it ran. This\r\nwas true of it, in the section of country immediately west of them.\r\nThe Sioux were in the habit of trespassing on it; and when their own\r\nhunters went out in the pursuit of game, they did not like to stop\r\nshort of the game, and they saw no marked line to stop them. He said\r\nthat it had been promised at the treaty that the line should be run,\r\nand he wished me to refer the subject to the President. He was in\r\nfavour of peace now, as he had been at Tipisagi, and at Fond du Lac.\r\n\r\nSoangikumig, or the Strong Ground, expressed his sentiments through the\r\nmedium of his brother, who was the more ready speaker. He said he had\r\ntaken a part in defending the lines, and he hoped that they might be\r\nmade plain, so that each party could see them. As it is, a perpetual\r\npretence is given for crossing the lines. It must be expected that\r\npeace would often be broken when it could be so easily done.\r\n\r\nWaub Ojeeg, or the White Fisher, said that he had given his influence\r\nto peace counsels. He had been present at the treaty of Fond du Lac.\r\nBut the Sandy Lake Indians had been lately reproached, as it were,\r\nfor their pacific character, by hearing of the Leech Lake war-party\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npassing so near to them. He hoped that the same advice that was given\r\nto them would be given to the Sioux. If the Sioux would not _come_\r\nover the lines, the Chippewas would promise not to _go_ over them. He\r\nthought the lines might have been differently run, but as they had been\r\nagreed to by their old chiefs, who were now gone, it would be best to\r\nlet them as they do. Their hunters, however, always came out of the\r\nmouth of Sauc River, which had been given up to the Sioux.\r\n\r\nThe young man said that he was the son of Pugu Sain Jigun, who had\r\ndied recently at Sandy Lake. He said that the medal which he wore had\r\nbeen given to his father by me, at the treaty of Prairie du Chien in\r\n1825, in exchange for a British medal, surrendered by him. He did not\r\nprofess to have any experience in political affairs. He had inherited\r\nhis medal, and hoped to be considered by me worthy of it. He expected\r\nthe respect due to it. He expressed his friendship, and confirmed his\r\nspeech with a pipe.\r\n\r\nAscertaining the trading-house to be near my encampment, after closing\r\nthe council, I descended the Mississippi about eighteen miles, and\r\nencamped at Prairie Pierc\xc3\xa9e.\r\n\r\nThe distance from the mouth of the De Corbeau to St. Anthony\xe2\x80\x99s Falls,\r\nmay be computed to exceed 200 miles. The line between the Chippewas\r\nand Sioux crossed from the east to the west of the Mississippi, so as\r\nto strike and follow up the Wadub, or Little Soc River, which is the\r\nfirst river on the west banks of the Mississippi, above the mouth of\r\nSoc River. We passed several Chippewa hunters, with their families,\r\nalong this part of the Mississippi, but encountered no Sioux, even on\r\nthat portion of it lying south of their line. I was informed that they\r\nhad in a measure abandoned this part of the country, and I observed no\r\nstanding Sioux camp-poles, which are, with the people, a conspicuous\r\nsign of occupancy, and which were, in 1820, noticed to extend as high\r\nup the river as Little Rock. (_Les Petite Roches_).\r\n\r\nI passed the portage of the Falls of St. Anthony, and reached Fort\r\nSnelling on the 24th July. There being no agent, nor sub-agent\r\npresent, Captain Jouett, the commanding officer, on whom the charge of\r\nthe agency had temporarily devolved, afforded me every facility for\r\ncommunicating to the Sioux the object of my visit to the Chippewas, and\r\nrequesting their concurrence in its accomplishment. For this purpose\r\nthe Wahpeton Sioux were called together, at the agency-house, on the\r\n25th. I stated to them the object of the visit, and the means which\r\nhad been used to persuade the Chippewas to give up war, and to confine\r\nthemselves within their lines. I reminded them of the anxiety of their\r\ngreat father the President, to bring about a firm peace between them\r\nand the Chippewas, and of the numerous proofs he had given them of\r\nthis anxiety, by calling them together at several councils, which had\r\nthis object particularly in view. They had men of wisdom among them,\r\nand they would quickly see how utterly useless it would, however, be\r\nfor the Chippewas to remain quiet, during any single season, if the\r\nSioux did not also, at the same time, sit still. I appealed to them to\r\nresolve on peace; to take the resolution now; to take it sincerely, and\r\nto adhere to it firmly and for ever.\r\n\r\nI stated to them the request made by Grosse Guelle, and other Chippewa\r\nchiefs, respecting the marking out of the lines, and invited them to\r\nexpress their opinion on this subject.\r\n\r\nI announced to them the exclusion of whiskey.\r\n\r\nThe aged chief Petite Corbeau uttered their reply. I recognised in\r\nthis chief one of the signers of the grant of land made at this place\r\n26 years ago, when the site of the fort was first visited and selected\r\nby the late General Pike. He adverted to the agency, which he had\r\nexercised for many years, in managing the affairs of his people. They\r\nlived upon the river. They were constantly in sight. They were in\r\nthe habit of being consulted. His ears had always been open to the\r\nAmericans. He had listened to their counsels. He would still listen\r\nto them, although they were, at present, in a depressed situation.\r\nHe adverted particularly to the existing war with the Saucs, and the\r\naccusations which had been thrown out against the Sioux party, who had\r\ngone down to join the American standard, but had returned. He denied\r\nthat they felt any friendship for the Saucs and Foxes. He said they\r\nwere willing to go against them again, if requested by the commanding\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nHe spoke on the subject of the Chippewa wars at some length, adverting\r\nto a time when this people did not approach so near to the river\xe2\x80\x94when\r\nthey dared not to approach so near to it. He thought the lines were\r\ndrawn too close upon them, on the St. Croix\xe2\x80\x94that the young men\r\ncould not go out hunting, but quickly they found themselves beyond\r\ntheir lines. He thought they might even now be driven back, were it\r\nundertaken in earnest.\r\n\r\nHe said the chief of Leech Lake was wrong to appeal to me to wipe the\r\nblood off his medal. He ought to be able to wipe it off himself. It\r\nwas pitiful to make this appeal, for men who were able to do a thing\r\nthemselves. He referred to the late Chippewa war-party, and said that a\r\nrelative of his had been killed. Blood would call for blood. He did not\r\nrule the Lessitons. He thought they would repay the blow.\r\n\r\nHis own advice had been pacific. He had received my wampum last year,\r\nand smoked the pipe with the St. Croix Chippewas. They were their\r\nneighbours. They were now at peace. They wished to remain so. They\r\nwould act by my advice. He thanked me for the advice.\r\n\r\nHe warmly approbated the proposition to run out the lines. He said\r\nit had been mentioned at the treaty. And although the lines were not\r\nadjusted to the full satisfaction of all, perhaps they could never be\r\nsettled better. He therefore united in requesting that the President\r\nmight be asked to direct white men to establish them. It would be\r\nnecessary, however, to have both parties by.\r\n\r\nHe again adverted to the difficulties between them and the Chippewas.\r\nHe thought that these difficulties were kept alive by the visits of the\r\nChippewas to their post. He said it put bad feelings into the hearts\r\nof the Sioux, to see the Chippewas share the bounties of government,\r\nwhich the Sioux believed the government intended exclusively for them.\r\nBesides, it was difficult to restrain their feelings of hostility\r\nwhen they came together. Both parties were mistrustful. It was only\r\nnecessary to look back a few years, to perceive what the consequences\r\nhad been. He believes that these tribes ought to be kept apart. And one\r\nof the best means of keeping them apart was to draw their lines plain,\r\nand to order presents to be given out on their own lands, and not on\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s lands.\r\n\r\nHe spoke against the location of any trading-post on the St. Croix,\r\nwhich should be fixed so near to the lines as to bring the Sioux and\r\nChippewas into contact. He also stated reasons why a post at the mouth\r\nof the St. Croix, which is exclusively in the Sioux country, was\r\nnot necessary.[33] He wished to keep his band together, and not to\r\ngive them excuses for going hither and yon. He requested me to stop\r\nat his village, and to use my influence in persuading his people to\r\nlive in one village, and not to continue, as they now were, in two\r\ndistinct villages, which were not, in consequence, so fully under his\r\ncontrol.[34]\r\n\r\nWamidetunkar, or the Black Dog, followed him in a speech containing\r\nsentiments not at variance with those expressed by the Little Crow. Its\r\ndistinguishing feature was, however, a reference to the indulgences\r\nformerly granted to the Sioux at this post. He thought it hard that\r\nthese indulgences should be withdrawn, or curtailed. And he could not\r\ncomprehend how such a course could be consistent with professions of\r\nfriendship on the part of officers of the U. States. He referred,\r\nparticularly, to indiscriminate visiting at the fort, and the purchase\r\nof ardent spirits from the settlers.\r\n\r\nCohmokar said that he had been present with the Petite Corbeau at\r\nthe signing of the treaty of cession at St. Peters, and it was owing\r\nto this act that the American flag was now displayed there. He had\r\nsustained this chief in his public acts, and he concurred with him\r\nin what he had uttered about the Chippewa war, and also the existing\r\ntroubles with the Black Hawk. He repelled the idea that the Sioux were\r\nfriendly to the Saucs and Foxes in the present controversy. They were\r\na people who were never at ease. They had often struck the Sioux.\r\nThe Sioux war-club had also been often lifted against them, and it\r\nwas ready to be lifted again. They were ready to hear the commanding\r\nofficer, who was sitting present, say strike.\r\n\r\nThe details of my route through the St. Croix and Burntwood Rivers,\r\ndo not essentially vary the aspect of North Western Indian affairs\r\ngiven above. Facts communicated expressive of the then existing state\r\nof feeling respecting the said disturbances, were promptly reported to\r\nhis excellency George B. Porter, governor of Michigan, in a letter, of\r\nwhich I have the honour herewith to furnish a copy. The proposition\r\nof running out and marking their territorial lines, as a means of\r\npreserving peace, was approved; the recent meetings on the St. Croix,\r\nfor the purpose of renewing pledges of peace, declared to be sincere\r\non the part of the Chippewas; and sentiments of friendship to the\r\ngovernment, and welcome to myself, expressed at each of the councils\r\nwhich I held with them.\r\n\r\nIn submitting to the Department this summary of facts, resulting from\r\nmy visit to the source of the Mississippi, I take the occasion to\r\nremark, that whatever may be the present state of feeling of the tribes\r\non that stream, above Prairie du Chien, respecting the government of\r\nthe United States, causes are in silent, but active operation, which\r\nwill hereafter bring them into contact with our frontier settlements,\r\nand renew, at two or three separate periods in their history, the\r\nnecessity of resorting to arms to quell or pacify them. The grounds\r\nof this opinion I need not now specify, further than to indicate that\r\nthey exist in the condition and character of opposite lines of an\r\nextensive frontier population, which will inevitably impel the one to\r\npress, and the other to recede or resist. This process of repulsion and\r\nresistance will continue, if I have not much mistaken the character\r\nof that stream, until the frontier shall have become stationary about\r\nfive hundred miles above the point I have indicated. I advert to this\r\ntopic, not in the spirit of exciting immediate alarm, for there are\r\nno reasons for it, but for the purpose of calling the attention of\r\nthe Secretary of War, through you, sir, to the importance of keeping\r\nup, and not withdrawing or reducing, the north western posts and\r\nagencies. And to express the opinion, that the advice and influence of\r\nthe government upon these tribes would fall nearly powerless, without\r\nready and visible means upon the frontiers of causing its counsels to\r\nbe respected. Christianity, schools, and agriculture will do much to\r\nmeliorate their condition and subdue their animosities, but it is a\r\nspecies of influence which has not yet been felt in any general effects\r\nin this quarter. Among the means of securing their friendship, and\r\npreserving peace, I have the honour to suggest, that beneficial effects\r\nwould result from following out the system of exploratory visits, by\r\nextending it to the region of Lac des Flambeau, and to that portion of\r\nthe peninsula of Michigan lying north of Grand River. A deputation of\r\nthe Chippewas from the sources of the Mississippi and Lake Superior to\r\nthe seat of government, would also be advantageous.\r\n\r\nSo far as respects the state of hostilities among the Sioux and\r\nChippewas, it must be expected that continued efforts will be necessary\r\neffectually to check it. Nothing could, perhaps, now be done, which\r\nwould tend so directly to promote this end, as the surveying of the\r\nlines agreed on between themselves at the treaty of Prairie du Chien of\r\n1825.\r\n\r\n                                         I am, sir, very respectfully,\r\n                                            Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                HENRY R.

Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie.}\r\n\r\nSIR:\r\n\r\nIn conformity with your instructions, I take the earliest opportunity\r\nto lay before you such facts as I have collected, touching the\r\nvaccination of the Chippewa Indians, during the progress of the late\r\nexpedition into their country; and also \xe2\x80\x9cof the prevalence, from time\r\nto time, of the small-pox\xe2\x80\x9d among them.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying table will serve to illustrate the \xe2\x80\x9cages, sex, tribe,\r\nand local situation\xe2\x80\x9d of those Indians who have been vaccinated by me.\r\nWith the view of illustrating more fully their local situation, I\r\nhave arranged those bands residing upon the shores of Lake Superior;\r\nthose residing in the Folle Avoine country (or that section of country\r\nlying between the highlands south-west from Lake Superior, and the\r\nMississippi River); and those residing near the sources of the\r\nMississippi River, separately.\r\n\r\nNearly all the Indians noticed in this table were vaccinated at their\r\nrespective villages; yet I did not fail to vaccinate those whom we\r\nchanced to meet in their hunting or other excursions.\r\n\r\nI have embraced, with the Indians of the frontier bands, those\r\nhalf-breeds, who, in consequence of having adopted more or less the\r\nhabits of the Indian, may be identified with him.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------+--------------------------------+-------\r\n       CHIPPEWA INDIANS.       |            MALES.              |\r\n-------------------------------+-----+-----+-----+----+----+----+------+\r\n                               |Under| 10  |  20 | 40 | 60 |Over|Males.|\r\n                               | 10  | to  |  to | to | to | 80 |      |\r\n                Bands.         |     | 20  |  40 | 60 | 80 |    |      |\r\n                               +-----+-----+-----+----+----+----+------+\r\n            {Sault Ste.

The efficacy of\r\nthe vaccine disease is well appreciated, even by the most interior of\r\nthe Chippewa Indians, and so universal is this information, that only\r\none instance occurred where the Indian had never heard of the disease.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every instance the opportunity which was presented for\r\nvaccination was embraced with cheerfulness and apparent gratitude;\r\nat the same time manifesting great anxiety that, for the safety of\r\nthe whole, each one of the band should undergo the operation. When\r\nobjections were made to vaccination, they were not usually made because\r\nthe Indian doubted the protective power of the disease, but because he\r\nsupposed (never having seen its progress) that the remedy must nearly\r\nequal the disease which it was intended to counteract.\r\n\r\nOur situation, while travelling, did not allow me sufficient time to\r\ntest the result of the vaccination in most instances; but an occasional\r\nreturn to bands where the operation had been performed, enabled me, in\r\nthose bands, either to note the progress of the disease, or to judge\r\nfrom the cicatrices marking the original situation of the pustules, the\r\ncases in which the disease had proved successful.\r\n\r\nAbout one-fourth of the whole number were vaccinated directly from the\r\npustules of patients labouring under the disease; while the remaining\r\nthree-fourths were vaccinated from crusts, or from virus which had\r\nbeen several days on hand. I did not pass by a single opportunity for\r\nsecuring the crusts and virus from the arms of healthy patients; and\r\nto avoid as far as possible the chance of giving rise to a disease of\r\na spurious kind, I invariably made use of those crusts and that virus,\r\nfor the purposes of vaccination, which had been most recently obtained.\r\nTo secure, as far as possible, against the chances of escaping the\r\nvaccine disease, I invariably vaccinated in each arm.\r\n\r\nOf the whole number of Indians vaccinated, I have either watched the\r\nprogress of the disease, or examined the cicatrices of about seven\r\nhundred. An average of one in three of those vaccinated from crusts has\r\nfailed, while of those vaccinated directly from the arm of a person\r\nlabouring under the disease, not more than one in twenty has failed\r\nto take effect\xe2\x80\x94when the disease did not make its appearance after\r\nvaccination, I have invariably, as the cases came under my examination,\r\nrevaccinated until a favourable result has been obtained.\r\n\r\nOf the different bands of Indians vaccinated, a large proportion of\r\nthe following have, as an actual examination has shown, undergone\r\nthoroughly the effects of the disease: viz. Sault Ste. Marie, Keweena\r\nBay, La Pointe, and Cass Lake, being seven hundred and fifty-one in\r\nnumber; while of the remaining thirteen hundred and seventy-eight,\r\nof other bands, I think it may safely be calculated that more than\r\nthree-fourths have passed effectually under the influence of the\r\nvaccine disease: and as directions to revaccinate all those in whom\r\nthe disease failed, together with instructions as to time and manner\r\nof vaccination, were given to the chiefs of the different bands, it is\r\nmore than probable that, where the bands remained together a sufficient\r\nlength of time, the operation of revaccination has been performed by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nUpon our return to Lake Superior I had reason to suspect, on\r\nexamining several cicatrices, that two of the crusts furnished by\r\nthe surgeon-general in consequence of a partial decomposition, gave\r\nrise to a spurious disease, and these suspicions were confirmed when\r\nrevaccinating with genuine vaccine matter, when the true disease was\r\ncommunicated. Nearly all those Indians vaccinated with those two\r\ncrusts, have been vaccinated, and passed regularly through the vaccine\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe answers to my repeated inquiries respecting the introduction,\r\nprogress, and fatality of the small-pox, would lead me to infer that\r\nthe disease has made its appearance, at least five times, among\r\nthe bands of Chippewa Indians noticed in the accompanying table of\r\nvaccination.\r\n\r\nThe small-pox appears to have been wholly unknown to the Chippewas\r\nof Lake Superior until about 1750; when a war-party, of more than one\r\nhundred young men, from the bands resident near the head of the lake,\r\nhaving visited Montreal for the purpose of assisting the French in\r\ntheir then existing troubles with the English, became infected with\r\nthe disease, and but few of the party survived to reach their homes\xe2\x80\x94It\r\ndoes not appear, although they made a precipitate retreat to their own\r\ncountry, that the disease was at this time communicated to any others\r\nof the tribe.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1770, the disease appeared a second time among the\r\nChippewas, but unlike that which preceded it, it was communicated to\r\nthe more northern bands.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances connected with its introduction are related nearly as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nSome time in the fall of 1767 or 8, a trader, who had ascended the\r\nMississippi and established himself near Leech Lake, was robbed of his\r\ngoods by the Indians residing at that lake; and, in consequence of his\r\nexertions in defending his property, he died soon after.\r\n\r\nThese facts became known to the directors of the Fur Company, at\r\nMackinac, and each successive year after, requests were sent to\r\nthe Leech Lake Indians, that they should visit Mackinac, and make\r\nreparation for the goods they had taken, by a payment of furs, at\r\nthe same time threatening punishment in case of a refusal. In the\r\nspring of 1770 the Indians saw fit to comply with this request; and a\r\ndeputation from the band visited Mackinac, with a quantity of furs,\r\nwhich they considered an equivalent for the goods which had been taken.\r\nThe deputation was received with politeness by the directors of the\r\ncompany, and the difficulties readily adjusted. When this was effected,\r\na cask of liquor and a flag closely rolled were presented to the\r\nIndians as a token of friendship. They were at the same time strictly\r\nenjoined neither to break the seal of the cask nor to unroll the flag,\r\nuntil they had reached the heart of their own country. This they\r\npromised to observe; but while returning, and after having travelled\r\nmany days, the chief of the deputation made a feast for the Indians of\r\nthe band at Fond du Lac, Lake Superior, upon which occasion he unsealed\r\nthe cask and unrolled the flag for the gratification of his guests. The\r\nIndians drank of the liquor, and remained in a state of inebriation\r\nduring several days. The rioting was over, and they were fast\r\nrecovering from its effects, when several of the party were seized with\r\nviolent pain. This was attributed to the liquor they had drunk; but the\r\npain increasing, they were induced to drink deeper of the poisonous\r\ndrug, and in this inebriated state several of the party died, before\r\nthe real cause was suspected. Other like cases occurred; and it was not\r\nlong before one of the war-party which had visited Montreal in 1750,\r\nand who had narrowly escaped with his life, recognised the disease as\r\nthe same which had attacked their party at that time. It proved to be\r\nso; and of those Indians then at Fond du Lac, about three hundred in\r\nnumber, nearly the whole were swept off by it. Nor did it stop here,\r\nfor numbers of those at Fond du Lac, at the time the disease made its\r\nappearance, took refuge among the neighbouring bands, and although it\r\ndid not extend easterly on Lake Superior, it is believed that not a\r\nsingle band of Chippewas north or west from Fond du Lac escaped its\r\nravages. Of a large band then resident at Cass Lake, near the source of\r\nthe Mississippi River, only one person, a child, escaped. The others\r\nhaving been attacked by the disease, died before any opportunity for\r\ndispersing was offered. The Indians at this day are firmly of the\r\nopinion that the small-pox was, at this time, communicated through the\r\narticles presented to their brethren, by the agent of the Fur Company\r\nat Mackinac; and that it was done for the purpose of punishing them\r\nmore severely for their offences.\r\n\r\nThe most western bands of Chippewas relate a singular allegory of\r\nthe introduction of the small-pox into their country by a war-party,\r\nreturning from the plains of the Missouri, as nearly as information\r\nwill enable me to judge, in the year 1784. It does not appear that, at\r\nthis time, the disease extended to the bands east of Fond du Lac; but\r\nit is represented to have been extremely fatal to those bands north and\r\nwest from there.\r\n\r\nIn 1802 or 3, the small-pox made its appearance among the Indians\r\nresiding at the Sault Ste. Marie, but did not extend to the bands west\r\nfrom that place. The disease was introduced by a voyager, in the employ\r\nof the North West Fur Company, who had just returned from Montreal;\r\nand although all communication with him was prohibited, an Indian\r\nimprudently having made him a visit, was infected with and transmitted\r\nthe disease to others of the band. When once communicated, it raged\r\nwith great violence, and of a large band scarcely one of those then at\r\nthe village survived, and the unburied bones still remain marking the\r\nsituation they occupied. From this band the infection was communicated\r\nto a band residing upon St. Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s Island, and many died of it; but\r\nthe surgeon of the military post then there succeeded, by judicious and\r\nearly measures, in checking it, before the infection became general.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 the small-pox again made its appearance among the Indians at\r\nthe Sault Ste. Marie. It was communicated by a voyager to Indians upon\r\nDrummond\xe2\x80\x99s Island, Lake Huron; and through them several families at\r\nSault Ste. Marie became infected. Of those belonging to the latter\r\nplace, more than twenty in number, only two escaped. The disease is\r\nrepresented to have been extremely fatal to the Indians at Drummond\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nSince 1824, the small-pox is not known to have appeared among the\r\nIndians at the Sault Ste. Marie, nor among the Chippewas north or\r\nwest from that place. But the Indians of these bands still tremble at\r\nthe bare name of a disease which (next to the compounds of alcohol)\r\nhas been one of the greatest scourges that has ever overtaken them\r\nsince their first communication with the whites. The disease, when\r\nonce communicated to a band of Indians, rages with a violence wholly\r\nunknown to the civilized man. The Indian, guided by present feeling,\r\nadopts a course of treatment (if indeed it deserves that appellation),\r\nwhich not unfrequently arms the disease with new power. An attack is\r\nbut a warning to the poor and helpless patient to prepare for death,\r\nwhich will almost assuredly soon follow. His situation under these\r\ncircumstances is truly deplorable; for while in a state that even,\r\nwith proper advice, he would of himself recover, he adds fresh fuel\r\nto the flame which is already consuming him, under the delusive hope\r\nof gaining relief. The intoxicating draught (when it is within his\r\nreach) is not among the last remedies to which he resorts, to produce\r\na lethargy from which he is never to recover. Were the friends of the\r\nsick man, even under these circumstances, enabled to attend him, his\r\nsufferings might be, at least, somewhat mitigated; but they too are,\r\nperhaps, in a similar situation, and themselves without even a single\r\nperson to minister to their wants. Death comes to the poor invalid, and\r\nperhaps even as a welcome guest, to rid him of his suffering.\r\n\r\nBy a comparison of the number of Indians vaccinated upon the borders\r\nof Lake Superior, with the actual population, it will be seen that the\r\nproportion who have passed through the vaccine disease is so great as\r\nto secure them against any general prevalence of the small-pox; and\r\nperhaps it is sufficient to prevent the introduction of the disease to\r\nthe bands beyond, through this channel. But in the Folle Avoine country\r\nit is not so. Of the large bands of Indians residing in that section\r\nof country, only a small fraction have been vaccinated; while of other\r\nbands not a single person has passed through the disease.\r\n\r\nTheir local situation undoubtedly renders it of the first importance\r\nthat the benefits of vaccination should be extended to them. Their\r\nsituation may be said to render them a connecting link between the\r\nsouthern and north-western bands of Chippewas; and while on the south\r\nthey are liable to receive the virus of the small-pox from the whites\r\nand Indians, the passage of the disease through them to their more\r\nnorthern brethren would only be prevented by their remaining, at that\r\ntime, completely separated. Every motive of humanity towards the\r\nsuffering Indian, would lead to extend to him this protection against\r\na disease he holds in constant dread, and of which he knows, by sad\r\nexperience, the fatal effects. The protection he will prize highly, and\r\nwill give in return the only boon a destitute man is capable of giving;\r\nthe deep-felt gratitude of an overflowing heart.\r\n\r\n                             I have the honour to be,\r\n                                 Very respectfully, sir,\r\n                                     Your obedient servant,\r\n                                         (Signed,) DOUGLASS HOUGHTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ADDENDA\xe2\x80\x94I.\r\n\r\n                                           OFFICE OF INDIAN AGENCY, }\r\n                             _Sault Ste.

It has been long known\r\nthat desperate and deep-rooted feuds continue to harass the tribes\r\nwhose local position brings them into frequent contact. These contests\r\noperate to divert their attention from hunting, and to abstract their\r\nminds from objects essential to their well-being. They embarrass every\r\neffort to better their condition. They repel the advance of teachers.\r\nThey deaden the effect of counsel. And by keeping the Indian mind in a\r\nstate of perpetual alarm, destroy its capacities of healthful action.\r\nEvery year is giving new proofs of the inveteracy of their hatred for\r\neach other, and the deteriorating effects of cultivating, as they do,\r\nthe passion for warlike achievement. It is destructive to the industry\r\nof the young, and paralyzing to the counsels of the old.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the expedition ordered by the government last year, into\r\nthe country of the Chippewas, is believed to have been efficacious in\r\nchecking this spirit of predatory warfare, and impressing upon their\r\nminds the true character of our government, its benevolent intentions\r\ntowards them, and its watchfulness, power, and resources. It was not\r\npracticable, however, to go over the whole area proposed to be visited,\r\nthe effect of the expedition having been directed exclusively to the\r\nbands located south of the latitude of St. Anthony\xe2\x80\x99s Falls. It is\r\nbelieved that a similar mission to the tribes of the Upper Mississippi,\r\nliving north of that point in our geography, would result in effects\r\nequally useful to them and to the government. And I therefore submit to\r\nthe Department the propriety of authorizing it.\r\n\r\nAdditional weight is given to the reasons applicable to this subject,\r\nby the increased hazards at which the trade of our citizens is\r\nconducted in that quarter, and the influence they have to contend with,\r\nfrom the proximity of a foreign and a rival frontier. The agents of\r\nthe Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company are wakeful and active opponents, and there\r\nis reason to believe that the measure of control which they exercise\r\nover the Indian population, is irrespective of an imaginary territorial\r\nline. At any rate, our traders complain loudly of infractions and\r\nlosses from this source. Merely to visit the Indians and the traders at\r\ntheir posts, will be to encourage and to sustain them.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to perform the journey in a single canoe, manned by\r\n_engages_, accompanied with an escort of soldiers, and with such\r\nauxiliary aid from the native population as may be necessary. It would\r\ngive additional utility to the effort, if the Engineer Department\r\nshould judge proper to subjoin an officer to take observations\r\nfor latitude, and to collect the materials for a correct map. The\r\nmoral condition of the native population is such as to render it an\r\ninteresting field for evangelical observation, and I propose to offer\r\nto a clergyman in the service of the A. B. F. Missions, now on the\r\nfrontier, the opportunity of exploring it.\r\n\r\nThe route from the head of Lake Superior will extend, through the River\r\nSt. Louis and its connecting waters, to the Mississippi at Sandy Lake,\r\nand by the way of Leech Lake to the sources of the Mississippi. From\r\nthe point where navigation is checked a portage is proposed to be made\r\ninto Red Lake (a remote tributary of Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay). And the route by\r\nOttertail Lake, and the river De Corbeau, will be pursued so as to\r\nre-enter the Mississippi at the confluence of the latter. Thence by\r\nthe Falls of St. Anthony to St. Peters, and through the St. Croix, the\r\nChippewa, or the Wisconsin, to the lakes. Circumstances may require\r\nchanges in this programme.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the country to be traversed requires an early departure\r\nfrom this place, and the toil of interior transportation makes it\r\ndesirable that as little baggage, and as few men, should be taken,\r\nas may suffice for the certain accomplishment of the object. Under\r\nthis view of the subject, I have prepared a detailed estimate of\r\nexpenditures, on an economical scale, which is herewith submitted.\r\n\r\n                                               I have the honour, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n                                         DEPARTMENT OF WAR,         }\r\n                              _Office Indian Affairs, May 3, 1832_. }\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYour letter of February 13th has been received, and its general\r\nviews are approved. The Secretary of War deems it important that you\r\nshould proceed to the country upon the heads of the Mississippi, and\r\nvisit as many of the Indians in that, and the intermediate region, as\r\ncircumstances will permit. Reports have reached the Department from\r\nvarious quarters, that the Indians upon our frontiers are in an unquiet\r\nstate, and that there is a prospect of extensive hostilities among\r\nthemselves. It is no less the dictate of humanity than of policy, to\r\nrepress this feeling, and to establish permanent peace among these\r\ntribes. It is also important to inspect the condition of the trade\r\nin that remote country, and the conduct of the traders. To ascertain\r\nwhether the laws and regulations are complied with, and to suggest\r\nsuch alterations as may be required. And generally to inquire into the\r\nnumbers, situations, dispositions, and prospects of the Indians, and\r\nto report all the statistical facts you can procure, and which will be\r\nuseful to the government in its operations, or to the community in the\r\ninvestigation of these subjects.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these objects, you will direct your attention to\r\nthe vaccination of the Indians. An act for that purpose has passed\r\nCongress, and you are authorized to take a surgeon with you. The\r\ncompensation fixed by law is six dollars per day, but this includes all\r\nthe expenses. As the surgeon with you must necessarily be transported\r\nand subsisted at the public expense, the whole sum of six dollars\r\nper day will be allowed for this service, but of that sum only three\r\ndollars per day will be paid to the surgeon, and the residue will be\r\napplied to the expenses of the expedition.\r\n\r\nVaccine matter, prepared and put up by the surgeon-general, is herewith\r\ntransmitted to you; and you will, upon your whole route, explain to\r\nthe Indians the advantages of vaccination, and endeavour to persuade\r\nthem to submit to the process. You will keep and report an account of\r\nthe number, ages, sex, tribe, and local situation of the Indians who\r\nmay be vaccinated, and also of the prevalence, from time to time, of\r\nthe small-pox among them, and of its effects as far as these can be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nThe following sums will be allowed for the expenses of the expedition,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n                                             Very respectfully,\r\n                                                 Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                     ELBERT HERRING.\r\n\r\n  HENRY R. SCHOOLCRAFT, Esq.,     }\r\n  Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie. }\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\n                                         _St. Peters, July 25, 1832._\r\n\r\n    GEN. JOSEPH M. STREET,        }\r\n  Indian Agent, Prairie du Chien. }\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI arrived at this place yesterday from the sources of the Mississippi,\r\nhaving visited the Chippewa bands and trading-posts in that quarter.\r\nMuch complaint is made respecting the conduct of the persons licensed\r\nby you last year, who located themselves at the Granite Rocks, and\r\non the St. Croix. No doubt can exist that each of them took in, and\r\nused in their trade, a considerable quantity of whiskey. And I am now\r\nenabled to say, that they each located themselves at points within the\r\nlimits of my agency, where there are no trading-posts established.\r\nMy lowest trading-post on the Mississippi, is the Pierced Prairie,\r\neighteen miles below the mouth of the De Corbeau. It embraces one mile\r\nsquare, upon which traders are required to be located. On the St.\r\nCroix, the posts established and confirmed by the Department are Snake\r\nRiver and Yellow River, and embrace each, as the permanent place of\r\nlocation, one mile square. I report these facts for your information,\r\nand not to enable you to grant licenses for these posts, as the\r\ninstructions of the Department give to each agent the exclusive control\r\nof the subject of granting licenses for the respective agencies.\r\n\r\nMuch solicitude is felt by me to exclude ardent spirits wholly from\r\nthe Chippewas and Ottowas, the latter of whom have, by a recent order,\r\nbeen placed under my charge. I am fully satisfied that ardent spirits\r\nare not necessary to the successful prosecution of the trade, that\r\nthey are deeply pernicious to the Indians, and that both their use and\r\nabuse is derogatory to the character of a wise and sober government.\r\nTheir exclusion in every shape, and every quantity, is an object of\r\nprimary moment; and it is an object which I feel it a duty to persevere\r\nin the attainment of, however traders may bluster. I feel a reasonable\r\nconfidence in stating, that no whiskey has been used in my agency\r\nduring the last two years, except the limited quantity taken by special\r\npermission of the Secretary of War, for the trade of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay\r\nlines; and saving also the quantity clandestinely introduced from\r\nPrairie du Chien and St. Peters.\r\n\r\nI know, sir, that an appeal to you on this subject cannot be lost, and\r\nthat your feelings and judgment fully approve of temperance measures.\r\nBut it requires active, persevering, unyielding efforts. And in all\r\nsuch efforts, judiciously urged, I am satisfied that the government\r\nwill sustain the agents in a dignified discharge of their duties. Let\r\nus proceed in the accomplishment of this object with firmness, and\r\nwith a determination never to relinquish it, until ardent spirits are\r\nentirely excluded from the Indian country.\r\n\r\n                                    I am sir,\r\n                                        Very respectfully,\r\n                                            Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                HENRY R. SCHOOLCRAFT.\r\n\r\nP.S. Capt. Jouett, commanding at this post, has recently seized\r\nsixteen kegs of high-wines. His prompt, decisive, and correct conduct\r\nin this, and other transactions relating to Indian affairs, merit the\r\napprobation of government.\r\n\r\nThe Petite Corbeau has requested that no trader may be located at the\r\nmonth of the St. Croix.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n  _Letter from the Secretary of War, transmitting, in obedience to\r\n    a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 24th ultimo,\r\n    information in relation to an expedition of Henry R.

Marie, October 1, 1831._\r\n\r\n  His Excellency GEORGE B. PORTER, _Governor of_   }\r\n  _Michigan, and Superintendent of Indian Affairs_.}\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have now the honor, through your intervention, to forward to the\r\nDepartment my report of the late tour through the Huron Territory.\r\nIt has not been possible to prepare the map referred to in season to\r\naccompany the report, but it will be forwarded as soon as it can be\r\ncompleted. In the mean time, I send a sketch of portions of the country\r\nintermediate between Lake Superior and the Mississippi, from which you\r\nwill be enabled to trace my particular route, and the location of the\r\nprincipal streams, lakes, and villages. The imperfect state of public\r\ninformation respecting the geography of this region, and the numerous\r\nerrors which still continue to characterize our maps, render something\r\nof this kind essential.\r\n\r\nWith the limited means assigned for the accomplishment of the object,\r\nit became necessary that every moment of time should be used in\r\npushing forward. This will account for the great space travelled in a\r\ncomparatively short time. I am of the opinion, however, that little\r\nor nothing has been lost from the efficacy of the movement by its\r\ncelerity. Lakes, rivers, and villages succeeded each other, with short\r\nintervals. But, in ascending each river, in crossing each lake and\r\nportage, the object of the expedition was definitely impressed upon the\r\nnatives who witnessed our progress; and it was acquiesced in by the\r\nchiefs and warriors, at the several councils which I held with them.\r\nFor a general detail of these councils, the report may be consulted.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that new topics for discussion arose from a\r\nrecent misunderstanding between the Chippewas and Menomonies; and from\r\nthe uncertainty as to the spot where the boundary line between the\r\nChippewas and Sioux strikes the falls on the Red Cedar fork, agreeably\r\nto a just construction of the treaty of Prairie du Chien of 1825. With\r\nrespect to the first, I am of opinion that time will only serve to\r\nincrease the difficulty of restoring a perfect understanding.\r\n\r\nThe line on the Red Cedar is important, as opposing an obstacle to a\r\nfirm peace between the Sioux and Chippewas; and I doubt whether any\r\nsteps could be taken by the government to induce them to live peaceably\r\nnear each other, with so little cost of time and money as the taking\r\npost, with a small military force, on the frontier in dispute, at some\r\nsuitable point between Prairie du Chien and St. Peters. With this\r\nimpression, I have brought the subject to the consideration of the\r\nSecretary of War; and I shall be gratified, if, on a review of it, you\r\nshall concur in opinion with,\r\n\r\n                                           Sir, very respectfully,\r\n                                               Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                   H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                No. 2.\r\n\r\n                                  _Sault Ste. Marie, Sept. 21, 1831._\r\n\r\n      To ELBERT HERRING, ESQ.                 }\r\n  _Office of Indian Affairs, War Department_. }\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nIn compliance with instructions to endeavour to terminate the\r\nhostilities between the Chippewas and Sioux, I proceeded into the\r\nChippewa country with thirteen men in two canoes, having the necessary\r\nprovisions and presents for the Indians, an interpreter, a physician\r\nto attend the sick, and a person in charge of the provisions and other\r\npublic property. The commanding officer of Fort Brady furnished me\r\nwith an escort of ten soldiers, under the command of a lieutenant;\r\nand I took with me a few Chippewas, in a canoe provided with oars, to\r\nconvey a part of the provisions. A flag was procured for each canoe. I\r\njoined the expedition at the head of the portage, at this place, on the\r\n25th of June; and, after visiting the Chippewa villages in the belt of\r\ncountry between Lake Superior and the Mississippi, in latitudes 44\xc2\xb0 to\r\n70\xc2\xb0, returned on the 4th of September, having been absent seventy-two\r\ndays, and travelled a line of country estimated to be two thousand\r\nthree hundred and eight miles. I have now the honor to report to you\r\nthe route pursued, the means employed to accomplish the object, and\r\nsuch further measures as appear to me to be necessary to give effect\r\nto what has been done, and to ensure a lasting peace between the two\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nReasons existed for not extending the visit to the Chippewa bands\r\non the extreme Upper Mississippi, on Red Lake, and Red River, and\r\nthe river De Corbeau. After entering Lake Superior, and traversing\r\nits southern shores to Point Chegoimegon and the adjacent cluster\r\nof islands, I ascended the Mauvaise River to a portage of 8\xc2\xbe miles\r\ninto the Kaginogumac or Long Water Lake. This lake is about eight\r\nmiles long, and of very irregular width. Thence, by a portage of 280\r\nyards, into Turtle Lake; thence, by a portage of 1,075 yards, into\r\nClary\xe2\x80\x99s Lake, so called; thence, by a portage of 425 yards, into Lake\r\nPolyganum; and thence, by a portage of 1,050 yards, into the Namakagon\r\nRiver, a branch of the river St. Croix of the Upper Mississippi. The\r\ndistance from Lake Superior to this spot is, by estimation, 124 miles.\r\n\r\nWe descended the Namakagon to the Pukwaewa, a rice lake, and a\r\nChippewa village of eight permanent lodges, containing a population\r\nof 53 persons, under a local chief called Odabossa. We found here\r\ngardens of corn, potatoes, and pumpkins, in a very neat state of\r\ncultivation. The low state of the water, and the consequent difficulty\r\nof the navigation, induced me to leave the provisions and stores at\r\nthis place, in charge of Mr. Woolsey, with directions to proceed (with\r\npart of the men, and the aid of the Indians) to _Lac Courtorielle_ or\r\nOttowa Lake, and there await my arrival. I then descended the Namakagon\r\nin a light canoe, to its discharge into the St. Croix, and down the\r\nlatter to Yellow River, the site of a trading-post and an Indian\r\nvillage, where I had, by runners, appointed a council. In this trip\r\nI was accompanied by Mr. Johnson, sub-agent, acting as interpreter,\r\nand by Dr. Houghton, adjunct professor of the Rensselaer school. We\r\nreached Yellow River on the 1st of August, and found the Indians\r\nassembled. After terminating the business of the council (of which I\r\nshall presently mention the results), I re-ascended the St. Croix and\r\nthe Namakagon to the portage which intervenes between the latter and\r\nLac Courtorielle. The first of the series of carrying-places is about\r\nthree miles in length, and terminates at the Lake of the Isles (_Lac\r\ndes Isles_); after crossing which, a portage of 750 yards leads to _Lac\r\ndu Gres_. This lake has a navigable outlet into Ottowa Lake, where I\r\nrejoined the advanced party (including Lieutenant Clary\xe2\x80\x99s detachment)\r\non the 5th of August.\r\n\r\nOttowa Lake is a considerable expanse of water, being about twelve\r\nmiles long, with irregular but elevated shores. A populous Chippewa\r\nvillage and a trading-post are located at its outlet, and a numerous\r\nIndian population subsists in the vicinity. It is situated in a\r\ndistrict of country which abounds in rice lakes, has a proportion of\r\nprairie or burnt land, caused by the ravages of fire, and, in addition\r\nto the small fur-bearing animals, has several of the deer species. It\r\noccupies, geographically, a central situation, being intermediate,\r\nand commanding the communications between the St. Croix and Chippewa\r\nRivers, and between Lake Superior and the Upper Mississippi. It is\r\non the great slope of land descending towards the latter, enjoys a\r\nclimate of comparative mildness, and yields, with fewer and shorter\r\nintervals of extreme want, the means of subsistence to a population\r\nwhich is still essentially erratic. These remarks apply, with some\r\nmodifications, to the entire range of country (within the latitudes\r\nmentioned) situated west and south of the high lands circumscribing the\r\nwaters of Lake Superior. The outlet of this Lake (Ottowa) is a fork of\r\nChippewa River, called Ottowa River.\r\n\r\nI had intended to proceed from this lake, either by following down\r\nthe Ottowa branch to its junction with the main Chippewa, and then\r\nascending the latter into _Lac du Flambeau_, or by descending the\r\nOttowa branch only to its junction with the North-West fork, called\r\nthe Ochasowa River; and, ascending the latter to a portage of sixty\r\n_pauses_, into the Chippewa River. By the latter route time and\r\ndistance would have been saved, and I should, in either way, have\r\nbeen enabled to proceed from _Lac du Flambeau_ to Green Bay by an\r\neasy communication into the Upper Ouisconsin, and from the latter\r\ninto the Menomonie River, or by Plover Portage into Wolf River. This\r\nwas the route I had designed to go on quitting Lake Superior; but, on\r\nconsulting my Indian maps, and obtaining at Ottowa Lake the best and\r\nmost recent information of the distance and the actual state of the\r\nwater, I found neither of the foregoing routes practicable, without\r\nextending my time so far as to exhaust my supplies. I was finally\r\ndetermined to relinquish the _Lac du Flambeau_ route, by learning\r\nthat the Indians of that place had dispersed, and by knowing that a\r\nconsiderable delay would be caused by reassembling them.\r\n\r\nThe homeward route by the Mississippi was now the most eligible,\r\nparticularly as it would carry me through a portion of country occupied\r\nby the Chippewas, in a state of hostility with the Sioux, and cross the\r\ndisputed line at the mill. Two routes, to arrive at the Mississippi,\r\nwere before me\xe2\x80\x94either to follow down the outlet of Ottowa Lake to its\r\njunction with the Chippewa, and ascend the latter to its mouth, or\r\nto quit the Ottowa Lake branch at an intermediate point, and, after\r\nascending a small and very serpentine tributary, to cross a portage of\r\n6,000 yards into Lake Chetac. I pursued the latter route.\r\n\r\nLake Chetac is a sheet of water about six miles in length, and it has\r\nseveral islands, on one of which is a small Chippewa village and a\r\ntrading-post. This lake is the main source of Red Cedar River (called\r\nsometimes the _Folle Avoine_), a branch of the Chippewa River. It\r\nreceives a brook at its head from the direction of the portage, which\r\nadmits empty canoes to be conveyed down it two _pauses_, but is then\r\nobstructed with logs. It is connected by a shallow outlet with Weegwos\r\nLake, a small expanse which we crossed with paddles in twenty-five\r\nminutes. The passage from the latter is so shallow, that a portage of\r\n1,295 yards is made into Balsam of Fir or _Sapin_ Lake. The baggage\r\nis carried this distance, but the canoes are brought through the\r\nstream. Sapin Lake is also small; we were thirty minutes in crossing\r\nit. Below this point, the river again expands into a beautiful sheet\r\nof water, called Red Cedar Lake, which we were an hour in passing; and\r\nafterward into _Bois Francois_, or Rice Lake. At the latter place,\r\nat the distance of perhaps sixty miles from its head, I found the\r\nlast fixed village of Chippewas on this stream, although the hunting\r\ncamps, and other signs of temporary occupation, were more numerous\r\nbelow than on any other part of the stream. This may be attributed to\r\nthe abundance of the Virginia deer in that vicinity, many of which we\r\nsaw, and of the elk and moose, whose tracks were fresh and numerous\r\nin the sands of the shore. Wild rice is found in all the lakes. Game,\r\nof every species common to the latitude, is plentiful. The prairie\r\ncountry extends itself into the vicinity of Rice Lake; and for more\r\nthan a day\xe2\x80\x99s march before reaching the mouth of the river, the whole\r\nface of the country puts on a sylvan character, as beautiful to the eye\r\nas it is fertile in soil, and spontaneously productive of the means of\r\nsubsistence. A country more valuable to a population having the habits\r\nof our North-Western Indians, could hardly be conceived of; and it is\r\ntherefore cause of less surprise that its possession should have been\r\nso long an object of contention between the Chippewas and Sioux.\r\n\r\nAbout sixty miles below Rice Lake commences a series of rapids, which\r\nextend, with short intervals, 24 miles. The remainder of the distance,\r\nto the junction of this stream with the Chippewa, consists of deep\r\nand strong water. The junction itself is characterized by commanding\r\nand elevated grounds, and a noble expanse of waters. And the Chippewa\r\nRiver, from this spot to its entrance into the Mississippi, has a depth\r\nand volume, and a prominence of scenery, which mark it to be inferior\r\nto none, and superior to most of the larger tributaries of the Upper\r\nMississippi. Before its junction, it is separated into several mouths,\r\nfrom the principal of which the observer can look into Lake Pepin.\r\nSteamboats could probably ascend to the falls.\r\n\r\nThe whole distance travelled, from the shores of Lake Superior to\r\nthe mouth of the Chippewa, is, by estimation, 643 miles, of which\r\n138 should be deducted for the trip to Yellow River, leaving the\r\ndirect practicable route 505 miles. The length of the Mauvaise to the\r\nportage is 104; of the Namakagon, from the portage, 161; of the Red\r\nCedar, 170; of the Chippewa, from the entrance of the latter, 40. Our\r\nmeans of estimating distances was by time, corrected by reference to\r\nthe rapidity of water and strength of wind, compared with our known\r\nvelocity of travelling in calm weather on the lakes. These estimates\r\nwere made and put down every evening, and considerable confidence is\r\nfelt in them. The courses were accurately kept by a canoe compass. I\r\nillustrate my report of this part of the route by a map protracted\r\nby Dr. Houghton. On this map our places of encampment, the sites and\r\npopulation of the principal Indian villages, the trading-posts, and the\r\nboundary lines between the Sioux and Chippewa, are indicated. And I\r\nrefer you to it for several details which are omitted in this report.\r\n\r\nThe present state of the controversy between the Sioux and the\r\nChippewas will be best inferred from the facts that follow. In\r\nstating them, I have deemed it essential to preserve the order of my\r\nconferences with the Indians, and to confine myself, almost wholly, to\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nAlong the borders of Lake Superior, comparatively little alarm was\r\nfelt from the hostile relation with the Sioux. But I found them well\r\ninformed of the state of the difficulties, and the result of the\r\nseveral war-parties that had been sent out the last year. A system of\r\ninformation and advice is constantly kept up by runners; and there is\r\nno movement meditated on the Sioux borders, which is not known and\r\ncanvassed by the lake bands.\r\n\r\nThey sent warriors to the scene of conflict last year, in consequence\r\nof the murder committed by the Sioux on the St. Croix. Their sufferings\r\nfrom hunger during the winter, and the existence of disease at Torch\r\nLake (_Lac du Flambeau_), and some other places, together with the\r\nentire failure of the rice crop, had produced effects, which were\r\ndepicted by them and by the traders in striking colours. They made\r\nthese sufferings the basis of frequent and urgent requests for\r\nprovisions. This theme was strenuously dwelt upon. Whatever other gifts\r\nthey asked for, they never omitted the gift of food. They made it their\r\nfirst, their second, and their third request.\r\n\r\nAt Chegoimegon, on Lake Superior (or La Pointe, emphatically so\r\ncalled), I held my first and stated council with the Indians. This is\r\nthe ancient seat of the Chippewa power in this quarter. It is a central\r\nand commanding point, with respect to the country lying north, and\r\nwest, and south of it. It appears to be the focus from which, as radii\r\nfrom a centre, the ancient population emigrated; and the interior bands\r\nconsequently look back to it with something of the feelings of parental\r\nrelation. News from the frontiers flies back to it with a celerity\r\nwhich is peculiar to the Indian mode of express. I found here, as I\r\nhad expected, the fullest and most recent information from the lines.\r\nMozojeed, the principal man at Ottawa Lake, had recently visited them\r\nfor the purpose of consultation; but returned on the alarm of an attack\r\nupon his village.\r\n\r\nThe Indians listened with attention to the message transmitted to them\r\nfrom the President, and to the statements with which it was enforced.\r\nPezhickee, the venerable and respected chief of the place, was their\r\nspeaker in reply. He lamented the war, and admitted the folly of\r\nkeeping it up; but it was carried on by the Chippewas in self-defence,\r\nand by volunteer parties of young men, acting without the sanction\r\nof the old chiefs. He thought the same remark due to the elder Sioux\r\nchiefs, who probably did not sanction the crossing of the lines, but\r\ncould not restrain their young men. He lived, he said, in an isolated\r\nsituation, did not mingle in the interior broils, and did not deem\r\nhimself responsible for acts done out of his own village, and certainly\r\nnot for the acts of the villages of Torch Lake, Ottawa Lake, and the\r\nSt. Croix. He had uniformly advised his people to sit still and remain\r\nat peace, and he believed that none of his young men had joined the\r\nwar-parties of last year. The government, he said, should have his\r\nhearty co-operation in restoring peace. He referred to the sub-agency\r\nestablished here in 1826, spoke of its benefits, and wished to know why\r\nthe agent had been withdrawn, and whether he would be instructed to\r\nreturn? In the course of his reply, he said, that formerly, when the\r\nIndians lived under the British government, they were usually told what\r\nto do, and in very distinct terms. But they were now at a loss. From\r\nwhat had been said and done at the treaty of Fond du Lac, he expected\r\nthe care and protection of the American government, and that they\r\nwould advance towards, instead of (as in the case of the sub-agency)\r\nwithdrawing from them. He was rather at a loss for our views respecting\r\nthe Chippewas, and he wished much for my advice in their affairs.\r\n\r\nI thought it requisite to make a distinct reply to this point. I\r\ntold him that when they lived under the British Government, they\r\nwere justified in shaping their course according to the advice they\r\nreceived; but that, on the transfer of the country, their allegiance\r\nwas transferred with it. And when our government hoisted its flag\r\nat Mackinac (1796), it expected from the Indians living within our\r\nboundaries the respect due to it; and it acknowledged, at the same\r\ntime, the reciprocal obligations of care and protection. That it always\r\naimed to fulfil these obligations, of which facts within his own\r\nknowledge and memory would afford ample proofs. I referred him to the\r\nseveral efforts the government had made to establish a lasting peace\r\nbetween the Chippewas and Sioux; for which purpose the President had\r\nsent one of his principal men (alluding to Gov. Cass), in 1820, who\r\nhad visited their most extreme north-western villages, and induced\r\nthemselves and the Sioux to smoke the pipe of peace together at St.\r\nPeters. In accordance with these views, and acting on the information\r\nthen acquired, the President had established an agency for their\r\ntribe at Sault Ste. Marie, in 1822. That, in 1825, he had assembled\r\nat Prairie du Chien all the tribes who were at variance on the Upper\r\nMississippi, and persuaded them to make peace, and, as one of the best\r\nmeans of ensuring its permanency, had fixed the boundaries of their\r\nlands. Seeing that the Chippewas and Sioux still continued a harassing\r\nand useless contest, he had sent me to remind them of this peace and\r\nthese boundaries, which, I added. you, Perikee, yourself agreed to, and\r\nsigned, in my presence. I come to bring you back to the terms of this\r\ntreaty. Are not these proofs of his care and attention? Are not these\r\nclear indications of his views respecting the Chippewas? The chief was\r\nevidently affected by this recital. The truth appeared to strike him\r\nforcibly; and he said, in a short reply. that he was now _advised_;\r\nthat he would hereafter feel himself to be advised, &c. He made some\r\nremarks on the establishment of a mission school. &c., which, being\r\nirrelevant, are omitted. He presented a pipe, with an ornamented stem.\r\nas a token of his friendship, and his desire of peace.\r\n\r\nI requested him to furnish messengers to take belts of wampum and\r\ntobacco, with three separate messages, viz. to Yellow River, to Ottawa\r\nLake, and to Lac du Flambeau, or Torch Lake; and also, as the water\r\nwas low, to aid me in the ascent of the Mauvaise River. and to supply\r\nguides for each of the military canoes, as the soldiers would here\r\nleave their barge, and were unacquainted with the difficulties of\r\nthe ascent. He accordingly sent his oldest son (Che-che-gwy-ung) and\r\nanother person, with the messages, by a direct trail. leading into the\r\nSt. Croix country. He also furnished several young Chippewas to aid\r\nus on the Mauvaise, and to carry baggage on the long portage into the\r\nfirst intermediate lake west of that stream.\r\n\r\nAfter the distribution of presents, I left Chegoimegon on the 18th\r\nJuly. The first party of Indians met at the Namakagon, belonging to a\r\nChippewa village called Pukwaewa, having, as its geographical centre\r\nand trading-post, Ottowa Lake. As I had directed part of the expedition\r\nto precede me there, during my journey to Yellow River, I requested\r\nthese Indians to meet me at Ottowa Lake, and assist in conveying the\r\nstores and provisions to that place\xe2\x80\x94a service which they cheerfully\r\nperformed. On ascending the lower part of the Namakagon, I learned that\r\nmy messenger from Lake Superior had passed, and on reaching Yellow\r\nRiver, I found the Indians assembled and waiting. They were encamped\r\non an elevated ridge, called Pekogunagun, or the Hip Bone, and fired\r\na salute from its summit. Several of the neighbouring Indians came in\r\nafter my arrival. Others, with their chiefs, were hourly expected. I\r\ndid not deem it necessary for all to come in, but proceeded to lay\r\nbefore them the objects of my visit, and to solicit their co-operation\r\nin an attempt to make a permanent peace with the Sioux, whose borders\r\nwe then were near. Kabamappa, the principal chief, not being a speaker,\r\nresponded to my statements and recommendations through another person\r\n(Sha-ne-wa-gwun-ai-be). He said that the Sioux were of bad faith;\r\nthat they never refused to smoke the pipe of peace with them, and\r\nthey never failed to violate the promise of peace thus solemnly made.\r\nHe referred to an attack they made last year on a band of Chippewas\r\nand half-breeds, and the murder of four persons. Perpetual vigilance\r\nwas required to meet these inroads. Yet he could assert, fearlessly,\r\nthat no Chippewa war-party from the St. Croix had crossed the Sioux\r\nline for years; that the murder he had mentioned was committed within\r\nthe Chippewa lines; and although it was said at the treaty of Prairie\r\ndu Chien that the first aggressor of territorial rights should be\r\npunished, neither punishment was inflicted by the government, nor had\r\nany atonement or apology thus far been made for this act by the Sioux.\r\nHe said his influence had been exerted in favour of peace; that he had\r\nuniformly advised both chiefs and warriors to this effect; and he stood\r\nready now to do whatever it was reasonable he should do on the subject.\r\n\r\nI told him it was not a question of recrimination that was before us.\r\nIt was not even necessary to go into the inquiry of who had spilt the\r\nfirst blood since the treaty of Prairie du Chien. The treaty had been\r\nviolated. The lines had been crossed. Murders had been committed by\r\nthe Chippewas and by the Sioux. These murders had reached the ears of\r\nthe President, and he was resolved to put a stop to them. I did not\r\ndoubt but that the advice of the old chiefs, on each side, had been\r\npacific. I did not doubt but that his course had been _particularly_\r\nso. But rash young men, of each party, had raised the war-club; and\r\nwhen they could not go openly, they went secretly. A stop must be put\r\nto this course, and it was necessary the first movement should be\r\nmade _somewhere_. It was proper it should be made here, and be made\r\nat this time. Nothing could be lost by it; much might be gained; and\r\nif a negotiation was opened with the Sioux chiefs while I remained, I\r\nwould second it by sending an explanatory message to the chiefs and to\r\ntheir agent. I recommended that Kabamappa and Shakoba, the war-chief\r\nof Snake River, should send jointly wampum and tobacco to the Petite\r\nCorbeau and to Wabisha, the leading Sioux chiefs on the Mississippi,\r\ninviting them to renew the league of friendship, and protesting their\r\nown sincerity in the offer. I concluded, by presenting him with a flag,\r\ntobacco, wampum, and ribands, to be used in the negotiation. After a\r\nconsultation, he said he would not only send the messages, but, as he\r\nnow had the protection of a flag, he would himself go with the chief\r\nShakoba to the Petite Corbeau\xe2\x80\x99s village. I accompanied these renewed\r\noffers of peace with explanatory messages, in my own name, to Petite\r\nCorbeau and to Wabisha, and a letter to Mr. Taliaferro, the Indian\r\nagent at St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s, informing him of these steps, and soliciting his\r\nco-operation. A copy of this letter is hereunto annexed. I closed the\r\ncouncil by the distribution of presents; after which the Indians called\r\nmy attention to the conduct of their trader, &c.\r\n\r\nInformation was given me immediately after my arrival at Yellow River,\r\nthat Neenaba, a popular war-leader from the Red Cedar fork of Chippewa\r\nRiver, had very recently danced the war-dance with thirty men at Rice\r\nLake of Yellow River, and that his object was to enlist the young men\r\nof that place in a war-party against the Sioux. I also learned that my\r\nmessage for Ottowa Lake had been promptly transmitted through Neenaba,\r\nwhom I was now anxious to see. I lost not an hour in re-ascending the\r\nSt. Croix and the Namakagon. I purchased two additional canoes of\r\nthe Indians, and distributed my men in them, to lighten the draught\r\nof water, and facilitate the ascent; and, by pushing early and late,\r\nwe reached Ottowa Lake on the fifth day in the morning. Neenaba had,\r\nhowever, delivered his message, and departed. I was received in a very\r\nfriendly and welcome manner, by Mozojeed, of the band of Ottowa Lake;\r\nWabezhais, of the Red Devil\xe2\x80\x99s band of the South Pukwaewa; and Odabossa,\r\nof the Upper Namakagon. After passing the usual formalities, I prepared\r\nto meet them in council the same day, and communicate to them the\r\nobjects of my mission.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the conference at this place, I obtained the\r\nparticulars of a dispute which had arisen between the Chippewas of this\r\nquarter, which now added to their alarm, as they feared the latter\r\nwould act in coincidence with their ancient enemies, the Sioux. The\r\nreports of this disturbance had reached me at the Sault, and they\r\ncontinued, with some variations, until my arrival here. The following\r\nare the material facts in relation to this new cause of disquietude: In\r\nthe summer of 1827, Okunzhewug, an old woman, the wife of Kishkemun,\r\nthe principal chief of Torch Lake, a man superannuated and blind;\r\nattended the treaty of Butte des Morts, bearing her husband\xe2\x80\x99s medal.\r\nShe was treated with the respect due to the character she represented,\r\nand ample presents were directed to be given to her; among other\r\nthings a handsome hat. The latter article had been requested of her\r\nby a young Menomonie, and refused. It is thought a general feeling\r\nof jealousy was excited by her good reception. A number of the\r\nMenomonies went on her return route as far as the Clover Portage,\r\nwhere she was last seen. Having never returned to her village, the\r\nChippewas attributed her death to the Menomonies. Her husband died\r\nsoon after; but she had numerous and influential relatives to avenge\r\nher real or supposed murder. This is the account delivered by the\r\nChippewas, and it is corroborated by reports from the traders of that\r\nsection of the country. Her singular disappearance and secret death\r\nat the Clover Portage, is undisputed; and whether caused or not by\r\nany agency of the Menomonies, the belief of such agency, and that of\r\nthe most direct kind, is fixed in the minds of the Chippewas, and\r\nhas furnished the basis of their subsequent acts in relation to the\r\nMenomonie hunting-parties who have visited the lower part of Chippewa\r\nRiver. Two women belonging to one of these parties were killed by a\r\nChippewa war-party traversing that part of the country the ensuing\r\nyear. The act was disclaimed by them as not being intentional, and\r\nit was declared they supposed the women to be Sioux.[35] On a close\r\ninquiry, however, I found the persons who committed this act were\r\nrelatives of Okunzewug, which renders it probable that the murder was\r\nintentionally perpetrated. This act further widened the breach between\r\nthe two hitherto fraternal tribes; and the Chippewas of this quarter\r\nbegan to regard the Menomonie hunting-parties, who entered the mouth\r\nof the Chippewa River, as intruders on their lands. Among a people\r\nwhose means of verbal information is speedy, and whose natural sense of\r\nright and wrong is acute, the more than usual friendship and apparent\r\nalliance which have taken place between the Menomonies and Sioux, in\r\nthe contest between the Sacs and Foxes, and the murder by them jointly\r\nof the Fox chief White Skin and his companions at a smoking council,\r\nin 1830, have operated to increase the feeling of distrust; so much\r\nso, that it was openly reported at Chegoimegon, at Yellow River, and\r\nOttowa Lake, that the Menomonies had formed a league with the Sioux\r\nagainst the Chippewas also, and they were fearful of an attack from\r\nthem. A circumstance that had given point to this fear, and made it\r\na subject of absorbing interest, when I arrived at Ottowa Lake, was\r\nthe recent murder of a Menomonie chief by a Chippewa of that quarter,\r\nand the demand of satisfaction which had been made (it was sometimes\r\nsaid) by the Indian agent at Prairie du Chien, and sometimes by the\r\ncommanding officer, with a threat to march troops into the country.\r\nThis demand, I afterward learned from the Indians at Rice Lake, and\r\nfrom a conversation with General Street, the agent at Prairie du Chien,\r\nhad not been made, either by himself or by the commanding officer;\r\nand the report had probably arisen from a conversation held by a\r\nsubaltern officer in command of a wood or timber-party near the mouth\r\nof the Chippewa River, with some Chippewas who were casually met. Its\r\neffects, however, were to alarm them, and to lead them to desire a\r\nreconciliation with the Menomonies. I requested them to lose no time\r\nin sending tobacco to the Menomonies, and adjusting this difference.\r\nMozojeed observed that the murder of the Menomonie had been committed\r\nby a person _non compos_, and he deplored the folly of it, and\r\ndisclaimed all agency in it for himself and his band. The murderer, I\r\nbelieve, belonged to his band; he desired a reconciliation. He also\r\nsaid the measures adopted at Yellow River, to bring about a firm peace\r\nwith the Sioux, had his fullest approbation, and that nothing on his\r\npart should be wanting to promote a result in every view so wise and so\r\nadvantageous to the Indians. In this sentiment, Wabezhais and Odabossa,\r\nwho made distinct speeches, also concurred. They confirmed their words\r\nby pipes, and all the assembly made an audible assent. I invested\r\nMozojeed with a flag and a medal, that he might exert the influence\r\nhe has acquired among the Indians beneficially for them and for us,\r\nand that his hands might thus be officially strengthened to accomplish\r\nthe work of pacification. I then distributed presents to the chiefs,\r\nwarriors, women, and children, in the order of their being seated, and\r\nimmediately embarked, leaving them under a lively and enlivened sense\r\nof the good-will and friendship of the American government, on this\r\nfirst official visit to them, and with a sincere disposition, so far as\r\ncould be judged, to act in obedience to its expressed and known wishes.\r\n\r\nThe Indians at Torch Lake being dispersed, and my message to them\r\nnot having been delivered, from this uncertainty of their location,\r\nI should have found reasons for not proceeding in that direction,\r\nindependent of the actual and known difficulties of the route at that\r\ntime. I was still apprehensive that my appearance had not wholly\r\ndisconcerted the war-party of Neenaba, and lost no time in proceeding\r\nto his village on the Red Cedar fork. We found the village at Lake\r\nChetac, which in 1824 was 217 strong, almost totally deserted, and the\r\ntrading-house burnt. Scattering Indians were found along the river. The\r\nmutual fear of interruption was such that Mr. B. Cadotte, sen., the\r\ntrader at Ottowa Lake, thought it advisable to follow in our train for\r\nthe purpose of collecting his credits at Rice Lake.\r\n\r\nWhile at breakfast on the banks of Sapin Lake, a returning war-party\r\nentered the opposite side of it: they were evidently surprised, and\r\nthey stopped. After reconnoitring us, they were encouraged to advance,\r\nat first warily, and afterward with confidence. There were eight\r\ncanoes, with two men in each; each man had a gun, war-club, knife,\r\nand ammunition bag: there was nothing else except the apparatus for\r\nmanaging the canoe. They were all young men, and belonged to the\r\nvicinity of Ottowa Lake. Their unexpected appearance at this place gave\r\nme the first information that the war-party at Neenaba had been broken\r\nup. They reported that some of their number had been near the mill,\r\nand that they had discovered signs of the Sioux being out in the moose\r\nhaving been driven up, &c. In a short conference, I recited to them\r\nthe purpose of the council at Ottowa Lake, and referred them to their\r\nchiefs for particulars, enjoining their acquiescence in the proposed\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nI found at Rice Lake a band of Chippewas, most of them young men,\r\nhaving a prompt and martial air, encamped in a very compact form, and\r\nprepared, at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice, for action. They saluted our advance\r\nwith a smartness and precision of firing that would have done honour\r\nto drilled troops. Neenaba was absent on a hunting-party; but one of\r\nthe elder men pointed out a suitable place for my encampment, as I\r\nintended here to put new bottoms to my bark canoes. He arrived in the\r\nevening, and visited my camp with forty-two men. This visit was one of\r\nceremony merely; as it was late, I deferred any thing further until the\r\nfollowing day. I remained at this place part of the 7th, the 8th, and\r\nuntil 3 o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the 9th of August. And the following facts present\r\nthe result of several conferences with this distinguished young man,\r\nwhose influence is entirely of his own creation, and whose endowments,\r\npersonal and mental, had not been misrepresented by the Indians on my\r\nroute, who uniformly spoke of him in favourable terms. He is located\r\nat the most advanced point towards the Sioux borders, and, although\r\nnot in the line of ancient chiefs, upon him rests essentially the\r\nconduct of affairs in this quarter. I therefore deemed it important\r\nto acquire his confidence and secure his influence, and held frequent\r\nconversations with him. His manner was frank and bold, equally free\r\nfrom servility and repulsiveness. I drew his attention to several\r\nsubjects. I asked him whether the sawmill on the lower part of the Red\r\nCedar was located on Chippewa lands? He said, Yes. Whether it was built\r\nwith the consent of the Chippewas? He said, No; it had been built, as\r\nit were, by stealth. I asked him if any thing had been subsequently\r\ngiven them in acknowledgment of their right to the soil? He said,\r\nNo; that the only acknowledgment was their getting tobacco to smoke\r\nwhen they visited the mill: that the Sioux claimed it to be on their\r\nside of the line, but the Chippewas contended that their line ran to\r\na certain bluff and brook below the mill. I asked him to draw a map\r\nof the lower part of Chippewa River, with all its branches, showing\r\nthe exact lines as fixed by the treaty at Prairie du Chien, and as\r\nunderstood by them. I requested him to state the facts respecting the\r\nmurder of the Menomonie, and the causes that led to it; and whether he\r\nor any of his band received any message from the agent or commanding\r\nofficer at Prairie du Chien, demanding the surrender of the murderer?\r\nTo the latter inquiry he answered promptly, No. He gave in his\r\nactual population at 142; but it is evident that a very considerable\r\nadditional population, particularly in men, resort there for the\r\npurpose of hunting a part of the year.\r\n\r\nThe day after my arrival, I prepared for and summoned the Indians to\r\na council, with the usual formalities. I opened it by announcing the\r\nobjects of my visit. Neenaba and his followers listened to the terms\r\nof the message, the means I had adopted to enforce it, and, finally,\r\nto the request of co-operation on the part of himself and band, with\r\nstrict attention. He confined his reply to an expression of thanks;\r\nallusions to the peculiarity of his situation on an exposed frontier;\r\nand general sentiments of friendship. He appeared to be mentally\r\nembarrassed by my request to drop the war-club, on the successful use\r\nof which he had relied for his popularity, and whatever of real power\r\nhe possessed. He often referred to his young men, over whom he claimed\r\nno superiority, and who appeared to be ardently attached to him. I\r\nurged the principal topic upon his attention, presenting it in several\r\nlights. I finally conferred on him, personally, a medal and flag, and\r\ndirected the presents intended for his band to be laid, in gross,\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, Neenaba got up, and spoke to the question, connecting\r\nit with obvious considerations, of which mutual rights, personal\r\nsafety, and the obligation to protect the women and children, formed\r\nthe basis. The latter duty was not a slight one. Last year the Sioux\r\nhad killed a chief on the opposite shore of the lake, and, at the same\r\ntime, decoyed two children, who were in a canoe, among the rice, and\r\nkilled and beheaded them. He said, in allusion to the medal and flag,\r\nthat these marks of honour were not necessary to secure his attention\r\nto any requests made by the American government. And after resuming\r\nhis seat awhile (during which he overheard some remarks not pleasing\r\nto him, from an Indian on the opposite side of the ring), he finally\r\ngot up and declined receiving them until they were eventually pressed\r\nupon him by the young warriors. Every thing appeared to proceed with\r\ngreat harmony, and the presents were quickly distributed by one of\r\nhis men. It was not, however, until the next day, when my canoes were\r\nalready put in the water, that he came with his entire party, to make\r\nhis final reply, and to present the peace-pipe. He had thrown the\r\nflag over one arm, and held the war-club perpendicular in the other\r\nhand. He said, that although he accepted the one, he did not drop the\r\nother; he held fast to both. When he looked at the one, he should\r\nrevert to the counsels with which it had been given, and he should aim\r\nto act upon those counsels; but he also deemed it necessary to hold\r\nfast the war-club; it was, however, with a determination to use it\r\nin defence, and not in attack. He had reflected upon the advice sent\r\nto the Chippewas by the President, and particularly that part of it\r\nwhich counselled them to sit still upon their lands; but while they\r\nsat still, they also wished to be certain that their enemies would\r\nsit still. And the pipe he was now about to offer, he offered with a\r\nrequest that it might be sent to the President, asking him to use his\r\npower to prevent the Sioux from crossing the lines. The pipe was then\r\nlit, handed round, the ashes knocked out, and a formal presentation\r\nof it made. This ceremony being ended, I shook hands with them, and\r\nimmediately embarked.\r\n\r\nOn the second day afterward, I reached the sawmill, the subject of\r\nsuch frequent allusion, and landed there at 7 o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\r\nI found a Mr. Wallace in charge, who was employed, with ten men, in\r\nbuilding a new dam on a brook of the Red Cedar, the freshet of last\r\nspring having carried away the former one. I inquired of him where the\r\nline between the Sioux and Chippewas crossed. He replied that the line\r\ncrossed above the mill, he did not precisely know the place; adding,\r\nhowever, in the course of conversation, that he believed the land in\r\nthis vicinity originally belonged to the Chippewas. He said it was\r\nseven years since any Sioux had visited the mill; and that the latter\r\nwas owned by persons at Prairie du Chien.\r\n\r\nThe rapids of the Red Cedar River extend (according to the estimates\r\ncontained in my notes) about twenty-four miles. They commence a few\r\nmiles below the junction of Meadow River, and terminate about two\r\nmiles below the mills. This extension of falling water, referred to\r\nin the treaty as a fixed point, has led to the existing uncertainty.\r\nThe country itself is of a highly valuable character for its soil,\r\nits game, its wild rice, and its wood. We found the butter-nut among\r\nthose species which are locally included under the name of _Bois\r\nfranc_ by the traders. The land can, hereafter, be easily brought\r\ninto cultivation, as it is interspersed with prairie; and its fine\r\nmill privileges will add to its value. Indeed, one mile square is\r\nintrinsically worth one hundred miles square of Chippewa country, in\r\nsome other places.\r\n\r\nThe present sawmills (there are two), are situated 65 miles from\r\nthe banks of the Mississippi. They are owned exclusively by private\r\ncitizens, and employed for their sole benefit. The boards are formed\r\ninto rafts: and these rafts are afterward attached together, and\r\nfloated down the Mississippi to St. Louis, where they command a good\r\nprice. The business is understood to be a profitable one. For the\r\nprivilege, no equivalent has been paid either to the Indians or to the\r\nUnited States. The first mill was built several years ago, and before\r\nthe conclusion of the treaty of Prairie du Chien, fixing boundaries to\r\nthe lands. A permit was given for building, either verbal or written,\r\nas I have been informed, by a former commanding officer at Prairie\r\ndu Chien. I make these statements in reference to a letter I have\r\nreceived from the Department since my return, but which is dated June\r\n27th, containing a complaint of one of the owners of the mill, that\r\nthe Chippewas had threatened to burn it, and requesting me to take the\r\nnecessary precautionary measures. I heard nothing of such a threat, but\r\nbelieve that the respect which the Chippewas have professed, through\r\nme, for the American government, and the influence of my visit among\r\nthem, will prevent a resort to any measures of violence; and that they\r\nwill wait the peaceable adjustment of the line on the rapids. I will\r\nadd, that _wherever_ that line may be determined, in a reasonable\r\nprobability, to fall, the mill itself cannot be supplied with logs for\r\nany length of time, if _it is now so supplied_, without cutting them on\r\nChippewa lands, and rafting them down the Red Cedar. Many of the logs\r\nheretofore sawed at this mill, have been rafted, _up stream_, to the\r\nmill. And I understood from the person in charge of it, that he was now\r\nanxious to ascertain new sites for chopping; that his expectations were\r\ndirected up the stream, but that his actual knowledge of the country,\r\nin that direction, did not embrace a circumference of more than five\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe line between the Chippewa and Sioux, as drawn on the MS. map of\r\nNeenaba, strikes the rapids on Red Cedar River at a brook and bluff a\r\nshort distance below the mill. It proceeds thence, across the point\r\nof land between that branch of the main Chippewa, to an island in the\r\nlatter; and thence, up stream, to the mouth of Clearwater River, as\r\ncalled for by the treaty, and from this point to the bluffs of the\r\nMississippi valley (where it corners on Winnebago land), on Black\r\nRiver, and not to the \xe2\x80\x9c_mouth_\xe2\x80\x9d of Black River, as erroneously inserted\r\nin the 5th article of the treaty; the Chippewas never having advanced\r\nany claims to the lands at the mouth of Black River. This map, being\r\ndrawn by a Chippewa of sense, influence, and respectability, an exact\r\ncopy of it is herewith forwarded for the use of the Department, as\r\nembracing the opinions of the Chippewas on this point. The lines and\r\ngeographical marks were drawn on paper by Neenaba himself, and the\r\nnames translated and written down by Mr. Johnston.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the adjustment of this line must precede a\r\npermanent peace on this part of the frontiers. The number of Chippewas\r\nparticularly interested in it is, from my notes, 2,102; to which,\r\n911 may be added for certain bands on Lake Superior. It embraces 27\r\nvillages, and the most influential civil and war chiefs of the region.\r\nThe population is enterprising and warlike. They have the means of\r\nsubsistence in _comparative_ abundance. They are increasing in numbers.\r\nThey command a ready access to the Mississippi by water, and a ready\r\nreturn from it by land. Habits of association have taught them to look\r\nupon this stream as the theatre of war. Their young men are carried\r\ninto it as the natural and almost only means of distinction. And it\r\nis in coincidence with all observation, to say that they are now, as\r\nthey were in the days of Captain Carver, the terror of the east bank of\r\nthis river, between the St. Croix and Chippewa Rivers. No other tribe\r\nhas now, or has had, within the memory of man, a village or permanent\r\npossession on this part of the shore. It is landed on in fear. It is\r\noften passed by other nations by stealth, and at night. Such is not\r\nan exaggerated picture. And with a knowledge of their geographical\r\nadvantages, and numbers, and distribution, on the tributary streams,\r\nslight causes, it may be imagined, will often excite the young and\r\nthoughtless portion of them to raise the war-club, to chant the\r\nwar-song, and follow the war-path.\r\n\r\nTo remove these causes, to teach them the folly of such a contest,\r\nto remind them of the treaty stipulations and promises solemnly made\r\nto the government and to the Sioux, and to induce them to renew those\r\npromises, and to act on fixed principles of political faith, were\r\nthe primary objects committed to me; and they were certainly objects\r\nof exalted attainment, according as well with the character of the\r\ngovernment as with the spirit and moral and intellectual tone of the\r\nage. To these objects I have faithfully, as I believe, devoted the\r\nmeans at my command. And the Chippewas cannot, hereafter, err on the\r\nsubject of their hostilities with the Sioux, without knowing that the\r\nerror is disapproved by the American government, and that a continuance\r\nin it will be visited upon them in measures of severity.\r\n\r\nWithout indulging the expectation that my influence on the tour will\r\nhave the effect to put an end to the spirit of predatory warfare, it\r\nmay be asserted that this spirit has been checked and allayed; and\r\nthat a state of feeling and reflection has been produced by it, which\r\ncannot fail to be beneficial to our relations with them, and to their\r\nrelations with each other. The messages sent to the Sioux chiefs, may\r\nbe anticipated to have resulted in restoring a perfect peace during the\r\npresent fall and ensuing winter, and will thus leave to each party the\r\nundisturbed chase of their lands. The meditated blow of Steenaba was\r\nturned aside, and his war-party arrested and dispersed at the moment it\r\nwas ready to proceed. Every argument was used to show them the folly\r\nand the insecurity of a continuance of the war. And the whole tenor and\r\neffect of my visit has been to inform and reform these remote bands.\r\nIt has destroyed the charm of their seclusion. It has taught them that\r\ntheir conduct is under the supervision of the American government;\r\nthat they depend on its care and protection; that no other government\r\nhas power to regulate trade and send traders among them; finally, that\r\nan adherence to foreign counsels, and to antipacific maxims, can be\r\nvisited upon them in measures of coercion. That their country, hitherto\r\ndeemed nearly inaccessible, can be penetrated and traversed by men and\r\ntroops, with baggage and provisions, even in midsummer, when the waters\r\nare lowest; and that, in proportion as they comply with political\r\nmaxims, as benevolent as they are just, will they live at peace with\r\ntheir enemies, and have the means of subsistence for an increased\r\npopulation among themselves. The conduct of the traders in this\r\nquarter, and the influence they have exerted, both moral and political,\r\ncannot here be entered upon, and must be left to some other occasion,\r\ntogether with statistical details and other branches of information not\r\narising from particular instructions.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the Indians upon the St. Croix and Chippewa\r\nRivers, and their numerous branches, have been drawn into a close\r\nintercourse with government. But it will be obvious that a perseverance\r\nin the system of official advice and restraints, is essential to give\r\npermanence to the effects already produced, and to secure a firm and\r\nlasting peace between them and the Sioux. To this end the settlement\r\nof the line upon the Red Cedar fork is an object which claims the\r\nattention of the Department; and would justify, in my opinion, the\r\ncalling together the parties interested, at some convenient spot near\r\nthe junction of the Red Cedar River with the Chippewa. Indeed, the\r\nhandsome elevation, and the commanding geographical advantages of this\r\nspot, render it one which, I think, might be advantageously occupied as\r\na military post. Such an occupancy would have the effect to keep the\r\nparties at peace, and the point of land, on which the work is proposed\r\nto be erected, might be purchased from the Sioux, together with such\r\npart of the disputed lands near the mills as might be deemed necessary\r\nto quiet the title of the Chippewas. By acquiring this portion of\r\ncountry for the purposes of military occupancy, the United States\r\nwould be justified in punishing any murders committed upon it; and\r\nI am fully convinced, that no measure which could, at this time, be\r\nadopted, would so certainly conduce to a permanent peace between the\r\ntribes. I therefore beg leave, through you, to submit these subjects\r\nto the consideration of the honorable the Secretary of War, with\r\nevery distrust in my own powers of observation, and with a very full\r\nconfidence in his.\r\n\r\n                          I have the honor to be, sir,\r\n                              Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n                                  H.

Blind to their true interests,\r\nthese tribes continue a warfare as hopeless in its termination as it\r\nis inglorious in its results. Notwithstanding every pains which has\r\nbeen taken by the government to convince them of the erroneous policy\r\nof such a contest, and to inspire in them fidelity to their public\r\ntreaties with each other, restless and ambitious young men, on either\r\nside, continue to lead war-parties into the territories of the other,\r\nand to waylay the unsuspecting. I am satisfied that the authority of\r\nthe chiefs is not always sufficient to restrain the incursions of these\r\nyoung warriors, who are led on by the thirst of fame, and stimulated by\r\nhereditary animosity. Such a course is not surprising among savages.\r\nBut it is the dictate of humanity to restrain this false ardor, and to\r\nmake use of every practicable means to put a stop to scenes at which\r\nthe heart sickens. It is but recently that a Mr. Cadotte, a young\r\nhalf-breed of the Sault Ste. Marie, another young man of mixed blood,\r\ncalled the Little Frenchman, living as an Indian, and two Chippewas,\r\none a female, travelling down the St. Croix in a canoe, were fired upon\r\nfrom an ambush by the Sioux, and killed. And this injury still remains\r\nunredressed.\r\n\r\nThe Chippewas complain of this mode of warfare, which it would be an\r\nidle affectation to designate by any other term than murder. They\r\nsay the Sioux are indeed ready to smoke the pipe of peace with them,\r\nand never fail to do so when it is presented to them; but that a\r\nconfidence, on their part, in these smoking councils, is paid with the\r\nloss of lives.\r\n\r\nI have despatched a message to the Sioux chief, Petite Corbeau, and\r\nanother to Wabisha, reminding them of their treaty engagements with\r\nthe Chippewas, and of the recent violation of them above referred to,\r\nand requesting them to use their influence efficaciously to terminate\r\nfurther inroads. These messages are accompanied by others from Shakoba\r\nand from Kabamappa, Chippewa chiefs on the St. Croix and Snake Rivers.\r\n\r\n                                       I am, sir,\r\n                                           Very respectfully,\r\n                                               Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                   H.

Y., November 14, 1831._\r\n\r\n  Hon. LEWIS CASS, _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSIR:\r\n\r\nIn fulfilment of the duties assigned to me in the late expedition\r\ninto the Indian country, under the direction of H. R. Schoolcraft,\r\nEsq., Indian agent, I would beg leave to transmit to you the following\r\nobservations relative to the existence of copper in the country\r\nbordering on the southern shore of Lake Superior.\r\n\r\nIt is without doubt true that this subject has long been viewed with\r\nan interest far beyond its actual merit. Each mass of native copper\r\nwhich this country has produced, however insulated, or however it\r\nmay have been separated from its original position, appears to have\r\nbeen considered a sure indication of the existence of that metal in\r\nbeds; and hence we occasionally see, upon maps of that section of our\r\ncountry, particular portions marked as containing \xe2\x80\x9ccopper mines,\xe2\x80\x9d where\r\nno copper now exists. But while it is certain that a combination of\r\ncircumstances has served to mislead the public mind with regard to the\r\ngeological situation and existing quantity of that metal, it is no less\r\ncertain that a greater quantity of insulated native copper has been\r\ndiscovered upon the borders of Lake Superior, than in any other equal\r\nportion of North America.\r\n\r\nAmong the masses of native copper which have engaged the attention of\r\ntravellers in this section of country, one, which from its great size\r\nwas early noticed, is situated on the Ontonagon River, a stream which\r\nempties its waters into the southern part of Lake Superior, 331 miles\r\nabove the falls of the Ste. Marie. The Ontonagon River is, with some\r\ndifficulty, navigable by bateaux 36 miles, at which place by the union\r\nof two smaller streams, one from an easterly, and the other from a\r\nwesterly direction, the main stream is formed. The mass of copper is\r\nsituated on the western fork, at a distance of six or eight miles from\r\nthe junction.\r\n\r\nThe face of the country through the upper half of the distance from\r\nLake Superior is uneven, and the irregularity is given it by hills of\r\nmarly clay, which occasionally rise quite abruptly to the height of\r\none or two hundred feet. No rock was observed _in situ_, except in one\r\nplace, where, for a distance, the red sandstone was observed, forming\r\nthe bed of the river.\r\n\r\nThe mass of copper lies partly covered by water, directly at the foot\r\nof a clay hill, from which, together with numerous boulders of the\r\nprimitive rocks, it has undoubtedly been washed by the action of the\r\nwater of the river. Although it is completely insulated, there is much\r\nto interest in its examination. Its largest surface measures three and\r\na half by four feet, and this, which is of malleable copper, is kept\r\nbright by the action of the water, and has the usual appearance of that\r\nmetal when worn. To one surface is attached a small quantity of rock,\r\nsingularly bound together by threads of copper, which pass through\r\nit in all directions. This rock, although many of its distinctive\r\ncharacters are lost, is evidently a dark colored serpentine, with small\r\ninterspersed masses of milky quartz.\r\n\r\nThe mass of copper is so situated as to afford but little that would\r\nenable us to judge of its original geological position. In examining\r\nthe eastern fork of the river, I discovered small water-worn masses of\r\ntrap-rock, in which were specks of imbedded carbonate of copper and\r\ncopper black; and with them were occasionally associated minute specks\r\nof serpentine, in some respects resembling that which is attached to\r\nthe large mass of copper; and facts would lead us to infer that the\r\ntrap formation which appears on Lake Superior east of the Ontonagon\r\nRiver, crosses this section of country at or near the source of that\r\nriver and at length forms one of the spurs of the Porcupine Mountains.\r\n\r\nSeveral smaller masses of insulated native copper have been discovered\r\non the borders of Lake Superior, but that upon Ontonagon River is the\r\nonly one which is now known to remain.\r\n\r\nAt as early a period as before the American revolution, an English\r\nmining company directed their operations to the country bordering\r\non Lake Superior, and Ontonagon River was one point to which their\r\nattention was immediately directed. Traces of a shaft, sunk in the clay\r\nhill, near a mass of copper, are still visible, a memento of ignorance\r\nand folly.\r\n\r\nOperations were also commenced on the southern shore of Lake Superior,\r\nnear the mouth of a small stream, which, from that circumstance, is\r\ncalled Miners\xe2\x80\x99 River. Parts of the names of the miners, carved upon\r\nthe sandstone rock at the mouth of the river are still visible. What\r\ncircumstance led to the selection of this spot does not now appear.\r\nNo mineral traces are at this day perceptible, except occasional\r\ndiscolorations of the sandstone rock by what is apparently a mixture of\r\nthe carbonate of iron and copper; and this is only to be observed where\r\nwater, holding in solution an extremely minute portion of these salts,\r\nhas trickled slowly over those rocks.\r\n\r\nIt does not, in fact, appear that the red sandstone, which constitutes\r\nthe principal rock formation of the southern shore, of Lake Superior,\r\nis in any instance metalliferous in any considerable degree. If this\r\nbe true, it would require but little reflection to convince one of the\r\ninexpediency of conducting mining operations at either of the points\r\nselected for that purpose; and it is beyond a doubt true, that the\r\ncompany did not receive the least inducement to continue their labors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these masses of native copper, an ore of that metal has\r\nlong been known to the lake traders as the green rock, in which the\r\ncharacteristic substances are the green and blue carbonate of copper,\r\naccompanied by copper black. It is situated upon Keweena Point, 280\r\nmiles above the falls of the Ste. Marie. The ore is embraced by what\r\nis apparently a recently formed crag; and although it is of a kind,\r\nand so situated as to make an imposing appearance, there is little\r\ncertainty of its existence in large quantities in this formation. The\r\nore forms a thin covering to the pebbles of which the body of the rock\r\nis composed, and is rarely observed in masses separate from it. The\r\ncrag is composed of angular fragments of trap-rock; and the formation\r\nis occasionally traversed by broad and continuous belts of calc. spar,\r\nhere and there tinged with copper. Although the ore was not observed in\r\nany considerable quantity, except at one point, it apparently exists\r\nin minute specks through a greater part of the crag formation, which\r\nextends several miles, forming the shore of the lake.\r\n\r\nThis examination of the crag threw new interest upon the trap\r\nformation, which had been first observed to take the place of the\r\nsandstone at the bottom of a deep bay, called Montreal Bay, on the\r\neasterly side of Keweena Point. The trap-rock continues for a few\r\nmiles, when the crag before noticed appears to lie directly upon it,\r\nand to form the extremity of the point; the crag, in turn, disappears,\r\nand the trap-rock is continued for a distance of six or eight miles\r\nupon the westerly side of the point, when the sandstone again reappears.\r\n\r\nThe trap-rock is of a compact granular texture, occasionally running\r\ninto the amygdaloid and toadstone varieties, and is rich in imbedded\r\nminerals, such as amethystine quartz, smoky quartz, cornelian,\r\nchalcedony, agate, &c., together with several of the ores of copper.\r\nTraces of copper ore in the trap-rock were first noticed on the\r\neasterly side of Keweena Point, and near the commencement of the trap\r\nformation. This ore, which is an impure copper black, was observed in\r\na vein of variable thickness, but not in any part exceeding 2\xc2\xbd inches;\r\nit is sufficiently compact and hard to receive a firm polish, but it\r\nis rather disposed to break into small irregular masses. A specimen\r\nfurnished, upon analysis, 47.5 per cent. of pure copper.\r\n\r\nOn the western side of Keweena Point, the same ore appears under\r\ndifferent circumstances, being disseminated through the body of\r\nthe trap-rock, in grains varying in size from a pin\xe2\x80\x99s head to a\r\npea. Although many of these grains are wholly copper black, they\r\nare occasionally only depositions of the mineral upon specks of\r\ncornelian, chalcedony, or agate, or are more frequently composed,\r\nin part, of what is apparently an imperfect steatite. The ore is so\r\nconnected with, and so much resembles in colour the rock, of which\r\nit may be said to be a constituent part, that they might easily,\r\nduring a hasty examination, be confounded. A random specimen of the\r\nrock furnished, upon analysis, 3.2 per cent. of pure copper. The rock\r\ncontinues combined with that mineral for nearly the space of three\r\nmiles. Extremely thin veins of copper black were observed to traverse\r\nthis same rock; and in enlargements of these were discovered several\r\nmasses of amorphous native copper. The latter mineral appeared in two\r\nforms\xe2\x80\x94the one consisting of compact and malleable masses, carrying from\r\n4 to 10 ounces each; and the other, of specks and fasciculi of pure\r\ncopper, binding together confused masses of copper green, and partially\r\ndisintegrated trap-rock: the latter was of several pounds\xe2\x80\x99 weight.\r\nEach variety was closely embraced by the rock, although the action of\r\nthe water upon the rock had occasionally exposed to view points of the\r\nmetal. In addition to the accompanying copper green, which was in a\r\ndisintegrated state, small specks of the oxyd of copper were associated\r\nin most of the native specimens.\r\n\r\nCircumstances would not permit an examination of any portion of the\r\ntrap formation, except that bordering directly upon the lake. But facts\r\nwould lead us to infer that that formation extends from one side of\r\nKeweena Point to the other, and that a range of thickly wooded hills,\r\nwhich traverses the point, is based upon, if not formed of, that rock.\r\nAn Indian information which, particularly upon such a subject, must be\r\nadopted with caution, would sanction the opinion that the prominent\r\nconstituents are the same wherever the rock is observed.\r\n\r\nAfter having duly considered the facts which are presented, I would not\r\nhesitate to offer, as an opinion, that the trap-rock formation was the\r\noriginal source of the masses of copper which have been observed in\r\nthe country bordering on Lake Superior; and that at the present day,\r\nexaminations for the ores of copper could not be made in that country\r\nwith hopes of success, except in the trap-rock itself; which rock is\r\nnot certainly known to exist upon any place upon Lake Superior, other\r\nthan Keweena Point.\r\n\r\nIf this opinion be a correct one, the cause of failure of the mining\r\ncompany in this region is rendered plain. Having considered each\r\ninsulated mass of pure metal as a true indication of the existence\r\nof a bed in the vicinity, operations were directed to wrong points;\r\nwhen, having failed to realize their anticipations, the project was\r\nabandoned without further actual investigation. We would be induced to\r\ninfer, that no attempts were made to learn the original source of the\r\nmetal which was discovered, and thus, while the attention was drawn to\r\ninsulated masses, the ores, ordinary in appearance, but more important\r\n_in situ_, were neglected; and perhaps from the close analogy in\r\nappearance to the rock with which they were associated, no distinction\r\nwas observed.\r\n\r\nWhat quantity of ore the trap-rock of Keweena Point may be capable of\r\nproducing, can only be determined by minute and laborious examination.\r\nThe indications which were presented by a hasty investigation are here\r\nimbodied, and, with deference, submitted to your consideration.\r\n\r\n                                        I have the honor to be,\r\n                                            Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                                DOUGLASS HOUGHTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  V.\r\n\r\n   _Speech of Six Chippewa Chiefs[36] on the Sioux War, delivered at\r\n                   Michilimackinac, in July, 1833._\r\n\r\nMY father: listen to your children. Look upon the blood that is shed\r\nby our enemies. I hold in my hand the wampum belt, and the articles of\r\nthe treaty of Prairie du Chien. This belt is stained by blood. It has\r\npassed through all our bands. We have all taken hold of it with our\r\nhands. So have we in our hearts taken hold of the words of the treaty.\r\nYou have told us to sit still, and we have done it. But what have our\r\nenemies done? Six times we have been attacked by them. Twice on Sioux\r\nland and four times on our own. Look on us, father; our mouths are full\r\nof blood. You are the cause of this. It is owing to our listening to\r\nyour advice. You bade us sit still. You told us that your arm was _long\r\nand strong_, and that you would reach it out and pull back any that\r\ncrossed the lines. We believed it. We remained quiet. Even when struck,\r\nwe ceased to revenge ourselves, as we formerly revenged ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe have been again struck. Our people have been killed on their own\r\nlands. Yet we are told to keep quiet. We have been killed while relying\r\nupon your flag, thinking our enemies came to smoke the pipe of peace.\r\nFather, think not that we are fools. We have right hearts. We cannot\r\nsit with our eyes shut. But we will keep them open. They are looking\r\nupon the lines. They are looking upon you. We will wait one summer\r\nmore, in hopes that our voices will reach you.[37]\r\n\r\n                                No. IV.\r\n\r\n     _Remarks on the Lead Mine Country on the Upper Mississippi._\r\n\r\n          [Addressed to the Editors of the New-York Mirror.]\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nTime admonishes me of my promise to furnish you some account of my\r\njourney from Galena to Fort Winnebago. But I confess, that time has\r\ntaken away none of those features which make me regard it as a task.\r\nOther objects have occupied so much of my thoughts, that the subject\r\nhas lost some of its vividness, and I shall be obliged to confine\r\nmyself more exclusively to my notes than I had intended. This will\r\nbe particularly true in speaking of geological facts. Geographical\r\nfeatures impress themselves strongly on the mind. The shape of a\r\nmountain is not easily forgotten, and its relation to contiguous\r\nwaters and woods is recollected after the lapse of many years. The\r\nsuccession of plains, streams, and settlements is likewise retained in\r\nthe memory, while the peculiar plains, the soils overlaying them, and\r\nall the variety of their mineral and organic contents, require to be\r\nperpetuated by specimens and by notes, which impose neither a slight\r\nnor a momentary labor.\r\n\r\nLimited sketches of this kind are furthermore liable to be\r\nmisconceived. Prominent external objects can only be brought to mind,\r\nand these often reveal but an imperfect notion of the pervading\r\ncharacter of strata, and still less knowledge of their mineral\r\ncontents. Haste takes away many opportunities of observation; and\r\nscanty or inconvenient means of transporting hand specimens, often\r\ndeprive us of the requisite data. Indeed, I should be loath to describe\r\nthe few facts I am about to communicate, had you not personally\r\nvisited and examined the great carboniferous and sandstone formation\r\non the Mississippi and Wisconsin, and thus got the knowledge of their\r\nfeatures. The parallelism which is apparent in these rocks, by the\r\npinnacles which have been left standing on high\xe2\x80\x94the wasting effects of\r\ntime in scooping out valleys and filling up declivities\xe2\x80\x94and the dark\r\nand castle-looking character of the cherty limestone bluffs, as viewed\r\nfrom the water, while the shadows of evening are deepening around, are\r\nsuited to make vivid impressions. And these broken and denuded cliffs\r\noffer the most favorable points for making geological observations.\r\nThere are no places inland where the streams have cut so deep. On\r\ngaining the height of land, the strata are found to be covered with so\r\nheavy a deposite of soil, that it is difficult to glean much that can\r\nbe relied on respecting the interior structure.\r\n\r\nThe angle formed by the junction of the Wisconsin with the Mississippi\r\nis a sombre line of weather-beaten rocks. Gliding along the current,\r\nat the base of these rocks, the idea of a \xe2\x80\x9chill country,\xe2\x80\x9d of no very\r\nproductive character, is naturally impressed upon the observer. And\r\nthis impression came down, probably, from the days of Marquette, who\r\nwas the first European, that we read of, who descended the Wisconsin,\r\nand thus became the true discoverer of the Mississippi. The fact that\r\nit yielded lead ore, bits of which were occasionally brought in by the\r\nnatives, was in accordance with this opinion; and aided, it may be\r\nsupposed, in keeping out of view the real character of the country. I\r\nknow not how else to account for the light which has suddenly burst\r\nupon us from this bank of the Mississippi, and which has at once proved\r\nit to be as valuable for the purposes of agriculture as for those of\r\nmining, and as sylvan in its appearance as if it were not fringed, as\r\nit were, with rocks, and lying at a great elevation above the water.\r\nThis elevation is so considerable as to permit a lively descent in the\r\nstreams, forming numerous mill-seats. The surface of the country is\r\nnot, however, broken, but may be compared to the heavy and lazy-rolling\r\nwaves of the sea after a tempest. These wave-like plains are often\r\ndestitute of trees, except a few scattering ones, but present to\r\nthe eye an almost boundless field of native herbage. Groves of oak\r\nsometimes diversify those native meadows, or cover the ridges which\r\nbound them. Very rarely does any rock appear above the surface. The\r\nhighest elevations, the Platte mounds, and the Blue mound, are covered\r\nwith soil and with trees. Numerous brooks of limpid water traverse the\r\nplains, and find their way into either the Wisconsin, Rock River, or\r\nthe Mississippi. The common deer is still in possession of its favorite\r\nhaunts; and the traveller is very often startled by flocks of the\r\nprairie-hen rising up in his path. The surface soil is a rich, black\r\nalluvion; it yields abundant crops of corn, and, so far as they have\r\nbeen tried, all the cereal gramina. I have never, either in the west or\r\nout of the west, seen a richer soil, or more stately fields of corn and\r\noats, than upon one of the plateaux of the Blue mound.\r\n\r\nSuch is the country which appears to be richer in ores of lead than\r\nany other mineral district in the world\xe2\x80\x94which yielded forty millions\r\nof pounds in seven years\xe2\x80\x94produced a single lump of ore of two thousand\r\ncubic feet\xe2\x80\x94and appears adequate to supply almost any amount of this\r\narticle that the demands of commerce require.\r\n\r\nThe river of Galena rises in the mineral plains of Iowa county, in\r\nthat part of the North-Western Territory which is attached, for the\r\npurposes of temporary government, to Michigan. It is made up of clear\r\nand permanent springs, and has a descent which affords a very valuable\r\nwater-power. This has been particularly remarked at the curve called\r\nMillseat-bend. No change in its general course, which is south-west, is\r\nI believe apparent after it enters the north-west angle of the state\r\nof Illinois. The town of Galena, the capital of the mining country,\r\noccupies a somewhat precipitous semicircular bend, on the right (or\r\nnorth) bank of the river, six or seven miles from its entrance into the\r\nMississippi. Backwater, from the latter, gives the stream itself the\r\nappearance, as it bears the name, of a \xe2\x80\x9criver,\xe2\x80\x9d and admits steamboat\r\nnavigation thus far. It is a rapid brook immediately above the town,\r\nand of no further value for the purpose of navigation. Lead is brought\r\nin from the smelting furnaces, on heavy ox-teams, capable of carrying\r\nseveral tons at a load. I do not know that water _has been_, or that it\r\n_cannot_ be made subservient in the transportation of this article from\r\nthe mines. The streams themselves are numerous and permanent, although\r\nthey are small, and it would require the aid of so many of these, on\r\nany projected route, that it is to be feared the supply of water would\r\nbe inadequate. To remedy this deficiency, the Wisconsin itself might be\r\nrelied on. Could the waters of this river be conducted in a canal along\r\nits valley from the portage to the bend at Arena, they might, from\r\nthis point, be deflected in a direct line to Galena? This route would\r\ncut the mine district centrally, and afford the upper tributaries of\r\nthe Pekatolika and Fever River as feeders. Such a communication would\r\nopen the way to a northern market, and merchandise might be supplied by\r\nthe way of Green Bay, when the low state of water in the Mississippi\r\nprevents the ascent of boats. It would, at all times, obviate the\r\ntedious voyage, which goods ordered from the Atlantic cities have to\r\nperform through the straits of Florida and Gulf of Mexico. A railroad\r\ncould be laid upon this route with equal, perhaps superior advantages.\r\nThese things may seem too much like making arrangements for the next\r\ngeneration. But we cannot fix bounds to the efforts of our spreading\r\npopulation, and spirit of enterprise. Nor, after what we have seen in\r\nthe way of internal improvement, in our own day and generation, should\r\nwe deem any thing too hard to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nI set out from Galena in a light wagon, drawn by two horses, about\r\nten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning (August 17th), accompanied by Mr. B. It had\r\nrained the night and morning of the day previous, which rendered the\r\nstreets and roads quite muddy. A marly soil, easily penetrated by rain,\r\nwas, however, as susceptible to the influence of the sun, and in a much\r\nshorter period than would be imagined, the surface became dry. Although\r\na heavy and continued shower had thoroughly drenched the ground, and\r\ncovered it with superfluous water, but very little effects of it were\r\nto be seen at this time. We ascended into the open plain country, which\r\nappears in every direction around the town, and directed our course\r\nto Gratiot\xe2\x80\x99s Grove. In this distance, which on our programme of the\r\nroute, was put down at fifteen miles, a lively idea of the formation\r\nand character of the country is given. The eye is feasted with the\r\nboundlessness of its range. Grass and flowers spread before and beside\r\nthe traveller, and on looking back, they fill up the vista behind him.\r\nHe soon finds himself in the midst of a sylvan scene. Groves fringe\r\nthe tops of the most distant elevations, and clusters of trees\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nrarely, open forests\xe2\x80\x94are occasionally presented. The trees appear to be\r\nalmost exclusively of the species of white oak and roughbark hickory.\r\nAmong the flowers, the plant called rosin-weed attracts attention by\r\nits gigantic stature, and it is accompanied, as certainly as substance\r\nby shadow, by the wild indigo, two plants which were afterward detected\r\nof less luxuriant growth on Fox River. The roads are in their natural\r\ncondition, they are excellent, except for a few yards where streams are\r\ncrossed. At such places there is a plunge into soft, black muck, and it\r\nrequires all the powers of a horse harnessed to a wagon to emerge from\r\nthe stream.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Gratiot\xe2\x80\x99s Grove, I handed letters of introduction to Mr.\r\nH. and B. Gratiot. These gentlemen appear to be extensively engaged in\r\nsmelting. They conducted me to see the ore prepared for smelting in\r\nthe log furnace; and also the preparation of such parts of it for the\r\nash furnace as do not undergo complete fusion in the first process.\r\nThe ash furnace is a very simple kind of air furnace, with a grate so\r\narranged as to throw a reverberating flame upon the hearth where the\r\nprepared ore is laid. It is built against a declivity, and charged by\r\nthrowing the materials to be operated upon, down the flue. A silicious\r\nflux is used; and the scoria is tapped and suffered to flow out, from\r\nthe side of the furnace, before drawing off the melted lead. The latter\r\nis received in an excavation made in the earth, from which it is ladled\r\nout into iron moulds. The whole process is conducted in the open air,\r\nwith sometimes a slight shed. The lead ore is piled in cribs of logs,\r\nwhich are roofed. Hammers, ladles, a kind of tongs, and some other\r\niron tools are required. The simplicity of the process, the absence of\r\nexternal show in buildings, and the direct and ready application of the\r\nmeans to the end, are remarkable, as pleasing characteristics about the\r\nsmelting establishment.\r\n\r\nThe ore used is the common sulphuret, with a foliated, glittering and\r\ncubical fracture. It occurs with scarcely any adhering gangue. Cubical\r\nmasses of it are found, at some of the diggings, which are studded over\r\nwith minute crystals of calcareous spar. These crystals, when examined,\r\nhave the form of the dog-tooth spar. This broad, square-shaped, and\r\nsquare-broken mineral, is taken from _east and west leads_, is most\r\neasy to smelt, and yields the greatest per centum of lead. It is\r\nestimated to produce fifty per cent. from the log furnace, and about\r\nsixteen more when treated with a flux in the ash furnace.\r\n\r\nMiners classify their ore from its position in the mine. Ore from _east\r\nand west leads_, is raised from clay diggings, although these diggings\r\nmay be pursued under the first stratum of rock. Ore from _north and\r\nsouth leads_, is termed \xe2\x80\x9csheet minerals,\xe2\x80\x9d and is usually taken from\r\nrock diggings. The vein or sheet stands perpendicularly in the fissure,\r\nand is usually struck in sinking from six to ten feet. The sheet varies\r\nin thickness from six or eight inches, in the broadest part, to not\r\nmore than one. The great mass found at \xe2\x80\x9cIrish diggings,\xe2\x80\x9d was of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nI observed among the piles of ore at Gratiot\xe2\x80\x99s, the combination of\r\nzinc with lead ore, which is denominated _dry bone_. It is cast by as\r\nunproductive. Mr. B. Gratiot also showed me pieces of the common ore\r\nwhich had undergone desulphuration in the log furnace. Its natural\r\nsplendor is increased by this process, so as to have the appearance of\r\nhighly burnished steel. He also presented me some uniform masses of\r\nlead, recrystallized from a metallic state, under the hearth of the\r\nash furnace. The tendency to rectangular structure in these delicate\r\nand fragile masses is very remarkable. Crystallization appears to\r\nhave taken place under circumstances which opposed the production\r\nof a complete and perfect cube or parallelogram, although there are\r\ninnumerable rectangles of each geometric form.\r\n\r\nIn the drive from Gratiot\xe2\x80\x99s to Willow Springs, we saw a succession\r\nof the same objects that had formed the prominent features of the\r\nlandscape from Galena. The platte mounds, which had appeared on our\r\nleft all the morning, continued visible until we entered the grove that\r\nembraces the site of the springs. Little mounds of red earth frequently\r\nappeared above the grass, to testify to the labors of miners along this\r\npart of the route. In taking a hasty survey of some of the numerous\r\nexcavations of Irish diggings, I observed among the rubbish small\r\nflat masses of a yellowish white amorphous mineral substance of great\r\nweight. I have not had time to submit it to any tests. It appears too\r\nheavy and compact for the earthy yellow oxide of lead. I should not be\r\ndisappointed to find it an oxide of zinc. No rock stratum protrudes\r\nfrom the ground in this part of the country. The consolidated masses\r\nthrown up from the diggings, appear to be silicated limestone, often\r\nfriable, and not crystalline. Galena is found in open fissures in this\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nWe reached the springs in the dusk of the evening, and found good\r\naccommodations at Ray\xe2\x80\x99s. Distance from Galena thirty miles.\r\n\r\nThe rain fell copiously during the night, and on the morning\r\n(eighteenth) gave no signs of a speedy cessation. Those who travel\r\nought often, however, to call to mind the remark of Xenophon, that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpleasure is the result of toil,\xe2\x80\x9d and not permit slight impediments\r\nto arrest them, particularly when they have definite points to make.\r\nWe set forward in a moderate rain, but in less than an hour had the\r\npleasure to perceive signs of it mitigating, and before nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nit was quite clear. We stopped a short time at Bracken\xe2\x80\x99s furnace. Mr.\r\nBracken gave me specimens of organic remains, in the condition of\r\nearthy calcareous carbonates, procured on a neighbouring ridge. He\r\ndescribed the locality as being plentiful in casts and impressions\r\nsuch as he exhibited, which appeared to have been removed from the\r\nsurface of a shelly limestone. At Rock-branch diggings, I found masses\r\nof calcareous spar thrown from the pits. The surface appears to have\r\nbeen much explored for lead in this vicinity. I stopped to examine\r\nVanmater\xe2\x80\x99s lead. It had been a productive one, and affords a fair\r\nexample of what are called east and west leads. I observed a compass\r\nstanding on the line of the lead, and asked Mr. V. whether much\r\nreliance was to be placed upon the certainty of striking the lead by\r\nthe aid of this instrument. He said that it was much relied on. That\r\nthe course of the leads was definite. The present one varied from a due\r\neast and west line but nine minutes, and the lead had been followed\r\nwithout much difficulty. The position of the ore was about forty feet\r\nbelow the surface. Of this depth about thirty-six feet consisted of the\r\nsurface rock and its earthy covering. A vein of marly clay, enveloping\r\nthe ore, was then penetrated. A series of pits had been sunk on the\r\ncourse of it, and the earth and ore in the interstices removed, and\r\ndrawn to the surface by a windlass and bucket. Besides the ore, masses\r\nof iron pyrites had been thrown out, connected with galena. In stooping\r\nto detach some pieces from one of these masses, I placed my feet on the\r\nverge of an abandoned pit, around which weeds and bushes had grown.\r\nMy face was, however, averted from the danger, but on beholding it, I\r\nwas made sensible that the least deviation from a proper balance would\r\nhave pitched me into it. It was forty feet deep. The danger I had just\r\nescaped fell to the lot of Mr. B.\xe2\x80\x99s dog, who, probably, deceived by the\r\ngrowth of bushes, fell in. Whether killed or not, it was impossible to\r\ntell, and we were obliged to leave the poor animal under a promise of\r\nMr. V., that he would cause a windlass to be removed to the pit, to\r\nascertain his fate.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock we reached Mineral Point, the seat of justice of Iowa\r\ncounty. I delivered an introductory letter to Mr. Ansley, who had made\r\na discovery of copper ore in the vicinity, and through his politeness,\r\nvisited the locality. The discovery was made in sinking pits in search\r\nof lead ore. Small pieces of green carbonate of copper were found on\r\nstriking the rock, which is apparently silico-calcareous, and of a very\r\nfriable structure. From one of the excavations, detached masses of\r\nthe sulphuret, blue and green mingled, were raised. These masses are\r\nenveloped with ochery clay.\r\n\r\nIn riding out on horseback to see this locality, I passed over\r\nthe ridge of land which first received the appellation of \xe2\x80\x9cMineral\r\nPoint.\xe2\x80\x9d No digging was observed in process, but the heaps of red marly\r\nclay, the vigorous growth of shrubbery around them, and the number\r\nof open or partially filled pits, remain to attest the labour which\r\nwas formerly devoted in the search for lead. And this search is said\r\nto have been amply rewarded. The track of discovery is conspicuously\r\nmarked by these excavations, which often extend, in a direct line,\r\non the cardinal points, as far as the eye can reach. Everywhere the\r\nmarly clay formation appears to have been relied on for the ore,\r\nand much of it certainly appears to be _in situ_ in it. It bears no\r\ntraces of attrition; and its occurrence in regular leads, forbids the\r\nsupposition of its being an oceanic arrangement of mineral detritus.\r\nAt Vanmater\xe2\x80\x99s, the metalliferous clay marl is overlaid by a grayish\r\nsedimentary limestone. Different is the geological situation of what is\r\ndenominated _gravel ore_, of which I noticed piles, on the route from\r\nGratiot\xe2\x80\x99s. This bears evident marks of attrition, and appears to have\r\nbeen uniformly taken from diluvial earth.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the village from this excursion, I found Mr. B. ready\r\nto proceed, and we lost no time in making the next point in our\r\nproposed route. A drive of five miles brought us to the residence of\r\nColonel Dodge, whose zeal and enterprise in opening this portion of our\r\nwestern country for settlement, give him claims to be looked up to as a\r\npublic benefactor. I here met the superintendent of the mines (Captain\r\nLegate), and after spending some time in conversation on the resources\r\nand prospects of the country, and partaking of the hospitalities\r\npolitely offered by Colonel D. and his intelligent family, we pursued\r\nour way. The village of Dodgeville lies at the distance of four miles.\r\nSoon after passing through it some part of our tackle gave way, in\r\ncrossing a gully, and I improved the opportunity of the delay to visit\r\nthe adjacent diggings, which are extensive. The ore is found as at\r\nother mines, in regular leads, and not scattered about promiscuously\r\nin the red marl. Masses of brown oxide of iron were more common here\r\nthan I had noticed them elsewhere. Among the rubbish of the diggings,\r\nfragments of hornstone occur. They appear to be, most commonly,\r\nportions of nodules, which exhibit, on being fractured, various\r\ndiscolorings.\r\n\r\nNight overtook us before we entered Porter\xe2\x80\x99s Grove, which is also\r\nthe seat of mining and smelting operations. We are indebted to the\r\nhospitality of Mr. M., of whom my companion was an acquaintance, for\r\nopening his door to us, at an advanced hour of the evening. Distance\r\nfrom Willow Springs, twenty-five miles.\r\n\r\nThere is no repose for a traveller. We retired to rest at a late\r\nhour, and rose at an early one. The morning (19th) was hazy, and we\r\nset forward while the dew was heavy on the grass. Our route still\r\nlay through a prairie country. The growth of native grass, bent down\r\nwith dew, nearly covered the road, so that our horses\xe2\x80\x99 legs were\r\ncontinually bathed. The rising sun was a very cheerful sight, but\r\nas our road lay up a long ascent, we soon felt its wilting effects.\r\nNine miles of such driving, with not a single grove to shelter us,\r\nbrought us to Mr. Brigham\xe2\x80\x99s, at the foot of the Blue Mound, being\r\nthe last house in the direction to Fort Winnebago. The distance from\r\nGalena is sixty-four miles, and this area embraces the present field\r\nof mining operations. In rapidly passing over it, mines, furnaces,\r\ndwellinghouses, mining villages, enclosed fields, upland prairies (an\r\nalmost continued prairie), groves, springs, and brooks, have formed\r\nthe prominent features of the landscape. The impulse to the settlement\r\nof the country was first given by its mineral wealth; and it brought\r\nhere, as it were by magic, an enterprising and active population. It\r\nis evident that a far greater amount of labor was a few years ago\r\nengaged in mining operations; but the intrinsic value of the lands has\r\noperated to detain the present population, which may be considered\r\nas permanent. The lands are beautifully disposed, well watered, well\r\ndrained by natural streams, and easily brought into cultivation. Crops\r\nhave everywhere repaid the labors of the farmer; and, thus far, the\r\nagricultural produce of the country has borne a fair price. The country\r\nappears to afford every facility for raising cattle, horses, and hogs.\r\nMining, the cardinal interest heretofore, has not ceased in the degree\r\nthat might be inferred from the depression of the lead market; and\r\nit will be pursued, with increased activity, whenever the purposes\r\nof commerce call for it. In the present situation of the country,\r\nthere appear to be two objects essential to the lasting welfare of\r\nthe settlements:\xe2\x80\x94first, a title to their lands from Congress; second,\r\na northern market for the products of their mines and farms. To\r\nthese, a _third_ requisite may be considered auxiliary, namely, the\r\nestablishment of the seat of territorial government at some point west\r\nof Lake Michigan, where its powers may be more readily exercised, and\r\nthe reciprocal obligations of governor and people more vividly felt.\r\n\r\nMr. Brigham, in whom I was happy to recognise an esteemed friend,\r\nconducted us over his valuable plantation. He gave me a mass of a\r\nwhite, heavy metallic substance, taken as an accompanying mineral, from\r\na lead of Galena, which he has recently discovered in a cave. Without\r\ninstituting any examination of it but such as its external characters\r\ndisclose, it may be deemed a native carbonate of lead. The mass from\r\nwhich it was broken weighed ninety or one hundred pounds. And its\r\noccurrence, at the lead, was not alone.\r\n\r\nFrom the Blue Mound to Fort Winnebago is an estimated distance of\r\nfifty-six miles. The country is, however, entirely in a state of\r\nnature. The trace is rather obscure; but, with a knowledge of the\r\ngeneral geography and face of the country, there is no difficulty in\r\nproceeding with a light wagon, or even a loaded team, as the Indian\r\npractice of firing the prairies every fall has relieved the surface\r\nfrom underbrush and fallen timber. After driving a few miles, we\r\nencountered two Winnebagoes on horseback, the forward rider having\r\na white man in tie behind him. The latter informed us that his name\r\nwas H., that he had come out to Twelve-mile Creek, for the purpose of\r\nlocating himself there, and was in pursuit of a hired man, who had gone\r\noff, with some articles of his property, the night previous. With this\r\nrelation, and a _boshu_[38] for the natives, with whom we had no means\r\nof conversing, we continued our way, without further incident, to Duck\r\nCreek, a distance of ten miles. We here struck the path, which is one\r\nof the boundary lines, in the recent purchase from the Winnebagoes. It\r\nis a deeply marked horse path, cutting quite through the prairie sod,\r\nand so much used by the natives as to prevent grass from growing on it;\r\nin this respect, it is as well-defined a landmark as \xe2\x80\x9cblazed tree,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9csaddle.\xe2\x80\x9d The surveyor appointed to run out the lines, had placed\r\nmile-posts on the route, but the Winnebagoes, with a prejudice against\r\nthe practice which is natural, pulled up many, and defaced others.\r\nWhen we had gone ten miles further, we began to see the glittering of\r\nwater through the trees, and we soon found ourselves on the margin of\r\na clear lake. I heard no name for this handsome sheet of water. It is\r\none of the four lakes, which are connected with each other by a stream,\r\nand have their outlet into Rock River, through a tributary called the\r\nGuskihaw. We drove through the margin of it, where the shores were\r\nsandy, and innumerable small unio shells were driven up. Most of these\r\nsmall species appeared to be helices. Standing tent-poles, and other\r\nremains of Indian encampments, appeared at this place. A rock stratum,\r\ndark and weather-beaten, apparently sandstone, jutted out into the\r\nlake. A little farther, we passed to the left of an abandoned village.\r\nBy casting our eyes across the lake, we observed the new position which\r\nhad been selected and occupied by the Winnebagoes. We often assign\r\nwrong motives, when we undertake to reason for the Indian race; but, in\r\nthe present instance, we may presume, that their removal was influenced\r\nby too near a position to the boundary path.\r\n\r\nWe drove to the second brook, beyond the lake, and encamped.\r\n\r\nComfort in an encampment depends very much upon getting a good fire.\r\nIn this we totally failed last night, owing to our having but a small\r\npiece of spunk, which ignited and burned out without inflaming our\r\nkindling materials. The atmosphere was damp, but not sufficiently\r\ncooled to quiet the ever-busy musquito. Mr. B. deemed it a hardship\r\nthat he could not boil the kettle, so as to have the addition of tea to\r\nour cold repast. I reminded him that there was a bright moon, and that\r\nit did not rain; and that, for myself, I had fared so decidedly worse,\r\non former occasions, that I was quite contented with the light of the\r\nmoon and a dry blanket. By raising up and putting a fork under the\r\nwagon tongue, and spreading our tent-cloth over it, I found the means\r\nof insulating ourselves from the insect hordes, but it was not until I\r\nhad pitched my musquito net within it that we found repose.\r\n\r\nOn awaking in the morning (20th), we found H., who had passed us the\r\nday before in company with the Winnebagoes, lying under the wagon. He\r\nhad returned from pursuing the fugitive, and had overtaken us, after\r\ntwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night. He complained of being cold. We admitted him\r\ninto the wagon, and drove on to reach his camp at Twelve-mile Creek.\r\nIn crossing what he denominated Seven-mile Prairie, I observed on our\r\nright a prominent wall of rock, surmounted with image-stones. The rock\r\nitself consisted of sandstone. Elongated water-worn masses of stone\r\nhad been set up, so as to resemble, at a distance, the figures of men.\r\nThe allusion had been strengthened by some rude paints. This had been\r\nthe serious or the sportive work of Indians. It is not to be inferred\r\nhence, that the Winnebagoes are idolaters. But there is a strong\r\ntendency to idolatry in the minds of the North American Indians. They\r\ndo not bow before a carved image, shaped like Dagon or Juggernaut; but\r\nthey rely upon their guardian spirits, or personal manitos, for aid in\r\nexigencies, and impute to the skins of animals, which are preserved\r\nwith religious care, the power of gods. Their medicine institution is\r\nalso a gross and bold system of semi-deification connected with magic,\r\nwitchcraft, and necromancy. Their jossakeeds are impostors and jugglers\r\nof the grossest stamp. Their wabenos address Satan directly for power;\r\nand their metais, who appear to be least idolatrous, rely more upon the\r\ninvisible agency of spirits and magic influence, than upon the physical\r\nproperties of the medicines they exhibit.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Twelve-mile Creek, we found a yoke of steers of H., in\r\na pen, which had been tied there two days and nights without water.\r\nHe evinced, however, an obliging disposition, and, after refreshing\r\nourselves and our horses, we left him to complete the labours of a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clocal habitation.\xe2\x80\x9d The intermediate route to Fort Winnebago afforded\r\nfew objects of either physical or mental interest. The upland soil,\r\nwhich had become decidedly thinner and more arenaceous, after reaching\r\nthe lake, appears to increase in sterility on approaching the\r\nWisconsin. And the occurrence of _lost rocks_ (primitive boulders),\r\nas Mr. B. happily termed them, which are first observed after passing\r\nthe Blue Mound, becomes more frequent in this portion of the country,\r\ndenoting our approach to the borders of the north-western primitive\r\nformation. This formation, we have now reason to conclude, extends in\r\nan angle, so far south as to embrace a part of Fox River, above Apukwa\r\nLake.\r\n\r\nAnticipated difficulties always appear magnified. This we verified in\r\ncrossing Duck Creek, near its entrance into the Wisconsin. We found\r\nthe adjoining bog nearly dry, and drove through the stream without the\r\nwater entering into the body of the wagon. It here commenced raining.\r\nHaving but four miles to make, and that a level prairie, we pushed on.\r\nBut the rain increased, and poured down steadily and incessantly till\r\nnear sunset. In the midst of this rain-storm we reached the fort, about\r\none o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and crossed over to the elevated ground occupied by the\r\nIndian Department, where my sojourn, while awaiting the expedition, was\r\nrendered as comfortable as the cordial greeting and kind attention of\r\nMr. Kinzie, the agent, and his intelligent family could make it.\r\n\r\nA recapitulation of the distances from Galena makes the route as\r\nfollows, viz. Gratiot\xe2\x80\x99s Grove, fifteen miles; Willow Springs, fifteen;\r\nMineral Point, seven; Dodgeville, nine; Porter\xe2\x80\x99s Grove, nine;\r\nBlue Mound, nine; Duck Creek, ten; Lake, ten; Twelve-mile Creek,\r\ntwenty-four; Crossing of Duck Creek, eight; and Fort Winnebago, four;\r\ntotal, one hundred and twenty miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ERRATA.\r\n\r\n  Page 12, line 5.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org \r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary \r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\r\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\r\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s web site and\r\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n\r\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n    Chief Executive and Director\r\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
